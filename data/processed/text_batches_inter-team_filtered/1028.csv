SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html," desired material:
Solar exposure. The material covering the solar cell, must allow sunlight to pass through to reach the bacteria.
UV resistance. As the material will be exposed to the sun, it must be resistant to the UV radiation.
Bacterial growth The material must neither be growth inhibitory, nor toxic to the bacteria.
Easy to mold. The outside of the device could be molded depending on the circumstances, as the device only relies on the bacterial technology.
Durability. The device will be located outside, meaning that the material must be able to withstand hard conditions and heavy weight.
Temperature. The material must allow for an appropriate constant temperature for the bacteria, despite the variations in sun exposure.
Longevity. We would like for the material to have as long a durability as possible, since replacing the device could prove cumbersome. We are aiming for at least twenty years of durability.
Price. We are looking for a material that is as cheap as possible, without sacrificing the necessary criteria.
Environmentally friendly. Considering the goal of this project being the creation of an environmentally friendly energy source, the ideal material would be as green as possible.
Interview with Flemming Christiansen
For the purpose of finding the necessary materials for our prototype, we contacted one of the leading plastic experts in Denmark, Flemming Christiansen , who acts as the market development manager of SP Moulding. He has been acting as a plastics consultant since his graduation as a master of science in Engineering, with a speciality in plastics. A meeting was quickly arranged for the purpose of confirming our criteria, the technical design, the material, and the possible price of creating the PowerLeaf.
In accordance with our established criteria, Mr. Christiansen suggested that we use the plastic known as Polycarbonate, specifically Lexon 103R-III Polycarbonate . Unfortunately, the material cannot fulfil the criteria on its own. He therefore suggested that we take a few liberties with it. In order to prevent UV degradation to the exposed parts, we will be adding certain additives to the surface. This increases the UV resistance of the device, without hindering the sunlight from reaching the bacteria.
During our conversations with Mr. Christiansen, we reached the topic of what to do in case of a breach. Should the container against all expectations be damaged, the environment will be exposed to the GMO inside. The solution we came up with was the possible implementation of a kill-switch in the inner compartment, making it vulnerable to sunlight. Should the bacteria of said unit be exposed to sunlight, they would perish. As the outer compartment would be dependent on the continued coexistence of the two units, the entire"

The Future
Most of the annual production of methanol (70 million tons) is consumed by the chemical industry [1] . Being predominantly obtained from natural gas, it is commonly used as a platform chemical with several applications.
New innovative technologies impressively increased the efficiency of converting CO2 into methanol [2] . Concerning its price, availability and sustainability, it becomes an interesting alternative to conventional carbon sources in bioprocesses.
Therefore, methanol is  a chemical with a huge potential not only for the chemical industry, but also for the bioeconomy.
We will approach to unleash this potential by establishing a methanol uptake pathway in E. coli to form higher metabolites.
Key Achievements
Building and testing a synthetic methanol assimilation pathway in E. coli
Demonstrating that our modified E. coli strain can tolerate high methanol concentrations
Characterizing the functional expression of Bacillus methanolicus methanol dehydrogenase 2 in E. coli
Developing an efficient cloning strategy to build a monocistronic diversity library applying the RDP standard

Design
Few methanol assimilation pathways are known to exist in nature. From literature references, we identified the ribulose monophosphate pathway (RuMP) to be the most efficient naturally occuring one [3] [4] . Recently, a modification of the RuMP was developed that theoretically improves the assimilation efficiency [5] . The results of our modeling confirmed the so called ""major MCC"" (Methanol Condensation Cycle) to be the most promising pathway.

OVERVIEW
As our project primarily involves the use of anti-microbial peptides, we designed and directed our human practices towards creating awareness about this niche topic, apart from synthetic biology and genetic engineering. Talking about synthetic biology and AMPs to over 500 people during Biofair and over 300 members of science from across the country during a national conference helped    us accomplish a part of what we had wished to do. In addition to this, we    conducted a hands- on workshop for school students from our city and it was well    received; the students thoroughly enjoyed it. To know more about each of these,    read below.

SCIENCE  WORKSHOP
As an integral part of Human Practices, we conducted a workshop on the 26th of July,2017. We invited about 80 students from four different schools to participate in this workshop. This day-long workshop started with a small introduction on concepts of Synthetic Biology and Genetic Engineering. Following that, our team members put up a presentation describing our project, why we chose to work on the track 'Food' and how we plan on applying it practically.
In an attempt to make it interactive, we further organized a 'HANDS-ON' training workshop for the students. This included simple experiments like DNA extraction, Blood Typing, Agarose gel electrophoresis and Food Adultration tests.
DNA EXTRACTION
The first step in any rDNA technology experiment is DNA extraction. To demonstrate the importance of this step, we extracted DNA from fruits such as strawberries and papaya using shampoo.
AGAROSE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS
AGE is an important step in Cloning experiments where DNA fragments are separated based on size after restriction. Students were given training in pipette handling and also the hands on experience of loading the sample into wells.
BLOOD TYPING
The aim of conducting this experiment is to demonstrate the agglutination reaction that takes place (principle behind blood typing )through Ag-Ab interaction (Haemolysis).  Native Latarcin possesses haemolytic activity. Our peptide of interest, a mutant of this native form has very low haemolytic activity.

Description
The Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis) is one of the species of destructive tree beetles in North America.  The beetle was initially identified in June 2002 in the southeast portion of the state of Michigan.  As of October 2018, it is now found in 35 states, including Nebraska, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Manitoba (Emerald n.d.).  A recent infestation has been confirmed in Lincoln as of August 2018.  (Lincoln Journal Star, 2018). The following map shows the how widespread the EAB infestation is throughout North America.
Emerald Ash Borer Dispersion Map:
The Problem:
The emerald ash borer beetle is considered the most destructive forest pest ever seen in North America (McCullough & Usbourne, 2017).  Emerald ash borers are highly invasive species native to Asia. They pose a threat to 16 species of native ash trees.  Adult beetles are typically bright metallic green and about 8.5 millimeters (0.33 in) long.
The Emerald Ash Borer:
The emerald borer completes one generation every one or two years. Females lay eggs in outer layers of bark and in and crevices of ash trees (Fraxinae) from mid-June and late August.  The eggs hatch in about two weeks and the larvae feed on the bark in an S-shaped pattern through the inner phloem and outer xylem.  The larvae pupate and turn into adults typically during April and May. The adults appear in the late spring months and into early August and emerge from the tree in D-shaped exit holes.  They later re-infest the old tree or find a new tree if the old tress is on the verge of dying (USDA, 2018). Visible signs of infestation only appear after their firm establishment.
Life Cycle of the Emerald Ash Borer:
Traps are triangular prisms that utilize vibrant green or purple colors, green leaf volatiles from ash trees, and other attractive compounds to lure the emerald ash borer.  Many of these attractive compounds are present in a natural tree oil called Manuka oil,  and for"

Waterloo,2009,Team:Waterloo#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," kick off a summer of research, the particpants of iGEM from across Ontario gathered at the University of Waterloo on May 29th. Members from each of the Ontario teams were present ( University of Toronto , Queen's , and University of Ottawa ) as well as synthetic biology/iGEM enthusiasts from University of Guelph and University of Toronto Mississauga. This was the first time that Ontario iGEM teams had met in the context of a regional synthetic biology conference .
The day kicked off with the keynote address which was given by Andrew Hessel on ""Why Synthetic Biology Is So Disruptive""  To view a movie of his presentation check out this link: Video: Hessel . The talk, open to the public, was insightful for iGEM participants as well as Waterloo students and professors wishing to learn more about what synthetic biology is and where it is headed for the future.
The day then turned over to discussions which centered around creating an Ontario community of iGEM teams as well as goals for creating more communication and support between teams. Mads Kaern, advisor to the University of Ottawa team made a presentation on ""How to Run a Successful iGEM Team"" which was insightful for veteran and rookie teams.
In addition, the gathering was also an opportunity for teams to get to know one another before heading down to MIT.  The meeting was a great success and the first of more regional gatherings to come.
Since then oGEM (group of Ontario iGEM teams) has met on a bi-weekly basis via teleconference to discuss issues and ideas for our regional community.  In the future we hope to see this organization (independent of an individual iGEM team) become an important resource to Ontario iGEM teams and for educating the general public about synthetic biology.
What We Accomplished
Upon reflection we feel that we have achieved the following goals through our outreach efforts:
Introduced synthetic biology to individuals who knew nothing about it
Educated multiple audiences on the fundamentals of science such that they will be able to better understand future scientific information and developments
Excited young minds about science
Strengthened our regional synthetic biology community
Communicated the work of other iGEM teams and the benefit and goals of the iGEM competition
Increased communication between local synthetic biologists
Gained insight and experience into what the public believes about modern science
Developed activities and displays to be used and improved upon in the future
Conclusions & Future Plans
We plan to continue our outreach efforts in the future. We plan to expand our efforts and continue to educate the public about synthetic biology"

Oxford,2017,Team:Oxford#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," protein circuits can be freeze-dried and then resolubilised when the diagnostic is needed - the latter step occurs upon the addition of blood. The OMVs then need to be lysed to expose the protein system within. We propose to accomplish the lysis by adding powdered detergent to the freeze-dried OMV  system, which is solubilized and therefore activated when blood is added to the kit. In order to test OMV lysis without denaturing protein we designed the two parts shown below:
Biobrick: BBa_K2450401
Biobrick: BBa_K2450501
The OmpA protein is able to be inserted into the outer membrane as the SpyTag motif is very small. The quenched sfGFP can then bind to SpyTag and be taken up into OMVs as explained above. This results in the protein complex shown below:
As seen in the diagram above, the sfGFP in an intact OMV is quenched by the quenching peptide. When the OMV is lysed, the TEV protease can access its cleavage site and relieve the quenching of fluorescence. This assay can be used to identify the best detergent to lyse the OMVs while keeping proteins stable. This is vital to both this project, and future projects looking to use OMVs as a chassis for freeze-drying and reactivating protein-based systems. If the BBa_K2450501 sfGFP-dark quencher part can be standardised against a known concentration of purified TEV protein, it can be used to quantify the concentration of TEV added to the lysed OMVs. To see how this could be useful look at the future protein-based experiments page .
Output
Our system detects the T. cruzi parasite in the blood. Thus, we decided that an anticoagulant (which prevents blood clotting) would be the most appropriate output. When our system is activated, the blood of the Chagas-infected patient will be prevented from clotting. To see how this would work in practice, go to our applied design page .
As our system is designed to be cell-free, simplicity is key. We attempted to find the simplest way in which we could inhibit the clotting of blood and discovered a short peptide anticoagulant called hirudin, which inhibits thrombin, the enzyme directly responsible for causing clotting in blood. Both of our systems either produce or interact with proteins making this an ideal solution. On further research, we came across an engineered analogue of hirudin called bivalirud"

Data Processing
1. After E. coli carrying the right construct was grown to mid-log phase, GFP intensity and OD595 were measured every 30 minutes (up to 120min);
2. GFP intensity are subtracted with the background fluorescence which is the fluorescence of pSB3K3- BBa_E0240 . Curve reflecting GFP expression change was plotted (from 4 measurements from time=0 to time=120); OD595 was converted to OD600, and average values were taken;
3. GFP synthesis rate was then obtained by calculating the slope of the above mentioned curve;
4. Absolute promoter activity of PcelA, PcomFA, and BBa_I20260 were calculated by dividing the GFP synthesis rate with the average OD600 value;
5. Averaged absolute promoter activity was then obtained by averaging the respective 3 sets of absolute promoter activity values;
6. Finally, R.P.U was calculated by dividing the averaged PcelA and PcomFA absolute promoter activity over the averaged BBa_J23101 absolute promoter activity. R.P.U value of PcelA and PcomFA reflect the maximum GFP expression in the presence of σx. Leakage could be analyzed according to the R.P.U value that shows the GFP expression of PcelA and PcomFA promoter in the absence of σx.
Equation of the RPU calculation is shown below:

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," when we observe the cells in population level.
Figure 10. Delay of the positive feedback loop. We simulated the positive feedback situations under the different basal expression condition. The basal expression of LuxI $beta_0$ controls the delay of positive feedback loop.
The DNA invertion can lead to a drastic change in gene expression. And the negative feedback loop structure forces the system to converge to a lower steady state. We used an explicit Tau-leaping method (Cao et al., 2006) to perform the stochastic simulation here instead of the classical stochastic simulation algorithm, since the high reaction rates made the classical algorithm ineffecient. The stochastic simulation result reveals that there is a weak oscillation in the negative feedback loop stage. And we ascribed this phenomenon to the delay of gene expression and noise in the systems. The steady states we predicted were consistent with our qualitative and quantitative results from wet lab (Fig. 11).
Figure 11. Result of design 2. In the big picture above, the dark blue line stands for the stochastic simulation result and the red dash line stands for the deterministic simulation result. The small picture is our experiment result. The two bottom pictures are the qualitative results from the fluorescence microscope.
5. Design Principle of Rewirable Circuit
If you want to design your own rewirable circuit, you may need more information about how to design. Our design principle can help you to find the pattern that satisfies the specification. Our method is based on the large-scale search.
5.1 ODE sets with matrices
In order to implement large scale calculation, we introduce the ordinary differential equation sets with matrices. The transcription regulatory network can be abstracted into a matrix $R$. We use 1, -1, 0 to stand for three possible gene relationships: activation, repression, no regulation. The elements $r_{ij}$ in $R$ indicates that gene $i$ is regulated by gene $j$. This matrix is used to index the topological structure. For calculation, we need to decompose this matrix into two adjacent matrices to represent activation relationship $R_1$ and repression relationship $R_2$, respectively. According to the matrices, we can use the following equations to simulate the gene expression dynamics.  \begin{equation}  \begin{split} \left(     \begin{array}{c}        \frac{d{mRNA}_{x_1}}{dt}\\     \vdots\\ \frac{d{mRNA}_{x_N}}{dt}\\   \end{array} \right) &= R_1 \cdot \left("

T7 extension PCR
Back to protocols .
This protocols consists in 3 steps:
Gene specific-PCR: amplifies the gene you want to put under the control of the T7 promoter  adding RBS upstream and overhangs for the next PCR
Extension PCR: adds the T7 promoter (or its variants) upstream the gene and overhangs for the Gibson assembly
Final PCR: amplifies the fragments extending the gibson overhangs
Gene specific-PCR
Just a normal PCR to amplify the genes. The primers should include the RBS and overhangs with the extension primers
Extension PCR
With Hifi+ enzyme:
10 uL 5X Buffer
1 uL dNTPs
0.5 ul 5' ext primer (500 nM)
0.5 ul 3' ext primer (500 nM)
1 uL product of gene specific PCR
0.5 ul Hifi+
to 50 ul H2O
10 cycles
annealing temperature = 55°C
extension time = depends on length (about 1kb/minute)
Ask Henrike for the primers.
Final PCR
When the previous PCR is done, open the PCR machine (don't wait too long) and add 0.5 uL of each final -gibson primers (at 50 uM) (I made a mix, so just add 1 uL of it). Use the same protocol as before but run for 35 cycles and set annealing temperature as 47°C (or 50°C).

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#HP rapport_-_-_TEXT.html," many species of bacteria, the majority of which live in the gut but also inhabiting the mouth and the surface of the skin. These bacteria would be much harder to contain and prevent contamination of special regions on Mars. However these bacteria are also highly evolved to live in the habitat that humans provide; warm and with high volumes of liquid. Therefore these are not the extremophile bacteria that would be able to survive on the martian surface or sporulate and lie dormant on the surface until suitable conditions presented themselves.
So whilst contamination of the martian surface could be a possibility from manned missions to mars, colonisation of the surface by such bacteria is unlikely due to the conditions presented by the Martian surface itself.
Lastly the Martian surface is believed to be inhospitable for many bacteria to survive and as such any native microorganisms are believed to be deep sub-surface colonies, as has been theorised by Professor Charles Cockell (Cockell et al, 2018). This means that whilst we should aim not to contaminate the surface of Mars with terrestrial organisms, even if it should happen, it is unlikely that they would interact with the Martian Biosphere and thus any martian organisms which we found would be left intact.
The low probability of bacterial degradation of native Martian organisms does not negate the concept of planetary protection, which is irrefutably crucial, since the opportunity to reduce contamination risks wherever possible is necessary to preserve the untouched martian biosphere. Considering this, a trade off must be made as to whether the risk of GMO contamination is worth taking in order to advance knowledge of Mars and further explore the possibility of colonization.
Benefits of GMOs on Mars
Genetic modification is a viable method for optimising organisms for human benefit. On Earth we use genetic modification for a wide range of reasons, ranging from insulin production in diabetics to pesticide resistance in crops. It is accepted that it would be difficult for humans to survive on Mars, even for a small, well equipped research group. Genetically modifying organisms could help to alleviate many of these problems.
NASA is already researching how algae could be used to develop closed system life support for the astronauts on Mars and expanding upon the principle of insulin production, we could feasibly create many other chemicals which would help humans stay on Mars for longer periods of time (NASA, 2015). These processes would need to happen in tightly regulated, enclosed environments to ensure contamination risks are minimal. Furthermore Mars has many natural resources which could make these processes highly sustainable, for example perchlorate salts or natural minerals such as Magnesium or Potassium found in the Martian regolith which could be used"

SmoColi - Achievements
It has been a long four and a half months since we started working on our SmoColi project. During that time, we worked hard and learned a lot of new stuff. Below we summarize shortly what we did and what we have achieved so far. If you would like to read more about a particular achievement, click on the respective link.
Modeling
We made a reaction-diffusion model for the toxic molecule gradient formation in a channel and got a feeling about the feasibility of our ideas and channel dimensions.
We approximated the gradient analytically and checked that it coincides with the numerically obtained one. Additionally, we gave an analytical criterion for the existence of the GFP band .
We made a single cell model describing our circuit and verified its operation.
We performed a robustness analysis of our system to see how the band behaves upon parameter variations and concluded that it is robust and monostable.
We performed stochastic analysis to see how the GFP band reacts upon noise and confirmed one more time its robustness
We integrated the single cell model and the reaction-diffusion model in a combined 3D spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion model , simulated for various channel dimensions to get a feeling how the GFP band will move and how the alarm is activated
We extracted some information about the channel dimensions from the model and used this information in the actual channel design .

THE MARKET
According to Bioprocessing Technology this product had been used in several industries since 1990. These industries include food, drugs, cosmetics, agriculture, health care and waste treatment. In GIA´s (Global Industry Analysis) report “Chitin & Chitosan: A Global Strategic Business Report“, it’s argued that the Chitosan global market has a value of 20 billion USD, being Europe, the United States and Japan the places where it is mainly produced, sold and consumed (Pennsylvania State University, 1987), (Global Industry Analysts , 2012)
The global market for Chitosan was estimated at 13.7 thousand metric tons for 2010, with a positive projected of 21.4 thousand metric tons expected by 2015. The Asia-Pacific region (including Japan) was the leading Chitosan producer with an estimated 7.8 thousand metric tons in 2010 and a projected 12 thousand metric tons by 2015. The US represented the second biggest producer of Chitosan, with an estimated market size of 3.6 thousand metric tons in 2010 (Global Industry Analysts , 2012).
Chitosan degree of deacetylation (DDA) has often been cited as an important parameter that determines many physiochemical and biological properties of Chitosan such as crystallinity, hydrophilicity, degradataion and cell response. Molecular weight is another important feature, and it decreases if DDA increases. According to the deacetylation grade and presence of other minerals, Chitosan is categorized in three types: low purity, medium purity and high purity or medical grade (Global Industry Analysts , 2012).
Low purity Chitosan is used as floculant for water treatment industrial processes, as pesticide for agriculture, as pulp for paper and a component for industrial processes in photography products and textiles. Medium purity Chitosan is used for the same purposes as low purity Chitosan, but it also has applications in protein precipitation, encapsulating agent (for food and some pharmaceuticals) and aqueous thickener. Finally, high purity Ch"

C
The JAWS predicted stems can be fused to the Spinach Aptamer. The software can be validated by analyzing the fluorescence emission in presence of ATP and DFHBI (Fig.4B and C).
To establish a stable, reproducible system in lab that is able to sense small molecules in real time using a fluorescent readout, we applied the already published c-di-GMP Spinach2 system first
Kellenberger2013
. To design new small molecule sensors, we adapted the system described by Kellenberger et al. We exchanged the second stem of Spinach2 by three different ATP Aptamer systems (Fig. 3). All of them are based on an ATP Aptamer described by Szostak. ATP Aptamer Spinach2 is the original aptamer that was generated by Szostak. ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 and the ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach2 contain the core sequence of the original ATP Aptamer, but have a modified stem, generated by our software JAWS. In presence of the ATP ligand, the ATP aptamer should change its tertiary structure and forms together with the Spinach2 a stem. The stem formations should finally result in an increase of the fluorescence. Using this read-out system we can compare the JAWS-generated Aptamers with the original one, described by Szostak. If our JAWS software works nicely, we should get a better fluorescent read-out with ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 or ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach2 in comparison to the original ATP Aptamer Spinach2 construct.

Analysis of the fluorescent properties of our ATP Aptamer Spinach2 constructs. The Spinach2 containing the Szostak ATP Aptamer shows the lowest fluorescence of all three ATP Aptamer Spinach2 variations. The JAWS-generated ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 and the ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach2 show higher fluorescence maxima in presence of ATP.

UCL,2017,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," N-terminal 66 amino acid PhoCl remnant is too weak to inhibit the formation of connections between E-cadherin and the actin cortex. Stable connections can now be formed between cells and photo-activation is achieved.
A two-step experimental approach was chosen: first test the E-cadherin preproprotein via an aggregation assay for the ability to form patterns and then test the E-cadherin-PhoCl fusion for photo-sensitivity.
Light-induced Gene Activation & Regulation
The problem
We considered different approaches that have been tried to activate genes via light to obtain precise and reliable gene activation. For example, Motta-Mena et al. 2014 used a for mammalian cells engineered version of the EL222 protein, a bacterial light-oxygen-voltage protein (further described in the Barchitecture module) to activate genes in a range of mammalian cell lines. However, this design requires the upstream positioning of the associated promoter in front of the gene of interest. This obviously limits its use in our proposed guidance system which tries to hijack the organism’s own genome.
Therefore, many researchers developed several optogenetic transcriptional control systems for dynamically regulating gene expression with light.
Most of these systems use light-inducible heterodimerizing proteins from plants. For instance, fusion of one heterodimerizing protein to a ZFP18 or TALE4 and fusion of its binding partner to a transcriptional activation domain, such as VP64, enables light-dependent recruitment of the activation domain to the DNA sequence targeted by the ZFP or TALE. These systems enable control over expression of any gene in a reversible, tunable and spatially defined manner. However, reengineering the ZFP or TALE DNA-binding domain to target new sequences can be laborious and require specialized expertise. This is particularly a concern for gene activation with systems that must target several sequences in a gene promoter to synergistically achieve robust activation.
To address the limitations in other approaches based on light, researchers adapted the CRISPR-Cas9 activator system for optogenetic control. Polstein et al. 2015 showed that fusing the light-inducible heterodimerizing proteins CRY2 and CIB1 from Arabidopsis thaliana to the VP64 transactivation domain and either the N- or C- terminus of dCas9, the catalytically inactive form of Cas9 (D10A, H840A) allows induction of transcription of endogenous genes in the presence of blue light.

In China, several young scientists have just died from too much work. What's more, a serious accident has caused an explosion and hurt 3 students in a university in Shanghai. As undergraduates, we know that some wrong operations still exist in the laboratories and some master and PhD students are used to spending too much time in the lab. The safety and healthy of young scientists is really important to the future of science. We want to do something to change their working condition.
Our project was named as 'SynFuture'. We want to do something to change the situations in China, and we hope that synthetic biology can have a brighter future in our country. To make it easy to understand, the context, rationale and prior work will be demonstrated in detail in the following sections. We will also give some instructions if you want to do similar work. (P.S. Just contact us if you need our help!)
Biologue:For Self-improvement
Background & Instructions
This part shows all kinds of dialogue we had with people working in the field of Synthetic Biology, including scientists and peer students. This is important for us because we should broaden our horizon before leading others into the field. Also, many people from different institutes helped a lot in the design of our project!
There are many teams inviting others to communicate with them every year. You could find such information on facebook, twitter and wechat, or you can be the host! You can invite others to visit your lab or interview scholars and exchange your ideas about the design of your programs! (A good way to make friends and improve your project☺And remember to help other teams when doing the program!)

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," important aspect for us throughout the whole project. Together with other German iGEM Teams we encountered an issue regarding intellectual property rights in context of the legal status of Biobricks.
 
Gold Requirements (4/1)
We demonstrated a substantial improvement in cost efficiency of our OD/F Device in comparison to commercially available spectrophotometers. For more information see Economical View .
We increased the accessability of our new measurement techniques by sharing instructions to build our DIY devices WatsOn and the OD/F Device .
Helped three other iGEM Teams:
We built a low-cost DIY methane sensor for Team Braunschweig .
We built AcCELLoMatrix Masks for Team Freiburg .
We tested different expression vectors constructed by Team Heidelberg .
On top of the Policy & Practice aspects already mentioned in the Silver Medal Requirements, we also critically evaluated the effectiveness of our approach to increase the social acceptance of gene technology in general, and of our initiative to spark interest for synthetic biology and DIY hardware.
In addition to the medal criteria of the measurement track, we have characterized the existing BioBricks K131026 and I746909 . We improved K731520 by replacing the GFP with an iLOV (now K1319042 ) and showed that it functions in our two-dimensional biosensor ( link ).
Biosensor
We developed and optimized a novel method for detecting pathogens using a two dimensional biosensor. In our approach, the sensor cells are immobilized in optimized agar chips . It has been experimentally validated that this method works for different kinds of reporter cells, induction substances and readout methods including our newly designed system WatsOn .
In order to improve the response of our sensor cells to induction we designed and engineered a novel reporter system using a TEV protease to activate a reporter protein by cleaving off a quencher. A faster response in comparison to regular expression of the reporter protein was shown by computational modeling as well as in our experiments . All parts needed to build this kind of reporter system have been submitted to the parts registry.
WatsOn
WatsOn is a measuring device designed to read out novel two dimensional biosensor. Using WatsOn, we could demonstrate the successful detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with our chip technology. This measurement device is built from inexpensive and easily available parts to make it ideal for use in low-budget institutions. Following our economic strategy embracing the Open Access principle, we published all technical details and constructional manuals for WatsOn on our wiki.
In addition, we have shown that our image analysis software Measurarty can analyze photos of the sensor chips"

RD mixture:
20 μl RD assay was performed according to the following protocol .
DNA Electrophoresis:
For detailed information on how to prepare and run agarose gel see following protocol .

Figure 6. DNA electrophoresis with samples (1-6 from     pDR111++message+ sfGFP(Sp)) from RD control with EcoRI.
Sequencing:
Plasmid pDR111+sfGFP(Sp) and pDR111+message+sfGFP(Sp) was sent for sequencing . Primers used for    the sequencing were F-gfp insert for pDR111+sfGFP(Sp) and F-gfp insert    and F-message sequence for pDR111+message+sfGFP(Sp) (primer sequences    can be found here ).
Conclusion:
Figure 5 shows two correct bands (1535 bp and 6081 bp) when the    pDR111+sfGFP(Sp) was cut.  Figure 6 shows two correct bands (2090 bp    and 6081 bp) when the pDR111+message+sfGFP(Sp) was cut.  Therefore we    assumed that our cloning was successful and correct plasmids were    obtained. Sequencing results confirmed our assumption as you can see in    Figure 7, 8 and 9.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"   greatly reduce organism escape rates after kill switch induction. Combining several kill switches was an  approach we had discussed during the development phase of our project. Dr Gershater advised that the   different systems would need to be truly orthogonal. For example, in an industrial setting two different   kill switches that both rely on protein production could potentially be circumvented by the over expression  of a useful enzyme that is being commercially produced.
There is of course no such thing as completely (infinitely) efficient, so instead it is best to aim for the most efficient possible system - e.g. chance of escape less than 1 in 1020. This is not unrealistic because multiple mechanisms can be combined that each have less than 1 in a billion escape rates, which gets you into this territory.
-Dr Tom Ellis. Imperial College London
We spoke to Professor Richard Titball leader of the Microbes and Disease research group at Exeter University. We asked him about potential applications of kill switches. He talked about how physical containment methods traditionally used in microbiology may have limitations when applied to vaccines, an area of his research, as they are administered to the population. He thought that if triggered by a specific environmental condition, a kill switch could be an elegant bio-containment solution as it is a system that can be finely tuned. In practice however he was skeptical that kill switches could be made reliable. Interestingly when we discussed the public perception of synthetic DNA and its potential release into the environment, Prof Titball believed that it was an issue that shouldn't be discussed by the scientific community alone, but that the public should be involved in the risk/benefit assessment of the use of genetically modified organisms. This prompted us to find ways to engage the public in order to better their understanding of synthetic biology and include them in the debate. You can see our interview with Prof Titball on the Exeter iGEM 2016 youtube channel.
This is not a zero risk activity, on the other hand there are massive benefits that might be realised from GMOs. The only way I can see of moving us forward is to educate the public a bit more about the issues.
-Prof Richard Titball. University of Exeter
After talking to individuals from industry and   academia about the strengths and limitations of kill switches, it was clear that there was not a consensus on their efficacy. We decided to investigate the effectiveness  of different types of kill switch, to quantify their robustness after several generations and investigate  the possibility for horizontal gene transfer (HGT). We aimed to test if multiple kill  switches in a system would reduce failure rate and if integration"

Hong_Kong_HKU,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"023 and BBa_K592024 . However, we discovered that they did not put a terminator after the mTagBFP CDS. We wondered if the observed fluorescence outputs will be different with versus without a terminator. Therefore, we decided to perform an experiment for comparison. The experimental results showed that the observed fluorescence levels were lowered without a terminator.
Given our results, we would like to caution future users in referencing the relative promoter strengths reported by Uppsala Sweden 2011, as their measured expression levels, generated by parts without a terminator, may not fully represent the true strength of the tested promoters.
THE INVESTIGATION
We hypothesized that the expression level of mTagBFP is affected by the presence or absence of a terminator.
An experimental construct was built where the mTagBFP generator ( BBa_K592100 ) was driven by a constitutive promoter (BBa_J23101) and a medium (BBa_B0032). It was compared against its counterpart which harbored a terminator, BBa_B1006 3’ to the CDS. Constructs without promoters served as controls for auto-fluorescence. We then performed the same experiment but used BBa_B0034 as the RBS instead. Both of the results showed that the observed blue fluorescence outputs were lowered when the transcription was not properly terminated.
Figure 1. Comparison of the expression levels of a BFP generator with and without a terminator. (a) Circuit diagram illustrates experimental setup of the experiment harboring BBa_B0032. (b) Experimental results of the experiment harboring BBa_B0032.(c) Circuit diagram illustrates experimental setup of the experiment harboring BBa_B0034. (d) Experimental results of the experiment harboring BBa_B0034. Error bars represent SEM of 3 independent experiments on 3 different days.
Our results indicated that the proper expression of mTagBFP requires a terminator, thus the previously submitted part BBa_K592023 (BBa_B0032-BBa_K592100) and BBa_K592024 (BBa_B0032-BBa_K592100) are translational units only and should not be considered as acceptable alternatives to mTagBFP generators, which have terminators.
In this experiment, we have improved BBa_K592023 (BBa_B0032-BBa_K592100) and BBa_K592024 (BBa_B0034-BBa_K592100) by adding a terminator BBa_B1006 3’ to these parts. Both of the improved parts, BBa_K1899001 (BBa_K"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Model#Recomination_-_-_TEXT.html," four Cre molecules on the same plasmid, the Cre recombinase can catalyze a recombination reaction to         produce a recombined product (P). The reverse reaction also occurs.
This product can separate into two separate plasmids (P1, P2) whose Cre can bind and unbind from the lox sites in the         same manner as before
The knockout eﬃciency can be calculated as
.
2 Approximations and Simpliﬁcations
2.1 Recombination Simpliﬁcation
In our model, we do not consider the other products that could form from Cre-lox recombination. In particular, two         original plasmids with 2 Cre at one lox site on each plasmid could theoretically recombine to make a joint plasmid         together based on the principle of Cre recombinase. However, this is less likely because the lox sites are located         much further apart than those on the same plasmid. Thus, in order to simplify our model and limit the number of species         to be considered, we do not consider them.
3 System of Reactions
We can describe the Recombination module as elaborated above with this set of reactions:
4 Simulations
To simulate the system, we implemented Euler’s method for approximating ordinary diﬀerential equations and applied         the approximations as stated.
4.1 Cre-lox Recombination
Fig. 1 Simulation of Cre Recombinase kinetics
In this simulation, it can be seen that the knockout eﬃciency of Cre tends towards 53.5 % after around 5000 seconds         (around 83 minutes). While this knockout eﬃciency is not particularly high, we will show in the population dynamics         model that, over time, it results in most of the plasmid eventually being those of the knocked out.
4.2 Cre-lox Recombination without Reverse Reaction
In our construct we use lox66 and lox71, which are mutants of loxp for which the forward reaction is highly preferred         over the reverse reaction because the product of recombination includes a mutant loxp which has a very low tendency         to recombine. Because we were unable to ﬁnd reaction constants for the reverse reactions of lox66 and lox71 in the         literature, we simply simulated a version of the model where the reverse reaction is ignored for reference.

8/26 Colonies 1A-7 and 1A-8 were ligated.  Gels were also run to test if the gBlock was present in the plasmid.
8/27 Colonies 1A-7 and 1A-8 were transformed and plated.  More competent cells were grown. Research was done on the 16S RNA which we plan to use to sequence our environmental strains which would then be used to make lysates.
8/28 Colony PCR run on the environmental strains as well as 1A-7.  1A-8 showed no growth.  Controls made of BL21 and DH5-alpha.  Nitrosomonas was harvested, but since the harvesting protocol is optimized for E. coli, this proved tricky.
8/29 We did Colony PCR of 1A-7 which was one of the clones that worked.  Ran a gel which showed 900 bp band for all trials of 1A-7.  We made more CAM plates and checked the growth of 1A-7, 1A-8, (the other things that are in the incubator that Kristi did).  We then inoculated of 1A-7-1 through 1A7-16.
8/30 Adam and Tiffany made 35 mini-preps of 1A-7-11 and measured and recorded the protein concentration using the Nano-drop and the ones that Kristi did.  Sharon and Kristi did PCR and made a gel of RBSs to extract the correct bands.

When we solved the differential equations corresponding to each reaction using Simbiology in MATLAB, however, we were unable to reproduce the results reported by Stricker et al. (2008). This was probably because of the complexity of the model. As a solution, a bottom-up approach of modelling was chosen, in which a simple model is built first and equations, parameters are added as required. The simple model, in this case, was made after the model of the cI-Lac oscillator described by Hasty et al.(2001). We fisrt reproduced the results of the cI-Lac model. The two first order coupled differential equations were solved using Python 3.6 in Spyder 2.3.2 environment, a range of parameter values was scanned to obtain oscillations. The main difference between the two oscillators is that the promoter in cI-Lac oscillator has two binding sites for cI protein and one for LacI tetramer, whereas the promoter in Ara-Lac oscillator has one binding site for AraC protein and two sites for LacI binding. We then modified the model to"
Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#LindaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Most of the ideas are from these databases, and I hope to combine all the things that I like about them into our database/ datasheet. I really do hope that I can get this design part over with, so that I can start coding. I will need to finish the design process, implementation, and pretty much get the whole thing to work by the end of this week. It’s quite a daunting task, I should say. But nevertheless, it’s going to be a really cool thing (and I’m pretty much working alone on this huge project), so hopefully, I’ll get useful input/ feedback from my peers and get this project rolling!
July 10: UI is set
After reviewing the designs with my prof and mentor, we finally came down with one that seems to fit what we want to do. I’m pumped to get started coding this thing!
July 11: A different structure
Because the structure of the website is going to be different (quite different compared to what I originally had built), I pretty much rewrote the whole program. I guess we should’ve researched the design earlier so I didn’t have to go back and rewrite the code again. At least this time, I know exactly what I’m supposed to do so I was on top of my task today. So this was the design by the end of the day!
Yeah. Almost there.
July 12: Trouble(shooting)
I did make some progress today, but the later part of the day was frustrating. The first half of the day, I made the front page/ search bar that connects to the main page. That took me a while because I had to keep on refering to references. I realized that I have learned a lot about researching online for what I need. Sometimes, it’s really easy to find what I need, but sometimes, I just couldn’t find something to work.
For lunch, we went to a CS talk on twitter. It’s was really interesting. I’m not a big twitter fan but after going to the talk, I realized why people really like it or how it’s actually useful. For example, I wasn’t aware that people in countries where press is censored, use tweets to report local news. This works because twitter accounts could be anonymous. But then, a problem comes with how do you know if what the person is tweeting about is true or not. This was what the CS group was researching about. Pretty cool, huh?
After this lunch break, I went back to trying to fix my code. This afternoon was very frustrating, because the problem why the javascipts aren"

Introduction
The main aim of our project is to sequester cadmium in the environment into the spores of our engineered B. subtilis, but what happens after the cadmium has been sequestered?
Do we attempt to retrieve the sequestered cadmium? Or do we simply leave the sequestered cadmium in the spores of our engineered B. subtilis?
For our project, we have chosen the latter. We will not be attempting to retrieve the sequestered cadmium. However, then comes the question: would there not be chances of the cadmium entering the environment again?
Our solution to this question is to disable germination of the spores. If spores cannot germinate retrieval of the sequestered cadmium is unnecessary, since the spores can persist intact for thousands of years.
We were fortunate enough that Prof. Anne Moir from Sheffield University kindly sent us two non-germinating strains, with inactivated genes, namely cwlD, and sleB and cwlJ.
While we would like to disable germination for the spores that contain sequestered cadmium, not all the cells would have sequestered cadmium, and it is also essential that we still have some cells germinating, so that our population of bacteria can continue to live and grow, reaching a balance, and not simply deplete totally.
Using the treatment protocol for the non-germinating spores from Prof. Anne Moir, we performed lab experiments for the two non-germinating spores, and concluded that the double-knockout mutant, sleB and cwlJ would be best for our project as it had more colonies growing after treatment, and fewer colonies growing without treatment, as compared to the single"

OUR YEAR: TEAM ACTIVITIES

The 2016 iGEM project was much more than just studying, wet lab work and building a robot. We had a lot of fun besides the work which contributed to a great year and made our team grow closer together. This makes lab work much more fun, appearing conflicts can be solved more easily and a lot of new friendships have been built. We all learned from each other: the physics students got an introduction to synthetic biology, the biology students got in touch with programming, new students learned from more experienced students and vice versa. But scroll down and see what we did during the 2016 iGEM year!
The Start: Kick-Off
In January 2016, the iGEM team started to meet every tuesday and brainstorming about the 2016 project slowly processed. We did some literature research, found a project, discussed it in our meetings and finally decided to carry this project out. The very first team event was the kickoff event. We got to know each other better, introduced ourselves to the team and talked about our ideas and visions for this iGEM year. The team structure was developed and discussed, some team rules were specified and we had a barbecue and a pub quiz.
Workshops
In order to teach everyone about cloning, the BioBrick system and other molecular biology, basics were taught to the new students in various workshops. Several computer programs were introduced, such as SnapGene or the SciFinder.
Hiking
On May 1st, which is a holiday in germany, we went to the Weinlagenwanderung in Zwingenberg. Our way lead us through the vineyards, offering breathtaking views and high-quality wine. We hiked through the Bergstraße mountains, had a picknick and spent a good day together.
Kleinwalsertal weekend
In June, we decided to have a seminar in the Kleinwalsertal (austrian mountains). We climbed a mountain, spent some nice evenings together and developed a first concept for the Human Practices work. This weekend improved our team spirit very much and was a good possibility to recharge our batteries from the"

We prepared a stock of TPA 50 ml 20mM according to our protocol (TPA detection protocol)/ after that, we diluted the stock to get concentration of 15mM, 10mM, 5mM, 1mM, 0.5mM, 0.1mM, 0.05mM, 0.01mM, 0.005mM, 0.001mM.
We added 200uL from each concentration to a different wall in 96W anti-UV plate.
We exposed the plate to UV according to the protocol and search for fluorescence emission we saw in the literature.
After few days of testing this method we wrote the TPA detecting assay.

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Project#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"ensor, predicting a quicker response time of our system.
The model predicted that our approach should be an improvement over the commonly used direct expression, so we proceeded with the clonings and assembled plasmids to test the system.
Due to the complexity of the quorum sensing circuit, we assembled an IPTG-inducible TEV protease instead of the 3-oxo-C12-HSL-inducible version. Although the modeled and the existing double plasmid system differ regarding the induction mechanism, a high correlation between the model predictions and the experimental data was observed. However, a new model was designed according to the existing and functional IPTG-inducible system.
Revised model of the molecular approach (A) and output over time (B).
This model is for the IPTG-inducible double plasmid system (A) and the calculated output (B). Experimental data was included in the plot for comparison and data validation.
The model was optimized to fit the data generated from the characterization experiment conducted in shake flasks. Additionally, the data from the characterization experiment of the double plasmid construct (K1319014 + K1319008) in the chip system was included in the plot above. The data was derived from the plate reader output of the four central spots of the chip. The background from the non-induced chip was substracted from the fluorescence response to correct the data and avoid effects from cell growth leading to wrong signal strengths. The development of the fluorescence is presented here .
It is shown that the fluorescence response in chips develops later than in the characterization experiment in shake flasks. This is because the solid agar chip provides a higher diffusion barrier than liquid medium as used in the shake flasks. Further, a high oxygen transfer rate in shake flask cultivations enhances the rate of fluorescence development, as oxygen is needed for GFP production, in comparison to the cultivation in chips.
The model predictions correlate with the data generated from the characterization experiments, thus validating our molecular approach. With an iterative cycle of modeling, a faster and stronger fluorescence signal could be proven both theoretically and empirically.

However, according to previous wikis, most of the teams only communicate with seni or high students from schools in urban areas. They never refuse students in rural areas, but they never inform them. High school students in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have already enjoyed best education resources, while rural areas in Shangdong Province, such as Weifang, are badly in need of that kind of education.
Hence, we suggest that iGEM headquarter may advise teams from developing countries pay more attention to the senior high students in the nearby rural areas and also invite them to have a lab visit. The teams from developed countries may also help donate some educational materials to them. Equality is not only the spirit of America, but also the wish of China.
We know that education inequality is hard to solve, but your action will make a difference!

Judging Criteria
We think we should be awarded with a gold medal because we achieved all the criteria mentioned in the judging form and the criteria setup by iGEM headquarters. We documented, characterized and improved multiple new standard biobricks and submitted these in the iGEM Registry. We designed and characterized a novel approach for the production and expression of proteins that would normally be insoluble or would get caught in inclusion bodies with the submission of our SUMO/Ulp1 system. In addition to the submission of the SUMO/Ulp1 system, we also designed a novel assembly standard. Furthermore, to our knowledge we are the first to show the interspecies communication between a Gram- negative and a Gram- positive species with our AIP receiver GFP system, and the first to characterize the biobrick used to do so. In human practice we contributed by the fact we made it possible for less well funded teams to make their own DIY fluorescent scanner with the designing  and publishing of all the technical details of our Zephyr. Besides this we developed a novel approach for the designing of anti-microbial peptides, we determined and proved their functionality, both in their toxicity towards Gram-positives and their lack of it towards mammalian cells.

Related to the result of application dosage model (10.16-15.77mg dsRNA/mu), the real cost of our project is at the range of $23-36/mu, which is slightly higher than the traditional pesticides like glyphosate used by farmers. When it applied in invasive species management, which is more cheaper than any other methods. And we would still working on optimizing our project for lower cost in future work.

The mixture was overlaid with 500 µl pentane (carefully, phases should not mix) and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. The reaction was stopped by vigorous mixing and centrifugation (5 min) to separate phases. The upper phase (solvent phase) was taken and put into a pasteur pipette which contained glass wool with Na2SO4 (to dry the solvent phase). Since the amount of pentane seemed to be insufficient (no solvent reached the GC glass container), the next two extractions were done with 1 ml of pentane each. Afterwards the combined extracts were reduced to approximately 300 µl under a stream of nitrogen.
3 replicates of negative control (reaction batch without enzyme) and enzymatic reaction batch were done.
The pentane extracts were analyzed with gas chromatography- mass spectrometry to identify the enzymatically formed products. An aliquot of each sample (0.5 µl) was injected into ""5890 Series II GC"" coupled to a ""Finnigan Mat 55 S MS"".
Preparation of yeast cultures for large scale expression (1l) 1
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the preparation of three 30ml yeast cultures (in selective SC-U 2% glucose medium), based on yeast clones transformed with pTUM104 vectors, each containing one of the three genes CaXMT1, CaMXMT1 and CaDXMT1 for having enough crude extract for further analysis.
Operational sequence:
If possible, a single colony which had grown on selective SC-U 2%glucose agar plates was used for inoculation of the 30ml liquid medium. If the density of the colonies was to high, a small amount (pipett dip) was taken.  The generated cell suspensions were incubated at 30°C over night.

The designing was done using M13mp18 DNA to keep the initial cost of the material low so that we abide by the rules set out by our aim with this project.  The scaffold is designed to be approximately 40 nm long, with an hollow cavity that can be design to place various inorganic material. Through the combination of organic material (DNA) and inorganic material such as gold, the product can have application in multiple fields.
In our prototype, we used gold as the inorganic component to which are precipitated precisely in the hollow cavity of the scaffold and tested for conductance of electricity at nanoscale. To align multiple of our scaffold in a straight line, we used Teslaphoresis as the method, which again fits the criteria we set out to achieve in our aim for this project.

Design:
For this year’s project, we used two available softwares for designing our three-dimensional DNA origami nanostructures. The first is cadnano2 supported under the open-source license by the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University. The second software we used is a recent one called, DAEDALUS. It is a free online resource developed and maintained by the Laboratory for Computational Biology and Biophysics at MIT, under the directorship of Professor Mark Bathe.

For example, the scroll bar could not function properly. Also, the position of the navigation bar was incorrect, which greatly affected the normal operation of the software. Meanwhile, we suggested them to increase the quantity of the data in the background database as well as improve the quality of the data. Moreover, we suggested that the real-time updating capability of their database should be enhanced.
Team SJTU_China designed a piece of software used for laboratory management and instant communication. The design style of this software is natural and delicate and the systems of laboratory material management and instant communication could very well meet the requirements of iGEM teams. When we actually tried out this software, however, we still discovered some problems. For example, in order to use the instant communication function of this software, users must register on service offered by certain commercial companies first, which would presumably lead to the disclosure of personal information.
We have submitted reports on user experience to both of the teams.
Team HUST_China
Many iGEM teams have participated in the Interlab Study this year. Unfortunately, however, materials from the 2016 Interlab Kit such as plasmids failed to function effectively due to problems in the manufacture, transportation, storage and experiment process. Team HUST_China was encountered with such problem. Due to some unknown issues, they failed to successfully transform the plasmid for Positive Control group into Escherichia coli DH5
and they turned to us for assistance. After we had learnt their situation, we immediately cultured the Positive Control strain that we had successfully transformed and send the plasmid they had required to them. With our prompt help, team HUST_China eventually obtained the Positive Group strain.
Team JSNU_China
This year is the first year that team JSNU_China participates in the iGEM Competition and we have had a close cooperation with them. We have provided them with detailed suggestions on composition of team members, selection of project focus and establishment of their team wiki etc.

One part of the project of our team this year was to design AI-2 Response Device that could respond to different concentration of environmental AI-2. As a result, we could test the regulation ability of AI-2 Controllers by directly measuring the GFP expression.

Train passenger
Not only did we inform and engage passengers, we also learnt from them about the general opinion on several aspects of our project through a survey. 75% indicated that there should be more public debates on developments in biotechnology in general to inform the public and reduce fear caused by ignorance. That was what we strived for with our outreach activities with which we on purpose tried to address the general public.
“With increasing manipulability we forget about the beauty of what is already there. We will diverge from our essential nature with consequences no one knows yet.”

Gene Doping in Society Surveys
We handed out surveys both during the train debates and in the public transports and streets during our time in China. From the start we focussed on reducing any survey response effects, which are unintended psychological effects influencing the responses of the respondents. We found alarmingly high numbers of people interested to use gene doping for performance enhancement among the general public in both The Netherlands as well as in China. This reinforced our project, to promote responsible use of synthetic biology. The topic certainly caught public interest and one person even wanted to contemplate longer before sending us the survey over the mail as can be seen in figure 9.
Figure 9. A survey sent to us by one of the people we met on the trains and who wanted to think further about the topic. We thank him and everyone else who contributed.
Survey hypothesis and results
We had the following hypotheses with results:
We expected a general fear of gene technology due to a lack of information supply on the topic to the general public both in The Netherlands as well as in China.
Most people are not afraid for gene technology in both countries and there seems to be only little difference between both countries. In The Netherlands only 11.2% is afraid of gene technology, which is 13.7% in the People’s Republic of China. In addition, more than 75% of the respondents in The Netherlands indicated they would like to be more informed about developments in biotechnology through e.g. debates.
We hypothesized that people would be hesitant to use gene doping because the phenomenon will sound new and thereby dangerous to many people at this point. Based on a paper by Connor et al. ("

Engaging with Experts and Potential Users
During the course of this project, we met with two commercial microfluidic companies based in the greater Boston area, Phenomyx and Fraunhofer Center of Manufacturing Innovation. During these meetings, we presented an overview of our system TERRA alongside the goals and motivations driving the project. Meeting with these microfluidic experts helped give us an idea about how to use our system to help remedy the lack of standardization in the field of microfluidic as well as brainstorm some potential applications and ways to integrate our system into some common workflows. Explore our integrated human practices page for more information.
In addition to the experts in the commercial microfluidics industry, we also consulted our resident microfluidic experts and other researchers here at Boston University’s Design Automation and Manufacturing Production (DAMP) Lab. From the researchers focused on biology, we were given a some protocols that TERRA should be able to run in order to improve their workflows. The graduate students who worked directly with microfluidics helped us determine the feasibility of some of these workflows and help guide the course of the project."

Young scholars in the field of synthetic biology
This summer, the 5th China Regional iGEM Exchange (CCiC) was held at Shanghai University of Science and Technology. More than 60 IGEM teams shared their research and experience in Shanghai. We shared the main content and project experience of this year's team project. In addition, we also displayed posters in the lobby of the School of Life Sciences of Shanghai University of Science and Technology, and further exchanged with other team members. Many of the suggestions we received from other teams were very valuable, so we went back to further improve the design and adjust the next step; in addition, we worked closely with Jiangnan China and ECUST because our project modules are suitable for them.

Before he moved on to the DpnI digest, Joe did a gel electrophoresis on the SDMed-PCR product. The band on the gel showed up as predicted (a pet200 plasmid at around 8.6kb). Joe then did a DpnI digest SDM-PCR products with 0.5uL of DpnI and incubated at 37C overnight.  Afterwards, he transformed 2uL of DpnI products on Kanamycin plates. He also did a negative control to test the plates for kanamycin. Unfortunately, there is no growth of colonies in all plates.  His next step is to increase the amount of DpnI digested products in the transformation.
At first, Joe didn't bother to do a gel electrophoresis on his PCR products after DpnI digest. He later did and found all his PCR products digest for some strange reason, which makes him wonder if he only had his original DNA template.  His next step is to redo his SDM-PCR. So forget about the horray at the beginnning!

Marianne and Vicki ran SDM-PCR on their synthase genes and verified their PCR products through gel electrophoresis. No bands were present in any of the lanes.
Troubleshooting: The dNTP could have been too old/contaminated (we had trouble with this particular tube of dNTP from last year), the concentrations for the reagents were not optimized so... Marianne looked into some protocols and optimized the SDM-PCR protocol. Let the failures begin.
In a group, Vicki, Marianne, Gurpal and Jacob again attempted to perform SDM to remove an internal cut-site. ThermoPol was used as a buffer and PFU was used. After adding the primers and other constituents, we each ended up with ~ 25uL samples. We set our samples to run in a thermocycler for about 4 hours with specified conditions. When the cycling was completed, DpnI enzyme was added to each PCR tube and incubated overnight at 37oC.
To check if our SDM worked, we performed gel electrophoresis. Unfortunately, our gel showed that our site directed mutagenesis did not work as our product was still cut in two by"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

Overview
In deciding on a project to work on for iGEM, Cooper Union and Columbia University students looked for something that was both relevant in the modern world and environmentally friendly, while minimizing safety concerns regarding any proposed ideas. It was brought to the team’s attention that current electronics manufacturing processes are harmful to the environment (1). With this in mind, the team came up with a synthetic biology approach to etch copper in order to redefine the manufacturing of printed circuit boards.
While brainstorming ideas, we came across Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, an acidophilic prokaryote that oxidizes Fe2+ to Fe3+. The oxidized iron can then oxidize the copper. When copper is oxidized, it becomes soluble. This means that circuit boards can be printed provided the ability to exert spatial control over these chemical reactions.
The following question ensued: what would provide the ability to exert spatial control over copper oxidation on a circuit board? Light is non-intrusive, cheap, and widely available. Furthermore, light can be manipulated easily in terms of wavelength and resolution. By inserting a light-activated mechanism, the bacteria could etch in the desired pattern by turning a gene on or off.
What gene would allow controlled etching? If light activated a gene that induced cell death through lysis, the bacteria that survived would continue to etch away at the copper while the dead bacteria would stop etching. This would achieve what was desired: spatially controlled etching.

Public engagement
In order to reach out to the society LiU iGEM has participated in several fairs and events to get in touch with the public and other students and spread the word about iGEM and synthetic biology.
Nordic iGEM Conference
The team from Stockholm Sweden decided to invite all the Nordic iGEM teams to a mini iGEM conference. The conference was held in late June and a total of nine teams from; Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden were represented.  It all started with some mingle and a barbeque, where the teams had a chance to get to know each other and get a sneak peek about what each team had decided to do for their project.
The second day had a much more hectic schedule, the day started with a mini jamboree where each team had a presentation about their project and how the progress of the project. Later, we attended several workshops, the topics were; Speculative design and Unsolved ethics. The hosting team from Stockholm had invited the Finish lecturer Marko Ahteensuu to talk about the ethics in synthetic biology. The workshop in speculative design was held by two members of the Stockholm iGEM team. All the new information from the other teams and the very inspiring workshops really made the team excited to get our own project started.
The finale was the Gasque at the end of the day, where all the teams dressed up for the formal dinner party. The winning team of the mini jamboree was announced and team UCPH was the lucky winner. They received the prize, a golden pipette, and were asked to host the next Nordic iGEM Conference.

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#blog_-_-_TEXT.html," twice a terminator. Indeed, every integrase can switch the terminator only once. Thus if the colony produces only r or only s, the terminator is switched only once, so the terminator is OFF, and GFP and QS1 or QS2 are produced (depending on the colony). If the colony produces r and s, the terminator is switched twice, so it is ON and it blocks expression of GFP and of the quorum sensing molecule.
Rule that will be computed by all cells : an XOR gate between the signals from the 2 cells above. Biologically, integrases p and q are able to bind sites around a terminator and switch this terminator, thereby turning off the effect of the terminator and enabling gfp transcription. If p and q integrases are both present, the terminator is switched twice and comes back to its initial state, gfp is not transcribed.
We need to  :
find orthogonal quorum sensing molecules and orthogonal integrases
discuss with microfluidics experts to check if using microfluidics is possible and presents advantages in our case
find possible parts in the registry for integrases, and design plasmids

BSSE Openhouse Day
Saturday, May 10th
Sharing our iGEM and synthetic biology interest with the public
On May 10th the public in Basel had the unique chance to get an insight into many different scientific laboratories and the work done there. It was the joint open house day of D-BSSE of ETH (Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering) and the Biozentrum of the University of Basel. The many different labs opened their doors to the public and many scientists were present to give interested people some details about their daily work. So did the ETH iGEM team 2014. The team was present with a poster showing the history of iGEM, the previous ETH iGEM teams with their projects and general information about synthetic biology. Additionally there was a slideshow giving a best-of photo collection of last years jamboree. The goal of this day was to inform the public about synthetic biology in general and specifically about the spirit and the many different projects of iGEM. Many people showed strong interest in truly student driven projects and are curious to follow our team wiki for the next months.

A more detailed description of the technology can be found on the BD Biosciences website.
Our Approach
We approach the characterization problem with a standard characterization workflow. The process begins after plasmids have already been transformed into E. coli in a frozen liquid stock. Cells containing the plasmid of interest are plated on agar plates for overnight growth at 37C. Three colonies are picked from each plate and grown in spinning liquid culture in triplicate at 37C, 300rpm for ~6 hours. These cultures are then diluted 200:1 into fresh media including a chemical inducer if appropriate. Afterwards, these cultures are again incubated at 37C, 300rpm but for ~15 hours. Finally, cultures are diluted 10:1 into PBS for flow cytometry.
Although this process is not experimentally proven to be optimal, it is an effort to standardize the workflow within the lab.

Tuesday and Wednesday Daniel and I worked on double bonding and finally got our bonds to change colors. As simple as it sounds, it was a victory for us since we just really working on this code. We also had a lot of meetings since all of the other HCI students were joining us for the first time and we had to help orient them to the lab.
Thursday we went to MIT to learn more about synthetic biology. Having no biology background and very little sleep, I was frustrated by the amount of times someone said, “Remember this from when you took biology?” The answer is no, I don’t, that was 6 or 7 years ago and I had a poorly taught bio class. Anyway, I learned as much as I could from that. I felt like there were very clear directions, but the directions really didn’t teach me anything as there was no explanation on why we did what we did. Even after taking CS240, the instructions on building the simulator with the breadboard were pretty annoying. They weren’t very clear or technological. It was okay though, I learned a bit about working in a wet lab and what the environment was nice and I temporarily got to play with fire so that was cool. Afterwards, we got smoothies and then ran to the bus which proceeded to be an hour late.
Friday was commencement so I had to be there working at it. The ceremony was interesting and Orit won the Pinanski Award! I came back to the lab at about 1:30 and found out what Dan had been working on. He’d figured out how to adjust the angles of the bonds after double bonding, so we worked together on deleting the old bonds. We discovered that there was an array that kept track of bonds, so if we iterated through the array and deleted the other bonds, then we could have the correct bonds remaining in the right places. This is what we need to continue working on on Wednesday when we return from BU.
Think about these for the future:
Here are some questions you might consider:
Who is your user?    What and where in the design cycle are the needs in synthetic biology?    During your wet lab experience, how did you feel? Were you ever overwhelmed? How might you mediate that?    What other domains and tools do you think you can refer to for your projects?    Where there gestures? Sketches? Interfaces that came to mind when you were trying to deal with the experiment protocol?    How could you frame synbio as a ""good"" thing?    Where and for what"

Maintenance of DNA fidelity and creating in vivo mutagenesis by affecting the participating proteins
DNA is the single blueprint for all proteins of an organism. Minor changes in the DNA sequence are mostly without significant consequences,     but in some cases the consequences are detrimental e.g. by rendering encoded crucial proteins useless. Therefore, an effective system of DNA     repair mechanisms emerged during evolution. The DNA fidelity system is composed of three main mechanisms, which contribute to the high fidelity.     The first fidelity mechanism lies in selecting the correct base for incorporation during replication of DNA. This process of base selection     reduces the error rate by 105 mutations per bp per generation. During replication, the acting polymerase (mainly polymerase III in E. coli)     directly corrects falsely incorporated bases. This process is called proofreading and reduces the error rate by 102 mutations per bp per generation.     Other mutations in the DNA e.g. introduced through replication errors or other mutagenic sources are repaired by the mismatch repair systems.     This system reduces the error rate by 103 mutations per bp per generation. (Schaaper 1993; Fijalkowska et al. 2012)  All these fidelity     mechanisms contributed to the error rate reduction, leading to a final rate of about 10-10 mutations per bp per generation. (Lee et al. 2012).
Many variants of the participating proteins with (partial) loss-of-function were identified and described in the literature     (Degnen, Cox 1974; Nghiem et al. 1988; Schaaper, Radman 1989; Fowler, Schaaper 1997; Junop et al. 2003). The common phenotype upon the     mutants was a strongly increased mutation rate. It did not take long before better-characterized hypermutator strains arose as a tool to study     the effect of random mutations on proteins or to improve proteins trough means of directed evolution     (Greener et al. 1997; Selifonova et al. 2001; Stefan et al. 2001). A common issue among  different applications of genomic mutator genes is the     general genetic instability and frequent unviability of these strains. For example, the E. coli strain, which chromosomally harbors     the strongest known mutator dnaQ926 is almost completely unviable without additional mutations (Fijalkowska, Schaaper "

Results and Discussion
The cod gene was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21 after induction with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The expression temperature was reduced to 30 °C.
Analysis utilizing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), shown in figure 14, revealed single bands for the COD enzyme (approximately 45.5 kDa).
Further approach would include adding His-tags and purification via affinity chromatography. To test the enzyme activity the amount of released acetic acid during enzymatic reaction can be measured, using an acetic acid assay kit, or via thin-layer chromatography.
Considering the importance of using two CDAs, an orthogonal expression system could be implemented to create multiple patterns of deacetylation.

Designer Future
Since chitin oligomers are deacetylated at specific positions by different deacetylases, the usage of different enzymes makes it possible to create chitosans with defined patterns and special properties. While our project only involves two deacetylases at this time, others could be introduced as well, giving us the opportunity to create varying patterns. To accomplish this future goal, we would require an orthogonal expression system. Unregulated parallel usage of several CDAs only results in chitosan oligomers that are deacetylated by all enzymes. If they could be individually induced, each combination of CDAs may be expressed and different chitosan oligomers could be constructed for various applications. To achieve an effective regulation, we have been searching for a suitable system. During this, we have stumbled upon a solution in a modern research issue – the T7-split-R"

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," 0.5% w/v of rhamnose, shows no significant difference with an alpha value of 0.05. However, if we look at the p-value (0.0503) we can see that it is actually really close to a 5% of significance. So, the variation could be due to the manipulation.
We could conclude that the tags added to the CsgA molecule do not have a negative effect on biofilm formation, but also that the rhamnose concentration used for induction do not have a remarkable effect for such a long induction. Now that the biofilm capability of these strains is proved, proper function tests for the affinity tags are required. With that, we could confirm that we have generated biofilm with special affinity for certain surfaces.
Attachment assay for testing biofilm adhesion strength on hydroxyapatite using Bos taurus dental parts
Background
In our research for a highly representative biofilm that could be used for testing products, we thought about the main surfaces where a non-desirable biofilm can be attached. The first structure that came into our minds was the dental cavity; there, biofilms can attach to the tooth cover and create strong and resistant biofilms (Kidd, E.A., et al, 2004).
In our research about the dental surface we found that the external part that protects the inner tooth fragments is the enamel. Hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2), also known as bone mineral, is a mineral compound that represents the major inorganic part of the dental enamel and dentin (Staines,M. et al, 1981). Thus, we looked forward to a way to make our biofilm attach better into a hydroxyapatite-covered surface.
In the end, we found that our homemade biofilm could be improved with surface-specificity just by adding a particular tag attached to our amyloid protein, CsgA (Roy,M. et al, 2008). This tag, successfully added to our csgA construct and cloned in our vehicle strain, does successfully make biofilms when induced with rhamnose. However, we thought that the best way to prove that it can resemble a real mouth-attached biofilm is testing it with teeth!

Methodology
For the experiment aiming to prove that our biofilm can be strongly linked to the enamel surface, we managed to get some teeth from a cow (Bos taurus) (figure"

This week, we got the sequencing results for construct 9, 10 and the TALE target sequences. The TALE target sequences (with old and new [B] + [A]) worked. Construct 9 sequencing did not have a good reading with one of the primers, so we send it for sequencing again. Construct 10 didn’t work, so we set up digestion, ligation and transformation again. Colony PCR revealed right-sized  bands for 5 colonies. We step up overnights and mini prepped those over the weekend.
We did colony PCR of construct 11, but the bands were not at the expected size, so we transformed more Top10 cells.
We also received constructs 9, 10 and 11 from GenScript and did a transformation with them. The plates had colonies, but now we have to plasmid switch them to pSB1C3 , because they came in PUC57 backbone. We did colony PCR and mini-prepped the colonies that worked.

We measured channel capacity of the part BBa K1061013. We quantify the properties of TRE promotor.
The link is:
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1061013
Our Improvement
Purpose
Channel capacity evaluates correlation between input and output signals. For instance, if channel capacity is larger than 1 bit, the part can decern between high and low inputs, and vice versa. By assessing this novel quantity, we through light on how much information can a inducible promotor pass on. The measuring and calcualtion methods can be applied to more promotors in the future.
Results
Using EBFP2 as reporter, we measure channel capacity of a simple circuit driven by TRE to be 0.5259, with standard deviation of 0.0058.
Methods
We transfect HEK-293 human cells with our plasmid constructions as described in the form [ref: table]. Different concentrations of Dox are applied to cell culture at the same time.
Transfected cells are cultured for 48 hours before performing flow cytometry, long enough for protein expression level to achieve steady state. FACS examination measures florescent intensity emitted by each cell, from which we obtain a large sample of florescent protein expression level, tens of thousands of cells for each experiment group.
Data collected from flow cytometry are later analyzed on computers. We estimated probability density function (p.d.f.) from data using kernel density estimation, a nonparametric statistics method. Given high and low Dox concentration input, cells exhibit different probability distributions, as illustrated in the example below [ref: fig].
What we have in hand is the conditional distribution $p\left( {Y\left| {X = x} \right.} \right)$ , given a known level of input $x$ . In order to calculate mutual information $I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \iint {p\left( {x,y} \right"

Manchester-Graz Collaboration
The Manchester-Graz team have developed an expression system designed to regulate single and multi-gene pathways for an intestine expression. For controlling a wide range of pathways it is designed in a flexible and modular manner. They tested the production of butyrate in the gut. The pathway was incorporated into the expression system model to observe the expression of butyrate under the control of the developed system. The model generated helped us to understand how the system is dealing with pathways that consist of several enzymes at an intestinal level.
The system consists of two quorum sensing (QS) systems EsaR/I and CepR/I. The EsaR/I system belongs to the plant pathogen Pantoea stewartii . The second QS-System, CepR/I, belongs to the opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia .  For details about the system and the model please look into the Manchester-Graz modelling page .
Figure 1: Overview of the reduced pathway. Coenzyme A (CoA) is recycled in the pathway by the butyryl CoA-acetyl CoA-tranferase.
Butyrate is converted starting from two acetyl-CoAs over several steps to butyryl-CoA. In the last step, the coenzyme A is transferred to acetate, producing acetyl-CoA and butyrate 1 . For simplicity, the pathway was reduced to some essential parts and steps in the pathway. Acetate is converted to acetyl-CoA. The steps to butyryl-CoA are reduced to one step. Coenzyme A is recycled in the last step to butyrate and can be reused to produce acetyl-CoA (Figure 1).
The pathway is controlled by three enzymes whose expression is controlled by the two quorum sensing systems.
If we simulate the model, in the first two minutes the acetate gets first converted into butyryl-CoA and then the butyrate production starts (see Figure 2). The following time is butyrate being produced constantly by the cells. The butyrate is transported out of the cells through diffusion by a rate of 207.6 µmol/h/L or 18 mg/h/L.

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Design and Background_-_-_TEXT.html," et al., 2015). The use of a toxin-antitoxin regulation mechanism is a prime example of such a system (Li and Wu, 2009), with several iGEM projects already having attempted to use and characterize these systems, for instance Lactonutritious and Endosymbiont . Toxin expression or action is hindered by its cognate antitoxin, resulting in a controlled system which could be used to eliminate the bacteria when it is not needed, hence the name kill-switch.
Our biocontainment system is based on two principles: genome integration and toxin-antitoxin gene switches. It is a two-component feedback-regulated kill-switch mechanism, with toxin expression induced by the addition of two chemical substances - cumate and tryptophan. Additionally, to minimize spreading of transgenic material, we added the option of integrating the system into a specific site in the genome.
What is genome integration and why is it needed?
The first issue we addressed was horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which is a mechanism used by bacteria for an exchange of genetic material (Keese, 2008). To reduce spreading of the transgenes encoding our system to native lung bacteria, integration into the bacterial chromosome was employed as a first-in-line strategy against HGT, specifically the mechanism of bacterial conjugation.
Looking into the available methods for genome integration described in the literature and in the iGEM community, we took advantage of the characterized mini-Tn7 BioBrick toolkit developed by the iGEM team UPO-Sevilla 2011 and previously described by Choi et al., 2005. In brief, the toolkit contains two suicide delivery vectors (medium and high copy number plasmids) in which one could insert any BioBrick between two distinct sequences (Tn7L and Tn7R) and integrate it into the genome at a designated site, attTn7. The attTn7 site is highly conserved in nearly all bacterial genomes (Milewski, 2002). The integration is executed by a transposase complex expressed in another ‘’helper’’ suicide plasmid ( pTNS2 ), containing a set of enzymes carrying out the transposition. The transposase complex recognizes the Tn7L and Tn7R sites, flanking the sequence of interest and finally inserts it into the unique conserved site in the genome (attTn7).

Why colonize Mars?
On this page you can read about our collaboration with the other Danish iGEM team from the technical university of Denmark, Hyphae hackers, and the iGEM team from the University of Exeter, Project perchlorate. We have had an extensive collaboration from early in the process, resulting in a cross disciplinary report on Mars colonization in which we together examine the motivations for Mars colonization, and the bioethical concerns of bringing humans to Mars. We have furthermore collaborated with the DTU iGEM team Hyphae hackers on an event held in the Tycho Brahe Planetarium in Copenhagen.
Our collaboration with Hyphae Hackers and Project Perchlorate is substantial because:
We have been working closely together on making a report on Mars colonization
We have used the conclusions from the report in our dialogues with laymen on a major culture event in Copenhagen
The process
We noticed our common interests with the other Danish team DTU (The technical university of Denmark) quite early. Our universities are tightly bound together and we have had extensive dialogue from the very beginning. We met the DTU team early in the process both at the Biobrick seminar held by DTU and at the Nordic iGEM conference held by iGEM team Lund. Since we had both chosen to work with projects related to Mars and since we were both interested in exploring the subject, we decided to collaborate on it.
Soon after the decision of collaborating with DTU was made, The iGEM team from the university of Exeter contacted us to ask if we wanted to collaborate with them on exploring Mars related Human Practice issues. We asked Exeter if they would like to collaborate with us and DTU making it a three-teams collaborations, and they said yes.
Extensive brainstorming sessions
Brainstorming was a big part of our first Skype meetings, and because of our early start, our discussions managed to shape parts"

iGEM Spirit
To spread the idea of iGEM and inform the public about synthetic biology in general we decided to set up an information desk on a public place in the downtown of Duesseldorf on September 23rd.
To get the attention of the people we created a little quiz in which they had to figure out what grapefruits, yeast and insect repellent had in common. Many people stepped by because they had no clue. We were happy to elaborate on the link between them and and our idea of fighting malaria.
We recognized on the given day, that a large percentage of the population is not at all informed or misinformed about synthetic biology which leads to a lot of unfounded fear. We had serious and intense talks with people who had negative feelings towards synthetic biology but could not exactly name why. We described the safety regulations and ethical aspects to them in detail and were often able to take away the undefined fear of bio-weapons and other things.
On the other hand people wanted to know how exactly our iGEM project works and elucidated us on what they know about synthetic biology and genetically engineered plants.
Whether knowing synbio or not the people started to be excited about its potential. We invited everyone to our “SynBio Day” to improve and consolidate their knowledge. They strongly appreciated our concept of comprehensive knowledge transfer.
The day was a huge success as we could talk to many people of all ages and education levels and show them what possibilities synthetic biology holds. We were able to inform people with no background information at all, overcome prejudices against synthetic biology and discuss our project with interested people. This project was a first important step to educate the population and create an open and friendly minded environment for synthetic biology.

Best Hardware Special Prize
iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.
To compete for the Best Hardware prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

XMU_Software,2013,Team:XMU Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," that λ=10 will be the best predictor.39 But there will be a large amount of calculation considering all possible situations—the 30 factors. We should select factors that can obtain the best prediction accuracy in least calculation. For that reason, we drew lessons from the literature4 by using the method of Monte Carlo simulation and then 14 optimal characteristic factor were obtained. Other studies have indicated that the logarithm of the sequences length has a good correlation with folding rate, so Ln (L) will be the fifteenth factors. We apply SPSS software to calculate the coefficient of 15 factor by multivariate linear regression, and this will be the forecast formula of the rate of protein folding. We compared the experimental data and the predicted data and the results are as follows:
Figure 3 The comparision of the experimental and the predicted results
Through the test, our software succeeded in showing a relatively accurate folding rate value.
Future work
First of all, we will modify our software by advancing the program and the framework to improve its ability of concurrent computation and shorten the computing time.
Secondly, to accelerate the calculation, we may simplify the function of calculation by neglecting some term in our equations. However, considering the time spent on running program was extremely little, we will pay more attention on how to modify the equations for increasing the accuracy which maybe dramatically progress optimization result.
Thirdly, enriching the database is other way to improve our software. According to time-space tradeoff law, we could pre-process a bunch of sequences in common use to optimized one and save the result into our database. By assessing our data, investigators could select the optimized sequences for their synthesis. Then, users are required to feedback their result. When it collects enough information, our app will learn users’ bias therefore modify our optimizing function by some methods, like NSGA-II algorithm.
The specific points are listed as following:
1. Shortening the computing time of the software.
2. Expanding the range of the host cells.
3. Improving bacterium's resistance to toxic molecule.
4. Advancing existed paths of synthetic biology by the method.
5. Designing new paths of synthetic biology by the method.
6. Increasing the output of recombinant protein.
7. Predicting the expression of heterologous gene in a new host cell.
8. Considering more factors such as spiral structure in folding which influence the folding rate and thereby obtaining more accurate prediction rate.
9. Providing a set of software tools for protein folding, especially in molecular dynamics simulation of protein folding.

iGEMers gather on the steps of Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Stanford University, at SB5.0
CommunityBricks and AlumniGEM
At SB5.0, the Cornell, Brown-Stanford, Arizona State, University of Panama, and UTP Panama iGEM teams gathered iGEMers together to discuss two initiatives: a global outreach/human practices collaboration and the formation of the iGEM Alumni Association.
Since SB5.0, many iGEM teams have come together to create CommunityBricks , a resource of outreach and human practices activities for future iGEM teams to use and add to. We envision that this resource--soon to be a part of iGEM.org--will help iGEM teams promote synthetic biology to the global community.
Additionally, Cornell has been collaborating with iGEM HQ and other iGEM teams to create iGEM's alumni association.  We all assisted Brown-Stanford iGEM in creating a fabulous networking tool, the AlumniGEM forums , which contains alumni profiles and discussion platforms. And check out the beginnings of the AlumniGEM website , a collaboration between iGEM teams and iGEM HQ to keep alumni connected to iGEM and synthetic biology!
Here is what Cornell iGEM has done specifically to make these ideas into reality:
Initiated the outreach/human practices collaboration at SB5.0
Discussed the need for an alumni association with Brown-Stanford
Contributed material to the AlumniGEM forums
Collaborated with Brown-Stanford to write the text on the AlumniGEM website's splash page
Started CommunityBricks (formerly known as iGEM Outreach 2.0) on OpenWetWare
Created the site architecture, with assistance from Brown-Stanford
Collaborated with Brown-Stanford on making the CommunityBricks logo and site banner
Along with Arizona State and Brown-Stanford, created a collaboration invitation letter inviting teams to contribute to CommunityBricks and the AlumniGEM forums and distributed it to every iGEM team
Uploaded a lesson plan on synbio ethics and posted three outreach activities (see below)
