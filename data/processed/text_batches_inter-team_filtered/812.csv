Although these results not formally demonstrate that the LovTAP repression is light dependent, it seems that in cells co-transformed with LovTAP versus those transformed only with the trpL-RFP system, there are lower levels of RFP. Another interesting pattern observed in the samples, is that there are lower levels of RFP as the promoter strength that regulates LovTAP increases, thus suggesting that there is a gradient of repression depending on the LovTAP concentration.
These results suggest that possibly LovTAP is working well, however as this experiment is totally qualitative, it must be improved taking into account the optical density of the samples, because the observations could be due to the presence of different number of cells in each sample. As well replicates of the experiment are needed.
Quantitative experiment
With the aim to have a better characterization of LovTAP, we designed a new protocol considering the methodology describe by Jason R Kelly, we include some changes that are detailed below.
We decided to start the protocol under blue light conditions to test the dark state, expecting that in dark exposed samples the RFP levels increase in comparison with those samples that are always under blue light.  We did this in order to face better the issue of the long half life of the RFP due to it doesn’t have a degradation tag.
Experimental procedure
The samples used were: trpL+RFP reporter system in plasmid pSB1C3, Lausanne trpL-RFP reporter system, LovTAP under promoters J23117, J23114, J23105 and RFP under J23102.
Only one colony of each co-transformation was used along the experiment and was tested under light and dark conditions.
TrpR mutant and wild type cells were co transformed using 5 µL of each plasmid (trpL-RFP in pSB1C3/ pSB1A2 and each LovTAP construction in pSB3K3). As controls RFP constitutively expressed under J23102 promoter was used and wild type cells transformed just with trpL-RFP. For each transformation one  tube containing 5 ml of  LB medium with Kanamicyn and chloramphenicol or Kanamicyn and ampicillin, was inoculated from a single colony of DH5α. Cultures were grown  overnight (~14hrs) at 37°C with spinning at 100rpm under blue light (470nm) conditions. Then"

Motivation
As every house needs a cornerstone, we need our binding protein library. The demand for easily accessible, fast adapting and specific binding proteins is ever-growing. To utilize the advantages of binding proteins for our project, a library adapted to the end-users (or more specific: our) needs, was designed by us.
When we were faced with the challenge of designing a binding protein library, earlier in 2016 year, we browsed existing iGEM projects and were surprised that we did not find preexisting examples for libraries. Actually - our investigation showed that our approach is unprecedented in this competition. Introducing and providing libraries of binding proteins therefore establishes a new entity in the iGEM BioBrick collection and provides new opportunities for the community. With our work we also hope to show how synthetic libraries can be in synthetic biology and pave the way for the usage of libraries in iGEM.
Overview
To generate the perfect binder an initial genetic library coding for binding proteins with a diversified binding-surface is essential for our project. Similar to the initial immune response this set of molecules forms the foundation for our in vivo mutagenesis system, which mimics the antibody maturation process.
We based our library layout on a"
Bielefeld-Germany,2013,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Labjournal#Molecular_-_-_TEXT.html," sure to work under a fume hood.
Do not work with protective gloves to prevent contamination of your sample with plasticizers.
Reaction tubes have to be cleaned with 60 % (v/v) CH3CN and 0.1 % (v/v) TFA. Afterwards the solution has to be removed completely followed by evaporation of the tubes under a fume hood. Alternatively microtiter plates from Greiner® (REF 650161) can be used without washing.
Cut out the protein lanes of a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE using a clean scalpel. Gel parts are transferred to the washed reaction tubes/microtiter plate. If necessary cut the parts to smaller slices.
Gel slices should be washed two times. Therefore add 200 µL 30 % (v/v) acetonitrile in 0,1 M ammonium hydrogen carbonate each time and shake lightly for 10 minutes. Remove supernatant and discard to special waste.
Dry gel slices at least 30 minutes in a Speedvac.
Rehydrate gel slices in 15 µL Trypsin-solution followed by short centrifugation.
Gel slices have to be incubated 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by incubation at 37 °C over night.
Dry gel slices at least 30 minutes in a Speedvac.
According to the size of the gel slice, add 5 - 20 µL 50 % (v/v) ACN / 0,1 % (v/v) TFA.
Samples can be used for MALDI measurement or stored at -20 °C.
Trypsin-solution: 1 µL Trypsin + 14 µL 10 mM NH4HCO3
Therefore solubilize lyophilized Trypsin in 200 µL of provided buffer and incubate for 15 minutes at 30 °C for activation. For further use it can be stored at -20 °C.

Add 1 µL HCCA matrix solution to the spotted sample aliquots. Pipet up and down approximately five times to obtain a sufficient mixing. Be careful not to contact the AnchorChip.
Note: Most of the sample solvent needs to be gone in order to achieve a sufficiently low water content. When the matrix solution is added to the previously spotted sample aliquot at a too high water content in the mixture, it will result in undesired crystallization of"

DNA Purification from Agarose Gel
This protocol is based on the Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System of Promega Corporation.
Excise a proper band containing the DNA from gel and place the excised gel slice in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.
Weigh the excised gel slice.
Add 10µL Membrane Binding Solution per 10 mg of gel slice. Vortex and incubate at 50-65 °C until gel slice is completely dissolved.
Insert the SV Minicolumn into the Collection Tube and label both of them according to the labelling of your samples.
Transfer the dissolved gel mixture to the Minicolumn assembly. Incubate the Minicolumn at room temperature for 1 minute.
Centrifuge the SV Minicolumn at maximum speed for 1 minute.
Discard the flow through and reinsert the SV Minicolumn into the Collection Tube.
Add 700µL of Membrane Wash Solution.
NOTE: Upon prior use, dilute the solution with 95% ethanol following the manufacturer's’ instructions.
Centrifuge the SV Minicolumn assembly at maximum speed for 1 minute.
Discard the flow through and reinsert the SV Minicolumn into the Collection Tube.
Repeat the washing step with 500µL of Membrane Wash Solution and centrifuge for 5 minutes at maximum speed.
Once the Collection Tube is empty, centrifuge the Minicolumn assembly at maximum speed for 1 minute with the Minicolumn assembly lid open to allow full evaporation of ethanol
NOTE: Leaving the column at room temperature ameliorates evaporation of residual ethanol traces.
Transfer the SV Minicolumn to a clean labelled 1.5mL Eppendorf tube.
Add 50µL of pre-warmed MilliQ directly to the centre of the SV Minicolumn, without touching the membrane with the pipette tip.
NOTE: Use 30µL when higher final concentrations of DNA are required or when small quantities of DNA are suspected.
Incubate the SV Minicolumn at room temperature for 5 minutes.
Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.
Discard the SV Minicolumn, cap the tube containing the eluted DNA, measure the DNA concentration and keep the DNA at 4 °C (for immediate use) or -20 °C (for storage).

It was my responsibility to troubleshoot together with María and the advisors, when experiments did not work out as expected. Furthermore, I designed experiments to characterize our biobricks according to literature. When I was not working in the lab, I helped Liza modelling the laser threshold.
María
Lab Manager
My role as a lab manager was to make sure that everything in the lab was ready (equipment, protocols...). Also, I have worked together with Lycka in the science and experimental design of the wet lab part of the project. At the beginning it would be us two in charge of figuring out everything we needed and how it worked and then passed it on to the rest of the core lab team members to be able to work as fast and efficiently as possible.
Tessa
Wiki Manager
As Wiki Manager my first and foremost responsibility was the design and content of the wiki. I designed our wiki according to our house style, created by Charlotte, and I uploaded most of the files. I also reminded others to write pieces for on the wiki, so I could create a page around it. What I really enjoined about being the Wiki Manger is the fact that it was my responsibility to make all the pages both clear and look nice. Therefore, I discussed with every Manger extensively how their page should look like and in that way I was always partly involved in all the parts of our project. Besides this I also spend a lot of time in the lab helping with the cloning of our biobricks and I worked on the InterLab study. I also went to modeling meetings and I helped Carmen with the policy & practice when I had the time.

The Keio strains are specific E. coli strains that express distinct gene knockouts; we worked with the ClpP knockout (JWO428-1), ClpX Knockout (JWO427-1) and the Keio Wild strains. However, due to time constraints, we were only able to grow and gain results for the ClpP strain.
Lauren Hong and Jack Kwon working in Georgia Tech lab over the summer to run through workflow with Monica McNerney
Given the physical and financial constraints of a high school laboratory, we didn’t have the luxury of using a fluorometer to quantify the relative strength of degradation in GFP molecules. Therefore, we used chromoproteins because they were visible to the naked eye. We exploited the chromoproteins’ stark visibility and constructed the ChromQ - a 3D printed “camera system” that feasibly quantifies the chromoproteins in a light-controlled chamber. After taking pictures of the chromoproteins inside the ChromQ light-chamber, we converted the pixels from the pictures into RGB values by using a commercial photo-editing software. In order to standardize chromoprotein expression, we used Roscolux filters to create a color chart that correlates with each degree of degradation in chromoproteins.
Panelists at Atlanta Science Festival Discussion
To deliver a more immediate impact outside the lab, we collaborated with numerous institutions to increase awareness of micronutrient deficiencies and synthetic biology in general. For example, we partnered with the Atlanta Science Festival to hold a discussion about the merits of GMOs. The discussion was lead by a team of professors from the University of Georgia, Emory University, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Georgia State University. Titled “GMOs or GMnos”, the discussion was held at GaTech and received over 100 participants. Moreover, we also hosted a workshop at the Building with Biology event at the Atlanta Maker Faire. We used this event as a venue to educate the public about DNA extraction and the recently discovered CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. We even collaborated with Next Generation Focus, a non-profit organization based in Forsyth County, to educate underprivileged students in Forsyth County about synthetic biology and biotechnology.

A freshman who dove straight into iGEM team during the first year of college with limited knowledge in synthetic biology experiments I can now handle the molecular cloning. It's huge progress for me! Outside lab I take delight in reading ancient Greece myth as well as running.
Yujie Liu is our youngest team member,and she’s studying Biotechnology in her 2rd year.She’s one of the main members of our team,she paticipates in constructing our main kit.She designed and cloned huge parts of the light-sensing part,also,she takes an active part in our human practice.Out side the lab she enjoys running,learning new things from different career like economy and art,and she’s really a friendly person.
I am MuTianchen and I am a junior student in the school of life science. Glad to meet everyone in this specific way. In iGEM, my job was to construct part of the Dental caries prevention circuit and help with the human practice . The work was heavy but also full of fun and inspiration. Me myself is a huge Sci-Fi buff and a fan of Coldplay——so for me the most interesting and relaxing activity outside the lab would be listening to the Violet Hill while traveling in the TARDIS … May the force be with you and enjoy the iGEM!

I am Yiran Shen, studying for my bachelor degree, as a number of the 2015 iGEM team at Wuhan University I am so exciting because I did a lot of new things and meet with lots of new friends here. At first, I interested in the dental caries, so with my team member we considered different ways to control and even cure the disease. Then I also worked with other to organize the human practice and also asked for the sponsors. During these process, I find myself not only a simply experimenter, but also a creative participant"

EPF_Lausanne,2014,Team:EPF Lausanne#Envelope stress responsive bacteria_-_-_TEXT.html," from the Michnick lab. After many PCR's and Gibson assemblies, we finally obtained our four constructs:
The four resulting strains were stressed with KCl (a known stressor for the Cpx pathway) and analysed on a plate reader to understand how CpxR dimerized. The experiment planned an initial period of 24 minutes without stress, addition of KCl at the 24th minute, followed by 2 hours of reading. To get more information about this experiment and its results check out this page.
Activation and deactivation of the signal
After having shown that we were able to activate the Cpx pathway, we set forth to accomplish our second objective: prove that the system can be activated and shut down quickly.
The experiment plan was to read IFP emission for 20 minutes without stress, and then stress our functional strain ( BBa_K1486056 ) with various concentrations of KCl. After the two hours of stress, we planned to centrifuge our cells for 10 min and put them into non-stressful media to continue signal reading for two more hours.
Check out the results for this experiment! The signal drops in an impressive way.
Localisation of CpxR - split IFP1.4 within E.coli
Having characterised the temporal dynamics of the CpxR dimerization, we proceeded to spatial analysis of our construct. In this experiment we aimed to address our third objective: prove that our system can provide spatial information on the sub-localisation of the protein within bacteria. Samples of stressed cells (80 mM of KCl) were put on a glass slide and observed under a microscope with appropriate filter. On top of giving us precise information on the localization of our proteins, this experiment allowed us to see a difference between stressed and non-stressed cells in terms of signal activation. Check out the results for this experiment here!

Activation of CpxR on microfluidic chip by chamber crushing
To prove that our strain of engineered bacteria is suitable for the development of BioPad we aimed to verify that we were able to activate the system by mechanical stress on a microfluidic chip. Thanks to our SmashColi chip, we applied stress by activating buttons at a pressure of 25 psi. Check out the results for this experiment here!

July
We had a meeting with SZU-China on 19th July just after deciding the project. They made a banner especially for us and gave us a warm welcome. We presented two projects in sequence and gave each other valuable suggestions.
It’s their first time to join in the whole iGEM family, so we then talked about the experience in establishing an iGEM team and doing project.
August
The Second Conference
We attended the 2nd iGEM Conference held by NCTU_Formosa. In the conference, every team had 20 minutes to present their projects and 10-minnute Q&A section. The professors and iGEMers present gave many suggestions to the team which was doing presentation. And we also had poster section to explain our projects to iGEMers who are interested face to face. We had a great time there and learned a lot from other teams. We developed deep friendship with other teams and kept in touch closely since then.
Meet up in SUSTC
SCUT and Shenzhen_SFLS (High School Division) came to SUSTC on 26th August. Everyone had an opportunity to introduce himself briefly. We did presentations and communicated a lot about team running. Then we showed them our lab and went for a short tour in our campus.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," sensing communication stages. The quorum sensing mechanism used here is the acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) system in gram negative bacteria. This system works by one cell producing a quorum sensing molecule which can diffuse out through its membrane. Once the extracellular space reaches a certain threshold concentration of AHL molecule, the AHL will begin to diffuse into other cells in the community. If the cell the AHL molecule enters has the appropriate transcription factor present (e.g. LasR for the C12 AHL), then transcription of a gene under the control of the pLas promoter can occur. Therefore, if background expression of the AHL is high enough to reach above the threshold level, then expression of the next quorum sensing molecule in another cell (in this case C4 AHL) will occur. By reducing the amount of detector and processor cells present in the system, the background expression levels of C12 and C4 will be lower, and hence expression of sfGFP by the reporter cell will be lower.
Qualitative test with chromoproteins expression. In order to check the performance of the Sensynova device in terms of modularity, cultures of IPTG detector, processor unit and 3 different reporter modules carrying two chromoproteins ( BBa_K2205016 , BBa_K2205018 ) and sfGFP ( BBa_K2205015 ) were inoculated and grown overnight in LB+Chloramphenicol (12,5ng/ul). The day after the cultures were diluted at OD600: 0,1 and mixed together to obtain co-cultures with ratio 1:1:1 and 1:1:13. Some samples were supplemented with 1mM IPTG to induce the expression of quorum sensing molecules and eventually achieve the chromoproteins visualisation (Figures 10, 11, 12).

After sharing our progress and experimental design, they would like to offer us additional help in refining experiments.
In addition, during the poster session,                             we visited several team booths and provided advice to their project interpretations in casual conversation.
Eurasian Meetup
On July 25, 7 members of our team went to Shenzhen to attend the iGEM2018 Asia-Europe Meeting held by BGI-CHINA and TU Delft.                             After three days, we are gratified that our design ideas have been recognized by friends from all over the world.                             During the presentation and poster session, we received a lot of support from other university’s iGEM teams.                             There were professors from TU Deft, one of the organizers,                             who provided valuable experience and ideas for teams participating iGEM. At the same time, we, fortunately,                             had personal guidance from one of the professors during the break,                             which benefits to made adjustments to the integrity of the experiment.                             It is worth mentioning that this participation laid the foundation for our cooperation with the University of Hong Kong.                             They are also committed to the design of the carrier and we are paying attention to each other. After the meeting,                             we will continue to discuss technical questions about the experiment and explore the common development of our two projects.

The DLS measurements using the same techniques do not overlap at all, which indicates either an experimental                     error or a mistake with the handling of the cell-free expression. Because of that no conclusions can be drawn from these measurements.
Plasmid construction (HexaHistidine Encapsulin with C-terminus BsaI cut sites)
The sfGFP coding insert was amplified and gel extracted (left), and the encapsulin containing plasmids had their backbones linearized through PCR (right).
The bands were then gel extracted and a Golden Gate assembly using the Esp3I type IIs restriction enzyme was used to build the construct with BsaI cut sites.
Incorporation of the OT1 coding sequence into our platform
We then wished to test our platform by inserting a peptide sequence in the C-terminus cutsite. We chose to insert the coding sequence of the peptide OT-1, a well-characterized epitope of the protein OVA (Ovalbumin). Indeed, the last step                   of our vaccine characterization would be to perform dendritic cell assay in order to assess the vaccine’s immunogenicity. One of the assay is to check if the right peptide is presented on MHC I molecules by the dendritic cells. This                   requires antibody targeting the peptide/MHC I molecule complex. Such antibodies are commercially available for OT1.
Encapsulin-OT1 cell-free expression and purification
Figure 10: SDS-PAGE gel after coomassie staining. B: before heat purification S: supernatant of the sample after heat purification
Before and after purification, we see a high molecular weight band in the HexaHistidine Encapsulin-OT1 lanes that are similar to the ones in the non-modified HexaHistidine Encapsulin lanes. This is a good indication of expression and proper                   assembly of our product.
Encapsulin-OT1 mass spec
Figure 11: The gel was stained with Coomassie blue and then given to the Proteomics Core Facility, where the two bands shown surrounded by squares were excised.
All manipulations after this step were not performed by us according to Protocol
The Proteomics Core Facility then washed the gel we provided, reduced and alkylated it, digested the proteins using trypsin and extracted the peptides to perform MALDI-TOF mass spec. The analysis of the results was also performed by the                   facility and we were provided the peptide sequence alignments onto the HexaHistidine Encapsulin"

To test whether our modified e-coli(transformed with dispersin B and lysostephin circuit ) has influence on biofilm growth, we designed function test under two situation in 24 well.
First one is to co-culture streptococcus mutans and modified e-coli for24hr and do biofilm growth assay. The other one is to culture streptococcus mutans for 12hr and then treat with modified e-coli for 12hr and do biofilm growth assay.  Also, we compare the streptococcus mutans growth situation in BHI solution with or without sucrose. We used crystal violet stain to do biofilm grow assay.
Indicated from the table, we could conclude that under no sucrose, modified e-coli has a great effect on decreasing biofilm formation. Co-culture decreasing rate is up to 64.2% and treat decreasing rate is 51.9% .On the other hand, solution with sucrose will has the bad impact on depleting biofilm, causing low decreasing rate. Overall, we could dedicate that modified e-coli has a good effect on decreasing biofilm formation or depleting biofilm.

Leu-Lock: Synthetic Translational Control
Synthetic biology is a burgeoning field that blends interdisciplinary concepts from the fields of engineering and inquiry biology. Eons of evolutionary development have conceived intricate biological systems whose complex efficiencies are inimitable. Rather than attempt to mimic these systems, synthetic biologists aim to understand and redesign biological pathways.refReference:
Biello, David. ""Genetically Modified Crop on the Loose and Evolving in U.S. Midwest."" Scientific American. N.p., 06 Aug. 2010. Web. 08 Oct. 2016. These “biological devices” can be implemented to address needs in industries like polymer manufacturing, environmental welfare, pharmaceutical synthesis, and agricultural nutrient enrichment. The field carries critical innovations; but many have yet to be implemented.
Public opinion surrounding genetically engineered organisms (GEOs) is less than savory. Much of this stigma resides in a media fog stemming from corporate intellectual property scandals during the late 2000s.refReference:
""Monsanto vs Farmer."" The Grand Disillusion. N.p., 23 Apr. 2009. Web. 14 Oct. 2016. refReference:
""Schmeisers Battle for the Seed."" Schmeiser's Battle for the Seed. Institute of Science in Society, n.d. Web. 14 Oct. 2016. Certain corporations leaked modified seeds into other farms, and preceded to sue those farms for ownership of their crops. This act created a misattributed criticism of GEO crops themselves.  However, concerns about environmental and human health are warranted. Mainly, we do not know enough about long term GEO applications to know what effects they will have on human health or larger ecosystems.refReference:
Department of Health and Human Services (2016). NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (National Institute of Health).
Our assessment of GEO health effects is limited by time; we simply must wait for mammalian studies to run their course. For example, benefactors of the Golden Rice Project, an enriched grain used to mitigate vitamin A deficiency in South America, provide a data set of GEO consumers whose health can be observed for years to come.refReference:

Schloss Mickeln
Our university is not just a place of teaching, but also a place of research. This research is normally conducted by each professor and his or her team on their own, but in some cases there are cross-field projects. At the Heinrich Heine University, many of these projects are organized by the professors themselves and preliminary ideas are discussed in meetings, organized by the science dean when and if needed at an old estate from the 18th century called „Schloss Mickeln“.
This time, our team had the privilege to be able to attend one of these meetings and not only be there when our predecessors introduced their work to the professors, but also be privy to the future plans of the Computer Science departments in regards to their capabilities to help with the progress of the Synthetic Life Sciences at our university.
This opened the floor for a discussion of our project and allowed for a spirited discussion about our plans, our view point and approach and what would hopefully be our results. In this discussion it became evident that there was, at that point, a high scientific appeal, but our real world application was not yet clear."

Modularity and Standardization
As functional DNA in iGEM has been rarely mentioned we want to introduce it to iGEM. We want to provide standard parts that everyone can use to make the work with functional DNA and also RNA accessible for the whole community. To simplify RNA work we designed a new BBF RFC 110 to standardize the processes necessary for this.
Standard for RNA work
RFC 110
Overview of BBF RFC 110
The coloning into RFC 110 is performed without restiction sites to avoid problems with consered restriction sites in functional sequences. We provide primers to linearize the plasmid in a two step PCR. Furthermore we provide 5' and 3'  extension sequences that have to be added to the insert. These extensions carry the homology that is needed for CPEC or Gibson Assembly. Plasmid can be transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3 for in vivo experiments or plamids can be use as template for in vitro RNA transcription. Alternatively another set of Primers is provided for extraction of a DNA template for in vitro transcription.
This new BBF RFC 110 is very important for the work with RNA as the cloning strategy does not rely on any restriction site. We designed it this way because if you work with a functional RNA the sequence is extremely essential. In most cases the sequence is laboriously optimized with several cycles of SELEX. If the functional RNA contains a cut sites usually one cannot simply mutate it as it is possible for proteins. Any mutation alters the effector sequence directly and thus can have severe effects on the functionality.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#article#genet_-_-_TEXT.html,", obesity, at this current stage of scientific research is not considered an incurable disease. In fact, many people do not even consider obesity as a disease. The severity of obesity, nonetheless, is slowly being recognized by the scientific community and, in June 2013, the American Medical Association decided to classify obesity as a disease (Dailey, 2013).
Application of gene therapy for our project is indeed an invasive method to treat obesity. Presently, many people will be reluctant to use this method unless obesity and its complications are life threatening (Yu, 2013). On the contrary, other methods currently used to cure diseases such as medicine and surgery are also invasive. The difference is that these invasive techniques have gained enough trust from public through clinical trials and tests. If gene therapy becomes safer and publicly accepted and if the severity of obesity constantly increases, the use of our project through gene therapy does not seem very improbable in the future.
Conclusion
Gene therapy is a promising method to cure diseases. Although the public currently has doubts about it, scientists are eagerly trying to make it safer and more efficient. In the future, when gene therapy becomes more accepted by the public, we speculate that this method would begin to be applicable for obesity, as more and more people recognize the severity and pathology of obesity.

I joined the Calgary iGEM team after completing my first-year at the UofC and spending the summer with the team has been quite a thrill. The field of synthetic biology is really dynamic and I have been involved mainly in the design and construction of the desulfurization components in the conversion of NAs to useful hydrocarbons, as well as in developing an integrated human practices element to the project.

I'm wrapping up my fourth year in Bioinformatics, which means that once I graduate, I will pretend to know both biology and computer science. In reality, the only computer science I can probably do is HTML, and so my primary work this year was building this wiki. And drawing cute things. This is my third year in iGEM, against the advice and concerns of my friends and family physician. In my ""spare time"" I draw, do karate, and sleep (a dying art).
Rai Chaudhuri
Hello! My name is Rai and although I am not a current student, nor have I been a part of iGEM in the past I do bring a wealth of experience to our team. This comes from my graduation from NASA's space program, my brief career as an Olympic race walker, and of course my adventures as a pirate in Indonesia. These pursuits were all on a purely volunteer basis, as I refuse to accept money for anything I do or buy for someone. Ever. From this point I moved into the wonderful world of academia where I received my PhD on the effects of caffeine overdose on my own giggliness from Western Arkansas Agricultural State College of Technology in 2009. My talents include excellent presentation skills, parafilming, mind reading, miniprepping, and generally being awesome. My only real weakness is a paralyzing fear I have of public transit vehicles (ZOMG BUSSSSS!!1!!1) when I am"

The System
The Uppsala iGEM team of 2009 is trying to produce alcohols, specifically ethanol and isobutanol, in the Cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp PCC6803. in the butanol approach we really only have one controllable variable which is the expression level of the enzymes in the pathway making this uninteresting to model. For the ethanol we do however have two variables which we can control as we're not only expressing enzymes aimed at a specific reaction but are also trying to increase the substrate levels for that reaction. In order to accomplish this we are trying two ways to inhibit the PDC, one protein mediated inhibition, the pirAB proteins, and one antisense RNA mediated.
We will here try to supply a model for the ethanol production in Synechcystis.
Modelling of Ethanol Production
The system as modelled below, excerpt and simplification of this Schematic View
In order to be able to model the system under the restraints mentioned above we have made some basic assumptions:
1. Co-evolution of the of the ethanol producing pathway, this making Km and kcat highly similar for the pdc and Adh2.
This assumption is quite logic as these enzymes comes from the same metabolic pathway in the native organism. In practice this assumption makes it possible for us to model the system as a knowing the characteristics of only one of the enzymes, making characterisation easier.
2. Assuming quasi steady state (Michaelis Menten Kinetics), that is constant total enzyme  and substrate concentration.
This is reasonable during log-phase when cell volumes are constant and before ethanol starts to inhibit growth.
Assumption #2 leads to equation (a) (a)
Where e is the amount of free enzyme and es is the amount of enzyme bound to substrate and e0 being the total concentration of enzyme.
Assumption #2 also gives equation (b) being simply the expression for the change of substrate  concentrations over time, that is influx minus outflux. If we assume constant substrate concentration as in #2"

The bio-reporter organism will be deployed at fish-farms where fishes continuously die as a result of the bio-accumulation of heavy-metals inside them. This can cause staggering financial losses to farm owners or those who deal in fishery.

Macquarie_Australia,2012,Team:Macquarie Australia#Project#background_-_-_TEXT.html," activities. The phytochrome naturally exists in the inactive state (Pr) where it can absorb red light, and in this state, the absorbance of the phytochrome causes the cell to appear blue. After it absorbs red light it undergoes a conformational change to the far-red state (Pfr) . This is known as the active form, and absorbs light at a wavelength that causes it to appear green, thus changing the colour of the cell.  When, the cell is irradiated with far-red light then it is able to isomerise back to the Pr form (Rockwell et al., 2009).
In this way we produce a reversible switch that enables the control of the colour of E. coli. If the cell is irradiated with red light it appears a green colour, hit it with far red light and appears a blue colour. The switch is controlled simply by light and due to this there is significant potential for differential expression of two different kinase pathways. There is also the advantage of a clear detection mechanism, which would be useful as a reporter gene .
The bacteriophytochromes of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Deinococcus radiodurans are able to be excited by two different wavelengths of red light. So if we stimulate E. coli with different wavelengths of light we can activate different biochemical pathways. This is the long term goal of the project. We hope to control two competing biochemical pathways with little lag time using a reversible switch (Auldridge and Forest, 2011, Bellini and Papiz, 2012).
The bacteriophytochrome vector will be transformed into E. coli competent BL21 (DE3) cells, which contain the T7 RNA polyermase for the expression of T7 promoter regulated operons. As E. coli do not contain a native heme oxygenase gene, it must be incorporated into the final assembled operon construct along with a T7 promoter and the bacteriophytochrome genes from Deinococcus and Agrobacterium for the ""light switch"" to be self-assembled and functional.

A bunch of energetic young guys bumping into each other in pursuit of the truth of life, and this is basically the essential reason why we are here now.
This year, we are much more populated than before. This not only gets solid proof from the increasing coverage of participants' number, but also can be demonstrsted by the big variance among participants' backgrounds. The 2009 iGEM team of USTC, well, if we just count the dry team, consists of two graduate students and four undergraduates. Our major varies from  electrnic engineering to condensed matter physics, from geophysics to computational biology. By such a colorful combination, anything exciting could be possible relying on our brotherhood. We feel so lucky to get acquaintance with each other and really enjoy all the funny days we are together. We will enjoy the days in MIT, just join us!

The NRP-EUA-Norwich team send us the MoClo Flipper Constructs designed by the 2014 NRP-UEA (BBa_K1467100, BBa_K1467100, BBa_K1467200, BBa_K 1467300 and BBa_K1467400). Thanks to these plasmids we were able to convert easily our GoldenBraid parts to BioBricks. In addition, we improve the characterization of this parts. Finally, they sent us four parts tagged with YFP (BBa_K1618029, BBa_K1618030, BBa_K1618031 and BBa_K16118032). They are acyltranferases candidates with the aim to acylate starch fused to YFP,  that makes them an expression construct
We transformed their parts into Agrobacterium tumefaciens. After two days we make a subculture. Next day we infiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana leaves; after four days we took samples and imaged them on a confocal microscope. We observed them localized in the cloroplasts as expected.

Then, an acyl-homoserine latone (AHL), 3OC12HSL from LasI in CELL-B will bind with LasR, lighting the green fluorescence and inducing the expression of LuxI, who synthesize 3OC6HSL. C6 accumulates in the culture and permeates into CELL-B, where it binds with LuxR. This process activates the expression of TetR and CFP, and therefore, represses LasI to produce C12.
Let’s have a review of the principle of oscillation, that is, A induces B, B represses B2, and B2 induces A, forming a feedback network with a delay part. Corresponding to the network is the three lines of gene, based on the interactions of C6/Lux, C12/Las and TetR/aTc.
When the concentration of C12 is high and C6 is low in the very beginning, luxI is intended to produce C6. As C6 mounts up, tetR starts to restrain the expression of C12. Then, under a certain rate of degradation, C12 decreases, resulting in the same decrease of C6. Once C6 is less than the threshold, tetR stops repression, and C12 is generated again. All in all, the oscillation begins.
3. Project Highlights
Several oscillation systems have been established by scientists, and our ECHO is not alone. But we must say that, ECHO is special and, to some extent, unique. So, besides the basic functions of an oscillator, what else can our system achieve?
In our expectation, ECHO is not just a single oscillator. Parameters that determine the property of an oscillation is the period and the phase, and we hope to maneuver each of the three independently.
The period of the cycle is up to the reaction rate. Suggest we want to elongate the period, so we need to slow down the rate. In our system, we use aTc to generate a delay. The molecule aTc will bind with TetR once it’s added into the culture, which results in the anti-repression of Line B2, thus, much more time is needed for the procedure. In that way, we realize a longer period.
As for the phase adjustment, we focus on the accumulation of AHLs and try to change the degradation. We design an extra gene, pBad, to generate AHLs under commands. When promoter pBad is activated by arabinose, C12 is produced to counteract the degradation. That delay a certain"

Future Generation Products
Future generation products will include measurement sensors for specific toxic compounds such as naphthenic acids and hydrocarbons. These sensors will report to the user on the type and amount of that compound present.
Product Design
The technology contains two components: disposable cartridges that will hold the sample and “sensing” bacteria, and the detector (Figure 1). The cartridges will contain microorganisms designed to demonstrate detection of toxins by producing enzymes capable of changing analyte compounds so that they can be detected electrochemically (Figure 2).  The detector device contains all of the circuitry necessary to read the electrochemical output from the bacterial strain and transmit it to a computer.
Figure 1: Overview of our technology
Data can be collected through a variety of inputs whether direct connections on site (USB) or wirelessly through cellular and existing data networks on-site.  Additionally, measurements can be linked to specific geospatial positions using GPS technology. Bringing it all together we envision our system integrating within current data management systems already in use in the oil sands in addition to providing our own cloud computing based system.
To date, we have generated a microbial strain that is able to detect three relevant oil sands toxins: naphthenic acids, carbazole, and dibenzothiophene. We are marketing this as a biosensor for general toxicity. We have demonstrated the output of the detector as being able to alter analyte compounds so that they may be detected electrochemically. Furthermore we are working to demonstrate that we can detect simultaneously active output signals, where more than one compound can be detected at a time. We currently have a proof-of-concept technology for detecting oil sands toxins.
As we are refining the techniques to optimally detect toxins with the microbial strain, we are developing a prototype of the system that will be sold commercially and will ultimately be used by clients for field tests. On this front we are working closely with manufacturers to design our final product.
Detailed Description of the Technology
Sensing Microorganism:
To obtain an organism that may respond to petroleum toxins, we performed a transposon screen. This biological screen inserts the genetic sequence of a reporting protein (the enzyme β-galactosidase) into random locations of the test organism's DNA. The purpose is to put the reporter in a region that the host organism uses to survive the toxicity of petroleum toxins because this way it would ""tell us"" that those chemicals are present (Figure 2).

To validate our idea, we conducted a survey, which was attended by many iGEM teams and asked about his opinion regarding our idea of ​​conceiving this project.
The answers were favorable, and the vast majority of the teams, supported our idea, albeit with some controversy involved. With the results of the survey, we decided to write the code taking into account the issues that teams thought they should be, and leaving aside those who did not receive much support in the response.
So our code consists of:

How Much Do You Know about Antibacterial Resistance
Before our report, let me show you some information from World Health Organization. ( http://www.who.int/topics/drug_resistance/en/ ).
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change in ways that render the medications used to cure the infections they cause ineffective. When the microorganisms become resistant to most antimicrobials they are often referred to as ""superbugs"". This is a major concern because a resistant infection may kill, can spread to others, and imposes huge costs to individuals and society.
April 30th, 2014, WHO releases a latest report ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE Global Report on Surveillance( http://www.who.int/drugresistance/publications/infographic-antimicrobial-resistance-20140430.pdf?ua=1 ),which introduces the situation of antimicrobial resistance around the world. Based on the data provided by 114 countries, the report indicates that Antimicrobial Resistance in particular antibacterial resistance (ABR) becomes a global problem and every have to pay attention to it. No matter Who you are or Where you are.
On the basis of knowledge we mastered, the most effective way to cope with antibacterial resistance is to exploit new antibiotics, which is the inspiration of our project Programmed Polyketide Synthesis.
Therefore, we make the survey How Much Do You Know about Antibacterial Resistance, in order to have a general overview about how the public uses antibiotics and judge is it necessary to exploit new antibiotics. Besides, we also broadcast the concepts of Antibacterial Resistance and Synthetic Biology and teach the ordinary citizens how to use antibiotics exactly( http://www.sojump.com/jq/3851816.aspx ).

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"egrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant"

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Project#Glucosemodel#MeS#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," combined with the proper promoter dependence. It is even near impossible without good wet-lab data.
A recent review by Shiue and Prather (2012) describes this problem in the following way: “due to the large sequence space and relative lack of understanding regarding polymerase-promoter interactions, the development of such predictive models remains a daunting task”. Also recent discussions on stochastic gene expression suggest that reliable, quantitative predictions of mRNA production are a daunting task.
In the past, many iGEM teams predicted their transcription rate using a formula introduced by NTU-Singapore in 2008 :
We fear that this formula is not a proper representation of transcription rate for a number of reasons :
The reference claiming an average transcription speed of 70 nt/s is no longer available. We tried to search for an average transcription rate ourselves and we can’t seem to find realistic values.
This formula does not take into account promoter strength. This is remarkable, because the strength of a promoter is a measure for how many times a transcript is initiated. (Watson et al., Molecular Biology of the Gene, 7th edition). The stronger your promoter, the more transcripts are initiated, the more the gene is transcribed in time and thus the higher transcription rate.
Gene length, aka the number of nucleotides involved, could influence transcription rate. The longer the gene, the higher the chance that the polymerase starts proofreading, slowing down the transcription rate. We did not find any reference in literature incorporating gene length as an important transcription rate parameter.
Summarized, we would strongly suggest to other iGEM teams to refrain from using this formula, because it is not a realistic representation of the transcription rate.
In our case, we observed most uncertainty in the transition from transcription to mRNA production. As an alternative to the modelled mRNA production step, we tried to determine in vivo mRNA concentrations using qPCR. This means that we will drop formulas [1.A] and [1.B]. If you want to know more on how we tackled the qPCR, please go to our WETLAB part .
Translation:
Initiation is usually the most important rate-determining step of the translation process (McCarthy and Gualerzi, 1990). Combined with the fact that there is a negligible chance for premature disassembly of the ribosome and mRNA, only the rate of translation initiation has to be known to determine the rate of translation .
The initiation codon, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the identity of the base at position -3 and the occurrence of alternative ATGs (that do not serve as an initiation codon)"

It was observed that after 60 minutes of incubation and subsequent spermine addition, no coacervates were formed in the tube containing activated Cas13a. On the other hand, if spermine was added to the tube with inactive Cas13a, coacervates did form (see Figure 23).
We can conclude that it is possible to prove the presence or absence of a certain RNA target with the naked eye using the CINDY Seq method. This conclusion can be drawn after at least 45 minutes of incubation, but preferably after 60 minutes (see Figure 24).
Figure 23: CINDY Seq gives a result within the hour. This figure shows the difference in turbidity between solution with and without RNA target after 0 minutes and after 60 minutes of incubation. It is directly visible to the naked eye that when activated Cas13a is given 60 minutes, it is able to cleave the polyU to such an extent that it no longer forms coacervates. As a control, also inactive Cas13a was incubated with polyU and did not show cleavage of polyU to the extent where coacervation no longer occurred. The tubes in which spermine was added after 0 minutes serves as a control.
Figure 24: Animated GIF showing the readout of CINDY seq at different timepoints. Mixes with active and inactive Cas13a and 0.1 wt% polyU were kept at 37  °C and supplemented with spermine (to final concentration of 1.0 wt%) at various timepoints. Previous experiments have shown that presence of 1.0 wt% spermine does not allow Cas13a to become active. At the first three timepoints (0, 15 and 30 min), coacervation is still visible in both tubes, indicating that there is still sufficient long polyU to coacervate. However, after 45 min and beyond, a clear solution can be observed in the mix containing active Cas13a, meaning that enough polyU has been cleaved.
Conclusions
Here we have proven that the ability of Cas13a to collaterally cleave RNA can be combined with the formation of coacervates of long polymers into an easy and cheap detection method. By incubating Cas13a for one hour at 37 °C in solution with 0.1 wt% polyU and subsequently adding spermine to a final concentration of 1.0 wt% the presence or absence of the RNA target can be proven.

- E. coli TG1 strain with des operon ( BBa_K1951011 ) before and after induction. (You can observe the production of the 4 proteins on the figure on the right; left : before induction, right : after induction)
Results showed the production of the 4 proteins DesA, DesB, DesC and DesD, all involved in the desferrioxamine B biosynthesis pathway.
Proof of fonctionnality
We investigated if DesA (Lysine decarboxylase) was fonctionnal by measurement of cadaverine using HPLC with C18 column and we proved that our biobrick allows the production of DesA which enables to produce the cadaverine and makes it fonctionnal.
Investigation of the cadaverine production by the lysine decarboxylase DesA. The cadaverin production has been detected by HPLC using C18 column after induction of the des genes. Different backgrounds were analysed : wild type Escherichia coli TG1 strain (yellow column), cadA mutant from Keio bank (blue column), complemented cadA mutant from Keio bank with pdesA ( BBa_K1951004 ) (orange column), complemented cadA mutant from Keio bank with des operon ( BBa_K1951011 ) (grey column).
Results showed cadaverine detection in the wild type meaning the original strain well produces the cadaverine.
In cadA mutant from Keio bank, cadaverine was also produced in a least quantity showing that an other pathway is responsible for the production of cadaverine (existence of an other constitutive lysine decarboxylase in the E. coli genome.
In the cadA mutant complemented by pdesA ( BBa_K1951004 ), the amount of cadaverine was recovered and even beyond the wild type production.
Moreover, in the cadA mutant complemented by the des operon ( BBa_K1951011 ), the cadaverine level produced was even over the wild type and complemented Bba_K1951004 production. We explain this result because of the higher stability of this big composite part.
To conclude, we made a big composite part able to produce every proteins involved in the biosynthetic pathway of the desferrioxamine B.

Meet Tiffany Dang
Heyos mayos! My name is Tiffany Dang. This fall I will be attending the Schulich School of Engineering at the University of Calgary for a degree in chemical and biomedical engineering.I joined iGEM again because I continue to be intrigued with its novelty. Genetic engineering combines scientific research, engineering principles and imagination to find a new perspective to currently unsolvable problems. iGEM has given me the experience to be a part of this process while making friends along the way. Outside of iGEM, I like being active playing rugby, racquet sports, hiking, and rock climbing.

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,". The biosensor system will be done through the construction of tanks in series, where the first bacterium will be able to detect mercury (merRTP + GFP), the second bacteria with the construction merRTP + MerA will be able to vaporize the mercury, which is captured and subsequently precipitated, the third tank will make the bacteria capable of bioaccumulation of mercury (merRTP + MBP) remaining in the effluent and in the fourth tank will be again a new detection of mercury by biosensoring bacteria  to prove the efficiency of the system, if there is still mercury the effluent is sent to the merRTP+merA bacteria, so that all mercury is removed.
Figure 7. Our future goal is to make the system work in tanks.
The cases of exposure to high doses involving intoxication by MeHg  gived the birth to offspring with severe neurological disorders such as mental retardation, deafness, blindness, cerebral palsy, cerebellar ataxia, strabismus, dysarthria, among others. Poisoning by high levels of MeHg is rare nowadays. Although quantities of mercury above the national average has been found in the hair of the local population, which indicates that the risk of contamination by this metal is real and needs to be fought. The reason of that is the accumulation of mercury through the food chain, especially in its methylated form in fish, which has a direct effect on the lives of the local population.
The growth of gold extraction in the Amazon caused a seriously problem in the environment, the caracteristic of mercury to accumulate in organic organisms makes it last for years. It is most commom to find mines in the nascente of rivers, because of that, the mercury flows with the river and can get to the metropolitan area. Also, the fish is getting mercury by eating particles of this metal and by the water contamination. Fish is the main font of protein to the local population, people are eating mercury without knowing!!
A way to know more or less the quantity of Mercury in the organism is by screening the hair composition, and, doing that, was discovered that the concentration of these metals in the hair of children in Manaus is higher than average of other regions in the country. After ingestion of contaminated food, about 95% of MeHg are absorbed quite rapidly in gastro-intestinal tract through alternative forms linked to a tiol residues in aminoacids formed. Once adsorbed and into the bloodstream just over 90% of MeHg is inside the red blood cells in a ratio of approximately 10-"

Judging Criteria
Over the course of putting together our iGEM project, we have kept all goals in mind that may qualify us for a Gold Award Medal.  In this section, we would like to directly address all the medal requirements listed on the iGEM Judging Criteria list .
Bronze Medal Requirements
Register the team, have a great summer, and have fun attending the Jamboree
Shortly before the beginning of this past summer, we successfully registered our iGEM team.  We've also already booked our flight to the Jamboree!
Successfully complete and submit a Project Summary form
A few weeks into the summer, we submitted a Project Summary form to iGEM summarizing our project.
Create and share a Description of the team's project via the iGEM wiki
This year, our team attempted to complete 3 individual projects: the Spatial Oscillator, the pH Sensor and the computational tool CPOTATo.  A detailed description of all 3 of these projects are available on the Projects Page

Simplifying the RP4 plasmid
For example the IncPa plasmid RP4, a thorough sequence analysis of the gene products of the transfer regions Tra1 and Tra2 revealed typical features of mainly inner membrane proteins,[2] both of which contribute to Mpf.
Our aim is get a simpler conjugation plasmid. So we will choose another plasmid in IncPa .After getting the tra1 aPnd tra2 part from the plasmid RP4,we can ligate the two parts with the new plasmid backbone.
Replace the plasmid backbone
As described in the project page, we have successfully constructed the double plasmid system in the E.coli. Then we have tested our plasmid, and the mini plasmid works well. However we hope to find the most suitable plasmid backbone, it has a broad-host-range.
The following is our requirements:
First, because of the plasmid incompatibility, we want to use more incompatible plasmid to replace the original mini plasmid backbone.
Second, the plasmid must be high copy.
Third, the plasmid backbone is short.
Finally, it has reporter gene.
When we get a suitable plasmid backbone, we will do more tests and verify its conjugation capability.
Conjugating various types of recipient bacterium
In our project, the conjugation of recipient bacteria is a very important part. We plan to try more recipient. For example, we have made conjugation test between E.coli and E.coli, E.coli and Vibrio harveyi.
We consider a Broad-host-rang is very significant for future application, such as environment and healthy.
In the future , we will try many Gram-negative, After test, we can get more data and have a very good analysis of conjugation. Finally we will make a list about the host range.

IISc-Bangalore,2017,Team:IISc-Bangalore#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," session, where audience members posed questions and gave constructive criticism to each team. Our team members participated enthusiastically in these sessions, leaping to ask questions and discuss the intricacies of all the projects — a huge variety of synthetic biology applications were presented, and this led to new insights for every team that attended this event.
It wasn't all work and no play though — evenings were spent sampling local cuisines at an authentic Marathi restaurant and enjoying ice cream at Cream Stone as a group! The iGEM India Meet-Up is sure to become an annual tradition — who knows, we may host it next year!
Ice cream time!
The iGEM India Meet also made the community aspect of science very apparent to us: it gave us the opportunity to present our idea for a collaboration to many teams — to gather large amounts of data for our machine learning algorithm for analyzing haemocytometry images. Many hands make light work!
GCODe Mini Assembly
Our iGEM Hardware Outreach involved talking to professors, PhD students, undergraduates and random IISc visitors across fields ranging from optics to electronics to pathology. We learned many useful things, (some of which appear on our Hardware Evolution page) and understood what a difference GCODe would make.
Once we were done writing up the documentation for the GCODe Mini, we needed to know how easy it would be for someone else to build. Sure, the documentation looked complete to us, but that's because we already knew how to build it! There would definitely be lots of little things that seemed obvious to us, but would leave anyone else confused. There was only one way to find out - make someone build it! We invited Arpit Behera, a college freshman at IISc, to build the Mini from the instructions you see on the wiki.
We gave Arpit all the parts he needed, laser-cut and soldered, and a link to our Construction Manual .
He managed to build the GCODe Mini in less than two hours!
Arpit's detailed notes on how our manual could be improved
Although this was extremely gratifying, Arpit did have lots of feedback for us on where he found the manual difficult to understand, and which parts could be improved further. This helped us make the manual for the Mini much more comprehensive and user-friendly.
""Assembling a device of this complexity is always a tedious and frustrating task, but the Mini Construction Manual made it a lot easier. Getting to use the revised version would have been even better!"" - Arpit

Northwestern,2013,Team:Northwestern#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," spent time identifying genes that were activated at high levels due to a pH shift. We focused on the asr (acid-shock rna) gene and the gadA genes. Their promoters should be pH-inducible. Moreover, a past iGem team from Wisconsin-Madison has already isolated the gadA promoter.
Over the long weekend, no growth was shown on the 7/3 transformation, indicating that our SOB was not the problem. Three lab members independently performed a transformation to test competency of cells prepared on 7/2 using a pUC19 plasmid. The transformations were tested on both Cb and Lb plates. Additionally, our TA Jessica independently ran a transformation testing our cells, plates, and SOB.
Day 17, July 9
Success! Our TA has indicated that our cells are competent comparable with her Dr. Jewett’s lab. She realized that the plates we thought were Amp were actually Cm, and this could be the reason why some of our transformations are failing. Our SOB and cells are fine. We also had an advisor’s meeting, where they suggested we use a low-copy plasmid for our construct, create a GANTT chart before next week, assign people to become specialists in each protocol we will be doing over the summer, and to practice these protocols over the next week or so.   Afterward, Brendan showed the lab how to make a gel, and he and Nirmal performed a transformation on the correct Amp plates using both the pUC19 and pL plasmids. Viral inoculated the cells Jessica transformed, so we can practice a miniprep tomorrow.
Day 18, July 10
We finally had a successful transformation! The cells containing pL grew on the Amp plates. The pUC19 cells did not grow, indicating that the plasmid, in conjunction with the mislabeled plates, was the source of our transformation errors.  We then practiced a miniprep, gel electrophoresis, and subsequent gel extraction.
Day 19, July 11
We spent the entire day in the library, coming up with a schematic for how to construct our dual-state promoters. We struggled particularly with designing how to add spacers so that we need as few primers as possible to save money. Ultimately we decided to have one 50bp sequence with the same restriction enzyme site on both ends. We would add this 50bp sequence repeatedly to create 100bp and 150bp spacers.   In the afternoon, we learned how to design primers. We designed a primer together"
Tuebingen,2015,Team:Tuebingen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," to apply the caging mechanism described by Zhou et al [Zhou 2012] . This caging is performed by fusing a copy of a variant of the fluorescent protein Dronpa to both the C- and N-terminus of the Cre recombinase. Since this Dronpa variant is able to form monomers or dimers depending on illumination with light of different wavelengths, we hope that the dimerized form inhibits the activity of the Cre recombinase.
Because our system only needs the expression of the caged Cre construct to be dependent on a sensor, it can be combined with almost all Biosensors that include a means of transcriptional control. This gives the system a wide variety of possible applications, especially in the context of the work of other iGEM teams."

When speaking with them about the digital divide, they considered that though the network was rather good in Dakar, it remained uneven. Computers such as the Jerry could help curbing the digital divide because it is cheap and easy to make and personalise. According to figure 7, there are still less than a quarter of the population without an internet access, so there is still a wide progress margin.

Therefore, JerryClan Senegal is part of a wider community which can strongly help fighting the digital divide, while promoting MOOCs. JerryClan’s concept has reached an international level and we thought that in a way, it relates with the international sense of community from MOOCs users.

BioBrick assembly
CMP and AFT did an assembly of test part (p032) that consist of single chain avidin and amilCP with his-tag. This was done with two different protocols. Protocol  #1 - ligation was done straight from the digest. It showed too many colonies and had to be restricted. Protocol #2 - no colonies appeared when digest was extracted from a gel.
CMP and AFT did an assembly of a part that consists of single chain avidin and amilCP with his-tag flanking a double cut site (BBa_K2355302) with two protocols. Protocol #1 ligation with the digested fragments. Protocol #2 ligation with gel extracted digest.
PHS ligated the part from the 20th of October, it was later transformed onto a X-gal + IPTG LB Cam plate.  The plates with X-gal showed blue colonies for the LacZ part that contained the promoter and RBS (BBa_K608003).

BactaSun
Overview
the issue
Although sunburns seem  quite ordinary to get tanned, it’s a real disaster for our skin… Indeed, for several years, our exposure  to UV rays has increased and scientists have noticed an upward trend in the risk of developing skin cancers.
Every year in Belgium we count approximately 2.000 new cases of melanoma [1].
Between 2005 and 2015 in Belgium, there has been a 77% increase of new cases of melanoma [2].
According to WHO, there are  globally around 2 to 3 million skin cancers each year, and around 132.000 melanoma [3].
One American out of  five will develop a skin cancer in his lifetime. We are all affected by this dangerous problem, but some people with specific characteristics are much more concerned.
Our solution :
BactaSun
That’s the reason why we, the 2017 UCLouvain iGEM Team, are participating in the international competition of synthetic biology, iGEM.
Our innovative solution is BactaSun, a bio-badge changing color when exposed to UV rays. Its color gradually switches from white to red. In a nutshell, you are quickly warned when you have to protect your skin.
Actually, we have developed two ways to achieve our goal. Both are using a photocaged amino acid, the ONB-Tyrosine. The cage, the ONB group, is cleaved when exposed to UV rays, which releases the tyrosine amino acid, making it available for protein synthesis (see on the figure below).
The photo-uncaging of the ONB-Tyr (https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2016/2/24/T--Aachen--onbtyrosincleavagereaction.png-modified)

The AE blue from the Gibson assembly is expressing color in the liquid culture which looks like the Gibson was successful. We will test further the Gibsoned AE blue today and we will start a 5 ml culture from a the current liquid culture for a mini prep tomorrow
●
We are looking into using ImageJ in the future to better quantify the changes in color we are seeing in the chromoproteins and create a way to consistently quantify our results

Currently thinking about ways to better plate the chromoproteins for consistency and for better ways of testing
Thursday, 8/4
●
Mini prep on the culture from the Gibson Assembly of AE Blue, Cellulose Binding Domain, and His Tag. After the mini prep, a PCR was done using VF2 and VR. The PCR product was then run on the gel which revealed a band at the 1000 bp mark (this suggests that the Gibson Assembly was successful). I cut out the band from the gel and did a gel extraction. I'll send this in for sequencing tomorrow.
●
The second AE Blue Gibson that grew cells did not express a blue color so that culture (which was entirely independent of the previously mentioned culture) was disguarded. This is likely because the AE blue vector that was linearized for the Gibson Assembly had some errors.
●
I spun down the chromoproteins I incubated yesterday to check for color. While most had a faint color, Cupid Pink (from DNA2.0), Prancer Purple (from DNA2.0), ScOrange (IGEM), AE Blue (iGEM), and dsPink (iGEM) had the strongest showing color. These five were selected to do temperature tests on while the remaining cultures were placed back on the room temperature incubator. Replacement cultures from five selected were made using 2 uL of the culture into fresh media and set to incubate at 37 °C overnight in the shaker.
●
After checking back at the plates (stored in the 4 °C fridge) made from transforming the DNA2.0 Chromoprotein plasmids, I diiscovered that others looked like they were expressing color, so I made liquid cultures of the other ten DNA2.0 chromoproteins and set them to incubate at 37 °C overnight in the shaker.

While checking the plates from the DNA2.0 transformation, I also looked at the plates from the Gibson Assembly we did 7"
Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#News#Oilsands_-_-_TEXT.html," environmental impact of the oil sands development projects.
We went on a perimeter walk to view the site and see the different processes in action.  We looked at the camp facilities and had lunch in the camp's kitchen.  After lunch we went to check out one of the two pads where the drilling actually happens.  We looked at the pipelines that go to and from the pads as well as where they are currently drilling.
We finished the day with a visit to the Oil Sands Discovery Centre where we got some good background information in the Oil Sands and watched a film about how oil sands production started and the initial difficulties it went through in establishing itself as a successful industry.
After this, we spent some quality time in the Fort McMurray airport before heading back to Calgary.   All in all this was a really great trip and we learned a lot and got to meet some interesting people.  We've already started to think about how Synthetic Biology could play a role in the oil sands industry, which could provide some interesting directions for future iGEM projects.

Missouri_Miners,2012,Team:Missouri Miners#Community_-_-_TEXT.html,". One such project proposal, The Effect of Education on Public Opinion of Synthetic Biology, developed in Bio 375 in the spring of 2011 was presented at the URC and selected for an OURE Fellowship. The project won first place at the 2012 URC in the humanities division. The report for this project can be found on the Public Opinion Research section of this Wiki. Our team prides itself on fostering the necessary skills that allow for members to win multiple awards in the conference; one of the goals of our team is to positively affect members by developing these skills, and winning these awards is the realization of that goal.
Organization
Becoming an RSO
In Fall 2010, our iGEM team became a recognized student organization (RSO) at Missouri S&T. This was a critical step for our team because we do not have any consistent or stable funding sources outside of our university. Now our team has access to funding from Student Council under a Professional Projects fund. This has allowed us to start purchasing our own equipment and secure our own lab space. This has been a huge jump for our previously struggling team. In addition to funding, being an RSO allows our team access to additional exposure and the ability to host legitimate functions at the university, such as our Synthetic Biology Informational in spring 2011 and the Exploring Synthetic Biology event this past spring.
Student Design and Experiential Learning Center
Once our team obtained RSO status, we applied to be a part of the Student Design and Experiential Learning Center (SDELC). This is an organization that oversees and provides opportunities and resources to student design teams on campus. Missouri S&T has a highly-valued tradition of outstanding student design teams across multiple engineering disciplines, including Solar Car, Concrete Canoe, Solar House, Human-Powered Vehicle, Miner Baja SAE, Advanced Aero Vehicle Group, Formula SAE Racing Team, Robotics, and Steel Bridge. We intend to increase the diversity of student design teams on campus because we are a diverse organization that brings a unique aspect of design to the university.
Being a part of the SDELC increases the exposure of our team and increases awareness of iGEM and synthetic biology. The SDELC also provides us with many additional resources, such as staffing support and funding opportunities. We became an official SDELC design team in January 2012.
Most Improved Organization Award
In Spring 2011, our iGEM team won the Outstanding Student Leaders' Most Improved Organization award. This honor was presented to us by Missouri S&T's Corporate Development Council and Student Council"
Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,". It is likely that those who align with conservative policies are less likely to reply out of perception that manipulation of genomic information is associated with more liberal policies.
Despite this, we believe that the responses received in Ithaca and other regions of upstate New York are a fair representation of the general New York State population. We carefully designed our survey to avoid misleading questions as well.
Compiling a Human Practices Handbook
Stockholm’s iGEM team created a human practices handbook to help provide iGEM teams guidelines about how to effectively engage in human practices activities of all types. Our team did well with our past projects particularly in the areas of integrating user feedback and understanding the larger context of the technology we were developing. We provided the Stockholm team our insights regarding timeline, focus, team delegation, goals, and interviewing strategy - all with particular focus to our past year’s tackling bovine mastitis with bacteriocins: Legendairy. We believe that passing on the knowledge we have gained through our past experiences in human practices is valuable to the entire iGEM community to develop advancements in synthetic biology with applications in mind."

Model overview
    The system we designed involves many kinds of relationships between populations and individuals. To help us understand these relationships better, we designed models to describe how the amount of E.coli and substance change with time.
    Concretely, we designed a fluid model and a solid model, where the solid model takes spatial effects on relationships between populations and individuals into consideration. In fluid model, we use Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to describe the behavior of the amount of different characters and molecules. In solid model, however, we use Cellular Automaton (CA) to mimic effects of spatial factors. (See more at Fluid Model and Solid Model )
    We use models to do the things listed below:
I Design warriors that can be killed only by the warrior from the other group
    According to our results from Orthogonality test , we can just determine the circuit of warrior II and what AHL warrior I should secrete. The results are shown as below:
Fig.1 Gene circuit designed from results, the upper one is warrior I while the one below is warrior II
    We cannot design a warrior I that can be killed by warrior II but not by itself regardless of whatever receptor-promoter pair we put inside warrior I. (See more at Orthogonality test )
    The problem now becomes how to block warrior I’s response to C4HSL secreted by itself. Our model tells us if we design warrior I as below (Fig.2), we can realize that warrior I"

Isolation and Characterization of Endophytic Bacteria
Our team isolated and characterized 39 strains of endophytic bacteria harbored in the roots of the wild grass Arrhenatherum elatius and the cultivated bioenergy crop switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). These strains were evaluated for resistance to chloramphenicol and streptomycin using the Kirby-Bauer test (Susceptible, Intermediate, or Resistant). Additionally, strains were tested for ACC utilization by plating on DF-ACC agar plates. We measured strain growth rates, with OD600 10X dilution after 18 hrs incubation at 30°C. Risk group was determined based on classification by 16S amplification and sequencing.
Table 1: Characteristics of evaluated strains.
