Collaboration
Michigan
After our project was on track, we had a look at the projects of the other 2011 iGEM teams. We were curious which new projects would submerge and we found some teams with projects related to ours. The Michigan iGEM team approached us for collaboration. We filled in their survey and we set up a videoconference. Since Michigan had based their project on the same previous work done by the Berkeley Wetlab 2009 team, this was an excellent basis in the early stage of iGEM to exchange information on thoughts, tasks devision and already encountered problems. The videoconference brought us two hours closer to the Jamboree in a split second. It was exciting to talk to people halfway across the world that are in the middle of the same experience and have based their project on the same already existing Biobrick!
Lyon-INSA-ENS
Short after the collaboration with Michigan, our supervisor Aljoscha Wahl, brought to our attention that besides the Michigan team also the Lyon-INSA-ENS and ZJU-China teams were working on bioadhesion. We decided to contact the Lyon-INSA-ENS team , because they were also working on controllable biofilm formation, namely on a Cobalt inducible biofilm.We set up another videoconference and again we were two hours closer to the Jamboree by the blink of an eye. During this videoconference real commitments were made on helping each other:
• As a conformation of the experiment results we decided to replicate each other experiments in each other laboratory to confirm if the results are replicable. The Lyon-INSA-ENS team would do our hydroxylation assay to confirm our results and we would perform their 24-well plate adhesiveness protocol to confirm their results.
• Lyon-INSA-ENS sent us their synthesized trc promoter,"

Genetic Algorithm (GA)
Introduction to GA
What's GA
Genetic algorithms are powerful methods for complex optimization problems. They are essentially evolution in a computer. A population of GA population random candidate solutions is generated and scored. These solutions are allowed to mate with each other, generating offspring that are hybrids of both parental solutions. The mating frequencies are related to a boltzmann-like probability term; akin to simulated annealing, the simulation temperature required for calculating these is high early in the run, and cools down. Since the mating probability for a given candidate solution is related to its score, better solutions mate more frequently, making their components more numerous in the offspring. This new population of candidate solutions is scored, ranked, and allowed to mate.
Why GA?
Genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized to identify the topology of the network. A rate term can be described as two parts: signal and function type. The former usually indicates the positive and negative interaction from reactants to products which strongly correlate with the SBGN entity relationship diagram. The later reflects the biochemical reaction type. GA searches an optimized solution by mimicking the process of evolution. Members of an initial population compete for the privilege to mate and produce offspring for successive generations. The probability of an individual mating is proportional to the fitness of the environment. The generation with better fitness will be obtained generation by generation. As the topology, the interaction forms and the parameters for each component function are all necessary in the final result, we employed a multi-level optimization. The lowest level optimization is to give the suitable parameters with the topology and the interaction forms known. For the next level, we are trying to find the interactions forms of component functions with the known topology with genetic algorithm. At last, for the upper level, the potential topologies are selected also"
NRP-UEA-Norwich,2012,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#Human Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," Show"". We were interviewed by Mark Peters (one of the presenters) about synthetic biology, iGEM and our project. The interview went really well as Pascoe and Khadija got across all of the information that was needed in a clear and concise way, and the presenter was extremely helpful in making sure all of the salient points of the project were brought out.
The team were able to give a brief description of what synthetic biology is before talking about the future applications of synthetic biology for medicine, agriculture and business. We were also able to mention our event at the Norwich Forum in late August in order to help promote it!
A big thanks goes out to all at STAR Radio 107.9 for their help with the project in setting up the interview and allowing us air time to discuss iGEM and synthetic biology. Please visit the link above to hear the radio show.
Newspapers & Internet Promotion
The team was featured on the UEA website throughout the summer including a press release regarding the entire project ( Found Here ) and a press release regarding the Quanticare/Cura future of synthetic biology video ( Found Here ). We are extremely grateful to the UEA Press Office for their help in publicising our project and the events/outreach material we have produced as part of it.
We have also been featured in two local newspapers; the Norwich Evening News (pictured left) and the Eastern Daily Press. This has allowed us to further engage the public with our work and help show the project to the local community. We hope that these articles have helped to promote synthetic biology and introduce it to members of the public who would otherwise have not heard about it. We thank the teams at both newspapers for covering the story of our project.
Further to this a UEA graduate, Daniel Vipond, has followed our project and iGEM as a whole in order to produce a report for his journalism career. It has been extremely exciting to be followed by a television camera throughout the last few weeks and hope Daniel does very well with the report!
Engagement with the wider scientific community
The team presented at the John Innes Centre Synthetic Biology conference
The John Innes Center (JIC) is a world leading center of plant research, the home of UEAs 2011 team,  and part of the Norwich Research Park (NRP). Researchers at the JIC recognized that synthetic biology was an important field and therefore hosted a synthetic biology conference. The aim of the day was to enhance local researchers' knowledge of what synthetic biology is, and highlight projects in which synthetic biology is currently being used. When the team was invited to"
Lambert_GA,2017,Team:Lambert GA#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," There have been multiple conference calls in which Dr. Styczynski and Monica McNerney helped the Lambert iGEM team troubleshoot and revise its project. Dr. Styczynski has also generously provided materials that a high school lab does not have access to. We would like to thank them for helping us complete our project.
Dr. Saad Bhamla generously provided the design files for 3-D printing our own paperfuge.  He also provided feedback on our designs for the improved version.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Specificity_-_-_TEXT.html," whether a specific Cry protein can induce fluorophore release, Cry3Aa was isolated from B. thuringiensis and tested on BBMV's obtained from T. molitor. Activated Cry3Aa gives a clear band on a gel of a 68 kDa protein after SDS-PAGE was performed, as described by Rausell et al 6 . The SDS-PAGE gel of the protein extract from B. thuringiensis, shown in Figure 5, shows such a band of approximately this size.
Figure 5. SDS-PAGE gel. M represents the marker lane. In the other three lanes, protein extracts of B. thuringiensis are loaded. Lane 1 has an undiluted sample, lane 2 a 10x diluted sample and lane 3 a 100x diluted sample.
T. molitor BBMV's were incubated with and without Cry3Aa and the fluorescence was measured over time(Figure 6). From this graph it can be concluded that the presence of Cry3Aa results in a faster increase in fluorescent and therefore in a faster fluorophore release. To determine how large the role of induced leaking is, the kinetic properties of both measurements have to be compared. In order to compare these properties, it should be known which kinetic rules the fluorophore leaking follows. Plotting the natural logarithm of the concentration of fluorophores entrapped in vesicles against time, gives a straight line, (Figure 6). The concentration of fluorophores entrapped in vesicles is expressed as the difference of the maximum fluorescence and the fluorescence at a certain time point. The observed straight line in this graph tells us that first order reaction rules can be applied on the measurement 9 . This means that equation 1 can be applied to the obtained data.
The reaction rate constant, kf, determines how fast the reaction goes. This constant can be used to compare one reaction with another. To find this constant, we plot equation 2 directly through the obtained data. The equation is also shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6. The fluorescence of a two solutions with BBMV's obtained from T. molitor incorporated with fluorophores was measured over time. One in the presence and one in the absence of Cry3Aa.  (a) shows the fluorescence against time, whereas (b) shows the natural logarithm of the maximum fluorescence minus the fluorescence at a certain time point against the time.
For both samples, 6 technical replicates were measured. Representative measurements of each sample are shown in Figure 6. All data"

Emin Lee
Medicine is my core passion, but I enjoy learning various fields of science, including bioengineering. I struggle to identify myself in terms of ""where I am from""; my DNA tells me I am Chinese, but my nationality is Malaysian. However, I was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan, and I go to an American school, but English is not my first language. Albeit my ambiguous origins, I can easily identify what I enjoy in life. I have played the violin for 14 years and piano for 3 years (I am 17 at the moment). I enjoy playing music as a way to escape from stresses (such as trying to explain people where I'm from). I enjoy being a part of this team's building project, contributing as a co-leader. I look forward to how this idea will expand as well as our maturation as people and as teammates.

Contrastingly, the 0g treatment yielded only 3 significantly differentially expressed genes at p_FDR < 0.1, of which none remained significant at the most stringent level. These genes are displayed in table table S1 and include genome annotations of genes or affected genes in case of antisense RNA.
Antisense RNA
From the annotations included in table S1 , it would appear that there is a particularly large number of antisense RNAs affected by the simulated reduced gravity. For the 0.4g treatment, we compared the number of significant antisense RNAs to the total number of significant RNAs (table 2). A simple chi^2-test for given probabilities shows that there is a larger number of significantly differentially expressed antisense RNAs than would be expected from the proportion of aligned antisense RNAs (p = 0.012).

iGEM Team Bielefeld is developing a biological filter using immobilized laccases, enzymes able to radicalize and break down a broad range of aromatic substances. For the production of laccases from different bacteria, fungi and plants, two expression systems are used: Escherichia coli and the yeast Pichia pastoris. Immobilization is carried out either by using CPC-silica beads or by fusing the enzymes to cellulose binding domains.

The following day we had a high number of colonies in our plates, all of them white (correct colour for the blue/white screening that we are performing).
Nonetheless, we performed PCR with our checking primers (ch1 and ch2/ch8) and all our bands were smaller than they were supposed to be. They seemed to be the size of what would be in the plasmid if the lacZ fragment had been correctly excised, and something quite small (up to 300pb) had been inserted.
The PCR was with Dreamtaq polymerase and as follows:
Volume per reaction 10ul:
- Mastermix --> 5ul
- ch1 --> 0.5 ul
- ch8 --> 0.5 ul
- DNA* --> 4ul

Though we accept the definition for protein generators, we observed     that there exist numerous parts which are defined as protein generators     but actually most of them do not fit to the definition provided above.     Although some parts are not functional and do not generate proteins     at all, they are classified as protein generators, which makes searching     for the parts difficult in the registry. Furthermore, there are also     numerous parts which are defined as “composite parts” but actually they     fit to the same definition with protein generators. In order to overcome     the problem of misuse of device type we have extracted related image     ID information for the composite parts. Image ID information helped     us to correctly categorize composite parts depending on its individual     atomic parts and identify the ones with more than one function, such     as being both inhibitor and activator. In other words, we used image     and part IDs in order to merge an input for its outputs.
Subtitle working conditions, includes all the detailed information     about the experimental properties of parts, and the details about the     working process of individual parts and complete devices. Additionally,     we marked the subtitle “Working Condition” in our standardization template     as potentially the most important title that helps synthetic biologist     to better understand the parts functions at iGEM’s part registry database.     The main problem we have encounter with the subtitle “working condition”     is within most of the parts the details about working process is not     enough and not provided regularly.
Examples of Misuse of Terminology:
For Composite Parts:
PartID: BBa_S04055
PartName: Synthetic lacYZ operon
This part is functional and responsible for the production of LacY     and LacZ proteins. This part partially fits the definition for “composite     part” but actually should be a protein generator as it fits fully to     the definition of “protein generators”.
For Protein Generators:
PartID: BBa_J45299
PartName: PchA & PchB enzyme generator
The part which is illustrated above actually fits the definition     for “composite part” but in part registry it is classified as protein     generator. This part can be functional but it needs a promoter. Even     though this part is not functional and is not capable of producing protein,     part registry assigns this product as protein generator. We suggest     that all parts in the registry, which are composed of more than one     atomic part and which are not functional on their own but can be functional,     should be classified as “composite parts”.

He is very fond of synthetic biology and he wants to continue in this domain of research for his diploma/ master thesis. He finds it also very exciting to work with a highly motivated team on a self chosen project for the summer.
Three weeks before the jamboree he had discovered a great new game - the blender animation program. Since then, when he haves time, he unleashes his new skills on the innocent ClpXP protease and his friends, stretching and bending them into models and pictures and forcing them to move.
Georgio Kourjian
Georgio joined the Ecole supérieure de Biotechnology de Strasbourg (ESBS) after he got his B.Sc degree in Biochemistry at the University of the Mediterranean in Marseille France. Currently he is in the last year of the master’s program in this trinational Biotechnology school. He was interested about synthetic biology and the idea of designing and building new biological functions and systems not found in nature that is why he joined the ESBS iGEM team. He thinks that participating at the iGEM competition is a very enriching experience.
For him diploma thesis a part of his work will be the use of synthetic biology for medical purposes.
He was mainly responsible of the wiki creation.
Jens-Sebastian Kalchschmidt
Jens is in his last year as student at the Ecole supérieure de Biotechnology de Strasbourg (ESBS). Before he enrolled in the ESBS he studied 2 years molecular biotechnology at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. He decided to take the chance to continue his biotechnology studies within the trilingual study course biotechnology at the ESBS implicating four universities in three countries. In retrospect, he must say that it was absolutely the right choice and the first long-term contact with the international research community. His research interests focus mostly on immunology and infectious diseases, but the iGEM participation sparked his interest in synthetic biology.
Personal remark: Marathon preparation can be best done during incubation times.
Morgane Griesbeck
Morgane did her cursus in the so-called « classes préparatoires » where she studied Mathematics, Physcis and Chemistry. She chose then to study Biotechnology, choice she has never regretted. She was very interested in the experience provided by conducting a project from scratch. She was especially attracted by the interdisciplinary aspect of synthetic biology and the juncture of biology and engineering. Besides, Morgane loves chocolate and did amazing chocolate cakes called « Indémoulable"
Groningen,2014,Team:Groningen#Template#MODULE#Notebook#toolbox#text_-_-_TEXT.html," The PCR was performed under standard conditions, with an annealing temperature of 64 °C and 1 μl, 2μl and 3 μl template. No product was obtained with this PCR. So the PCR was once again repeated, this time using diluted template. The mixture was diluted 50x, 300x, 1500x and 15000x. The PCR was repeated using 1 μl and 2 μl of each of the dilutions. This way, product was obtained for all reactions.
 
The PCR products of the genes NisA, NisB, NisC, NisRK, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs) were purified using the GeneJET purification kit. Then 1 μg of each purified product was restricted with EcoRI and PstI, together with 1 μg of the pSB1C3 plasmid. The restriction enzymes were then inactivated by heating the samples at 80 °C for 20 minutes. Ligated 6 μl of the restricted PCR products to 2 μl restricted pSB1C3. Inactivated the ligase by incubating at 65 °C for 10 minutes. Mixed 5 μl of the ligation mixture with 25 μl electrocompetent Escherichia coli DH5α. The transformants were grown on LB with 10 μg/ml  chloramphenicol. The white colonies were tested on insertsize with a colony PCR with the VF2 (BBa_G00100) and VR (BBa_G00101) primers. For every gene transformants were found that contained pSB1C3 with a correctly sized insert, except for NisB and NisRK.
 
The E. coli that contained the pSB1C3 plasmid with a correctly  sized insert were grown as a liquid culture and the plasmid was isolated using the GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit.
 
18 - 31 August
 
The plasmids containing the new BioBricks NisA, NisC, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs)  that were isolated in the week of 11 - 17 August were concentrated with a SpeedVac and then sent for sequencing with the primers VF2  (BBa_G00100) and VR (BBa_G001001). The sequence of each BioBrick was confirmed.

Introduction
Community involvement is a high priority for the Missouri Miners iGEM Team. Every year the team does several community outreach events, including hosting educational events, ethical discussions, and a class on Missouri S&T's campus. The following sections detail the activities that the team organized and participated in over the past year, as well as advances the team has made as a student organization and design team at Missouri S&T.
Educational Events
Exploring Synthetic Biology Informational Event
In the past, our iGEM team has held educational events about synthetic biology on our campus. However, this year the team wanted to not only educate the public, but to also get people involved and excited about synthetic biology through hands-on learning activities. Thus ""Exploring Synthetic Biology"" was born.
This event was designed primarily to educate students about synthetic biology and genetic engineering as a whole, as well as to provide information about the goals of the iGEM foundation and Missouri S&T's iGEM team in particular. Hands-on activities included a plasmid modeling activity found on the Community Bricks section of the iGEM website (courtesy of iGEM British Columbia 2011), a “quick and dirty” DNA extraction activity provided by one of the team's advisors, and a synthetic biology Jeopardy game. There were also a few short informational presentations in addition to the hands-on activities. Surveys were distributed both before and after the event to gain valuable feedback from participants; data was utilized as part of two team members’ Public Opinion research project. Prizes were given to attendees periodically throughout the program to encourage participation and reward the winners of the Jeopardy game. The event was held on a Saturday afternoon (March 3, 2012) from 1 to 4 pm. There were approximately 20 Missouri S&T students in attendance, not including the iGEM team members who helped during the presentations and activities.
The first presentation of the afternoon served as an introduction to the field of synthetic"

More information about their project can be found on Aachens Galectin-3 site .
In exchange they offered to characterise these expression vectors with their own designed analyser by measuring the amount of produced fluorescent proteins. Unfortunately, transporting E.colis to another city wasn't as easy as expected, not all Bacteria were able to grow afterwards and we could only obtain sufficient data from pSBX4C5.
iGEM Team Tuebingen
The project of iGEM Team Tuebingen is about blood types and the difficulties that arises during blood donation of the wrong blood type. They aim to develop an easy system to convert blood types A, B, AB to the rares but also most applicable blood type 0. They have applied the method of intein targeting, a method which can also be found in our intein toolbox, to the N-Acetyl-Galactosaminidase protein. More about their project can be read in the very nice article they have wrote for our tumblr blog or on their own wiki .
In this collaboration, Tuebingen conducted a mass spectrometry analysis of our Lambda lysozyme to proof circularization. The data still has to be evaluated, but we will have them ready until the jamboree. There is a high demand for our expression vectors. Tuebingen had problems with expressing their constructs, therefore we send them some of our plasmids pSBX1K30 ( BBa_K1362093 ) and pSBX4K50 ( BBa_K1362097 ), as they showed to work really nicely even with big proteins like the Dnmt1 with 105kDa.
iGEM Team Freiburg
Three of our team members, Anna, Caro, and Charlotte visited the iGEM team Freiburg. We met the team right after a big team meeting, therefore we were able to hear their latest project developments. We spend the evening talking about experiences in the lab and about iGEM. It was relieving to hear that they faced similar difficulties in the lab.  The morning after we presented our project to the iGEM team Freiburg. Freiburg was very interested in our program iGEM@home as we offered them to promote their own human practice projects. You can also find an article about optogenetics on our tumblr blog. Both our teams are working with light inducible systems, manly the LOV domain. Although working in different organisms"

We cultured the yeast in calcium-inducing medium and uninduced medium which contains a relatively low concentration of calcium ion (1xYPD medium). Why we don't choose a medium without any calcium? It's impossible that our yeast or Trichoderma atroviride will have to survive and work in the surrounding without any calcium. And a relatively low concentration may be more similar to the real condition of the soil and rhizosphere. It can also represent the basic level of the calcium when the cell has not been stimulated.
Fig.4 The color difference of two cultrues(left: uninduced; right: induced with Ca2+)
Obviously, the transgenic yeast cultured in the calcium-inducing medium(200mM Ca2+) is turning red while the control shows no significant changes. Then we detected the fluorescence of this two cultures. To eliminate the influence of the concentration of the yeast, we calculated the value of Fluorescent Intensity/OD600 to evaluate these two groups.
Fig.5 Relative fluorescent intensity of two groups
Fig.6 Relative calcium content in two groups
The value indicated that the fluorescence intensity of the calcium-induced group has improved about 118%. It's not quite a huge change and the uninduced group has already shown a great intensity of fluorescence. How come?  We suspect that it's the basic calcium level contributed a lot to the high fluorescent intensity of the uninduced group. To verify this hypothesis, we detected the intracellular calcium ion concentration with Fluo 4-AM whose fluorescent intensity can represent the relative concentration of calcium ion.
We are all surprised that the difference of the intracellular ion concentration between these two groups are so small that the induced group is only  about 8% higher than the uninduced one and the basic level is truly high as we suspected. But from another perspective, only 8% change of the intracellular ion concentration can contribute to 118% higher expression level of the downstream gene. It seems that our CDRE promoter is much more sensitive than we expected.
But can our selective calcium channel induce enough calcium influx to activate CDRE promoter, at least 8% higher concentration of calcium ion? We need to examine our TRPV1 and Ferritin carefully.
Ferritin —— The original sequence of Ferritin is gotten from addgene (plasmid #79649). It is in the same ORF of TR"

Hosting Critical Conversations
• The Science Museum of Minnesota and Minnewashta Elementary
      We had the excellent opportunity to help shape the innovative initiative facilitated by a National Science Foundation grant. Science museums across the nation were extended the opportunity to develop programming focused on the burgeoning field of synthetic biology.  The initiative aimed to stimulate/be a catalyst for community dialogue around a topic at risk for public scorn. Through facilitating new and challenging conversations regarding the simplest (microbial diversity) to potentially most controversial (applied synbio in therapeutics and the environment) aspects of genetic engineering, our team tackled a new mode of connecting over one hundred people from the local community to the future implications of synthetic biology and genetic engineering technologies.
      We collaborated to design activity modules that embraced multiple dimensions of public engagement with science (PES) as described by McCallie et al. (2009). This study emphasizes collaboration and equal contributions of public and scientific opinions regarding institutional policy, and most importantly rejects the common heuristic that superior scientific knowledge confers superior judgment in which initiatives should be pursued and defended within synthetic biology. Team members helped design three different activity modules encompassing microbial diversity, prioritizing applications of synthetic biology, and comparing vaccine advancements achievable through synthetic biology and conventional science.
Each activity was carefully designed to encourage conversations from different perspectives: children were engaged through exploring the aromas of different microbes (such as yeast and E. coli strains) used in everyday food products to consider our proximity to biotechnology in our daily routines; people of all ages were prompted to decide which applications of synthetic biology should receive funding; and adults identified the most important traits in an effective vaccine based on synbio and conventional development methods.
Instead of approaching this outreach opportunity as a venue convincing the lay population of the safety, utility, etc. of synthetic biology, our team saw it as a resource for valuating future projects as they connect to community objectives. We found that an overwhelming majority of attendees connected with synbio solutions to cancer treatments and other medicines mostly due to personal experience with these diseases. In terms of environmental issues, there was also significant interest in developing more effective mosquito repellents.

Collaborations
    As a new team in iGEM, we participate in 2018’ s iGEM competition with enthusiasm to synthetic biology. In this season, we received a great amount of guidance and assistance from many experienced teams and mentors, and we learnt a lot from them. At the same time, we hold collaborations with many teams in experiment, modeling and human practices.
1. With OUC-China
    This year, it is our first time to participate in iGEM competition.
Interaction
    OUC-China is an experienced team that has been participating in iGEM competition for 8 years. They give us huge support. At the beginning, they explained the process of the iGEM competition to us in detail and remind us some important deadlines. For the project, they gave us some pertinent suggestions.
Public engagement
    For human practice activities, during the summer vacation, they invited us to hold a summer camp. We are very glad to collaborate with them and explained to the campers how to make insect specimens.
Experiment
    Apart from that, we also help them in return. We help them test the performance of miniToe, proving that their system has the same trend under our experimental conditions.

2.With SKLMT
Interaction
    SKLMT-China and us come from the same university, so it’s pretty convenient for our two teams to communicate with each other. Because we were both freshmen to iGEM, we helped each other with all kinds of issues during the iGEM season, from project design to experiment support and competition issues. From the beginning, the projects were polished by two teams together through holding some seminars.
Experiments
    What’s more, we did the interLab experiment together, experimental materials and equipment were shared together, besides, we analysed the data and discussed the consequence we got together. Recently, we gave them a favour in testing their new plasmid backbone for standardization, and it worked really well. In a word, thanks to our sister team for"

Sixpi 21:04, 31 July 2009 (UTC)
We've gotten a first pass at the database connection piece done - we can connect to a database, grab the columns, map them to the field keywords, and then dynamically generate the files needed for hibernate to function, and then use them to query the database.
This weekend I'll be setting up a sourceforge project that we're going to migrate clothoII into. The project will be at http://clothocad.sourceforge.net . I'm setting up the svn repository, moving the code we have, trying to organize it better, and editing the website.
I also attended the data exchange workshop at Stanford on the 26th with Doug. I got to listen to people from various organizations argue about what a part is, and in the end everyone agreed to at least attempt to get their tools to talk to other people's tools as a way to move forward instead of moving in circles trying to get people to agree.
Week Eleven
Sixpi 22:04, 7 August 2009 (UTC)
So we've more or less successfully moved into sourceforge. Most of the old tools have been migrated, except for the ""Holy Trinity"" of managers (parts manager, plate manager, and database manager). The core tool loading system has been revamped and is relatively stable. I still need to finish a tool import utility that will move your tool files into the correct places for you, and also generate the xml file required for tool loading.
We came up with a high level timeline of goals at our meeting yesterday, which is reproduced below:
Aug  1st week - tools migrated 2nd - new tools, help/preferences, Evan leaves(finishes adjacent object paths) 3rd - Icons Sept - 3 managers, BioCAD migration 1st - 2nd - Chess demo 3rd - Hilfinger/Paper, Davidson 29th - Thien's 21st bday Oct - India 1st - Polish 2nd - iGEM Bay Area/Presentation 3rd - Poster/Wiki/clothocad.com/sourceforge Doug 32nd bday Jamboree!!

1st September
The Bacteria Team is living some intense moments! The first transformation of the zeocin ligation took place yesterday and we're all very optimistic! We're about to know the results of this zeocin cloning on the 2nd, the latest the 3rd.
2nd September
We finally received the oligonucleotides needed for the linker region! We can now start the cloning plan for this biobrick.
3rd September
We started to consider which type of poster would be the best for the Jamboree presentation. We met Darren at 4 pm to discuss about the cloning strategy for MMP9.
4th September
We used SurveryMonkey in order to make a decision on who should present at the Jamboree.  We reached a consensus for Alex, Tom and Casey to carry out this precious job for the team.
5th September
We decided that the best option as the background colour for the T-shirts would be white.
6th September
HQ replied about zeocin resistance biobrick. It will count as a new part. They also confirmed our attendance to the Regional Jamboree. Lyon, here we come!  Alex produced a first draft of the poster while the other gave him feedback and FYi offered to take care of the actual design.
9th September
Today Darren visited us at the lab and brought us MMP9 which was used to transform our competent cells.  A new ligation for zeocin was prepared and competent cells were transformed with it.
10th September
All the photos of the team members and supervisors were mounted on wiki. We had another discussion with Darren who advised us to test again the chloramphenicol and also to prepare more competent cells. He also reminded us to always use pSecTag2A as a positive control when minipreping.
11th September
Intense work in the Bacterial Lab as the Biobrick Submission deadline is nigh. Obtained new stocks of valuable pSB1C3.
Weiling sent further sponsorship proposals to GSK and New England Biolabs.

In order to be considered for the Best New Basic Part award , you must fill out this page. Please give links to the Registry entries for the Basic parts you have made. Please see the Registry's Help:Parts page for more information on part types.
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts."

After that, we worked on counting the number of times each amino acid appears in each of the 7 positions (unfortunately given by -1,1,2,3,5,6,7), and counting the number of times amino acids are next to each other (ex. ACTQRNF has AC, CT, TQ, etc pairings). Taken overall, we found that L is overwhelmingly in position 5.

Brown,2010,Team:Brown#Project#Light pattern#Logic design_-_-_TEXT.html," AND gates, and found PKU 2009's description of the supD/T7ptag AND gate appropriate.
The AND gate as outlined by team PKU '09. When both inducible promotors are active, supD tRNA and T7ptag form functional T7, inducing the T7 promoter.
Last year, PKU achieved their optimal AND gate function using pSal and pBad. As we want to eliminate the need of multiple inputs, especially chemical ones, pSal was not a valid option for our circuit. Considering that we have already covered many of the available transcription factors in the registry, we decided to adopt the GAL4/UAS system. Gal4, a transcription factor derived from yeast, binds to the UAS (Upstream Activator Sequence) to induce transcription. By including GAL4 in state three, we can achieve activation of the AND gate following activation of the third state.
Putting it all together
The diagram below is an interactive depiction of our circuit in its entirety. Press the LIGHT button to toggle the light ON and OFF. Note that when components are greyed out, they are ""off"" or repressed, and when they are black they are ""on"" or active. This depiction of the circuit was created using Adobe Flash CS4.

What are the Oil Sands?
The Oil Sands
The Canadian oil sands  are the second largest proven crude reserves in the world and continue to be developed to meet  the energy demands of North America.  The IEA lists the proven reserves of the Athabasca oils sands contain more than 170 billion barrels. However, the processing of oil sands is much more energy and resource intensive than traditional extraction methods. The sands are a heavy mixture of rock, metals, organic material, and a very viscous form of petroleum known as bitumen. Bitumen must be separated out and heavily processed using steam, heat, and mechanical methods. This presents a major challenge to engineers to produce this resource on a large commercial scale in a responsible and sustainable way.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the PDE with the finite element method (FEM). This method discretizes the continuous space into small elements by overlaying a mesh ( figure 10 ) and transforming the continuous geometry into a graph. Each node is a dependent variable. The time-dependent PDE is transformed in this manner into a large system of ODEs, with 1 equation for each node (because the boundary conditions are Neumann).
Coupling AHL diffusion and localized chemical interactions
By and large the most interesting piece of this puzzle is how to couple the spatially-oblivious chemical reaction network described above with the diffusion. [AHL] has become a spatial field. Each ring/layer of bacteria (see footnote in figure 10 ) is an autonomous agent that interacts with the locally available AHL. A few things are evident: AHL concentrations at points on cytoplasms depend both on diffusion and on chemical interactions, and many more dependent variables are required, to store the concentration of every species at every bacterium.
A bacterium can be thought of as a dynamical system with all the other chemical species as its state and local AHL as its input signal. The dynamical system can be seen as a function of the input and the previous state. Multiple dynamical systems can also be seen as a single function, because the function takes a point in space as input and knows which individual system to feed the input to. Since it can be seen as a function, it can readily be plugged into the equation above as the production coefficient - problem solved!
… solved, but for the ODE solver which fails miserably at such a convoluted, nested system of equations! The alternative that has been successfully implemented is to augment the system of node equations. To the equations produced by the spatial discretization a new set of equations for every bacterium involved is added.
The bacteria expect a single value for the concentration of AHL in the cytoplasm, but as can be seen in figure 10 to each bacterium correspond 6 mesh nodes. For simplicity, the value of [AHL] that the bacteria see is the mean of those nodes.
The d[AHL] (change in [AHL]) produced from the bacterial equations also has to be distributed correctly on the mesh nodes. What we want to simulate when distributing the bacterial output is a constant source on the entire cytoplasm. There is a certain complexity in how the finite element method formulates the node equations and the nodes are not all equivalent, so we can’t simply split the d[AHL] into many parts and give one to each node. Instead, we rely on the FEM"

Screening System
K2020040
– screening plasmid for incorporation of non-canonical amino acids → pRXG This part is an improvement of the existing BioBrick K1416004 , called pFRY by the iGEM Team Austin Texas 2014. It is an flourescent reporter for measurement of incorporation of ncAA. pRXG is one part of a two plasmid reporter system for measurement of incorporation of ncAA via amber supression. It consists of two flourescent domains connected through a linker sequence containing and amber stop. When IPTG induced and expressed, the flourescence intensity can be measured. A red flourescence is always visible upon induction, and if an amino acid is incorporated as response to the amber stop codon, then a green flourescence intensity is measurable. Fidelty and efficiacy of the incorporation can be determined with comparison of flourescent level. This reporter plasmid is one of a two plasmids containing screening system for determining efficiancy and fidelty of non-canonical amino acids (ncAA) incorporation via amber termination supression. One plasmid contains tRNA and corresponding aminoacylation-synthetase. The other one is this plasmid presented herein. It consists of am mRFP1 domain which is connected through a linker sequence containing a recoded amber stop codon with a sfGFP domain. The expression of the plasmid gives either a red fluorescence, or - if the ncAA will be incorporated at the rec"
NRP-UEA-Norwich,2012,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#NOSensing_-_-_TEXT.html,", this could be due the potassium nitrate concentration reaching the critical concentration at which it becomes toxic to the cell. This data differs to the readings taken from the bacterial-mammalian promoter ligated to eCFP, as well as the hybrid promoters to RFP, which may suggest there is a difference in the molecular mechanisms that these promoters function by; however at this point the change in intensity at 20mM is inconclusive and is an area which we would like to look into further.
Figure 12.A graph comparing the intensity of CFP fluorescence at 475 nm where the samples were excited at 410 nm. The samples of E. coli were transformed by the B-M + CFP BioBrick and grown overnight in different concentrations of potassium nitrate (0 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 15 mM and 20 mM) before being lysed in order to release proteins from the cells for fluorometer analysis.
We were initially unsure of the effect that the orientation of the bacterial (pYEAR) and the mammalian (CaRG) genes would have in gene expression, therefore we synthesised two hybrid promoters in the orientation bacterial-mammalian and mammalian-bacterial. The graph above compares the intensity of fluorescence of the two hybrid promoters (BBa_K774004 and BBa_K774006)  ligated to eCFP. There is a distinct difference between the intensity of fluorescence produced by the bacterial-mammalian promoter and the mammalian-promoter which is something that we would like to look into further. It is particularly interesting that at an intensity of 109a.u. the mammalian-bacterial promoter returns to the same level of intensity as the apparent maxiumum of the bacterial-mammalian promoter at 40a.u.
We also ligated both of our hybrid promoters to Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP), and the results can be seen below.
Figure 13.A graph of the intensity of RFP fluorescence at different wavelengths ranging from 600 - 650 nm where the samples were excited at 560 nm. The samples of E. coli were transformed by the B-M + RFP BioBrick and grown overnight in different concentrations of potassium nitrate (0 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 15 mM and 20 mM) before being lysed in order to release proteins from the cells for fluorometer analysis.
The graph above shows the flourescence measured from the expression of RFP due to the response of the bacterial-mammalian promoter to  different concentrations of potassium nitrate.  The wavelength reading which corresponds to RFP is"

Paris_Bettencourt Paris_Bettencourt team has sent us one of their parts for characterization: BBa_K1137008. This part codes for the enzyme TDMH, which degrades mycobacterial cell wall. The enzyme has a his tag, so we would use Western blot to characterize its expression in BL21 over time – after 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours from induction with IPTG. Additionally, a negative control (an uninduced culture) will also be used for the blotting. We sent their team our part Bba_K1223005, so they could characterize the lac/ara-1 promoter we use in this construct.

They tested their system with the production and secretion of Hepatitis B antibody which was placed under the control of a nitrate inducible promoter (BBa_K1071004). Since our instructors have experience with yeast we offered to check if the Nitrate Reductase (NR) promoter works in yeast.

at three different concentrations in LB media. Cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37 ºC and shaking at 250rpm. Please note that OD measurements are considerably higher in dye-contaminated waters due to the absorbance of the azo-dye. OD measured at 600nm and Time is shown in hours after incubation.

Figure 4b - BBa_K1336007 LEC+BsDyP Azo-degradation device shows indicative effectiveness on Acid Orange 7 after 24 hours of shaking incubation. Graph showing the indicative decolourisation activity of E. coli DH5Gα transformed with BBa_K1336007 on AO7, at three different concentrations in LB media. Cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37 ºC and shaking at 250rpm. Please note that OD measurements are considerably higher in dye-contaminated waters due to the absorbance of the azo-dye. OD measured at 480nm and Time is shown in hours after incubation. Error bars indicate SEM, n=2.
The second step of the decolourisation assay, however, showed a much more dramatic decolourising effect after 30 hours. After centrifugation, it could be observed that the supernatant for the AO7 (0.0155 mg/mL) with cells that contained the plasmid had a less intense colour than the plasmid-free control, where no degradation was expected.

Meetings
In the week of 29 August, our advisor Steven went to Lausanne to meet up with EPFL iGEM team . They had a barbecue together on which both teams elaborated on their projects. Steven had a lovely day, with lots of new insights on how we can improve dewpal (which can be found under Human Practices). He also learned many new things about synthetic biology, with which he was not familiar. This sparked an interest in him to start exploring this, for him, new field, and even looked into taking a class on this subject.
Surveys
As iGEM is also about gaining new knowledge, we participated in several surveys of different iGEM teams:
iGEM Göttingen, Germany
The iGEM team of Göttingen is working on increasing the production of vitamin B12. This vitamin is invovled in metabolic functions in all organisms, and thus an essential nutrient. We completed their survey on the general understanding of vitamin B12, and its importance in living organism.
iGEM Virginia, USA
The iGEM team of Virginia are designing a novel biocontainment mechanism based on leucyl tRNA-synthetase. For their human practices, they created a survey around the awareness regarding biocontainment in other iGEM teams. Our wetlab team gladly participated, and the results can be found here .
iGEM Paris-Saclay, France
The iGEM team of Paris-Saclay is studying the effect of DNA-topology on gene expression. However, as part of their Human Practices, they send out a survey about responsible research and innovation. We filled it in, and you can see what they learned here .
iGEM Munich, Germany
The iGEM team of Munich are trying to develop an innovative way to print organic tissue using ""bioink"". For their Human Practices project, they wanted to investigate the enabling factors in biotechnology. To help them, we filled in their survey. Their findings can be found here .
iGEM Groningen, the Netherlands
The iGEM team from Groningen are working on a bacterial decryption system to safely store information. For their Human Practices, they performed a survey to understand the current perception around digital and physical storage of information. Their results are available here .

Supporting iGEM Team Paris Bettencourt
iGEM Paris Bettencourt has set up a visual databse that should help various iGEM teams collaborate and find common ground. In that database all teams can enter techniques, keywords, organism and many more thev are knowdledgeable in or have been working on. As common dots are connected automatically, it's easy so see, whom to ask for a collaboration.
Though we came a little late to the party, we really loved the idea and hoped, that the database has helped various teams!

Collecting impressions from the community
It’s done. We’ve finally decided upon a logo. It’s beautiful, it’s blue, it’s fishy *wink*. The next step was to choose a color scheme and a general style for the wiki. As we feared that our own ideas might be too similar we thought of asking a broader public how they would design a website based on our logo. In order to do so, we headed to the ’Neckarwiese’. During summer, a big part of Heidelbergs population decideds to go there and enjoy the sun, have a BBQ or just relax – so we caught them off guard.
We have had prepared a little presentatio with which we introduced them to iGEM and Synthetic Biology. Afterwards we explained them what we planned on doing, showed them our logo and asked, how they would design a website, based on what they’ve just heard. The general consens was to go for a blue theme, maybe add a little algae green  and generally stick to maritime iconography. Unexpectedly we actually met someone who knew his stuff: Natalie, a student of the history of arts from Berlin. She gave us useful advice on how play with the different colors, what to avoid and even added a little touch of history to it. Lucky catch!
With fresh ideas we headed back to the lab and continued our experiments, being envious of all the people that could continue"

(Protein-Based System)
Introduction
In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our protein-based system for detecting cruzipain, we designed and cloned  three parts into the pSB1C3 vector:
SpyTag-OmpA-sfGFP-His tag BBa_K2450401
OmpA-SpyTag-sfGFP-His tag BBa_K2450451
TorA Leader-SpyCatcher-sfGFP-TEV cleavable linker-Reach quencher-His tag BBa_K2450501
From our modelling of this system we knew that the final concentration of our proteins was important, and therefore packing efficiency into the OMVs was vital. Therefore, we attached sfGFP to both OmpA parts (BBa_K2450401 and  BBa_K2450451)  to measure the efficiency of their transport to the outer membrane and OMVs. We also designed the BBa_K2450501 part with the dark quencher near the end of the part. This would allow the quencher to easily be removed by PCR and so we would be able to assay the colocalization of this part to the outer membrane and OMVs. This value would be important to determine protein concentration. It would also be able to inform on the ratio of bound to free protein in the OMVs by performing an assay on the fluorescence in OMVs with and without a targeting OmpA part, which was another unknown variable in the modelling.
Shipping Vector Cloning
A more in-depth description of this stage of our project can be found on the Shipping Vector Cloning results page. We successfully cloned the three parts above into the shipping vector. We had designed two additional parts, two halves of a split TEV protease, however these contained illegal restriction sites. We attempted quick-change PCR and overlap extension PCR for site"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of g"
Brasil-USP,2015,Team:Brasil-USP#Policy#WomanInScience_-_-_TEXT.html," com a carreira, porque é nessa época que ela presta concursos, etc. Mas, se a mulher tem uma família compreensiva e que a apóia, esse processo pode ser levado de forma mais tranquila. An academic career, with graduation, master and doctorate, most of the time stabilizes at 30 years old. How does it impact you? Does it depend on the gender?
When thinking about finishing an academic career, there is not a lot of difference between genres. Both finish it at about 30 years old. But I find that women have more responsibilities when they get pregnant, since she needs to divide herself between the career and maternity in a critical age, since it is the time she studies for public tenders, etc. But, if the woman has a comprehensive family that backs her up, this process can be easier.
Survey
We decided to do a survey about women in graduation to see what people thought about it and have some statics to work with. We wanted to know what was the proportion of women on the course over the years, how they were compared with their male counterparts, if they were ever discriminated or harassed during university, etc. The survey, though, is not meant to be taken on behalf of all students, since it was done with a relatively small number of people. We only wanted to have an idea about this matter and what people thought of it. The survey was done only with brazilian students, especially those from University of São Paulo. The data we have gathered can be seen below."

Atipat Patharagulpong
Atipat is also known as Ming. (people sometimes call him ATP, which he finds a bit geeky) He is a third year biochemist and responsible for collaboration, part registry, and Arabidopsis (and also drawing everyone's picture). Apart from Biochemistry, he loves playing the piano, drawing anime, gardening, and also cooking (and eating too).
Chris Schoene
Chris is going into his 3rd year of Biochemistry at Imperial College London and our official head of parts characterisation. He has been interested in Synthetic Biology since the last year's team presented their project in October. His other interests include creative writing, martial arts, the classical guitar and traveling. He is German but was born in Colombia and has lived in the USA and Spain.
Frank Machin
Frank is halfway through his degree in Biochemistry at Imperial and responsible for the software and hardware. He has been a huge fan of Synthetic Biology ever since he watched The Andromeda Strain and The Day of the Triffids. When he is not working, he likes gaming, loud music, and making short films and he is going to try and include them all in this project!
Jiayue Zhu
We generally call Jiayue Nina to make our lives easier since nobody can pronounce her name correctly. She is a 2nd year bioengineer and very glad to be here with the team and to do some amazing fancy stuff. She is in charge of all media-related issues.
Nicolas Kral
Nick has just finished the second year of the Bsc Biology degree at Imperial. He has been attracted to synthetic biology because of the immense potential and creativity that is hidden in it, yet still following the strict scientific thinking. His hobbies include everything to do with Nature and the great outdoors, hiking, climbing, caving and just the joy of being out.

I am studying Advanced and Applied Chemistry with a focus in an area a little different: Computational Biology. I joined the iGEM team, to have a good excuse to do some wet lab work, while having the fun of doing a project over the summer. I like structural biology, and can spend hours in Pymol. I like setting up computational solutions, and will try to integrate structural biology in a protein-protein database search algorithm as my Master Thesis. In my free time, I enjoy simple sports such as running and swimming. My favorite kind of cake includes many blueberries and lots of chocolate.

Hi my name is Vanessa and I study systems biology at DTU. I am especially interested in the mathematical modelling of biological systems. I think iGEM is a great opportunity to gain experience. I like to spend my free time outdoors and enjoy beeing so close to the beach here in Copenhagen. My favourite cake is Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte.
Anastasia Mourka
Hi all! I am a MSc student in Computer Science and Engineering at DTU, while my first degree was in Electrical and Computer Engineering at AUTH. My Biology knowledge is left back in high school, but I have a personal interest in creating websites. Therefore, I decided to join the iGEM team! Apart from that, I like working as a member of a big project and meeting new people! I enjoy dancing Latin and traditional Greek dances and my favorite cake is chocolate cake! The more the chocolate, the better the cake!
Natalia Papargyri
I have a bachelor degree in Chemistry, but I was always fascinated by biology! ..And now here I am, studying Systems Biology at DTU and being part of this year's iGEM team! I joined the team because I believe that learning by doing is the best way to really gain new skills and have a better understanding of the field of your interest, and of course is more fun!! It is also my first time working in a team at university level, with people having different backgrounds, and cultures, something that makes this experience all the more valuable to me! My favorite cake is…well, whatever has chocolate! :)

Grinnell,2011,Team:Grinnell#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"SB1C3 plasmids containing the three promotors.
The transformations had a lot of small colonies, too many to count.  4 isolatable colonies from each transformation were prepared through freeze-thaw and PCR amplified to confirm sizes.  Sizes of four colonies were unclear because the promotors are so small that it is difficult to tell the difference between a band that contains only WT dspB and one that contains both WT dspB and a promotor ( DspB Figure 2 and the first four lanes of Esp Figure ). Therefore, a sample of WT dspB was PCR amplified as a standard for comparison and run on a gel against the ambiguous transformation results ( DspB Figure 3 ).  These gels confirmed the sizes of WT dspB + PrsaA and WT dspB + the BioBrick promotor BBa_K081005 but not WT dspB + Pxyl.
Four more colonies were freeze-thawed and PCR amplified and run on a gel against the standard WT dspB but none contained WT dspB + Pxyl ( DspB Figure 4 ).
Week 7 July 10-16
WT dspB: PrsaA + WT dspB and BBa_K081005 + WT dspB were miniprepped.  Will continue working on WT dspB when we recieve the sequencing results and determine whether we need to make new primers to eliminate the stop codon from the gene.  4 more colonies were picked from the transformation of WT dspB into Pxyl and two colonies showed the expected size ( Figure ).  This band was gel extracted because of the presence of another brighter band.  WT dspB + Pxyl was then digested with EcoRI and PstI and then ligated into pSB1C3 previously digested with EcoRI and PstI and then transformed into E. coli Top10.  The results of this transformation were confirmed on a gel ( Figure )
Optimized dspB: 4 colonies from the transformation of optimized dspB were PCR amplified and one colony showed the correct size ( Figure ).  An overnight culture of this colony was miniprepped, digested with SpeI and PstI and ligated with rsaA that had been previously gel extracted and digested with XbaI and PstI and then transformed.  4 colonies from the transformation plate were PCR amplified and 3 matched the expected size of optimized dspB + rsaA ( Figure ).

Abstract
CeCe is a simulation environment capturing in one setting the key processes that influence cell-cell signal transmission. The underlying scene is a simple 2D world. Cells enter and exit this world through predefined channels of arbitrary shape. Each cell executes its own stochastic biochemical reactions and based on its state interacts with the rest of the population. As such, CeCe is easy to setup, intuitive to interpret, and fast to run.
Key Achievements
Provided simulation tool to confirm IOD design
Built in streamlines, diffusion, stochastic reactions, and more
Released under open-source license so everyone can simulate their projects
Highly modular, easy to be extended by community-made plugins
Extendable by Python without having C++ knowledge
Demo
Demo 1
Your browser does not support the video tag.
We created a demo simulation to present some of CeCe's features. This simulation contains two different length paths. The slower flow velocity in the bottom path causes signal and cells to accumulate leading to higher cell activation, represented by YFP expression. The connection between tanks shows how the simulator handles differences in pressure.
Demo 2
Your browser does not support the video tag.
The second demo shows yeast colony cells reacting to contamination, i.e., cells of different types producing measurable extracellular signals. Contaminating cells are added randomly throughout the scene and produce an invisible signal. When the yeast cells (shown in grey) detect a sufficient amount of the signal in the surrounding medium, they randomly express RFP.
This simulation was constructed to model detection of contaminants for Team Chalmers Gothenburg's Scarlett detection design.

On the minimal medium M9 agar plates they were usually significantly faster and showed swimming motility earlier than any other cells. On Tryptone swimming agar they were in general the runner up behind yhjH-transformed E. coli. Unfortunately, we had trouble cloning our fliC constructs into pSB1C3 because of a problem in our reverse primer suffix. When we had located the source of the problem it was too late to send this part to the Registry in time.
flhDC
Fig. 8: The master operon flhDC, involved in motility, codes for the transcription factor FlhD4C2 which acts as a regulator of flagellum synthesis. It is suggested that an overexpression of this operon in E. coli results in an increased motility [2]. (A) The flagellar apparatus is  anchored within the bacterial cell membrane. (B) E. coli cells that overexpress the flhDC operon supposedly exhibit an overall increased flagella production. Consequently, the cells should be able to move faster than their untransformed fellows.

The flhDC operon is the master regulator of motility and chemotaxis in E. coli. This means that it is the main control instance for flagellar synthesis and starts the complex process of flagellar gene synthesis and flagellum assembly (Chevance and Hughes 2008). The flhDC operon codes for the transcriptional regulator FlhD4C2 which forms heterotetramers and activates class II operons in concert with sigma factor 70. Among the gene products of class II operons are several components of the flagellum and the alternative sigma factor FliA which is essential for the transcription of class III genes. It has been shown that increased expression of flhDC also enhances motility in E. coli (Ling et al. 2010). We wanted to see how different levels of fl"

MIT,2010,Team:MIT bioethics_-_-_TEXT.html," patent offices to be proficient in a multitude of technical domains from computer science to nanotechnology, resulting not only in a shortage of synthetic biology examiners but also a general confusion and concern as to what constitutes patentable material. Rick Johnson, who heads up an OECD group on synthetic biology, has called the field “an IP law professor’s dream final examination problem,” arguing for a complete overhaul of US patent laws regarding the field.   Legal experts also agree that something needs to be done. ""Synthetic biology presents a particularly revealing example of a difficulty that the law has frequently faced-the assimilation of a new technology into... existing intellectual-property rights,"" wrote Arti Rai and James Boyle, from Duke University in North Carolina, in a recent paper. ""The way that US law has handled software on the one hand and biotechnology on the other could come together in a 'perfect storm' that would impede the potential of the technology.""
The confusion clouding synthetic biology has led groups, such as Synthetic Genomics, founded by scientist and industrialist Craig Venter, to file patents on the very foundations and principles on which the field is built, potentially freezing progress in both research and commercialization by others. “Some of the patents being filed are astoundingly basic, the equivalent of patenting Boolean algebra right at the birth of computer science,” wrote Boyle.   The disturbing ease of this sort of patenting has  garnered the attention of synthetic biology's founding fathers. ""You can take any device from the Texas instruments TTL catalogue, put 'genetically coded' in front of it without actually demonstrating it in practice, and you have a good chance of getting a patent,"" says Drew Endy, professor of bioengineering at Stanford.   Tom Knight of MIT calls such patent claims, “absurdly, ridiculously broad.” The problem is aggravated by the fact that unlike in the biotechnology industry, the one molecule-one patent rule  does not apply to synthetic biology. Instead, because it so intrinsically relies on a single standard upon which all future improvements are made, the field is particularly susceptible to patent trolls and entities who are seeking financial gain, but not pursuing product development.
As it was throughout the biotechnology industry's growth, patents will play a key role in determinating the future of its latest product, synthetic biology. However, because of the inescapable differences between traditional biotechnology and synthetic biology, what was once a prime mover in the direction of innovation and commercialization has proven to be a double-edged sword.   The premises originally established to stimulate progress may result in the very opposite effect. When synthetic biology's potential"

Word2Vec Embeddings on Proteinsequences
We rewrote a word2vec implementation from tensorflows tutorials that implements Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space, ICLR 2013 (Mikolov, et. al.). The model is a skipgram model with negative sample that uses custom ops written in C. The code was adapted to our needs, mainly by changing datatypes in the C kernels and writing a different evaluation function based on predicting the nearest words to the most frequent words instead of using analogies. Two new datasets were generated based on both swissprot and uniprot. Training of 4mer embeddings in 50, 100 and 200 dimensions were started but have not been calculated yet.
Visualisation of the first checkpoints is possible via tensorboard Visualisation of an example embedding via tensorboard .

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"alactose is added at 12 hours to turn on ""switch"".
Fig.5-4 clearly shows the change of the concentration of heavy metal ions in the supernatant. Firstly, the Cu yeast works smoothly. The concentration of copper ions declines over time while that of cadmium ions barely changes. 12 hours later, we add galactose to the solution. Situation changes. Galactose induces the enzyme, changing Cu yeast to Cd yeast. It leads to faster adsorption of cadmium but slower for copper.
DISCUSSION & FUTURE WORK
In the experiment, we find the LIMT doesn’t appear as ideal as we thought. In the future work, we plan to read involved references in order to complete protein modification by rational design.
Moreover, it’s a pity that we have no time to combine our genetic circuit and SCRaMbLE yeast. In subsequent experiments, it deserves a try to transform fragments into SCRaMbLE yeast, checking if it will double the absorption capacity or even better.
In the nutshell, we will be dedicated to improve the absorption efficiency and better our genetic circuit.

To solve these problems, the iGEM-Team Bielefeld 2011 aims to develope a cell-free bisphenol A (BPA) biosensor based on a coupled enzyme reaction fused to S-layer proteins for everyday use. Bisphenol A is a supposedly harmful substance which is used in the production of polycarbonate. To detect BPA it is degraded by a fusion protein under formation of NAD+ which is detected by an NAD+-dependent enzymatic reaction with a molecular beacon. Both enzymes are fused to S-layer proteins which build up well-defined nanosurfaces and are attached to the surface of beads. By providing these nanobiotechnological building blocks the system is expandable to other applications.""
Our approach is a cell free biosensor. One advantage is that no living organisms need to be used outside the lab for the application of our system. We want to provide S-layers as nanobiotechnological building blocks for cell free biosensors. By fusing different enzymes to these proteins, a variety of biosensors can be build. Further cell free applications are possible and we think that when more projects are focusing on cell free systems this is also a contribution to more safety and security. All GMOs can stay in the lab, therefore are grown under controlled conditions and only qualified personnel has access to them.

We’re inspired by double-click of computer’s mouse. It doesn’t react to the first click but does react when it is accompanied by the second one. This is one of the most accepted, familiarized, and proven mechanism to diminish the erroneous operation. This fail-safe technology should find various uses also in biotechnology.

    The following is our main menu for game pattern. By choosing ‘One Player’ you can play with the virtual player AI (artificial intelligence). We have designed smart algorithm to help you computer think up game strategies like we human do and AI can initialize its bacteria after your action at once. If you choose ‘Two Players’, then you can play with your friends or initialize both sides yourself.
    Each battalion has the same amount of bacteria.You can initialize your bacterial camp at the beginning of the game before you click the button ’start’.
    By click on different bacteria characters you can initialize them on the round Petri dishes. Different colors represent different kind of bacteria and the green box around the farmers surround the area of nutrition they can support so don’t put your bacteria out of green boxes.
    The number following ‘total’ tells us the amount of live bacteria in each bacteria troop. At the bottom of the picture we can see the ‘remaining chances’ we have to initialize bacteria. The days which bacteria have growing for and the coordinate point of where you mouse click are at the upper right corner.
    Now we can learn more about the toolbar.
    After you finish initializing all the bacteria, clicking the ‘start’ button can run the game. If you click on the button ‘restart’, all the progress can be cleared. By clicking the button ‘model’, you can choose again whether you want to play with AI or not. Now let us click the button ‘setting’ and we can see the following pop-up:
    The first option line is for setting background music volume. The middle line decides the volume of bacteria actor's lines and after you click on each character, you can hear them speaking. By dragging the last line’s option button you can change the amount of bacteria of each side.

Using the example iGEM's first SynBio Beer our team tried to bridge the gap between the scientific community and the general public by hosting a variety of “Human Practice” events. To inform younger members of our society about genetic engineering we visited a class of 10th and a class of 11th graders. An interview at the local student radio station gave us the opportunity to present our team and our mission to fellow students. In addition a comic was designed that illustrates our project in a playful way. Two versions of this comic were drawn: one for children and one for grown-ups. Our team never encouraged under-age alcohol consumption. The presented content was always adapted according to the respective audience.
Our team also addressed the general public with a multitude of events. Laborwelt.de was our most important media partner. Moreover, other newspapers and websites reported about our team and project and a movie presented our project and explained the basic ideas of synthetic biology. A nationwide information day was organized in cooperation with other German iGEM teams. Our team also invited politicians and scientists to discuss the impact of genetic engineering in groceries.
GMO in Food
Genetic Engineering or Genetic Modification of food is an issue that is present in the media all over the world [3] . There are a lot of people who are critical and skeptical about genetically modified (GM) food. The opponents of genetic engineering are wondering if food produced from genetically engineered organisms is safe. They are afraid of eating GM food because they think that the food can interfere their normal bodily functions.  Yet a lot of food that we eat every day contains genetically modified ingredients and we do not know about it [3 ]. Consequently labeling GM food is another important issue that is often raised in controversies over genetic engineering of food. Especially in Germany these controversies are omnipresent and have led to many disputes, protests and restrictions.
Unfortunately many people who debate about genetic engineering have only little background knowledge. Consequently the content of the discussion is often unobjective and emotional. A negative effect of GM food on humans is not approved sufficiently yet. Supporters of GM food say that genetic engineering of crops for example is needed to address the world’s food needs. In this case the sustainability of food security and availability is an important topic because the population increases [3 ]. Biotechnological methods could help increase food production since generating genetically modified crops can provide protection from pathogens. Besides fewer insecticides and"

ULaval,2018,Team:ULaval#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," implications must be carefully considered - is synthetic artemisinin really cheaper? How can synthetic biology help the farmers whose livelihoods have been disrupted by a decrease in demand for sweet wormwood? How can synthetic artemisinin be responsibly produced and consumed? Without giving due thought and consideration to the existing methods of artemisinin production, it would be a travesty and tragedy to brashly impose synthetic artemisinin on all its consumers.
Drugs aside, there are currently exciting ongoing research involving the food industry. Biotransformation is a multidisciplinary platform within A*STAR focused on developing microbial fermentation processes to produce high value ingredients more sustainably[10]. By using microbial and synthetic biology methods of producing ingredients, food production becomes less land and weather dependent and in higher quantity. A similar case in chemical manufacturing is the story of truffle oil. Truffle oil was previously available only through foraging of truffles, which are also seasonal. However, with artificial truffle oil in production since 1980s, constraints on quantity and seasonality have been greatly removed or eliminated[11].  Synthetic biology is also actively applied to other fields, leading to the development of potentially transformative applications, such as in therapeutics and biomaterial production. For example, in California, at the startup Bolt Threads, spider silk is produced using genetically engineered yeast[12].
A major obstacle preventing widespread adoption of these novel synthetic biology-based technologies is economic feasibility. Yield is a common problem affecting many new bioreactor fermentation and bio-manufacturing processes. As engineered cells are not naturally inclined to produce the intended products, doing so induce metabolic burden. increasing yield must therefore be achieved by balancing against cell metabolic stress due to production. Furthermore, semi-biologically produced drugs and compounds are larger than chemically produced ones, presenting production challenges and keeping costs high. In large-scale bioreactors, due to the time taken for the diffusion of substrates, heterogeneous conditions between different parts of the bioreactor can create different kinds of reaction conditions and different stresses for different cells. This variability makes bio-manufacturing more expensive and unpredictable. Lastly, for drug production and quality control, the conditions for protein 3D-folding also makes it susceptible for viral contamination[13].
Nonetheless, the global bio-based market remains a growing market with high potential, driven by synthetic biology[14]. It is anticipated to reach US$38.7 billion by 2020, based on predictions by market research company Allied Market Research[15]. Governments all around the world, from the United States to China, are increasingly acknowledging the immense potential of bi"

Oxford iGEM
An iGEM team from Oxford generously offered us help in mathematical modeling of our experiments. We appreciated their operative and precise work a lot. We have agreed on the collaboration over a couple of Skype calls and continued to manage the deal by the emails over a period of two months. The description of the modeling Oxford team performed can be found here.
What is more, we did not only collaborate on the dry lab, but also on the Human Practices side. Since we found out that our projects looked quite similar and were based on the creation of probiotics, we have launched a survey on probiotics delivery method and compared the results between two countries. The results of the survey are described here.
WashU iGEM
We are very grateful to WashU StLouis iGEM team from Washington, USA, who agreed to collaborate and asked to confirm their results of a biobrick characterization. They have chosen to characterize a part from this year’s distribution kit – a HSP promoter. We have organized the collaboration over a friendly online conversation. The details of a biobrick characterization can be found here.
Aachen iGEM
We have organised collaboration with Aachen iGEM team . We tried to find out the opinion and to define the current knowledge of the common public about genetic engineering in Lithuania. Our team managed to question 57 people of different educational background. Results revealed that the majority of people in Vilnius were poorly informed about genetic manipulations.

Earlier measurements of other bacterial laccases showed that the elution of these laccases begins with a elution buffer concentration of 50 % equates to 250 mM imidazole. One explanation of this result could be a low concentration of the produced TTHL. Consequently all elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to detect TTHL. In the chromatogram no further peaks were detected. The following increasing UV detection signal by increasing concentration of the elution buffer results from the rising imidazole concentration of the Ni-NTA elution buffer. The corresponding SDS-PAGES are shown in Figure 5.

In Figure 5 the SDS-PAGE of the Ni-NTA purification of the lysed E.coli Rosetta-Gami 2 culture containing BBa_K863012 is illustrated. It shows the permeate and retentate of microfiltration and diafiltration respectively, several fractions of flow-through, wash and the elutions with different buffer concentrations respectively. The selected samples were taken where peaks were seen in the chromatogram. The His-tagged TTHL has a molecular weight of 53 kDa. Apparently the concentration of TTHL is too low to see a band.

Figure 1: The Chain-Node Model of a E.coli cell
Example of a species: pLacI*:LacI4 and its tree structure of binding.
Here is another example of template species with more complicated structure.(see Figure 2) In biology, LacI tetramer (or LacI4) can bind with promoter pLacI as a repressor. When bond with LacI4, pLacI is repressed and its transcription speed will decrease significantly. In order to express this alteration, as mentioned above, we use another part of pLacI* with decreased transcription speed instead of pLacI in the species.
The structure of binding sites is shown in figure (see Figure 3). The graph indicates that LacI monomers first bind together to form LacI dimer, then LacI dimers forms LacI tetramer, and finally LacI4 binds with pLacI* to form pLacI*:LacI4.

Modeling with Templates
Manual modeling of biological system is widely used in synthetic biology. However, it requires an overall understanding of the biological network and large amount of data, making it difficult even for professionals. Actually, the data provided manually are redundant because different reactions may occur with a same mechanism. Based on this idea, we introduce the concept of Template, which is the minimal data set for describing biological reaction networks, as a feasible way to implement automatic modeling. The term “automatic” does not mean modeling without providing any information. Instead, we aim at providing minimal amount of data. Similar to C++ programming language, templates allow generic description of species of a certain structural pattern or reactions of a certain reaction mechanism.
Substituent and Template
There are two kinds of templates: Template Species and Template Reactions. They are designed to represent a family of species with similar structure and a family of reactions with similar mechanism respectively. In order to realize this idea, we add the container of Substituent into MoDeL. There are currently six objects in this container, ANY, ANYUB, ONE, ONEUB, NZ and NZUB. Though defined differently, they actually serve the same purpose: representing other parts. Let’s take ANY as an example (see Figure 4). ANY, represents parts on ONE chain and the number of represented parts can range from zero to infinity. For example, a DNA species"

2) GalKO using the GalKO primers and the pCS33 template
3) TEF with no adjuvants
4) TEF with BSA

Ran a gel of the PCR reactions.  1% agarose.  Loaded 10 uL of each reaction and 2-log NEB  ladder.
500bp product for the + control reaction, as expected
Got a 1.5 kB product from the GalKO reaction- this looks to be correct.  There is also a faint band at ~4kb.  This is likely template- perhaps I'll use less next time.
No products were visible in the - CTRL or TEF reactions.
Thinking about trobleshooting the TEF reaction- maybe the template is wrong?  I'd like to try using our primers in a whole cell reaction with W303 yeast.  It should pull the TEF promoter out of the genome if the primers are correct.  Also, I found a paper detailing their generation of variants of the TEF1 promoter using error-prone PCR.  They list their primers- perhaps we could use those instead.
(http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/full/72/8/5266)
Streaked out plates of W303a and W303alpha from plate & gly stock to try out the GalKO and to use as template for the pTEF PCR reaction.

Aachen,2015,Team:Aachen#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Size
Most iGEM teams usually work with wetlab crews of around 9 people. Some teams have scaled up to more than 15 or even more than 20 people.
As team size increases, the number of samples in the freezers go up to. When we did the survey in July/August, some teams had already accumulated more than 1500 samples.
Distribution of Total Sample Amounts
When the survey was conducted, many teams had less than 100 samples. At the same time most of the teams were scaling up and kept more than 500 or even more than 1500 samples.
Freezer Organization Performance
While 72 % of the teams are able to get a sample in less than a minute, only 22 % are able to achieve the same performance in the theoretical scenario of the tube being not were expected. Half of the participants indicated that they search for more than 2 minutes and sometimes for more than five minutes when they do not find a sample right away.
Documentation Strategies
Almost two thirds of the teams use handwritten (38.9 %) or Word (24.1 %) documents for the documentation of their wetlab work. 18.6 % of the teams that participated in our survey used a wiki-based documentation system. Among another 18.5 % did not use a text- or wiki-based system, the lab management software labguru was most popular.
Popularity of different documentation strategies
Documentation strategies are very different between teams. Both 'old school' and 'new fancy stuff' technologies are widely used.
Conclusion of survey
From write-in-questions, we have condensed the following advices for newcomer iGEM teams:
think of organization rules before starting in the lab
use a centralized system and enforce the rules
get rid of old samples that are not longer relevant
connect your sample labels with your documentation
involve everyone with the sample storage rules
don't forget important information like date, concentration, name, strain...
Especially for teams that are already using Wikis to document their work, we recommend our new sample management system at tubefront.com because it helped us to avoid chaos-driven frustration and increase our wetlab efficiency.
Safety
Overview
We regard safety regulations as a necessity for our own well being and the environment. A high-quality solution of a problem is of no value if the damaged created exceeds the benefits of the solution.

An electrometer that could be connected to a PC was purchased and is set up in a way that the black rod’s metal tip (negative) is constantly touching the anode, while red rod’s tip (positive) touches in on the cathode. Not only voltage with respect to time can be detected this way, but also the current can be measured in series and readings in the milliamps range should be expected.
First, before adding the liquid medium or bacteria inside the cell, the resistance is checked and it should be in the Mega or Kilo Ohms range (if not, the electrodes are touching touching the bolts and there is a need to reassemble).
Controls: Bacteria in M9 Media and methylene blue inside the fuel cell, with no TPA
Experiment name: Selecting Exogenous Mediator Type and Concentration
What experiment will show: Will show which exogenous mediator type and concentration has the biggest color change.
Reason for doing experiment: Exogenous mediators are essentially water-soluble redox molecules that can shuttle electrons from the microbe to the anode and therefore allowed us to use microbes without electron shuttling membrane proteins in the fuel cell. This experiment will show us which exogenous mediator type and concentration is the best for the microbial fuel cell.
Materials: Methylene blue, neutral red, C2566H, C2530H, M9 minimal medium
Experiment methods: We tested two strains of E. Coli, with two different types of exogenous mediators (methylene blue and neutral) at 6 different concentrations (0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001, 0.0005). This would determine which exogenous mediator type and concentration is the best with a bacteria known to work in a microbial fuel cell (using the mediator method rather than the membrane protein method).
We decided to test methylene blue and neutral red as exogenous mediators because The 2013 Bielefeld iGem team worked on a similar experiment and these two mediators worked best for them. (iGem Bielefeld, 2013).
Based on the Bielefeld team’s experimental work, we conducted an experiment with our E.Coli and the exogenous mediators to see if they were able to reduce these. The overnight reduction of methylene blue and neutral"

Repression studies
Colonies were cultivated in the dark in the TECAN plate reader during 24 hours and GFP fluorescence intensity was measured during that time. It turned out that the fusion strategy 1 (full UVR8 directly fused to dTetR) represses most in the dark state.
Plans
In a next step we plan to measure also the derepression of the UVR8 dTetR fusion by screening its UV response with the plate reader and carry out single cell analysis by FACS and finally join UVR8 and pABA systems/RecA and show increased E.coli UV-B tolerance (sun cream properties).
