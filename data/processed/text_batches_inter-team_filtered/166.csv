A plot of output against repressor present is given for a set input which shows the expected switching off of output at a threshold (this is the reverse of an activator switch on, effectively).
Violacein Synthesis
Sent the order to DNA2.0! The GeneDesigner file was send, along with the ApE files for the vio operon and the vector we hope to splice the operon into (pPB3K3). The final design is shown below:
Design specifications were also finalised:
The gene consists of five open reading frames (vioA-E) each preceded by a ribosome binding site. The whole sequence is held within the BioBrick registry prefix and suffix
The DNA sequence of the prefix and suffix cannot be altered in any way
As overexpression of the violacein operon can be toxic for the bacteria, we would like the operon under control of an inducible/repressible promoter, such as the T5 promoter suggested by Jeremy.
With the exception of the prefix and suffix (which cannot be altered) the following restriction sites are forbidden within the operon: EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI, NotI
If possible, we would like the genes to be optimised for E. coli and preferably B. subtilis as well
In order to easy gene separation, we would like restriction sites on either side of the vio C and the vio D genes.  Ideally ones with compatible overhanging ends such as BamHI, BclI and BglII

Packaging: The RXers extracted the TOPO plasmids from the E. coli and ran a restriction digest. To ensure the correct dCBD length, both cut and uncut DNA  was run on a gel. The results of the gel determined the possibility of sending in plasmids with dCBD for sequencing on Monday.
Week 5: June 26-30
Monday (06/26/17)
Sense/Respond: The students began another week of hard work. They made a gel to run their previous Plasmid Digest. Next, they looked at the gel under the blue light and found the band they were looking for at 3.2k base pairs. Next they scalpeled out the desired band and began a gel extraction using the QIAEX ll Agarose Gel Extraction Protocol. After the gel extraction they tested their results on the Spectrotropsesis. The first sample was lower than preferred and the next sample had a very uneven graph, but with the desired numerals. Afterwards, the mentors discussed and determined to still do a legation the next day and see the results.

LMU-Munich,2012,Team:LMU-Munich#Data#Vectors_-_-_TEXT.html," STRONG CONSTITUTIVE INSTEAD OF IPTG-INDUCIBLE!
pSBBs0K-Pspac is a replicative expression vector with a kanamycin resistance. The IPTG -inducible promoter Pspac is followed by the multiple cloning site and a terminator. Moreover, it contains lacY, encoding aβ-Galactosid-Permease, and lacI, encoding the Lac-repressor. In the presence of IPTG, LacI is released from the promoter and the gene of interest is expressed.
The ble gene encodes the bleomycin resisitance protein (BRP), which can be used for by bleomycin selection in E. coli and B. subtilis. We did not use this resistance.
The presence of the vector can be checked by colony PCR with the primers: CTACATCCAGAACAACCTCTGC and TTCGGAAGGAAATGATGACCTC. We did not perfom the colony PCR because we selected for functionality of our lacZ-construct (see figure below) on plates with X-Gal and IPTG, and got blue colonies.
lacZ-activity in Miller units in pSBBs0K-Pspac depending on B. subtilis growth phase.
This expression vector was tested by insertion of lacZ into the multiple cloning site, transformation into W168 and ONPG assays. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 in LB-medium and incubated at 37°C, 230 rpm. Cells were harvested in 2 ml reaction tubes and frozen. For the induction assay, a culture of about OD600=0.9 was split into 3 ml aliquots in test tubes with different IPTG-concentrations and incubated for another hour. (Same results were obtained for OD600=0.3, data not shown.)
lacZ-activity in Miller units in pSBBs0K-Pspac depending on IPTG concentrations.
In summary, the figures show that the expression is uniformly very strong [in comparison to the native B. subtilis promoters], even without addition of IPTG. It does change depending on the growth phase, with a maximum strength in the stationary phase.
This vector was designed for the inducible overexpression of proteins, but is constitutively active.
Possible reason for these results are: a dysfunctional Lac-repressor, or point mutations in the operator. This needs to be checked by sequencing.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Best Basic Part Special Prize
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are *many* opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts. To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize.

Captain and Programmer
Hi, I’m the captain of this team, and I’m in grade 11. as the captain, I didn’t do much experiment works. Instead, I finished the frame of wiki (maybe the next team will use it too) and the modeling. In school, I enjoy the process of learning biology and computer science (I know some knowledge about Python and HTML), which is the motivation of joining iGEM. In the free time, I like to play badminton.
This will be my first and last time of joining iGEM. When I was in grade 10, my teacher told me iGEM in the technology day of our school. I decided to join this competition right after I heard specific details about it. At the start of our iGEM project, I participated in most of the experiment works, because I have learnt more in genetic engineering than my teammates. From the mid-stage of our project, my teammates has more time and experience with the experiment part, I started to spent most of my time on Wiki and modeling works. All in all, I enjoy the time I spent on iGEM.

Captain and Art Editor
I am studying in Grade 12 now. Just as other 12th grade students, I am really confused with my future life in the university. I am having trouble with deciding the major of my university study. What I prefer is to learn something about Art; it can be designing or music, those will all be fine for me. However, what my mom wants me to do is to learn biology, because her own company is close relate to biology, and she wants me to take care of her company when I finish my school life. To be honest, I have lots of interest on biology, especially when we have class in the lab. I am always excited with the experiment and I can do well on it. Therefore, I thought iGEM would be a really helpful experience for me.
Instead of focusing much on the experiment, my major work is to complete most of the mission with art (logo designing, poster, and the power point for the presentation). I am really proud that my speciality can help my teams.

Figure 10: BioBrick integrative base vector <partinfo>BBa_K300000</partinfo>.
Figure 11: Parts notation.
This vector can be considered as a base vector, which can be specialized to target the desired integration site in the host genome. The default version of this backbone has the bacteriophage Phi80 attP (<partinfo>BBa_K300991</partinfo>) as integration site.
This vector enables multiple integrations in different positions of the same genome.
Glossary
The passenger is the desired DNA part to be integrated into the genome.
The guide is the DNA sequence that is used to target the passenger into a specific locus in the genome.
Design features
The main design features for vector engineering and for the genome integration of the vector are reported below.
Vector engineering features:
The cloning site is compatible with the original BioBrick standard (RFC10), i.e. it is composed by the BioBrick Prefix (<partinfo>BBa_G00000</partinfo>) and Suffix (<partinfo>BBa_G00001</partinfo>). The presence of illegal restriction sites (XbaI in <partinfo>BBa_J72001</partinfo> and SpeI in <partinfo>BBa_K300991</partinfo>) prevents the usage of this backbone in the classic BioBrick Standard Assembly process. However, the presence of unique EcoRI and PstI sites in Prefix and Suffix fully supports the assembly of the desired BioBrick parts in the cloning site upon EcoRI-PstI digestion and also supports the 3A Assembly.
The two NheI restriction sites flanking the default integration guide sequence <partinfo>BBa_K300991</partinfo> enable the engineering of this backbone by assembling new user-defined BioBrick integration guides upon XbaI-SpeI digestion, if the desired guide conforms to the RFC10 or a compatible standard.
The default insert <partinfo>BBa_I52002</partinfo> contains the positive selection marker <partinfo>BBa_P1016</partinfo> and the pUC19-derived replication origin <partinfo>BBa_I50022</partinfo>. <partinfo>BBa_P"

    d. During this phase preserving microbes will greatly affect the cost of production, and affordability is one of the most important characteristics of JACOB.
2. Medium Scale Trial
    a. Duration: 4-5 months
    b. When the production of microfluidic chip is resolved, how to prepare it for using will be on the agenda. Currently the chip we used for final packaging needs to be soaked in ethyl alcohol and acetone for about one hour, which pose a question for mass production.
We asked 博奥 mainly on how to control the cost of microfluidic chip production¬. From their experience we found that chips cost much more in the early development, but its cost diminishes quickly in later stages when mass production is reached, ranging from $0.1 to few dollars. However, there exist a conflict of material. In the iGEM version we picked optical cement instead of PMDS for its advantages of adequate solidification speed, feasibility, bio-inertia, and precision of altitude. However, PMDS production industries are much more matured. There is currently no companies offering mass production of optical cement microfluidic chips. Thus, we must decide the better material.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#EricDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," of the VioA reaction. Next step by VioE is the rearrangement of the IPA imine dimer to protodeoxyviolaceinic acid, which can non-enzymatically oxidize to prodeoxyviolacein or, by VioC via deoxyviolaceinic acid, oxidize to pink deoxyviolacein. The flavin-dependent oxygenases VioC and VioD require interaction with the oxidized form of flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (uniprot, uniprot) . The two enzymes act sequentially: first, VioD hydroxylates protodeoxyviolaceinic acid, leading to protoviolaceinic acid. Second, VioC creates the oxindole at the 2-position of one indole ring, leading to violet violacein (Balibar CJ et al., 2006) (Janis J. Füller et al., 2016) .
Relocating the pathway into the peroxisome enables proximity of the enzymes and substrates. Furthermore the yeast cell is protected from the toxic substance hydrogen peroxide. Yeast peroxisomes have no problem with this as their main function is the beta-oxidation of fatty acids and the detoxification of the thereby produced H2O2 (Erdmann R. et al., 2007) . Because VioC and VioD are FAD-dependent, it is additionally an evidence for FAD availability inside of the peroxisome, if the synthesis of Violacein works. Otherwise the two enzymes would not be able to catalyze the reaction.
The genes for VioA, VioB and VioE were amplificated via PCR with Golden Gate compatible overhangs from the biobrick VioABCE (Part: BBa_K274004) .
By Golden Gate cloning the peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS1) was attached to the C-terminus of every pathway protein. Combined with the other necessary parts of the toolbox they represent the level 1 plasmids.
The PTS-tag marks the proteins for the import into peroxisomes. This should first of all point out the functionality of the yeast’s natural import mechanism and also be the basis for demonstrating our own modeled PTS*, proving our designed orthogonal import mechanism . Furthermore we also aim to optimize the working conditions for the enzymes inside of the reaction room - the peroxisomes. For example to vary the pH with new membrane proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin. To secure this"

Characterization of promotor PcstA , was done by meassuring levels of mRNA during growth. The promoter is sensitive to the glucose concentrations, which was tested in the experiment.
The bacterial two-hybrid system has never been introduced to iGEM before. For this reason we wanted to validate the function of the system. To examine if the bacterial two-hybrid system can be used to study protein-protein interactions, we made a control experimental setup, where the leucine zipper region from the GCN4 yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) protein were fused to the T18 and T25 domains (T18-Zip+T25-Zip). As leucine zippers form homodimers, their interaction should lead to functional complementation between T18 and T25.
We used the E. coli K12 BTH101-strain, which is deficient in the gene encoding adenylate cyclase, cyaA. Our results showed that only when leucine zippers was fused to both T18 and T25, complementation was observed. We wanted to carry out a screening for peptide aptamers, but due to delayed deliverance of our nucleotide library and problems inserting it in our scaffold, we did not accomplish this.
17 parts were sent to the Parts Registry. In Submitted Parts you can browse through our parts and be redirected to the Parts Registry. Here you will find more information on our parts, e.g. function, sequencing and characterization.
This year we participated in iGEM's Second International InterLab Measurement Study . The goal of this study was to measure fluorescence from three different devices expressing GFP. We were able to measure the fluorescence of these devices using FACS. The data we acquired showed that there was a relative difference in promoter activity in the mutated promoters compared to the wild type.

Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," resulted in a region of red surface. This problem occurred on all computers with Maya installed, under many different settings, even in Autodesk Max, but not on our in-house expert Merry's computer. For now we just use print screen to get the image and will worry about rendering later.
At the same time Ceser asked us to study the following techniques in Maya: Dynamics, nParticle, and APBS extension of ePMV for calculating the electrostatic force of a protein. Like everything else in Maya, the APBS extension doesn't work as we have intended; for some reason it complains error occurred when executing a line in the script but without the details necessary for debugging. As a result nothing came out of APBS extension. Even worse we were going for the IMD extension of ePMV for calculating the molecular interactions, but that was not released which we just found out this week.
Week 13: July 22 - July 26
Turns out by re-configuring the light source immediately after importing .pdb files into Maya, the ribbon and atom models will render beautifully. Unfortunately this trick doesn't work for the surface models. Nonetheless we generated some really high definition pictures (8192*8192 pixels with 220 pixels/inch) for the website. At the same time Justin has been transferred to work on Maya with us. I taught him everything I knew, from creating simple objects to do basic dynamics.
Rai asked me to do some modelling on beta-lactamase, which will likely be the reporter in our system. What she wants to get out of this study is to understand, say given two different concentrations of substrates, at what time will their differences be largest such that we can tell them apart. Unfortunately beta-lactamase is very fast enzyme such that the reaction mechanism is not studied in detail. Then I remembered what my chemical engineering professor taught me: when reaction is fast, model mass transfer. For our lateral flow strip system, the substance will spend most of its time diffusing before react with beta-lactamse, whose reaction will be rapid. Then by timing when the reaction occurs we have a measurement of the diffusion and hence will tell us how much substance was there initially.
Week 14: July 29 - August 2
Cesar asked us (Justin and I) to divide up our work. So I was working on the quantitative modeling while he worked on the qualitative modeling. The task I was asked to do was to figure out how to simulate TALE binding to DNA, according to laws of physics. We were hoping for using the electrostatics plug-in and"

Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#Daily Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," We also digested dCas9 with XhoI and ClaI restriction enzymes and ligated it into two of our Plasmid 1 backbones. This is an overnight ligation, so we will transform it tomorrow. We also picked new Plasmid 1 colonies to plasmid prep and try to improve our yield after the two serial digestions with ClaI and SalI-HF and gel extraction. We made cryogenic stock of Plasmid 1 constructs #1 and #9, two of our best sequenced plasmids.
Sequencing results arrive. There is an insert in the backbone, but it is not the one that was expected. Expected GFP4, received GFP2. This must be due to a contamination or mislabeling. Just the thought of this gave Clay the heeby jeebies, which were so bad that God knows he might still have them. Because only two of the four primers annealed in the sequencing reaction (the two that anneal into the backbone), it was decided to retry the reaction using the other two primers (that anneal in the CDS) and send for sequencing again. This was attempted, but the sequencing center on campus responded that the plasmid (template) DNA concentration was too low. Six cultures inoculated with cells on plate streaked on 7/1 to be plasmid prepped tomorrow.
Thursday, July 10, 2014
Ashlee and Emily plasmid prepped 6 Plasmid 1 constructs - 3 from #1 and 3 from #9. We changed the plasmid preparation protocol to a 30 minute centrifuge spin after the cell had been lysed and digested with RNase because we were not seeing clean and compact cell pellets after 20 minutes. 30 minutes improved the pellets significantly and we got higher DNA concentrations. We then digested these with ClaI for 7 hours (instead of the previous 4), heat inactivated for 25 minutes, then PCR cleaned the digest. We then digested with SalI-HF overnight for 7 hours. We hope that this additional digest time coupled with increased centrifuge time during plasmid preparation would result in greater amounts of digested backbone. We also performed two transformations of the dCas9-Plasmid 1 ligations.
Plasmid prep of six tubes inoculated yesterday. Samples re-sent for sequencing on campus with higher DNA concentration. (76.5 ng/ul today vs 24.1 ng/ul yesterday). Several improvements made to plasmid prep"

CUHK Information day (22 OCT 2017)
Through outreach activities, we collected opinions from the public about our project and concerns related to synthetic biology. This was precious chance for us to go out of laboratory, and get our project and synthetic biology connected to the community.
Visiting local community lab: DIYBio (12,19 JAN 2017)
DIYBio is the first growing biotechnological social movement in Hong Kong initiated in 2016. Through this platform, we hosted one public sharing session, presented our project to the audience and discussed safety issue with them. We also attended a talk given by HKU iGEM 2016 Team organized by DIYBIO Hong Kong and they shared with us their experience in iGEM.
Vibrant Science Academy – Summer Science Party @Hong Kong Science & Technology Parks （Sundays in JUL and AUG 2017）
We invited iGEM HKUST Team to collaborate with us. Holding a booth in this public science carnaval, we aim to arouse general public’s interest in biology and our project. Through fun interactive activities, kids learn simple and basic biology. We taught children to build origami model to allow kids understand the basic structure of DNA. We had another game “Who is the criminal?” focused on DNA application, allowing kids and their parents to know that DNA is closely connected to daily life. We promoted basic knowledge of synthetic biology to their parents as well. We encountered some talented kids with special interest in molecular biology and we met a few professionals in the field as well, they gave us rewardful advices and comments on our project.
International public engagement
Due to the high population, East and South East Asia is the global source of influenza. In addition, rapid spread of Influenza is more serious in undeveloped country due to less developed system. Therefore, our project and the idea of synthetic biology should also be introduced to the publics in those countries. However, most underdeveloped countries don’t have the concept of synthetic biology. Among the region, Bangladesh is country affected by influenza and without the concept of synbio. Therefore, we first choose Bangladesh as the first targeted country.
First ever synthetic biology event in Bangladesh (16 JUN 2017)

Aachen,2017,Team:Aachen#Plant_-_-_TEXT.html," specifically is a high affinity transporter in the plasma membrane [35–37]. Since sodium has a      negative effect on the efficiency of AtAKT1 [38], we did not combine a sodium accumulating mutant with this channel but rather created a separate mutant called NAKT. Therefore, we integrated      the channel in the plasma membrane of a mutant with ENA1 and NHA1 already knocked out.
Fig.11: 2D topological structure (left) and function (right) of AtAKT1. AtAKT1 uses ATP to actively import potassium into the cytosol. CYCLN and ANKY are intracellular regulation domains. Overexpression of is channel not only increases the uptake on potassium (a nutrient) but also increases salt and drought resistance.
AtSultr1;2 encodes for a high-affinity sulfate transporter that naturally occurs in Arabidopsis thaliana and is expressed at epidermis and cortex of its roots [39]. AtSultr1;2 belongs to a      family of sulfate transporters and due to studies with mutants the AtSultr1;2 seems to be the most important one. The mutant having a AtSultr1;1-knockout showed up a phenotype similar to      the wildtype while the Sultr1;2-mutant showed differences in the phenotype compared to the wildtype relating to root length, growth and sulphate uptake. This confirms the assumption that      AtSultr1;2 plays a major role in the sulfate uptake system [10,9].
Outlook
To reach our goal of desalinating waste water with genetically modified microorganisms we chose the yeast strain Sacharomyces cerevisiae as our preferred biological system. The wide range of      genetic tools that make it possible to easily modify genes in yeast in addition to its fast growth and simple cultivation conditions make S. cerevisiae a perfect model organism [40].      Furthermore, the natural ability of yeast to sequestrate different molecules in its large vacuole and resist huge osmotic pressure made us pick out yeast as our favourite microbe. [41]
But this system of locking up salts in the vacuole is not restricted to yeast, but may be implemented for other organisms.  Our far-reaching aim is to transfer our system of overexpressed ion         channels and eliminated efflux mechanisms to an algae species. Algae also own a vacuole to accumulate salts and do not rely on an external carbon source, because of their ability to run         photosynthesis. Transferring our system to these algal cells,"

Characterization of synthetic promoter library
Overview
To find the optimal regulatory system to integrate in our genetic circuit, we designed eight versions of the lldR-promoter that would be released from repression by LldR upon addition of Lactate. With our synthetic promoters we are planning to achieve higher sensitivity and reduced leakiness in respect to the natural version. We will remove the ArcA binding site to avoid unspecific regulation and will add LldR and LldP with higher expression levels than in the natural promoter, helping us to achieve the desired levels of expression. More information about the design process for these promoters can be found in our Part Collection

For characterization of the promoter, we cloned all versions in front of a reporter-GFP. We then measured the sensitivity of our designed promoters to a range of Lactate concentrations by monitoring the GFP produced by our bacteria expressing constant LldR along with the nine reporter plasmids. Further information on the experimental setup can be found here .
We tested the following combinations of plasmids:
a medium copy plasmid containing our designed lldR-promoters followed by a reporter GFP ( lldRO1-J23117-lldRO2 - B0034 -sfGFP)

Performance of PSO
In contrast with simulated annealing, another method we used to optimize parameters, PSO performs much better both on the efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, PSO is good at dealing with very large parameters because it is a global optimization algorithm.

Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA)
A general objective in our modeling process is an exploration of the high-dimensional input variable space as thoroughly as possible for its impact on observable system behavior, often with either optimization in mind or simply for achieving a better understanding of the phenomena involved. Since the system input->output behavior is typically a nonlinear relationship, simple logic suggests that the number of runs could grow exponentially with the number of input variables. However, an emerging family of high dimensional model representation concepts and techniques capable of dealing with such input->output problems in a practical fashion. RS-HDMR is a global sensitivity analysis technique that can decompose the high-dimensional, nonlinear contributions of each parameter to the network properties(represented by their total sensitivity) into a hierarchy of low-dimensional terms. Calculations by RS-HDMR require only the ODE model, an estimate of the initial conditions and an estimate of the dynamic range to explore for each parameter.
Introduction to GSA

Why GSA?
Theoretical Foundations of GSA
High dimensional model representation(HDMR) is a general set of quantitative model assessment and analysis tools for capturing high dimensional IO system behavior.

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Notebook#Engineering#ODF_-_-_TEXT.html,", there will be not enough light registered at the sensor, and the resolution of the measurement shrinks. This should be prevented. The chosen light to frequency sensor is reported to be very sensitive on the amount of light shining on it. There are reports of the sensor breaking when put into sunlight on a nice day , and not being sensitive at both high light or low light conditions .
Evaluation of the Optical Density Measurement
From Transmittance to True Optical Density
At very low levels, uncorrected photometric determinations of cell densities show a decreasing proportionaility to actual cell density.
This can also be observed using our device.
In general, photometric determination of bacterial concentrations depends primarily on light scattering, rather than light absorption. Therefore, often not absorption is measured, but transmittance. For this, the relationship between optical density (OD) and transmitted light $\frac{I_0}{I}$ exists as:
$$ OD = \frac{I_0}{I} = \kappa \cdot c$$
where $I_0$ is the intensity of incoming light and $I$ the amount of the light passing through.
However, this equation is linear only in a certain range. While one can tackle this non-linearity by using dilutions of the culture, correcting the error systematically is another way to overcome this limitation.
For our OD device we needed to correlate the transmittance measured by our sensor to an optical density anyway. Our team members from the deterministic sciences emphasized on the correction method, which was conducted according to Lawrence and Maier (2006):
The relative density ($RD$) of each sample in a dilution series is calculated using $\frac{min(dilution)}{dilution}$.
The uncorrected optical density is derived from the transmission T [%]: $OD = 2 - \log T$
Finally, the unit optical density is calculated as $\frac{OD}{TD}$.
The average of the stable unit optical densities is used to calculate the true optical density $ OD_{unit} \cdot RD $.
This way, the correlation between transmission and true optical density can be computed. The derived function allows the conversion from transmission to optical density on our device and therefore calibrates our device.
In our experiments, we find in accordance to Lawrence and Maier that the correction majorly depends on the technical equipment used, especially the LED, sensor and cuvettes. While this at first sight looks disappointing, it is also expected: Transmittance is the fraction of light not absorbed by some medium relative to the cell-free and clear medium. However, the transmitt"

Human Practices
An important part of developing a system is evaluating the impact TERRA will have on various communities. Through our interactions with the synthetic biology and microfluidics communities, we were able to gauge the effect of TERRA within these groups. Additionally, our outreach also served to educate the greater STEM community and in doing so, help bridge the knowledge gap barring many from the field of microfluidics. All of the feedback we received from these interactions helped improved the design, usability, and accessibility of TERRA.
Human Practices
Integrated Human Practices
Throughout the summer, our team has worked with STEM Pathways, an outreach program sponsored by the National Science Foundation aimed to inspire and engage students in synthetic biology and engineering. We participated in various outreach events hosted on the Boston University campus, such as Summer Pathways on July 18, 2018 and Day of Learning on August 4, 2018.
During these events, our team introduced the basics of microfluidics to rising high school students and led microfluidics-based activities for hands-on learning. The events started with a brief overview of synthetic biology and its impact on our world, then led to activities for synbio and microfluidics.
We began our activity by briefly explaining the components of microfluidic chips and the advantages of incorporating microfluidics into synthetic biology. Our activity involved creating paper representations of potential microfluidic chips for synthetic biology protocols, such as ligation or PCR. This allowed the students to understand the thought process behind creating a chip design and how features of the chip accomplish steps in the protocol. Our team then led a tour of our lab space, where we distributed microfluidic devices and walked the students through the goals and basic workflow of the lab.
Our team has also designed a new activity that will be implemented in future outreach events. The students will be able to create droplets similar to those in droplet-based microfluidic devices using common culinary ingredients. This aims to be a highly-interactive, hands-on activity that engages students and increases interest in microfluidics.
We also assisted with high school lab trainings and the Biobuilder Panel. During the high school lab training, members from our team hosted and taught"

LMU-Munich,2012,Team:LMU-Munich#Spore Coat Proteins#cloning_-_-_TEXT.html," to fuse the genes for the crust proteins cotZ and cgeA to the terminator and gfp to the three chosen promoters. Unfortunately, there occured a mutation in the XbaI site during construction of gfp in Freiburg Standard. Therefore we were not able to finish these constructs. Finally we needed to clone our constructs into an empty Bacillus vector, so that they could get integrated into the genome of B. subtilis after transformation. For that purpose, we picked the empty vector pSBBS1C from our BacillusBioBrickBox ,  for the cotZ constructs. This vector integrates into the amyE locus, which allows to easily check the integration by starch test. In order to also express both crust protein constructs in one strain, the cgeA fusion proteins had to be cloned into another empty vector, pSBBS4S. Unfortunately, for unknown reasons, the cloning of the constructs with cgeA into this vector has so far not been successful.
Moreover, we wondered if clean deletions of the native spore crust genes would show any difference in fusion protein expression in our Sporobeads. Thus, we deleted the native cotZ and cgeA using the pMAD based gene deletion strategy described by Arnaud et al., 2004 .
In the end, we were able to finish five constructs and integrated them into wild type W168 and the ΔcotZ mutant:

Overview
Polyketide is a large family of structurally diverse compounds[1]. It exhibits a wide range of biological and pharmacological activities, particularly the antimicrobials. As far as we know, many antibiotics are derived from polyketide such as methymycin, erythromycin, amphotericin and so on. Nowadays, reaserchers about polyketide synthesis are focusing on the whole gene cluster of original polyketide or combinatorial biology[2]. However, we can’t use the each domain flexibly by combinatorial biological methods. The study of the whole gene cluster limits the exploring of the modularity of polyketide synthase. All these researches didn’t make good use of the modularity of polyketide synthase.
Programmed Polykitide Synthesis (PPS)
This summer, our team developed a novel approach for creating customized polyketides that overcomes the above mentioned limitations by engineering synthetic Polyketide Synthetases (PKSs). PKS is “called” the assemble line of polyketide. PKSs are very complicated that contain several kinds of domains in one module. Each module catalyst is to extend, modify or terminate the polyketides chain. By standardzing the domains of different functions, we can design and synthesize structurally various polyketide what we need just like programming.
Triketide Lactone Synthesis (TKLS)
First of all, we attempted to synthesize triketide lactone by engineering Polyketide Synthetase—DEBS1+TE. Based on fact that single domain have independent function[3], we assembled domains in some order to create new module of PKSs that can"

The three specialists oriented us on the several regulations and normative that we should check over in order to proceed according to the national and international law and security
Residuality: Described in the national program of control and monitoring of toxic residues in honey, carried out by SENASICA. (National Service of sanitation, innocuousness, and agri-food quality)
Regulations of the European Union regarding food safety.
Zoosanitary regulations (NOM-ZOO)
Federal Animal Health Law
Entomology protocols
Maximum limit of allowed residues in honey (After looking over we found out there is no regulation regarding AMPs; we could later validate this information in the IV State’s Beekeeping Forum with Dr. Sóstenes Rodríguez)
Since the aspects mentioned were evaluated after the meeting, we realized the need to create a legal plan where the project would really considerate and comply with all its legal and security implications.
In addition to covering the legal aspect of our project, we were able to consult with the MVZ bee specialists about the anatomy of the bee; an important aspect to consider since the nanocapsule will travel through the nurse bee until reaching the larvae.  After arduous research and incorporation of the received advice in this meeting, we were able to know in detail the anatomy of the bee and integrate the important factor of it to our project design. ( Consult details about the bee anatomy ). When we were discussing the terms of the anatomy of the bee we both realized that some terms had different words but referred to the same part. We also had the opportunity to become aware that some very specific parts of the bee could influence the nanocapsule path that we were analyzing.
Regarding the technical part of the project, the attendees to the meeting recommended us that at the time of the experimentation part with bees, some innocuous dye could be added to make sure that the nanocapsules were reaching the larva. In addition, it was discussed how there is greater production of larvae during flowering, and in this time artificial feeding is not widely used; thus we concluded how our product would be optimal to be used before the period of flowering, so at the initiation of the greater production of larvae, if the bacteria, which mainly infects in the first days of the bee larva, attacks, the antimicrobial peptide will already be found in the medium to reach the objective.
We also had the opportunity to know a little about the perspectives and concerns of the three persons in the meeting. They perceive the problem that the regulations"

UANL_Mty-Mexico,2012,Team:UANL Mty-Mexico#Modeling#transport and accumulation_-_-_TEXT.html," now on:
We assume that ArsB is non functional, so that the only protein affecting As transport is GlpF.
GlpF effect is masked by the population level kinetics.
We assume that the intracellular As concentration and the GlpF effect at the population level (that is, considering total cell volume) are homogeneously distributed and should be the same as in a single cell.
The protein MBPArsR is not present in our system, so the variable MBPArsRAs is not considered for our model.
The next equation shows the application of those modifications:
\begin{equation} \large\frac{\mathrm{d[As(III)in] } }{\mathrm{d} x} = -ArsR_{As} -n_{f}\cdot fMT_{As} + (\frac{V_s}{V_c}) \cdot V_{max} \cdot \frac{As_{ex}}{K_{t}+As_{ex}}  \end{equation}
Now, let us introduce a variable called AsTOTALin, which represents the total amount of arsenic inside a cell (recall core modification number 2), whether free or bound to whatever protein. Let's also call AsFREEin the amount of free intracellular arsenic and AsBOUNDin the protein-bound As. In this way, AsTOTALin can be represented as follows: \begin{equation} \large[As_{TOTALin}] = [As_{FREEin}] + [As_{BOUNDin}] \end{equation}
In the iGEM Groningen 2009 model, Asin represents the free intracellular arsenic, as this variable has negative terms related to the binding of As to proteins; to avoid further confusions, we'll establish this equivalence as follows: AsFREEin, so that equation 2 changes to:
\begin{equation} \large[As_{FREEin}] = [As_{in(iGEM Groningen 2009)}] \end{equation}
If we further analyze the AsBOUNDin variable, considering that in our system only ArsR and a methalothionein (which we'll simply call MT) are being expressed, then equation 5 turns to be:
\begin{equation} \large\large[As_{TOTALin}] = h_{2}[ArsR|As] + h_{3}[MT|As] \end{equation}
Where h2 and h3 are the Hill coefficients for the interaction between As and ArsR and MT, respectively.  Finally, taking into"

x
We choosed the Ssp DnaB S1 split-intein because it has high ligation kinetics which reduces the time of reaction (Aranko et al., 2014). Also, Volkman et al., 2011 have proved that the intein reaction can occur in Escherichia coli without affecting the cell viability. Aditionally, the high specificity of the C-intein recognition avoids undesired cleavege of other proteins (Tropilina & Mills, 2014). This IP has already been used in iGEM and it's in the repository.
2. Release of split TEV
In order to allow the reaction to occur only with the Cas9 conformational change, we decided to insert the C-intein in one of the hotspots and the complement intein in a second hotspot. Thus, when the Cas9 binds to the target ARN the distance between the insertions is reduced and the intein reaction takes place. Because we aimed to release an amino acid sequence inside a domain we had to excise not one but two peptide bonds. For that reason, one of the insertions consists of a split TEV protease joined with a trans-splicing Npu DnaE N-intein and flanked by two N-inteins. Therefore, when the insertions become closer the C—intein will cleave both N-inteins and release a split TEV protease used in our response module. The trans-splicing intein was added to allow the reconstitution of the split-TEV in the mentioned module.
Figure 2. Intein mediated dCas9 detection system. Only when the dCas9 is associated to both target and sgRNA, the C-intein Ssp DnaB will react with the N-terminals inteins.

Based on the protein structural model we decided to insert the smallest sequence in the REC lobe because it suffers the most aggressive conformational change. In contrast, the longest insertion which included the split TEV protease joined to a trans-splicing Npu DnaE N-intein and both N-inteins was inserted in the HNH domain. Also, we added the flexible linker 2x (GGGS) on both sides of each insertion to allow a better interaction between the split inteins. According to Chen et al. (2013) flexible linkers are usually used to provide a degree of movement and"

BostonU_HW Collaboration: Microfluidics
We collaborated with the Boston University Hardware team . We followed the protocols they provided us and assembled three types of chips: PCR, digestion and a toehold chip they designed specifically for our project. To test out functionality of the chips we used color dye to imitate the process of biological fluid flowing into the chip. The toehold chip had a relatively serious leakage problem, and air bubbles in the valves blocked the way for color dye to get through. We hypothesize several reasons that explained why the leakage happened and redid some steps to improve the assembly. After several rounds of tests and trials with all the chips, we gave BU Hardware team some feedback about our thoughts of the chips and how it could potentially be improved. We also pointed out steps on the protocols that appeared unclear to us as users and suggested them to explain purposes of certain steps better to make sure users understand why they are important.

MIT Collaboration: Adding an MS2 Domain to Triggers
We collaborated with MIT to test the potential for their RNA binding protein (MS2) to sterically protect our RNA trigger from exonuclease degradation. For the MS2 protein to be able to recognize our trigger DNA, a hairpin loop structure was added at one end. After DNA is transcribed into RNA, the MS2 protein binds to the hairpin loop on the RNA sequence. The below is a flowchart showing the procedures of collaboration. MIT designed the hairpin loop that was added to the trigger sequences we provided them. We eventually put MS2 protein, trigger and toehold sequence into cell-free. However, due to potential contamination of trigger RNA, we were not able to get valuable cell-free data."

However, BFP only seemed to cut with X,P.  The TetR gene RD again only gave one band.  However, after a closer analysis and manipulation of contrast of the gel pic, a faint line where the insert had been can be seen.  Also looking at the previous gel of C0040, the same bands are there.  Thus, the restriction digest was working, but the bands were so faint, they could barely be seen.  Fortunately, after looking through the registry, we found a composite TetR part, P0440, that already has the RBS-TetR-term combined.  In addition to transforming this part from the 2011 iGEM plates, I also prepared a ligation of my GFP, RFP, and BFP with terminator as well as GFP and RFP with B0034 (RBS).

Project Overview:
Since the isolation of GFP in 1962, fluorescent proteins have become a ubiquitous tool for studying cellular processes and have found applications in synthetic biology - for example serving as a reporter of the performance of the canonical repressilator.  To be better suited to the increasing precision of biological experimentation and the increasing sophistication of synthetic networks, however, these proteins will need to be more quantitatively characterized and used.  To this end, the 2011 VT iGEM team is interested in finding and optimizing good fluorescent reporters which mature and degrade quickly, and which fluoresce brightly.  This involves establishing a framework for modeling and characterizing fluorescent proteins, and then using this framework to find fast-maturing proteins and degradation tags that help destabilize and degrade them.  We hope that this work will lay a good foundation for a more quantitative use of fluorescent reporters in the future.
To tackle this problem, we have split our team into three specialized groups focusing on the Design, Fabrication, and Characterization of our fluorescent protein constructs.  This transdisciplinary approach allows us to work more quickly and achieve more ambitious goals
Design
Design Team Members:   Mark, Daniel
The Design Team designs biological constructs and makes predictions about their performance using the software tool GenoCAD.  As a Computer Assisted Design (CAD) tool, GenoCAD has a repository of biological parts, grammatical rules that help users put them together, and an attribute-grammar-based structure that helps users make predictions about how their assemblies will perform before they are made in a lab.  The Design Team works with all of these aspects of GenoCAD - searching for promising fluorescent reporters, promoters, and degradation tags to add to the repository, writing grammatical rules specific to this project that govern how parts can be put together, and using attributes to model how they expect our constructs to behave.  This software has been very useful to our project and has made it easy for the Design Team to quickly design many constructs and pass information about them to the Fabrication Team.

Experiments
The genomic extraction was carried out to purify the P. aeruginosa DNA that contains the desired set of genes. In order to have a sufficient quantity of DNA, the cells were grown overnight and the DNA was released in to PBS. Following the extraction, an agarose gel electrophoresis was carried out to determine the presence of genomic DNA. The extracted DNA was diluted. Multiple dilutions were performed in order to obtain the optimum diluted conditions for the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). PCR was performed using these dilutions to amplify the genes of interest using the primers that were custom designed. These primers contain the restriction enzyme sites that would be used to cleave the gene later on during transformation. Following the PCR amplification, the amplicons were visualized in a TBE gel for the correct band size. Due to difficulties in PCR, the correct band size was not observed. However, once the correct band size is obtained, the amplicons would be purified using a PCR purification kit and will be used for downstream applications."

While the children were listening to our story about bacteria, we told their parents something about synthetic biology and the iGEM competition. In conclusion, this festival was a very useful way to reach out to the public and a small step in acquainting the general public with synthetic biology. Our team is very proud to contribute to sharing this knowledge.

Open Days
At the Open Days of our university, high school students will take a look at different studies and faculties to find out what they are interested in. During these days our team will present the iGEM competition and the TU Eindhoven team to the future students. We will explain the term synthetic biology and explain why the iGEM competition is important and interesting. Moreover, we want them to get interested in the field of research and challenge them to get the most out of their studies.

As we want our hydrogel to be as thin as possible while remaining effective, we synthesized this 0.75 mm thin hydrogel to demonstrate that our hydrogel material is suitable for creating such a thin patch. We could demonstrate that a hydrogel of this thickness could be synthesized and handled, illustrating that our ideal patch that we have modeled can also be produced in reality.
Figure 5. Patch prototype investigated for the wound healing application & modeling experiments
Hydrogel with cavity
This prototype (figure 6) was used to improve the consistency in the adhesin experiments. Polydimethylsiloxane molds were created                          in collaboration with Dr. Manoj Sharma through which a glass rod can be inserted halfway into the centre of the gel. Pouring                          the polymerizing gel mixture into this mold results in the synthesis of the cubic cavity hydrogels.

Columnar shaped hydrogel
We created columnar shaped hydrogels varying from a 96-well plate volume (figure 7) for the initial adhesin                          experiments to a 1 mL columnar shaped hydrogel for modeling experiments.

Collaboration iGEM Hamburg team 2018
As a collaboration, the iGEM Hamburg team 2018 was looking for a suitable hydrogel for their project.                          They desired a hydrogel that is stable under acidic conditions, is non-toxic, and                          non-degradable. We sent our hydrogel, and iGEM Hamburg team 2018 tested our hydrogel on all these different                          requirements. Our hydrogel turns out to be remarkably stable under varying conditions which exceed the tolerance of most common bacteria.

4.Isolate the plasmid with the correct phenotype and digest it, to test that the insert is around the expected size.
Only trpL + RFP ligation was correctly done according to the phenotype observed and to the restriction pattern obtained once the plasmid was isolated.
Characterizing LovTAP
18-30  October 2010.
Once LovTAP with the three weak constitutive promoters (J23117,123114 and J23105) was correctly obtained in plasmid Psb3k3, and the reporter system trpL+RFP was also finished by our team , we started the co-transformation procedure in order to have the whole system inside the cells both trpR wild type and trpR mutant. Besides, we also receive  the trpL+RFP construction from Lausanne team that was kindly sent it by Edinburgh team, because we didn’t get any response from the members of  Lausanne team to provide us with their reporter systems. We are using both our trpL-RFP reporter system and the Lausanne system as a reference, expecting to obtain the same results. The difference between the reporter systems is that ours doesn’t have the double terminator.
Experimental procedure
The samples used were: trpL-RFP reporter system in plasmid pSB1C3, Lausanne trpL-RFP reporter system, LovTAP under promoters J23117, J23114, J23105 and RFP under J23102.  Qualitative approach TrpR mutant and wild type cells were co transformed using 5 µL of each plasmid (trpL-RFP in pSB1C3/ pSB1A2 and each LovTAP construction in pSB3K3). For each co transformation one  tube containing 5 ml of  LB medium with Kanamicyn and chloramphenicol or Kanamicyn and ampicillin, was inoculated from  a single colony of DH5α. Cultures were grown  overnight (~15hrs) at 37°C with spinning at 250rpm in dark conditions. Then, 1 ml of broth was taken and transferred into 5 ml of fresh LB medium with antibiotics. The cultures were grown for approximately 13 hours under the previous conditions but some were exposed to blue light (470nm) while others were maintained in dark. Finally,"

Problems
How hard is to work in Brazil?
BioBricks Kit Problem
This year, our team faced problems due to the delay in the delivering of the BioBricks Kit. The arrival of the kit on the right time is essential for the wet lab activities to happen as planned, so the iGEM project can present the desired results. This     kind of delay can be prejudicial for the iGEM teams' performance along with the bureaucratic difficulties already intrinsic to the importation of biological material, especially on Latin American countries. In 2014, the iGEM Tec-Monterrey team faced     a similar hold-up that led to the creation of a law project to facilitate importation process.
In Brazil, the National Agency of Sanitary Vigilance (Anvisa – Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária) is the responsible for the regularization of products, equipments, food, drugs and cosmetics, among other national and international products. Created     in 1999 (Law n° 9.782, January), Anvisa carries out sanitary supervision as well as the economical supervision of the Brazilian market. One of the functions performed by the agency is the sanitary inspection of products, seeking to know their origins,     use and destiny of the imported goods. It's a highly bureaucratic process that demands a long time from the receivers, once it's necessary to fill forms, elaborate texts and even pay a sending tax (GRU – ""Guia de Recolhimento da União""). In several     cases, the bureaucracy coordinated by Anvisa keeps the products from arriving to its destination and sends the imported product back to its original country.
Our team's BioBricks kit, as well as other Brazilian teams' (Brasil-USP and UFMG-Brazil), were kept by Anvisa's sanitary inspection on May, what resulted in a three-week delay on the delivering time. We've highlighted that the shipping was tax-free,     since we've been helped by the University's administrative sector. The team also sought information on the necessary papers for the"
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Modeling2_-_-_TEXT.html," absolute distance moved in the timestep and \(\xi_{r}\) is a normally distributed random number with mean 0 and variance 1. To calculate the distance that particles have actually moved depends on what dimensionality we are operating in. We work in polar or spherical poar co-ordinates in 2D and 3D respectively, and so sample angles \(\phi\) and \(\theta\) and uniformly distributed in the ranges [0,\(2\pi\)] and [0,\(\pi\)].
Random Velocity
We initially take a collection of particles at position \(\mathbf{r_{0}}\). We give them random velocities uniformly distributed in the range \(\left[-2\mathbf{v},2\mathbf{v}\right]\) (where \(v\) is determined by thermal fluctuations) and decide that the direction of these velocities should change direction (or not) with some probability after every timestep. We summarise this process in the algorithm below.
For each particle, generate a random speed \(s\) in a random direction.
Compute the position of the particle after a timestep \(\Delta t\).
Generate a random number \(r\) uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.
If \(r<\dfrac{s^{2}}{2D}\Delta t\), calculate a new random direction of velocity for the particle.
Repeat steps 2-5 for each particle until a certain time or computational budget is exhausted.
Compartmental diffusion; Gillespie
We can divide our region into a system of compartments
\[A_{1} \mathrel{\mathop{\rightleftharpoons}^{\mathrm{k}}_{\mathrm{k}}} A_{2} \mathrel{\mathop{\rightleftharpoons}^{\mathrm{k}}_{\mathrm{k}}} ... \mathrel{\mathop{\rightleftharpoons}^{\mathrm{k}}_{\mathrm{k}}} A_{N-1} \mathrel{\mathop{\rightleftharpoons}^{\mathrm{k}}_{\mathrm{k}}} A_{N}\]
such that the only difference in their propensities is related to the number of particles contained in each compartment. This will produce a correct model of diffusion if the proportionality constant \(k\) is chosen as
\[k=\dfrac{D}{(dx)^{2}}\]
where \(dx\) is the physical size of each compartment [ 2 ]. We now run the Gillespie algorithm but with \(2(N-1)\) reactions to consider.

Add 1 µL HCCA matrix solution to the spotted sample aliquots. Pipet up and down approximately five times to obtain a sufficient mixing. Be careful not to contact the AnchorChip. Note: Most of the sample solvent needs to be gone in order to achieve a sufficiently low water content. When the matrix solution is added to the previously spotted sample aliquot at a too high water content in the mixture, it will result in undesired crystallization of the matrix outside the anchor spot area.
Dry the prepared spots at room temperature
Spot external calibrants on the adjacent calibrant spot positions. Use the calibrant stock solution (Bruker’s “ Peptide Calibration Standard II ”, Part number #222570), add 125 µL of 0.1 % TFA (v/v) in 30 % ACN to the vial. Vortex and sonicate the vial.

Phage Therapy Now
Modern advances in phage therapy and how phages infect bacteria.
Click the arrow above for more information.
Introduction:
According to the Phage Therapy Center, bacteriophage therapy is defined as “the therapeutic use of lytic bacteriophages to treat pathogenic bacterial infection.” (1) And while this technique was discovered prior to antibiotic treatments, inconsistent results and a lack of understanding caused it to be almost completely overshadowed by antibiotics. (2) The ever increasing issue of antibiotic resistance has led to a phage research revival. Modern knowledge of bacteriophages gives hope that phage therapy will not only work with but surpass antibiotic treatment.
Bacteriophages are viruses that target bacteria to reproduce. The phages do this by injecting their DNA into the host. The bacteria can then enter one of two phases, the first of which is the lysogenic phase. In the lysogenic phase, the viral genome integrates into the bacterial DNA and goes into a hibernation allowing the cell to replicate on its own until it enters the lytic cycle. In the lytic cycle, the bacterium is used to create parts of the phage"
Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," to spread faster. Compared to our other tested constructs we got the most reliable results for yhjH. However the positive effect on motility was not present when we used M9 minimal medium swimming agar. Here, yhjH-transformed cells usually did not show a strong tendency for swimming. This result suggests that the motility-effects of YhjH are somehow nutrient-dependent and therefore depend on the used media.
fliC
Fig. 7: The fliC gene encodes for flagellin, which represents the single subunits of the flagellar filament. The used E. coli strains (DH10B, BL21, XL1 Blue and DH5α) are typical laboratory strains with degenerated flagella and thus reduced motility (A).  We assume that the overexpression of fliC might lead to the incorporation of further flagellin subunits and hence to longer flagella compared to earlier (B).  The electron microscope image (C) features the flagella of the strain MG1655, which still possesses unimpaired, long flagella. Our aim is to restore the phenotype of  the laboratory strains flagella and to receive a length comparable to that of MG1655.

Flagellin, the product of the fliC gene is the structural protein that builds up the filament of the bacterial flagellum (Fig. 7). By overexpressing fliC we hope to construct longer flagella which might have a positive impact on swimming speed (Furuo et al. 1997). At the same time we were aware that overlong flagella might cause adverse effects due to an obstructive architecture.
The fliC gene was amplified from DH10B E. coli genomic DNA and contained four forbidden restriction sites. We had to mutate all these sites via overlap PCR. A description for this method can be found here .
Results
Our overlap PCR for the mutation of three PstI and one SpeI sites worked efficiently and fast. The resulting PCR product was not cut by any BioBrick standard 10 enzymes.
In order to avoid too strong levels of expression we included 1kb of the upstream region for most of the assays to allow a certain level of regulation in the cells. Like yhjH-transformants these strains showed increased motility in almost all of our assays (Fig. 6). On the minimal medium M9 agar plates they were usually significantly faster and"

Luminescence Measurements
The constitutive promoters PliaG&43 (BBa_K2705008), PliaG&43-1 (BBa_K2705009), PliaG&43-2 (BBa_K2705010), PliaG&43-3 (BBa_K2705011) were evaluated in the reporter vector pHT01-Px-GFP. The promoter activity results in gene expression and production of the green fluorescence protein (GFP). The fluorescence intensity (FI) was measured by the Multimode Plate Reader Enspire (PerkinElmer).
All clones showed a normal growth behavior. As the σB recognition site of P43 we added is a lag phase sigma factor binding site, we tested the FI at the very beginning (the lag phase, Fig.1a) of its life. All the modified promoters except for the promoter PliaG&43-2 (BBa_K2705010) outperformed the original promoter PliaG at the lag phase. The activity of the best promoter, PliaG&43 is about 1.5 times as high as the activity of PliaG. The promoter PliaG&43-2 (BBa_K2705010) still has a slightly higher activity than the promoter PliaG (Fig.1)

The strains were cultured in LB medium with 5 µg/mL chloramphenicol in dark for 2 hours. Fluorescence intensity of GFP was measured, which was normalized against OD600. Data indicate mean values ± standard deviations from three independent experiments performed in triplicates. ** Very significantly different (P < 0.01) by Student's t-test.
Result
As these promoters are all constitutive promoters, the activity enhancement at the lag phase can surely enhance the promoters' effect, which has achieved the goal of promoter enhancement as well as the part PliaG (BBa_K823000)'s improvement.

Yale,2015,Team:Yale#results_-_-_TEXT.html," riboregulation system that controls expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels.
Biofilm formation on surfaces is an issue in the medical field, naval industry, and other areas. We developed an anti-fouling peptide with two modular components: a mussel adhesion protein (MAP) anchor and LL-37, an antimicrobial peptide. MAPs can selectively attach to metal and organic surfaces via L-3,5-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), a nonstandard amino acid that was incorporated using a genetically recoded organism (GRO). Because this peptide is toxic to the GRO in which it is produced, we designed a better controlled inducible system that limits basal expression. This was achieved through a novel T7 riboregulation system that controls expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels.

MAPs can selectively attach to metal and organic surfaces via L-3,5-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), a nonstandard amino acid that was incorporated using a genetically recoded organism (GRO). Because this peptide is toxic to the GRO in which it is produced, we designed a better controlled inducible system that limits basal expression. This was achieved through a novel T7 riboregulation system that controls expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels.

SWISS-MODEL service proposes a protein sequence homology based 3D modeling5. It performs sequence homology research through BLAST and on the SWISS MODEL Template Library to begin the structural assembly. If there is no match in the database, the algorithm performs a Monte Carlo technique to find the best conformation.
MODELLER is an software for protein 3D structure modeling. It uses homology for template reference but also implements a structure reference based prediction of the most potent conformation6.
Simulated Annealing
When dealing with a protein as large and complex as ours, 3D prediction approaches described above  are not sufficient for obtaining an adequate structure. We then performed simulated annealing on the 3D model obtained through the previous approach. This process involves first a protein energy minimisation, then a series of heatings and coolings. This enables it to exit a local energy minimum and re-settle in a more global energy minimum.
Simulating Annealing was performed using sander, from the Amber16 suite. Amber is a suite of biomolecular simulation programs used both for generating parameters for molecules to be simulated and for simulating those molecules over time7. It was first released in the late 1970s and is consistently kept up to date and features a large range of tutorials and forums to help users. All simulations performed with Amber16 used the ff14SB force field for topology and parameters of standard amino acids in the protein...
The minimisation phase was performed over 5,000 cycles to find the lowest energy point, holding the streptavidin and CBM3a domains fixed.
Orthos was heated and equilibrated following these steps:
0 - 200ps: Heat from 100 K to 330 K
200 - 500ps: Equilibrate at 330 K
500 - 700ps: Cool from 330 K to 310 K
700 - 1000ps: Equilibrate at 310 K
Each of these was performed with an integration time of 2 femtoseconds.
IDR Conformational Sampling and Exploration
The challenge here was the complexity of the IDRs. During the previous phase of our study, we were faced with the limitations of classic protein modelling methods.  These approaches generally search for secondary structures (helices and sheets) connected by short flexible connectors (3-10 residues), but when faced with a long region lacking in secondary structures, they fail to predict an appropriate structure.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#Library#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," with RpoZ, the omega domain of RNA polymerase, via a c-Myc-linker to enable selection for good target affinity.  In the first steps, the constant regions of our binding protein scaffolds (Monobody and Nanobody) were ordered as gene as synthesized IDT G-Blocks® and inserted in the vector via Gibson assembly.
After finding the optimal randomized codon scheme for Monobodies and Nanobodies, respectively, we had to decide how to generate the library. Most of the gene synthesis companies do not offer long gene fragments with partly randomized sequences and if they do the synthesis of a whole library is prohibitively expensive (about 5-10 k€) and time consuming. Therefore, we decided to do the gene synthesis of the library ourselves and ordered a small number of larger, partly randomized oligonucleotides (from Metabion).
The ordered oligonucleotides had complementary overlaps for annealing. Double stranded fragments were generated by a single touch-down fill in reaction to achieve and maintain maximum diversity. After generating the double stranded library fragments, these were cloned in the library vector using a Gibson assembly, due to the incorporated overlap with the vector.

UCLouvain,2016,Team:UCLouvain#Experimental_-_-_TEXT.html," a sequence including only histidine codons for heavily degenerated primers. The figure 3 illustrates the effective design of lightly degenerated primer for our first library (Library 1 on figure 2).
In comparison to a fully randomized mutagenesis approach, our “semi-rational targeted mutagenesis approach”, as we decided to call it, should proportionally yield a lot more valuable mutants. We haven’t seen any project using this kind of approach and we wanted to show that, even in a short amount of time, random mutagenesis can be a wonderful tool for synthetic biologists. It is, as we found, a very interesting way to work on protein design problems.
Once the libraries were created, all we needed was a strong selection design and the time to reduce our diversity down to a few mutants that would fit our needs.
Figure 3: Design of the degenerated primers
Selection method
Our selection method was based on the work of Spagnuolo et al. (2010) as explained in the background section of this wiki. Its particularity resides in the fact that through two different selective growth media we’re able to select the open phenotype on one hand and the closed one on the other hand.
Selection of the open phenotype is achieved with a minimal media, containing maltose sugars of polymerization degree 4 through 6 as sole carbon source in a ΔLamB strain of E. coli.
Selection of the closed phenotype on the other hand is achieved on regular LB Growth medium with vancomycin.
To select an inducible opening or closing of the porin, we compared viability on the two previously mentioned media in presence and absence of our transition metal ions (Zn2+ and Ni2+). If, on the same medium, a mutant survives in presence of the ions and dies in its absence or vice-versa, it possibly contains a porin for which the gate opening or closing is regulated by Zn2+ or Ni2+. The mutants selected through this step should be further investigated and characterized.
These successive steps of selection are illustrated on figure 4.

Here is our selection process in a table form:

The Project
Project
Our team’s project is Dr. Coli, an E. coli bacterium that produces a drug when and where it is needed in the human body. It does this in an intelligent way, such that the drug production meets the individual patient’s needs. And when the patient is cured, Dr. Coli eliminates itself from the body. To achieve this goal we divided our project into several subsystems. A detailed description about every subsystem can be found by clicking on one of the following pictograms.

For the Bayesian network it will be a little bit complicated. For an investigation of a DNA and b TALE, we first compute the probabilities of 1 DNA binding, existing on the same space with {b,b-1,b-2,¡­,1} TALE respectively. Then to find the probabilities of n DNA we assume no interaction and apply binomial distribution to get the result from the corresponding 1 DNA case. Thus we obtained the probability of moving from the state of n DNA with m TALE to, the state of n-1 DNA with m TALE (if DNA exists) or the state of n-1 DNA with m-1 TALE (if DNA binds). Then the entire network from n DNA with m TALE to 0 DNA m-x TALE will give us the distribution where we can ask the expected number of DNA binds.
For now the simulation method is very easy to code so work has been started on that front. The Bayesian network approach is very interesting in its own right and we wish to develop the method further.

P2 uninfected(t)  = population of secondary receiver cells that have not received a DNA message
P1 ori(t)  = population of primary receiver cells carrying the original DNA message
P2 ori (t) = population of secondary receiver cells carrying the modified DNA message
P1 mod (t,a) = population of primary receiver cells of age a at time t. Age a corresponds to how long the cell has been a P1 mod cell. This is important to know because of the turnaround time between receipt of a DNA message and accumulation of phagemid and protein to fuel viral particle production.
P2 mod(t)  = population of secondary receiver cells carrying the modified DNA message
Mori (t) = concentration of M13 viral particles carrying the original unmodified DNA message
Mmod (t) = concentration of M13 viral particles carrying the modified DNA message
Parameters:
c = carrying capacity of the liquid growth medium
g = maximum growth rate of cells that are not producing viral particles in absence of pressure due to carrying capacity
r = maximum growth rate of cells that are producing viral particles as a fraction of g
k = adsorption rate of viral particles to cells
i = induction constant. i = 1 when message modification and retransmission is induced, and i = 0 when it is not induced
S(i) = rate of switch flipping per primary receiver carrying Mori. Depends on induction.
p = rate of viral particle production through intact M13 cistrons on the helper plasmid
b = the percent rate, relative to p, of viral particle production in primary receiver cells through complemented helper plasmid with gene VIII knockout. Assumed between 0 and 1.
j1 = age at which viral particle production begins in P1 mod cells. Production starts at zero at age j1 and increases.
j2 = age at which viral particle production reaches its maximum and continues to maintain a steady rate
When modeling the growth of each population over the course of the experiment, the carrying capacity of the media had to be considered. To simplify our equations, we define:
We built a differential equations (DEs) model of the system using these state variables and parameters, which is described below.
The DE for senders is a simple logistic growth equation:

Syntetisk biologi er en mulighet til et paradigmeskifte i samfunnet med tanke på vår oppfatning av hva levende ting er. Hvis vi tar bort bakteriers ”unødvendige” funksjoner og får dem til å produsere ting som vi trenger, vil disse bakteriene fremdeles betraktes som levende organismer, eller har de blitt maskiner? For å sette fokus på denne problemstillingen har vi valgt en kunstnerisk tilnærming ettersom Bio-Kunst er en av de beste måtene å sette i gang en samfunnsdebatt på. Vi har skapt en konsept organisme som reflekterer denne problemstillingen. Vi har modifisert E. coli-bakterier til å produsere lukt og etterlikne modningsprosessen til en sitron. En blanding av bakterier og vekstmedium blandes sammen:  Det vil lukte som, modne som og se ut som, en sitron, men ”Ceci n’est pas un citron” – dette er ikke en sitron… eller er det? Med dette inviterer vi alle til å tenke over hvilke muligheter og etiske grenser vi har når vi designer levende skapninger.

Comparing with most of iGEM teams whose team members come from same school, ASTWS-China is a particular team. Actually our team consists by 15 Chinese students coming from 11 different high schools located in among 8 Chinese and U.S. cities. Therefore, it is so hard for us to work together for most of times. Thanks to the Internet, we were able to have regular online meeting to discuss the project or assigned the works. And this unforgettable summer of iGEM will be our common memory forever.

HYPE-IT Database also include important gene related information, such as the name of the gene and the protein targeted, the paper we have based on or the NCBI accession number. It allows us to organise information in a structured way, in addition to have it interconnected with other kind of databases. Mixing our Database and Software, we are able to obtain the optimal gRNA to a specific HYPE-IT Database gene using the scoring system of our Software. The objective is to reduce steps that plant breeders should do if they wanted to enhance a plant variety giving them all sequences they should order to synthesize.
We are very glad to the result of our Database. If you want to access to it, you should sign in our external webpage, located inside HYPE-IT sofware application.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of g"

INTRODUCTION
Why we choose termites?
Termites are widely recognized as the 5th pest around the world,     based on its astonishing number and incredible damage towards wood.    Given that a termite weighed 1 gram,    then everyone should own 500 thousand termites!     Owing to their wood-eating habits,     termites are terminators of crops,     trees, buildings, river dams；    and more often, spoil people’s life.
Our new system of termite terminator

Virginia,2013,Team:Virginia#Applications_-_-_TEXT.html,"PS is a crucial part of Gram-negative bacteria’s structural integrity and also plays a protective role against certain chemicals and immune effectors. However, it is extremely endotoxic, evoking a strong immune response in human that can result in septic shock.  It was found that hexa-acylated LPS is the trigger in humans, recognized by the human toll-like receptor 4 (hTLR4) and myeloid differentiation factor-2 (MD-2) complex. This complex activates the NF-kappaB transcription factor, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and eventually septic shock.
Thankfully, strains of E. coli have already been made to deal with this toxicity without significantly compromising the structural integrity of the bacteria. One such strain includes a mutation in the lpxM gene, which codes for a late-stage myristoyl transferase essential for the addition of secondary acyl chains on the Lipid A portion of LPS. This prevents the toxic hexa-acylation of LPS and exhibited a 10-fold reduction of toxicity in a murine model. We were able to obtain the lpxM mutant strain from the Yale E. coli stock center for use in our experiments. Recently, it was brought to our attention that a new strain, dubbed “Clear Coli”, utilizes six additional genetic mutations to further lower the risks of immunogenicity. While the strain is relatively new, the results are very promising with >95% reductions in endotoxin response in a Limulus amebocyte lysate test. In the future, we hope to use “Clear Coli” as our standard for minicell production.
