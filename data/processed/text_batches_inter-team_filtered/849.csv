TU-Eindhoven,2012,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," we raised some questions concerning their differential equations. Soon the deadline approached and we have not seen any model results, but we hope we helped them along and that they create inspiring results with their model!
Request iGEM team of Cinvestav
We also responded to a request on the Matchmaker by NTNU-Trondheim. The iGEM team of Cinvestav requested information concerning advices, experiences and other useful information for future iGEM teams. We answered questions posed by the Cinvestav team, such as 'How to create new projects and ideas?' and 'What is the importance of human practices?'. We hope they have received plentiful input from the other iGEM teams, so they can set up an introductory document for new iGEM teams such as ourselves.
iGEM symposium Eindhoven
All Dutch and a few other iGEM teams from neighbouring countries, Germany and Belgium, are invited to join a symposium organised by iGEM team TU-Eindhoven. They are invited on the 3rd of October to have lunch, listen to some guest speakers about synthetic biology, present their own work and to enjoy this gathering with some late afternoon drinks. The aim of this symposium is to get some late critical comments from other iGEM teams and to practice the way to present their own work before the real deal at the Amsterdam iGEM Jamboree. Of course this afternoon is also meant to be a nice way of getting or staying in contact with each other and to have a great day together. Moreover, the entire symposium is open to the public and fellow students and employees have also been invited. If you are one of the teams flying in early to the Netherlands and you want to practice your presentation and receive valuable feedback, you are most welcome to join our symposium!

Aix-Marseille,2016,Team:Aix-Marseille#Medals_-_-_TEXT.html," Our results show even more production than obtained with the WT strain. For more information, please visit this page .
We also helped other iGEM teams:
the Bordeaux team by extracting data  from an article and analyze them.
the Toulouse team by making a model of plasmid loss.
All of this can be found here .
For our human practices, we present the iGEM competition and the use of the synthetic biology in many events .
Gold medal
To reach the gold medal, we worked hard to integrate our human practices to our project.  You can find all this work and how it helped our project right here .
We also improved an existing BioBrick, Glasgow 2014 team's BioBrick ( BBa K1463604 ), making our brick ( BBa K1951008 ). This BioBrick is an improvement of the orignial BioBrick in three ways:
The codon usage has been optimized to ensure a strong expression in E.coli,
The RBS has no mutation so the flagellin is well expressed,
Our swimming test show that the swimming phenotype of the BioBick is improved thanks to our changes.
All the functional tests and experiments, show this part is functional, are listed here .

IPOC2-Colombia,2009,Team:IPOC2-Colombia:Labs_-_-_TEXT.html," all worked in a lab and encountered these biological processes  and laboratory techniques, it was an incredible experience. Throughout the  summer we managed to get some things right the first time we tried, and other  times we made mistakes that in the end, only allowed us to learn even more. Our  mentor, Dr. Cuero, was always there making sure we were on the right path.  Whenever we encountered an obstacle, he’d give us the opportunity of finding  our own solution, in our own creative way, rather than just pointing it out.  For us, this lab experience wasn’t just about performing lab techniques; it was  more about learning, by doing.

Valencia_UPV,2014,Team:Valencia UPV#prueba pag_-_-_TEXT.html," values describe the temporal and spatial distribution of the unknown function.
Although implicit methods are unconditionally stable so time steps could be larger and make the calculus process faster, the tool we have used to solve our heat equation is the Euler explicit method.
Euler explicit method is the simplest option to approximate spatial derivatives, in which all values are assumed at the beginning of Time.
The equation gives the new value of the pheromone level in terms of initial values in that node and its immediate neighbors. Since all these values are known the process is called explicit.
$$c(t_{k+1}) = c(t_k) + dt \cdot c'(t_k),$$
Now applying this method for the first case (with no wind consideration) we followed the next steps.
1. Split time $t$ into $n$ slices of equal length dt: $$ \left\{ \begin{array}{c} t_0 &=& 0 \\ t_k &=& k \cdot dt \\ t_n &=& t \end{array} \right. $$
2. Considering the backward difference for the Euler explicit method implies that the expression that refers to the current pheromone level each time step is:
$$c (x, y, t) \approx c (x, y, t - dt ) + dt \cdot c'(x, y, t)$$
3. And now considering the spatial dimension, it is applied central differences to the Laplace operator $\Delta$, and the backward differences to the vector differential operator $\nabla$ ( in 2D and assuming equal steps in x and y directions):
$$c (x, y, t) \approx c (x, y, t - dt ) + dt  \left( D \cdot \nabla^2 c (x, y, t)  - \nabla \vec{v} c (x, y, t)  \right)$$ $$ D \cdot \nabla^2 c (x, y, t) = D \left( c_{xx} + c_{yy}\right) = D \frac{c_{i,j-1} + c_{i,j+1} + c_{i-1,j } + c_{i+1,j} – 4 c_{I,j}}{s} $$ $$ \nabla \vec{v} c (x, y, t) = v_{x} \cdot c_{x} + v_{y} \cdot c_{y} = v_{x} \frac{"
Hong_Kong_HKU,2015,Team:Hong Kong HKU#Description#ex_-_-_TEXT.html,"ological research has demonstrated that up to 35% of plasmid DNA remain functional even after expose to high temperature and pressure9. Chances are that recombinant DNA may be taken up by natural occurring bacteria even though escaped synthetic organisms are destroyed. Thus, in order to fully unleash the potential of synthetic biology, it is necessary to develop more comprehensive containment strategies to control the leakage of GMO and recombinant DNA.
Exploring new containment device
In light of the demand of better containment strategies, we would like to explore the potential of CRISPR/Cas system as an intrinsic containment device. In this project, we are going to design two prototype repressible killswitches based on two bacteria immune systems against viral infection – CRISPR/Cas3 (originated from E. coli MG1655) and CRISPR/Cas9 (originated from S. pyogenes SF370). In addition, we would like to compare the killing efficiencies of the devices and test our devices out in a simulated scenario using E. coli BL21 (DE3) as the chassis.
For the detail of our containment device please visit our Design page.

Making Molecular Biology Easier
We have designed a novel standardized assembly system, called “Plug 'n' Play with DNA” where ready to use biological parts can be gathered without the use of restriction enzymes and ligase. This will make cloning faster and assembly of expression vectors possible within a few hours. We have created a library of standardized biological parts for mammalian cells and Aspergillus niger ready to plug 'n' play. You can find more information about how this standard works here .
A Reporter System
As proof of concept we have created a reporter system that can be used for anything from monitoring gene expression to determination of protein localization. We expressed and localized fluorescence proteins in the model organism Aspergillus nidulans and the mammalian cell line U-2 OS with great success.
Flexibility
Standardization entails rigidity. Therefore we have written a guide that allows the researcher to customize the system, so proteins can be assembled seamless, multiple mutations can be introduced in one round of cloning etc. The only limitation to this is your creativity.
Applications
Here you can learn more about the numerous applications of the Plug’n’Play with DNA assembly standard and the research areas, where this system is especially advantageous.
Data Page
You can find an overview of our project on our Data Page . Here you also find our favorite submitted biobricks, and the biobricks we characterized during the summer.
Achievements
Designing a novel assembly standard and creating a reporter system for Aspergillus nidulans and mammalian cells are our main achievements. You can read more about our accomplishments on this page .
The Team
We are five girls that have been working on this project for three months with support from our three supervisors. You can learn more about us, and how we started an iGEM team on our Team Page .

Transfer the minicolumn to a clean, labelled 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, then add 30µl of sterile MilliQ directly to the minicolumn matrix. Incubate for 1 minute at room temperature.
Centrifuge for 15 seconds to elute the plasmid DNA. Discart the column and label the tube. The isolate can be stored at -20 °C or directly used.
Primer Working Stock
This protocol is based on the instructions for primer resuspension given by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT).
Centrifuge the tube containing the primer for 3−5 seconds (>3,000 x g) to pellet the material to the bottom of the tube.
Dissolve the DNA material in sterile MilliQ according to the supplier IDT. This creates a 100µM stock solution.
Heat the primer stock solution to 65 °C for 20 minutes.
Centrifuge the primer stock solution at maximum speed (~17,000 x g) for 2 minutes.
Prepare a 10X diluted work solution (10µM) by dilution with sterile MilliQ.
Store both Stock and Work solutions at -20 °C.

The streptavidin affinity chromatography yielded a satisfying elution peak that was then concentrated using a centrifugal filter unit (MWCO: 30 kDa). The concentrated protein was then applied to an ÄKTA purifier equipped with a Superdex 200 10/30 size exclusion chromatography column. The chromatogram shows three major peaks with a first peak near the void volume that corresponds to aggregated protein >600 kDa, a second elution peak of high molecular protein and a third elution peak corresponding to the desired laccase protein. This assumption was made on the knowledge that on this column proteins of arround 50 kDa elute at an elution volume of 14 to 15 ml. This assumption was subsequently confirmed by ABTS activity assays with all elution fractions (see next section).

Figure 12: Mechanism of the oxidation of ABTS which is a model substrate for laccase activity
Figure 13: Correlation of size exclusion chromatography (blue) and activity determination using ABTS (red). Relative values are shown.
The enzymatic activity of the purified laccase was determined by the ABTS-assay. In a first pre experiment the appropriate dilution factor was determined to be 100-fold. The elution fractions obtained from size exclusion chromatography were diluted 1:100 in PBS and in an ELISA plate. 100 µl of the enzyme and 100 µl of ABTS substrate were mixed and a kinetic measurement at 405 nm was performed. The absorption at 280 nm in the SEC chromatogramm (blue) identifies three main protein peaks, with a first peak corresponding to aggregated protein, a shoulder which also corresponds to higher molecular protein and a single peak which was proposed to be the monomeric laccase. The relative activity obtained for the different elution fractions was plotted in the same diagramm and shows a clear peak which matches the laccase peak in the SEC. Beside this major peak a second smaller peak of active fraction was visible which appeared in earlier elution fractions and might correspond to dimerized laccase. As the laccase is a secreted enzyme which also bears dislufide bridges it was produced in the cytoplasm and subsequently it was oxidized to form the proper dis"

There is no cure for RA and the drugs usually used for its treatment are anti-inflammatory compounds with oral and/or parenteral administration. Because of this, the typically prescribed medications potentially have serious systemic side effects. Besides, biological characteristics of the joints make the drug delivery difficult when targeting sites, compromising the efficacy of the treatment.
IFN-β
The type I interferons (IFNs), IFN-β and various IFN-αs, are pleiotropic cytokines acting on a range of cell types and eliciting a diverse range of responses. For many years, IFN-β was thought to be a potential agent for the treatment of a variety of immune-mediated diseases (Vervoordeldonk et al., 2009). This molecule has N-glycosylation sites that increase stability and activity of molecule (Sommereyns & Michiels, 2006).
IFN-β has clear anti-inflammatory properties (Tak, 2004) and plays an important role in bone homeostasis (Takayanagi et al., 2002). Also, IFN-β has the ability to reduce the secretion of proinflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)α, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and prostaglandin E2, which are key players in the pathogenesis of RA (Coclet-Ninin et al., 1997; Smeets et al., 2000). In addition, IFN-β has antiangiogenic properties (McCarty et al., 2002), which could boost therapeutic effect in RA (Gerlag et al., 2001).
The notion that IFN-β treatment may reduce arthritis is supported by animal experiments. Several studies examining the effect of IFN-β in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice have been published (Treschow et al., 2005; van Holten et al., 2004; Triantaphyllopoulos et al., 1999; Tak et al., 1999).
Treatment of RA patients with IFN-β has been unsuccessful so far, presumably as a result of pharmacokinetic issues (van Holten et al., 2005). Novel approaches leading to constitutive IFN-β production at the site of inflammation may be required to induce clinical efficacy in patients.

Symposium
Since none of our team members had any experience in such a big event as the giant jamboree we wanted to recreate this atmosphere in Leuven. A presentation in front of hundreds of people, all with scientific background, can be pretty scary. So to prepare our team and the other teams in the best way possible, we planned to bring as much teams as possible together in Leuven for the European Practice Jamboree.
The goal of this meet-up was to practice the presentations so the team members who are presenting in Boston get used to a stage and a crowd in front of them. Of course we could never reach the same amount of attendees as the Giant Jamboree in Boston but we could try to get together as many people as possible.
We planned this meet-up from the beginning of our journey, because we were very enthusiastic to meet our fellow iGEM teams. First we went to the Benelux Meet-up at Wageningen University, there we had a great time and get to know the Dutch teams. It was really nice to interact with so many young and enthusiastic people, all enrolled in the iGEM competition. The atmosphere there couldn’t be described. This meet-up took place in the beginning of the summer, so the only thing we could present was our project ideas since we weren’t able to start until the summer holidays.
We wanted to go a step further and waited till the 7th of October to make sure the teams finished or nearly finished their project. In that way they could present everything they had done during the summer, which would represent their presentation in Boston. We invited every team from Europe to our European Practice Jamboree, eventually 4 teams responded and attended this event. Representatives of iGEM team Amsterdam, Ionis Paris, Aachen and Munich attended the event. They had prepared a presentation and a poster, every team had the chance to present their project and get feedback from the crowd. In this way the teams are able to adjust their presentation based on the critics and feedback from the other i"

5/30 - MIT Bio Builder lab
MIT Bio Builder Lab
Day one of biology boot camp at MIT was a fun and instructive initiation to the world of synthetic biology. BioBuilder founder Natalie Kuldell structured the day with lectures and lab activities that helped to introduce and explain some of the basic concepts, practices, and goals of synthetic biology, showing some of the current developments in the discipline as well as possible future implications. The experience of being in a lab and hearing the perspective of a scientist/educator in the field provided valuable insight into the engineering process (the design, build, test cycle) and also the attendant possibilities and challenges. It was interesting to see that like computer science and engineering, design in synthetic biology relies upon standardization, abstraction, and synthesis to facilitate the process. This parallel helped to illuminate some of the needs and challenges faced by synthetic biologists, such as moving through the abstraction levels of complex systems, and showed areas that could benefit from the development of new design tools.
It was especially insightful to go through the lab experience from the perspective of one with limited prior experience in biology. It provided a better appreciation for the process of learning and discovery, and also the limitations and frustrations of a novice scientist. Since the project Joanna and"

Chain-Node Model
Figure 1: Logo of Chain-Node Model
In most manual modeling, complex is treated as a whole entity in reactions. Plenty of synthetic biology automatic modeling software treats complex the same way. However, there is a big difference between manual and automatic modeling, that is: Model constructors always know which detail of complex needs to be ignored or preserved, but software does not. So in most software, detailed structure has to be specified by modelers, otherwise will be ignored. In most cases, this requires plenty of manual operations and thus making the software not so automatic. Knowing this, MoDeL chooses to preserve detailed structure in complex and present Chain-Node Model, which view complex as a construction of its parts throughout the modeling process. With chain and nodes, describing large biological complex with a great number of basic units and binding sites becomes possible. It also offers great flexibility in modeling. Detailed concepts are explained below.
Abstract Concept of Chain
When it comes to biobrick assembly, DNA of plasmid is often considered as an abstract straight line where biobricks can be placed on and connected together. It actually acts as the basic frame of biobrick assembly. Inspired by this, we present the abstract concept of chain, which also acts as the basic frame of part assembly. Chain is an abstract straight line where different parts can be placed on and connected together. Part is the basic unit of chain, and chain can"

H2O2 DECOMPOSITION MODEL
Purpose
In our experiment, we found it hard to measure the intracellular H2O2 concentration, so we                     controlled the external H2O2 concentration in culture to confirm our system'                     function. Although the                     H2O2 can entry the cell quickly through simple diffusion, we needed to build                     up a model to simulate                     the intracellular H2O2. At the same time, this model will provide a base for                     roGFP2-Orp1 Michealis                     equation model.
Model simulation
Firstly, in order to describe the process in cells more accurately, three reactions in this process                     are considered: diffusion, fast degradation and slow degradation. The fast degradation is caused by                     some natural reduction molecular (like Glutathione) directly react with H2O2.                     And slow degradation                     is led by enzymatic degradation.[1]

Killing
Talking about my work - killing pathogens is finally what I am made for. In response to quorum sensing molecules of the pathogens, I export a range of antimicrobial substances leading to dissipation of biofilms and the killing of the targeted bacteria.
Suicide switch
When the job is done and all the bad guys are finished, you don't need a super hero anymore. So after fulfilling my work I say goodbye to the world by activating my suicide switch.
Application
Of course I'm not only a fictional hero, but a very real one. In two different prototypes, I could be used for diagnosis or treatment of pathogen-caused diseases. However, there is still a whole lot of regulational and economical questions that have to be answered before.
See you!
So now you know my short story - and it is time for me to return to my fight for a safer world. Feel free to take a closer look on my super powers , the process of my development or the plans for a medical application .

PSB1C3-DAMP-PEXIGANAN/TEV PROTEASE CLONNING
We thought to ,ligate our gene sequence whichs ordered from IDT with the g-BLOCKS form, PSB1C3 firstly to clonning and submittions.  Therefore we digested both PSB1C3 vector and Damp-Pexigan and TEV protease-G-blocks with EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Then we aimed to insert these cuted g-BLOCKS into plasmid with using T4 DNA Ligase. Following ligation, the resulting plasmids were transformed into BL21 competent bacteria.
We did colony PCR in order to check the accuracy of cloning with Veritification Forward and Veritification Reverse Primers. If the clonning resulted negative expecting band would be 314 bp. On the other hand if we succesfully clonned these parts, for DAMP-Pex. Expected band would be 1006 bp, for TEV Protease it would be 1062 bp.
After colony PCR consequences we have put the positive resulted clonnings 16 hours liquid culture  after that we isolated plasmid DNA with miniprep plasmid izolation method. We make cutcheck to our attained plasmid DNAs for put a second control step. Our restriction enzymes those we used are EcoRI and PstI.

We planned; clonning our genes ,whichs clonned succesfully to PSB1C3 vector, into pET45-b expression vector. For producing abundantly protein.  To allow for cloning this vector we withdraw our genes from PSB1C3- DAMP-Pexigan and PSB1C3-TEV protease gene plasmids with using BamHI and XhoI digestion enzymes. We did"

The recommendation will then be to select the action (i.e. precaution or no precaution) that has the smallest amount of regret in the case in question. Then, if we stick to the fixed presumptions (c>e>d) then the actions to choose are precaution in case 1 and no precaution in case 2 and 3. The presumptions are dependent of the specific cases.
The problem with the minimax regret is that it treats the epistemological and the damage condition as quantitative, where the Precautionary Principle has to be applicable to qualitative measures as well. The two conditions have to be thought of as quantitative for the terms of ‘difference’ between them makes sense STEEL, D. 2014. Philosophy and the precautionary principle, Cambridge University Press. .
Scientific Reproduction
We have made it our obligation to follow the virtue of scientific reproduction. It is fundamental for the scientific method and is integrated in the scientific community.
Science began when people started wondering about the significance of their observations. Aristotle was wondering why the stone fell down when he dropped it from midair. He therefore developed a hypothesis about the essences in all things, which explained that the stone was moving towards its natural place - that the stone had a teleos (Ancient Greek: purpose, aim). Nowadays we laugh at that type of explanations but the essence of science still stands: explaining our observations KLAUSEN, S. H. 2014. Hvad er videnskabsteori. Akademisk Forlag. .
Theories and hypotheses have virtues, which a good scientist should comply with, e.g.: to follow the rules of good reasoning, being coherent and explaining a phenomenon. A hypothesis or theory must always have implications that can be empirically tested for it to be of any use. To accept a hypothesis or theory one needs to show that it satisfies all demands - and then it needs to be tested by an objective scientist. This is called the demand of reproduction HEMPEL, C. G. 1966. Philosophy Of Natural Science. Foundations of Philosophy series. Princeton University. .

In our project we tried to follow several other iGEM teams’ protocols and methods for our work. We had success following the protocols from the iGEM teams of Imperial College London 2013 , Tokyo Tech 2012 and Standford Brown 2015 .

Background
Here follows the ongoing discussion amongst the group members about the project we are putting together. In addition we include theoretical support from scientific articles for what we want to accomplish.
Cell penetrating peptide (CPP)
(High importance, really needs to be adressed. What is the best approach to penetrate the skin? What is the best approach to enter target cells? Can one approach solve both problems? If not, would the two approaches interfere with each other?)
""Protein drugs, because of their large size and hydrophilic nature, are normally precluded from effective delivery such as cell entry or tissue diffusion. Among the transport barriers, the skin poses a formidable challenge to proteins because of the impermeable stratum corneum."" - Synthetic Skin-Permeable Proteins Enabling Needleless Immunization p. 2724
Nina: I found this interesting article about a molecule that can penetrate the skin. Thus we have to build fusion proteins of our protein of interest together with a molecule that can penetrate the skin . This is to have them passing through the stratum corneum, which as the article says is a very good barrier.
""To circumvent these problems that confront the current methods, we hypothesized the concept of “skin-permeable proteins”, which would possess skin-penetrating ability and thereby eliminate the need for a transport vehicle."" - Synthetic Skin-Permeable Proteins Enabling Needleless Immunization p. 2724
Nina: The skin-permeable proteins seem to be good for our study concerning a model to have our proteins penetrating the skin.
""[...] we present a novel strategy for chemically constructing artificial skin-permeable proteins, illustrated by the simple conjugation of a protein to a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), which would display a penetration effect on the stratum corneum barrier and transport the attached proteins into the skin."" -Synthetic Skin-Permeable Proteins Enabling Needleless Immunization p. 2724
Nina: They have chemically constructed their CPP, but we will use a recombinant approach, meaning we will insert our genes of interest into plasmids and have bacteria expressing our proteins.
""The CPPs are capable of transporting their cargos, often linked by a covalent bond, into almost all cell types.[2] Among such CPPs, the low-molecular-weight protamine (LMWP) peptide"

Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) is a very challenging pathogen. Not only is it incredibly difficult to treat, it has the ability to persist in the environment for months. Dust, dirt and soil are just some of the things that the bacterium is able to survive on. Clearly this creates a very challenging situation for both farmers and vets trying to eradicate bTB. If a farm is finally declared bTB free status, any area of the farm that may have been exposed to an infected animal (silage, buildings, equipment) may be able to transmit the infection back into the herd. Dick explained how some farmers face a situation where they have to isolate their entire farm, keep the cattle indoors and follow a strict regime to minimise the risk of bTB exposure. Also, Dick made us aware of some current research into the ability of M.bovis to persist in the environment.
Herd Size Increase and Sensitivity Issues
Advances in technology have led to a huge increase in the size of farms in the UK. Not only has the number of cattle increased as a whole, the size of individual herds has also greatly increased. In 1996 the average size of a UK dairy herd was 75 cows3. In 2014 this had increased to 133 cows3. Increase in herd size has highlighted how the current Tuberculin skin test is simply not sensitive enough to allow for a strategy to eradicate bTB in the UK, as shown by the larger dairy farm herds, where recurrent bTB breakdowns are common. Dick highlighted how the current Tuberculin skin test can leave behind cows that are infectious and that in current farming conditions leaving behind even a single infectious animal can lead to bTB breakdown. Large high risk herds are particularly challenging to achieve bTB free status. Dick made it clear that our test would be most useful not as a stand alone, but as a tool that could be used in conjunction with the current test to achieve greater specificity in these high risk large herds.
Points to Consider
Our multiple meetings with Richard (Dick) Sibley helped us as a team understand exactly what situation the UK currently faces with eradicating bTB. Dick made it clear to us the situation of bTB in Devon and Cornwall. With 1.8 million animals tested in Devon and Cornwall in 2014 and 800 farms under bTB restriction, the problem our test is trying to solve is very relevant to our local area.
As well as highlighting some of the fundamental problems with the current Tuberculin skin test, Dick helped us gain an understanding of"
Tsinghua-A,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," this not as dizzying as it is at the first glance. Let’s look at it step by step.
When both promotors are TREs, both split parts are inducible, and channel capacity is relatively higher than that of channels with un-inducible CMVs. In the absence of intein, the two peptides find it hard to dimerize, giving rise to low channel capacity.
Upon addition of intein sequence, the binding process becomes irreversible since the two halves assemble into one intact protein through splicing. As a consequence, channel capacity greatly increases. Double-inducible group with two TRE promotors still win the competition speaking of channel capacity.
Comparing three inducible groups leads to the conclusion, that splitting leads to decrease in channel capacity, but adding intein sequence to peptides rescue the effect, elevating the channel capacity to even higher level.
What can the result teach us?
Inspirations for Synthetic Biology Engineering
For synthetic biologists, it is crucial and challenging to construct AND gate. Split up a regulatory protein such as transcription factor, express two halves independently, and an AND gate is born.
Nonetheless, the act of splitting up can bring about unexpected side effects. Gene regulatory circuits are highly dependent on quantitative properties, its complexity and nonlinearity contributing to hard-to-predict behaviors of biological systems. Once an important part in the system is chopped up, who knows what will happen next?
Our program quantitatively studies the behavior of such systems. Splitting up changes the circuit’s output-input function, alleviates leakage phenomenon, improving switch-like property, and increases fold change when induced by circuit inputs. Moreover, we use channel capacity from information theory to describe how well can they transmit signals. We find adding intein sequence tremendously beneficial in that it shifts the channel capacity to a higher level, thus ameliorating uncertainty.
When it comes to designing logic gates, our findings can lead the way. Not only can splitting achieve logic gate effect, but also can it improve sensibility to inputs and defend the system against detrimental interferences of noise when intein is added. Future work shall benefit from this fundamental investigation of basic synthetic biology blocks.
Highlighting the biological significance of dimerization
Dimerization is only too common in cells. Monomers assembly into dimers for further functions all the time, some interactions strong, some interactions weak. Function-less newborn peptides piece together and get to work, forming so-called tertiary structure; activated kinases reach each other and mutually phosphorylate; transcription factors, when forming homo- or hetero-dimers according to different stoichiometry, leads to varied"

While I was living in the outskirts of Nairobi, I worked as a volunteer in an orphanage of 34 children, from aged six to seventeen. One of the eldest girls at the orphanage attended one of the best schools in Kenya, and she told me that it was common knowledge amongst the more privileged that in very poor areas of the country where people don’t have any money to buy antibiotics and other drugs, there are pharmaceutical companies distributing non-approved (or experimental) drugs. It was a horrifying realisation for me, that large companies take advantage of the lack of conditions and knowledge of these people. Once I was living near the orphanage and working there every day, I decided to give some lectures about genetics and synthetic biology to the older kids. I organised evening lectures, after all the kids had finished school and were already at the house. I began with curriculum science- talking about DNA composition and its functions in our cell, and consequently in our lives. As interest piqued, we discussed some of the applications of synthetic biology and how we can now start editing DNA and the consequences that these can have in the future of humanity. Teaching can be unforgiving, but teaching kids who are actually interested is incredibly rewarding. Many children in the UK and across Europe take their education for granted- whether that is because of cultural attitudes or the fact that education is a given right, I do not know. The children in the orphanage were, in contrast, committed to learning. They knew the hurdles they had to overcome, and persisted- which was inspiring.
Belvedere Wellbeing Centre Visit
As part of our Public Engagement activities, in September a few of our team visited the Belvedere Wellbeing Centre for elderly people in the London Borough of Bexley.  We set out to open up the dialogue about antibiotic resistance to include more people in shaping synthetic biology, including groups not traditionally consulted.  We thought it best to shed the conventional methods of teaching that we had relied on at Bexley Grammar School, and instead simply start a conversation about the elderly’s experiences of antibiotic administration and whether they see the use of antibiotics in animal farming as a factor in their shopping habits.

To use ABC-SysBio we had to make an SBML file describing our model and write an xml input file. The input file contains values for initial conditions of each species in our model, as well as prior distributions for each parameter. The prior distributions consist of a range of values for each parameter, from which the algorithm will sample values. The input file also contains the data from the degradation of AzoDyes and sulfonated AzoDyes over two days.
 
ABC-SysBio samples a value for each parameter from the priors and using the initial conditions provided, simulates the model. The resulting time course is compared to the data provided, and if the distance between the two is greater than a threshold, the sampled parameter set is rejected. This is repeated for 100 sets of samples, consisting of one population. The sets that were accepted are then perturbed by a small amount and then a new population is sampled from the perturbed sets. This process is repeated until the distance between the data and the simulations is minimised:
 
The parameter values that gave rise to this final population are called the 'posterior distribution'.
Posterior distribution of model parameters
The distribution of values for each parameter are shown in the diagonal. All distributions are between 0 and 1. Drawing a straight line from one parameter to the other, at the point where the two meet, the two parameters have been plotted against each other in a density contour plot. Three parameters stand out as very constricted, k3, k8, k17 and k18. These are the parameters of the reactions for intake  (k3) and secretion (k8) of AzoDyes as well as the intake (k17) and secretion (k18) of sulfonated AzoDyes by the cell. This shows that the bottleneck happens at those points in our pathway. So if we increase the rate of intake and secretion of AzoDyes and sulfonated AzoDyes in our synthetic pathway, we could speed up the process of degradation!
Flux Balance Analysis
In order to see whether our xenobiological approach would work we wanted to check whether lack of Ubiquinone would have an effect on the growth rate of the chassis. The literature (Okada 1997 and Soballe, 1999) suggested that Ubiquinone is essential for E.coli growth so we decided to put that to the test! In order to do that we used Flux Balance Analysis (FBA). FBA is a method that uses the"

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," don’t have social structures here. [...] And when the children don’t go to school, they just become poorer and poorer and poorer. It is a disease that is left with the eye care people, but its impact is on the whole economy.
Kai:
How would you rate the awareness of chlamydial infections in Malawi, especially in poorer regions?
Prof. Kalua:
Well, they are aware a little bit, mostry through our interventions. But before most of it has been explained through culture and beliefs. They think, something happened to you, to get trachoma. Some still believe, that if you fight with somebody you will get this disease. We explain to them that this is a bacteria, that has to with your environment and facial cleanliness. So they are aware to some state, but the challenge is the behavioural change. Because some of the factors that make chlamydia target the poor demographic, has to do with the behaviour. [...] We don’t believe in toilets as a culture. Culture-wise they don’t believe in having toilets. They think it’s not environmental friendly so they just use the bush. And this attracts a lot of flies which spread the trachoma. So the behavioural change is to convince them, to use toilets which is not very easy.
Dominika:
So you just told us about the misperceptions of the disease. So are there any educational programs at school for teaching?
Prof. Kalua:
Yes, there are some educational programs within the school curriculum dealing with trachoma. There are also NGO institutions, which focus specifically on facial cleanliness and environmental hygiene. Making posters, radio programs. Trying to teach the children to go out and teach their parents. So these are the programs that is happening as of now.
Dominika:
How are the laboratories equipped over here? You were talking about PCR tests...
Prof. Kalua:
Yes, we have very good laboratories, due to collaborations with international investors. So within the government system, most of the PCR facilities have been established because of the HIV epidemic. But as you know, when you use up to 2000 machines for HIV, you can just get another template for chlamydia. So the machines are there, we just get software for testing chlamydia. There are relatively good number of labs that have these 2000 machines, but when we get the software for diagnosing chlamydia, the cost is actually very high. It is very expensive. In such cases you question whether you should be spending money on drugs or on tests. As you know, we have an oint"

Collaborations
The Colorado iGEM teams met up at Colorado State University to present their projects.
Colorado iGEM Meetup
On August 30th, Colorado State University’s iGEM team held a meetup with University of Colorado-Boulder’s iGEM team . For the past 2 years the teams have collaborated by testing each other’s parts, which proved difficult this year due to project complexity. Instead, we decided to hold a meet up this year. CU-Boulder traveled to CSU and the teams each presented their projects. Both teams were able to receive feedback on their presentations from people who had never heard it before. The meet up also gave the teams the opportunity to make meet new people, develop useful relationships with fellow scientists, and learn about the other team’s work on a personal level.
CSU iGEM also invited Dr. Jeff Kasser, professor of philosophy at CSU, as a guest speaker. He spoke to the teams about the philosophy of science and biology. Kasser dicussed whether there was a way to distinguish science from pseudo-science, discussed laws of nature, and the reduction of one science to another (e.g. is psychology really just a sub-science of biology). Both teams and Wade Troxell, mayor of the city of Fort Collins, discussed with Dr. Kasser genetic engineering and the public perception of genetically modified organisms. The talk incited conversation and thoughts around the responsibilities and standards that synthetic biologists do and should hold themselves to.
Other Collaborations
Our team also participated in upwards of 15 surveys, and added our team and project to Paris-Bettencourt's iGEM Rhizi. This year, we also participated in the 2015 Interlab Study , including the extra credit."

Diabetes
With the rising population, the number of diabetics worldwide is increasing as well. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that in 2015, there were 415 million adults with diabetes 6 . This is estimated to rise to 642 by 2040 6 .
Figure 3: The estimated increase of diabetics from 2015 to 2040.
Insulin demand
Assuming that an average diabetic needs 15 units of insulin daily to live symptomfree, the global insulin demand would yearly be approximately 79 thousand tons of pure crystaline insulin and rise to more than 120 thousand tons by 2040.     $$\frac{\text{Number of diabetics }\cdot 15 \text{ units day}^{-1} \cdot 365 \text{days}}{288118443.804 \text{ units ton}^{-1}} = \text{ Insulin demand (tons)} $$
Insulin production
In their annual report, the Danish insulin manufacturer, Novo Nordisk, estimates that of the 415 million adults with diabetes, only 6% receives full care 5 . However, with increasingly broad access to drugs in areas of the world where expensive medication like insulin have previously been unavailable, this number can be expected to increase.
Insulin is produced using glucose as a substrate. Glucose is commonly refined from starch, which again is refined from eg. potatoes or corn. This means that arable land and food potentially fit for human consumption is being used to produce medication instead of feeding the ever increasing population. An approximation of the demand for arable land, starch and crops can be calculated with the expressions below 3,4 :
$$ \frac{\text{Insulin Demand}}{0.05 \frac{\text{ton insulin}}{\text{ton glucose}}}\cdot 1 \frac{\text{ton starch}}{\text{ton glucose}} = \text{Starch demand} $$   $$ \frac{\text{Starch demand}}{0.17}\frac{\text{ton starch}}{\text{ton potato}} = \text{Potato demand (tons)}$$   $$ \frac{\text{Starch demand}}{0.34}\frac{\text{ton starch}}{\text{ton corn}} = \text{Corn demand (tons)} $$   $$ \frac{\text{Potato demand}}{17.4 \frac{\text{tons}}{\text{ha}}} = \text{Area demand (ha)} $$   $$ \frac{\text{Corn demand}}{5"

2. Addition of agar and plating
i)Top agar was warmed/liquefied by microwaving.
Microwaving doesn’t see to work so well, a better alternative would be to use a warm water bath.
ii) 5mL of liquid top agar was added to test tube; mixed well with phage + bacteria solution
iii)5mL of the mixed solution was transferred to the LB plate. The top agar was spread to from a uniform layer.
iv)The same process were repeated the test tube 0-6.

V) Results
March 21, 2013 at 1:00pm – E coli have formed a uniform lawn. No plague is seen in any of the plates
VI) Conclusion
E coli is viable, but the phiX174 phage is not.
Obvious contamination seen in 2 out of the 6 plates
VI) Limitations and Questions
We did not have all the equipment ready at the start of lab. With the waiting periods in between, contamination might be a huge problem.

They were also found to be free from contaminants (based on the 260/280 and 260/230 values). But none of the samples appeared on the gel after electrophoresis.
In order to understand the problem that had been plaguing our work, we went to a biology lab to view the plasmid preps under compound microscope and conduct gram staining analysis. All plasmid preps seemed to be contaminated with either another type of bacteria (due to differences in shape and size) or unidentified string-like compound. Many of the plasmid preps contain purple-colored bacteria, even though E. coli bacteria are supposed to be pink since they are gram-negative.
Based on these observations, we plan to improve on the lab cleanliness and avoid contamination. One important decision here was to autoclaved all of the pipet. This was done not only to avoid the possibility of contamination in daily experiments but also to ensure that the plasmid preps will properly amplify the plasmid-containing bacteria.

The heat resistant system was made up by a RNA thermometer and a heat shock protein expression device.
Questions
What’s the shape of the growth curve under normal growth condition?
What the impact if the lethal effect is considered?
What is the time to turn on the RNA temperature switch?
What happened if the cooling system was removed?
Build the normal cell growth model
Build the growth model with the lethal effect considered
Build a model which can be used to predict the temperature change tendency
Fig. 14 the red curve shows the result with the lethal effect considered, the blue curve shows the normal logistic growth result.
The initial inoculation amount of this model is 1 unit. The proposed intrinsic rate is 0.05. And we set the maximum number of cells that the environment can support is 100 units. As can be seen from the simulation , from 0 to 200 units of time, the number of cells are in a growth state in both cases, no lethal effect is greater than the growth rate of cells in the presence simulation lethal effect of simulations; after 200 units of time, two kinds of simulations have tended to steady state, the growth of non-lethal effects of simulated results of the final number of the environment can accommodate the largest state, while the presence of the number of lethal effect of significantly less than the maximum number of steady-state simulation results is about 90 units.

We could get the information that the heat in the fermenter will accumulate over time without a cooling system from the above figure. Once the cooling system was turned on, a steady state could be achieved as shown in the figure above.

In the meeting, we learned that the the launch of genetically mofied product should pass many examines in order to confirm not doing harm to human beings, and finally it is allowed to enter the market. Up till now, China has only permitted and issued 7 series of security certificate, namely, shelf-stable tomatoes, cotton, change color petunias, disease-resistant chili, disease-resistant papaya, insect-resistant phytase maize and rice. Therefore, if our product wants to be launched, it also needs many examines and struggles for the permission of relevant state departments.
We enjoyed the communication with the genetically modified experts as well, learning about a series advanced methods of reducing the risk of gene pollution during the period of the research of genetically modified technology. So, these can be the key point about how to slove with the gene pulltionand and avoid biological risk better in our project.
Expect the regulations about genetically modified technology, we should make more effort to master the issue of intellectual property right for entrepreneur like us. Therefore, we join in the lecture given by professor Zhang Yongzhong, who is from South China Normal university school of law college.
In this lecture, we can know that if one of our research result is only published papers, we just can own the copyright, but enterprise can use this achievement for free. So, at the same time of setting up enterprises and publishing papers, we need to apply for a patent to protect our intellectual property right.

The scientific community seems split on whether or not biofuels will bring these desired benefits. The most pessimistic have looked at current characteristics and productivity data for biofuels and feel that in a world where over half of the population is malnourished, the growth of crops for fuel will squander land, water and energy sources needed for food production, resulting in increased food prices. The most optimistic look beyond the current available data and foresee a bright future where biomass will be a sustainable source for both food and energy, without the need of further deforestation.
However, it is recognized that such a bright future will only be possible through significant innovation and change in the current methods of biomass processing into biofuels. This is where we believe synthetic biology will come to play a large role.
Most of the innovations required in order to reach a sustainable future for biofuels will come from the genetic manipulation of crops for increased biomass production, and of microorganism for increased productivity of current fuels and for the production of more efficient fuels than first-generation biofuels.
In Brazil, the bioethanol industry is thriving. Sugarcane bioethanol is significantly cheaper to obtain than corn ethanol due to not requiring amylase pre-treatment and because sugarcane is a more efficient biomass source than corn. In addition, Brazil’s tropical climate provides not only the abundant sun and water necessary for biomass production, but also a rich microfauna from which very efficient yeast strains for ethanol production have been isolated and are currently used by industry.
In view of this scenario, and as the first Brazilian iGEM team, we decided to apply the concepts of synthetic biology to the bioethanol business. As part of our research we couldn’t fail to notice the biofuels debate.
In order to evaluate the general public’s opinion on this matter and to obtain hints of what the underlying causes for the different opinions could be, we elaborated a survey to be distributed through the internet.

DESCRIPTION
Interview with Novozymes
With this in mind, we turned to another major league player in the biotechnological industry - Novozymes A/S. Novozymes has a very diverse production line and produces enzymes for industries ranging from agriculture, household care and food to bioenergy and wastewater solutions. Furthermore, they are a top 10 company on the Fortune Magazine’s Change the World list, so we thought - who else would be more likely to seize our idea and technology? To read the full interview, you can click here .
“I’m not saying that it IS a challenge, but it could be a challenge. If you cannot get the dirt out of the fermentor, then you need to use organic solvents and it might also have other consequences. But in general, I would say yes! There is a lot of available fat sources that could be used. But we need to know the consequences.” was what Gernot J. Abel from the Research and Technology department at Novozymes in Bagsværd, Denmark, said, when we asked him, whether Novozymes would consider switching to Y. lipolytica as production organism in case our molecular toolbox is up and running, and then base the production on waste streams such as glycerols, fatty acids and media containing other complex carbohydrates. “The more you can do with one single strain, the better. But if Yarrowia is excellent making more homogeneous proteins, then that would be a selling point. Get rid of your waste, so less waste and more value. If you can cut production costs 10% down and use different waste streams, then cool!”

This year the TUe organized a Master Kick-off to welcome all new Master students, this includes foreign Master students as well as Dutch Master students. During this Kick-off, which is a three day event, students will get to know each other, the master’s degree program and they had the opportunity to network with some high-tech companies in the area.
During one of these days the faculty of Biomedical Engineering also had the chance to welcome their new Master students. We as an iGEM team gave a presentation about the iGEM competition in general and also our project, to give the new students an idea of the possibilities to join a student team in the area of synthetic biology.

The D score is calculated by Carafa Scoring System.
Carafa Scoring System
Scoring System 2 is based on the model created by d'Aubenton Carafa 2. The score of terminator consists of two parts, the free energy of stemloop and the score of 15 nt poly T tail. The free energy of stemloop is calculated using Loop Dependent Energy Rules 3. The minimization of the free energy also determined the secondary structure of the stemloop. T tail score is calculated by the formula given by d' Aubenton Carafa.
Detailed Calculation of Score
1. Some definitions3
i. Closing Base Pair
For an RNA sequences, we number it from 5' to 3' . If i < j and nucleotides ri and rj form a base pair,we denote it by i.j. We call base ri' or base pair i'.j' is accessible from i.j if i <i' ( <j' ) <j and if there is no other base pair k.l so that i <k <i' ( <j' ) <l <j. We denote the collection of base and base pair accessible from i.j by L(i,j). Then i.j is the closing base pair. Here “L” means loop.
ii. n-loop
If the loop contain n – 1 base pairs, we denote it by n-loop. (Because there is a closing base pair, so we denote it by n-loop even though the closing base pair is not included in the loop.)
Here we can divide loops which may be formed in the terminator secondary structure into two kinds.
1-loop : Hairpin loop(size of loop shouldn't be smaller than 3)
2-loop : Interior Loop(right strand size and left strand size are both bigger than 0.)
Buldge(Size of one strand is bigger than 0 and that of another strand is 0.)Stack(size of the loop is 0.)
2. Calculation of the Minimum Free Energy Change of Stemloop Formation4 Assume i.j is the closing base pair of the loop
G（i,j）= min { GH ( i , j ) , GS( i , j ) + G ( i + 1"

Week Fourteen
Sixpi 23:49, 23 August 2009 (UTC)
Summer research for iGEM 2009 is winding down - we have our last monday meeting of the summer tomorrow morning, and then classes start on Wednesday.
I've finally ""finished"" the revamped database management system - you can navigate from one object to another using the API we developed at the beginning of the summer. This fall, I'll need to port over the old database manager from Clotho Classic (as we're now calling it), polish up the UI for the database management system, and make sure all my source code is cleaned up, organized, and well-commented.
Week Fifteen and Onwards
Sixpi 17:24, 3 September 2009 (UTC)
Fall semester started last week, so I haven't really made much progress. With single hop object traversal working, I need to test it before Doug gets back from his trip to Michigan. I also plan to finish the saving a connection functionality before then, as this will make testing much easier for the whole team.
Sixpi 01:53, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
Today Doug returns from his vacation, and we had our meeting. It seems that the wet lab is not very happy with Clotho as it is now, since from their perspective Clotho has made backwards progress since the release of Clotho Classic Beta. We haven't moved the most important parts over - the parts manager and database manager, and the database connection/binding process is not polished yet. The database manager and binding/connection process are what I need to finish by next week.
Sixpi 05:57, 20 October 2009 (UTC)
2 weeks until the jamboree! And only 2 days until the wiki deadline!
We presented at the NorCal iGEM Jamboree last Saturday, and it went pretty well, considering we completely reorganized our presentation the night before =D. I ended up doing the intro slides and then the data model first, so Friday night/early Saturday morning was trying to practice my part.... >.<
Anyways, we should have no problem finishing the wiki by Wednesday. After that's done, we just have to finish the poster (Doug claims this is not hard), and also clean up the code/make sure everything is working/fix up the sourceforge page.

OUR COLLABORATIONS
Our most meaningful collaboration was with Team Athens.  We mentor them and we were mentored by them. Exchanging ideas with them was  really helpful for us. We also helped their team by sending them our measurement  kit for InterLab, because we didn’t participate in it, but they did.  And the best of all are the friendships we made!

LZU-China,2015,Team:LZU-China#project_-_-_TEXT.html," with water pollution. In China, for example, about 75 percent of the population (or 1.1 billion people) are without access to unpolluted drinking water, according to standards from China[6]. And our university, Lanzhou University, located on northwestern China, where lacking water especially. What's worse, water pollution is also serious including heavy metal contaminants.
Heavy metal detecting
1. Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, AAS
  Once other particles or photons with appropriate energy are running into an atom, the electron of the atom will perform the absorption transition, and the photons will be taken up. Different atoms have their specific corresponding photons, which mean they all have their own absorption spectrum. According to this phenomenon, people have created AAS to detect specific atom.
  To perform AAS to detect heavy metal ions quantitatively, an atomic absorption spectrometer is required, which is usually 50,000 to 90,000 dollars.
Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, AAS
2. Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry, AFS
  After the atom absorbed the photons, if the energy together with the photons is being released out, then we can detect its own AFS. The fluorescence intensity varies directly as the number of the atom.
  Similar to AAS, we need an AFSer to analyze AFS to detect heavy metal ions quantitatively. AFS is more accurate and sensitive than ASS, which means it’s more expensive than ASS. An AFSer may be up to 300,000 dollars.
Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry, AFS
3. Oscilloscopic polarography
  Also called as single sweep polarography. It is a method that can obtain the polarogram quickly and accurately. In order to accomplish it, a serrated pulse voltage should be added at the electrodes promptly during the late of the growth of the mercury drop on electrode. Thus, we are able to obtain a polarogram in several seconds.
  An oscilloscopic polarographer can reach 10,000 dollar.

The following day, we analyzed the sequencing results and saw that the gBlock red, blue, lacI and mazF had the correct DNA–sequence (Fig. 15). The other gBlocks showed no matches (Fig. 16). Because of the fact that the other gBlocks didn`t show the expected results, we changed our plan and started to use pUC19 (Fig. 17) instead of our own designed vector and our lacI part. Unfortunately, we didn’t have enough gBlocks left for further experiments. So we decided to run a PCR, followed by a gel electrophoresis.
The gel didn’t show clear bands at the appropriate size.
Fig 15: The sequencing results of the red part. the third clone showed the best results, so subsequent works were done with clone 3.
Fig 16: This is an example how bad our sequencing results were. In the case of the vector we could work together.
Week 5 (08.08 – 12.08)
PCR of gBlocks for directed cloning into pUC19
To see the quality of our delivered gBlock–DNA, we ran a gel electrophoresis using pure gBlock-DNA. The surprising results have shown that there were some samples with very less DNA and even some with no DNA at the appropriate size. The samples that have shown a band were cut out at the correct length and resolved, followed by a PCR reaction:
98 °C 30 sec
98 °C 10 sec I
68 °C 20 sec I 30 x
72 °C 30 sec I
72 °C 7 min

Because of the fact that some gBlocks didn’t show results at all, we asked IDT for new samples and they sent ccdB toxin & our designed vector again.
Moreover, a new attempt of cloning ccdB into a pJET vector was performed with the last few µl of the original sample. After transformation colonies were detected and used for a raster-screening, to double-check the size of our gBlock DNA. The correct ones were used for a colony PCR as following:

Our team believes that iGEM isn’t just a competition, but a chance to collaborate and learn from one another, thus we are passionate about every precious chance of meeting with different teams. These are invaluable opportunities to grow together and engage in cooperation.
NYMU-Taipei iGEM team
NYMU-Taipei is the first iGEM team in Taiwan, and their teacher, Prof. Chang, has extensive experience in iGEM competition. We seeked some advice about forming an iGEM team, and how to integrate a project. In return, we gave them some information about some professors in National Taiwan Ocean University whose specialty focused on questions similar to their project.
CCU_Taiwan iGEM team
It's our pleasure to have a meet up with CCU iGEM Taiwan on 3rd of July because both of us are joining iGEM for the first time. Thanks to the meetup, we had lots of profound collaborations during this summer.
NCKU_Tainan iGEM team
We had a face-to-face meeting with them in National Cheng Kung University. They interviewed us about their environmental protection project, and we also showed our project to them. With their suggestions, we found a new method to present our project more clearly through the collaboration, where we felt more connected with other iGEMers. We are sincerely thankful for their interview and hospitality.

- Professor
As a group of high school students, our understanding of genetic engineering is limited. In addition to the usual self-turning of books to learn knowledge, many professors have helped us to carry out the design of the experiment smoothly. One of them is Professor Wang Wenhang of the School of Food Engineering and Biotechnology at Tianjin University of Science and Technology.
Before the construction of our subject, we got in touch with the professer by using the resources of one of our team members’ parents. After Professor Wang heard about our project, he was very willing to help us because Professor Wang had done research in this area before. He believed that chitosan is a promising new material. After reading our initial experimental ideas, he gave us valuable advice. There is a region between the ribosome binding site and the promoter called scar, but the design of our previous experiment made this region too long. In order to make the protein be successfully expressed, the scar should not exceed 6 bp. In the end, the protein was successfully expressed, which is inseparable from the professor's credit.
Work experience and performance: 2003.6-present, teaching and research work at the School of Food Engineering and Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science and Technology. He teaches undergraduate courses ""General Biology"", postgraduate courses ""Functional Food Technology and Equipment"", ""Food Science and Biotechnology Special Lecture"" and other courses, and trains more than 20 postgraduate students. In recent years, he has hosted and participated in dozens of national, provincial (ministerial) projects, and has carried out international cooperation with Canada and the United States. Published more than 30 academic papers, including more than ten papers in SCI.
Practice:

While designing our project, we have learnt that the current production method of chitosan has some limitations. In order to gain more knowledge about the setbacks and how are they influencing the industrial supplies of chitosan, we put visiting these institutions up on our schedule.

Rapid open source production of zinc finger nucleases becomes available
Researcher Keith Joung of Harvard University and Mass. General Hospital develops a method for making zinc finger nuclease proteins that bind to custom target sequences, utilizing a bacterial two-hybrid screening system to identify specific zinc finger binders to a DNA sequence of interest.
Zinc finger nuclease enters clinical trials
Sangamo and University of Pennsylvania begin clinical trials with a zinc finger nuclease designed to target the CCR5 gene and inhibit HIV. Success of this therapeutic could prove a significant advance for gene therapy.
Context-dependency improves open-source zinc finger engineering
Keith Joung publishes tables of zinc finger binding sites that account for context-dependent effects and can be rearranged to form custom zinc finger proteins that bind to a variety of DNA sequences. This greatly increases the ease of engineering novel zinc fingers based on the structures of previously characterized zinc fingers.
Harvard iGEM develops a novel method to engineer custom zinc fingers
Using novel integration of existing technologies, we have developed a rapid, comparatively low-cost, open source method for making thousands of custom zinc fingers by integrating MAGE, lambda red, and chip-based synthesis technologies. Our work greatly increases the ease of access to zinc finger technology for researchers worldwide.

Formaldehyde, as  common contamination in daily life, is one of the most dangerous cancerogen in  the world. The condition of formaldehyde pollution has alerted people. Thus, it  is essential for everyone to detect and degrade formaldehyde right now. [1]  However, there is no simple and convenient way to detect and degrade formaldehyde.  On the contrary, available methods are usually too complicated for the public  with a great amount of drawbacks. For example, Spectrophotometry is limited by  experiment conditions and Prices of chromatography equipment are usually high. [1][2][3]  So we want to design biobricks to solve this problem by using microorganism.
How to detect formaldehyde?
With  corporation of Wuhan University, We got a special promoter named hxlR in Bacillus  subtilis, whose function is that it can be induced by formaldehyde and express  downstream genes.[4] Due to this feature, with the help of GFP, we designed a  vector PSB1C3 by using a series of genes, hxlR and GFP(Figure 1). If this  system works well, we will see fluorescence under UV-light.
Figure 1. Vector pSB1C3-hxlR-GFP.
How to degrade formaldehyde?
We found two key enzymes to degrade formaldehyde, named formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and formaldehyde dehydrogenase (PADH). Last year, Wuhan University added these two genes downstream Promoter hxlR directly, but did not got perfect results(We also verified, you can click here to see). Therefore, we improved this system.
First, we adjusted prior vector by adding a gene called T7 RNA polymerase(Figure 2). What’s more, we used pET vectors to express two key enzymes, and constructed such a vector(Figure 3).
Finally, when T7 polymerase is expressed, Vector pET-DUET can express PADH and FDH. In this way, the whole system can be induced by formaldehyde and express PADH and FDH to degrade it.

Stanford-Brown,2015,Team:Stanford-Brown#PHA_-_-_TEXT.html,"3HB) produced in vivo in two ways: by extracting the plastic and measuring its mass, and by staining the cultures and measuring the fluorescence on a flow cytometer and fluorometer.
To extract the plastic, we used sodium hypochlorite to dissolve the lyophilized cells, freeing the plastic. The protocol (posted below in greater detail) then calls for several wash steps to purify the plastic. Measuring the mass of the culture post-lyophilization and measuring the mass of the plastic once extracted, purified, and fully dried allowed us to determine the percentages of the cells that were taken up by P(3HB) granules and compare between devices. The addition of panK to the existing P(3HB) device allowed for, on average, a 23% increase in the amount of plastic accumulated in vivo as a percentage of dry cell weight.
P(3HB) produced in vivo and extracted using sodium hypochlorite. The tube on the left shows a negative control, a culture with no genes for plastic production. The tube in the middle was from a culture with the phaCAB operon with hybrid promoter from Imperial College iGEM team, 2013. The tube on the right shows the plastic produced by a culture with the panK gene added to the Imperial team's construct.
To verify this increase in production, we also quantified plastic production using fluorescence. Nile red is a fluorescent dye that has previously been used to show production of poly-hydroxyalkanoates in bacteria [8]. It binds to P(3HB) and other lipids, such as those in the cellular membranes. Therefore, staining with Nile red is expected to show fluorescence even for the negative controls - the cultures that do not contain P(3HB); however the fluorescence will be much higher in cultures that do contain P(3HB). The second way we quantified plastic production was by measuring the fluorescence of cell cultures and dividing by the density of the cell cultures using OD600 – this allows us to compare the relative fluorescence of cultures containing our construct compared to cultures containing other constructs. We also used a flow cytometer to qualitatively show an increase in fluorescence in cells that contained panK. The addition of panK to the existing P(3HB) device caused, on average, a 34% increase of fluorescence from Nile red bound to plastic. We hypothesize that the slightly larger increase in fluorescence than increase in percentage of plastic could be because the cells that accumulate more plastic would be larger, and have a greater surface area of cell membrane, and therefore would bind to more Nile red"

Characterization and Investigation on AraC-ParaBAD BBa_I0500
The 2014 HKUST iGEM team had previously submitted characterization data for part BBa_I0500 that described an all-or-none behavior of the promoter. That is however not true. We discovered a few issues in reproducibility and interpretation. Essentially, our result from 2014 did not fully capture the arabinose sensing range. The all-or-none response reported on pSB3K3 was also an artifact, where dead cells from an old plate interfered with fluorescent readings.
We sincerely apologize for the misleading information that we provided last year. To remedy for that, we decided to re-characterize BBa_I0500 in a more rigorous manner, using the construct BBa_I2031 . To do so within limited time, we headed for a deeper characterization instead of measuring multiple properties (e.g. induction time).
Our results demonstrated that this promoter 1) has a graded induction response, 2) has different sensing ranges on plasmids with different copy numbers, and 3) does not display all-or-none behavior on a single cell level when expressed from a low copy plasmid. We have uploaded our results to the Experience Pages of BBa_I0500 and that of BBa_I2031 .
Graded behavior and plasmid copy number influenced sensing ranges

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#policypractice#clinic_-_-_TEXT.html,", and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"In application, this system often utilizes a genetically engineered strain of yeast in which a reporter gene (GFP, nutrient genes or others) is inserted, which can be only activated by certain transcriptional activator. This activator can be split into two fragments: DNA-binding domain (BD) fragment and activation domain (AD) fragment. Two plasmids are engineered to produce a protein product in which the BD fragment is fused onto a protein while another plasmid is engineered to produce a protein product in which the AD fragment is fused onto another protein. The protein fused to the BD may be referred to as the bait protein, and is typically a known protein the investigator is using to identify new binding partners. The protein fused to the AD may be referred to as the prey protein and can be either a single known protein or a library of known or unknown proteins.
If the bait and prey proteins interact (bind), then the AD and BD of the transcription factor are indirectly connected, bringing the AD in proximity to the transcription start site and transcription of reporter gene(s) can occur. If the two proteins do not interact, there is no transcription of the reporter gene. In this way, a successful interaction between the fused protein is linked to a change in the cell phenotype[1].
The reporter genes are usually GFP, nutrient genes and others. If using GFP, when AD binds to BD, GFP will express to show green fluorescence. If using nutrient gene, this system often utilizes a genetically engineered strain of yeast in which the biosynthesis of certain nutrients (usually amino acids or nucleic acids) is lacking. When grown on media that lacks these nutrients, the yeast fail to survive. So only when AD binds to BD can the nutrient be expressed so that the yeast can survive.

They offered to expose the Latin American teams scenario (based on our team’s experience) regarding the difficulty in the delivery of the biological material, especially iGEM kit and Biobricks, because of problems with customs in most of Latin American countries.
Meeting at Toulouse
We also collaborated with team Toulouse by translating and recording in Spanish four protocols of the most used methods in genetic engineering: transformation, digestion, ligation and PCR. The team's purpose was to make an electronic manual, based in videos and scripts translated in 4 different languages: English, French, Spanish and German.
Spanish is one of the most spoken languages around the world, so translating the videos into Spanish will definitely help them reach a broader audience. Moreover, there are not many reviewed protocols online in Spanish, and sadly, there are less videos explaining on a pleasant and dynamic way how to carry out the experiments; so taking into account our own experience, we wanted to make this type of content more accessible to people who, like us, are not native english speakers.

We thought this was a great initiative because iGEM projects are making an impact all over the world and we were happy to take part of it and help them spread the word.
We sent them a description of our project and a description of our team so that everyone could know what we are up to and could get to know us a little better. We also agreed to an interview via Skype where we told them all about our project, the team, our experiences, the struggles we had and all we have learned in iGEM.
Additionally, we shared information about the development of our project and we talked about important issues regarding the struggles we had (specially with customs) while doing research in Mexico and Latin America in general.

NRP-UEA-Norwich,2012,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#NOSensing_-_-_TEXT.html," all figures from the fluorometer, flow cytometry and qualitative results showing fluorescence as a result of potassium nitrate induction we can conclude that the hybrid promoter in both orientations (B-M and M-B) does indeed react to nitrates and result in translation and expression of the downstream reporter. We can assume due to the transcriptional repressors associated with PyeaR (Figure 1.) that similar results would be given by nitrites, however future experimentation is recommended to test this theory and fully characterise this aspect of the promoter.
In Figures 20, 21 and 22 it is shown that human breast cancer cells (MCF7) can be transfected with the M-B orientation of the promoter and that fluorescence does not occur in untransfected cells, however does occur in the transfected cells; the figures also appears to show that fluorescence intensifies upon addition of a nitric oxide donor. This data would suggest that the hybrid promoter indeed responds to nitric oxide as well as nitrates, however future experiments are needed to prove this. This appears to show that the hybrid promoter is indeed flexible as we first intended it to be, and systems can be developed in bacteria and then applied to mammalian cells with similar affects.
In Figures 11, 13 and 14 the data shows the intensity of fluorescence increasing as the concentration of potassium nitrate added to the media the E. coli were grown in increases; this trend continues until the 15 mM sample (which appears to be the highest), before dramatically dropping in the case of the 20 mM potassium nitrate samples. One of the ideas surrounding this would be the toxicity levels of potassium nitrate, however in Figure 5 E. coli samples are shown to be fluorescing (and thus likely still be alive) after being subjected to 100 mM potassium nitrate. Another possibility may be the formation of inclusion bodies due to the vast quantities of fluorescent proteins being produced, leading to their aggregation and thus inability to fluoresce as expected. From the data given it can likely concluded that the maximum level of fluorescence can be attained from potassium nitrate levels between 15 mM and 20 mM, though future experimentation with narrower parameters in this area will be needed to conclude where the maximum tolerable level of potassium nitrate is found.
In Figure 12 there appears to be a stark difference in CFP fluorescence intensity when M-B and B-M are compared, with M-B giving much higher intensities than B-M on all occasions, however in Figure 15 where the same experiments have been carried out using RFP instead of CFP the differences are not conclusively favour"

Pigments
We wanted to use pigments as reporters in our designed genetic construct. Why did we choose for pigments and not use a common    reporter like Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)? Well, we imagined our Food Warden system as a consumer product.     Therefore, it is unreasonable to expect everyone to have a fluorescence microscope available at home. Pigments, however,     are recognizable by the naked eye and come in many color varieties, but a main challenge we had to accept was that     these pigments had yet to be expressed Bacillus subtilis . We decided to take the risk, and look the great results!
We identified many pigments in the Registry and choose three BioBricks that we could express independently     so we could create different colors for every single device. The parts that have been utilized as a reporter gene are:
Lycopene (BBa_K274100)
Coral red pigment biobrick CrtEBI with RBS (BBa_K274100), created by Team Cambridge 2009, was used as one of our reporter genes in    our volatile detection device. Details concerning this part can be found in Team Cambridge 2009 page. BBa_K274100 .
Our team has coupled this biobrick part with our promoters:  alsT, fnr, and sboA. The cloning was done in BBa_K823023     (plasmid backbone for B. subtilis, engineered by LMU Munich 2012), to allow color    expression in B. subtilis. We utilized a strong RBS BBa_B0034 for pigment expression in E. coli and B. subtilis.

Design Notes of K2052014
As our project consists of two stages we digested the part that we’ve divided into two sections. This part made up of protein coding region; FimH, a double terminator (B0015) and an arabinose induced promoter (K206000).
We got our protein coding region from Harvard Bio Design iGEM 2015 Team. without its arabinose dependent promoter region. This part enables E.coli to bind cancerous cells in colon flora. “Fim” gene expression in some substranes of E.coli results hairlike appendages on the bacteria. At the end of the pilus, there is a protein “FimH” which is from the Fim family. It binds naturally to sugar mannose.
RPMrel is a nine-amino-acid, disulfide-constrained peptide. By the help of RPMrel, a colon tumor specific binding peptide, our E.coli has the ability to bind specifically to tumor cells in colon flora
The double terminator (B0015) and arabinose induced promoter that we’ve used is gotten from the iGEM part library.

3D Structure of FimH together with RPMrel can be seen below as Harvard BioDesign 2015 submitted  in part registry :
Visual demonstration of interaction between FimH and its ligand
Our simulations were designed by the NAMD program, and CHARMM force field was  applied. This CHARMM technique was used  to calculate the energy usage in the simulations. The FimH and HETA models were  used in the simulation were  taken from an cristal model. After 100 ns, the protein could not disassociate from the ligand. We can understand that there is a strong interaction between the protein and the ligand.
