DNA data storage is an apocalypse-proof technology because DNA     will be relevant to future civilizations. As long as intelligent     DNA-based life exists, there will be compelling reasons to study     and manipulate DNA.
Our system is especially safe as it cannot be hacked by computer     scientists and it requires the specific knowledge of the recipient     to retrieve the stored data.
As our project is designed by BioBricks it is easily adjustable to individual wishes. Message and key are easy to implement and exchange, and biological safety layers can be customized. According to the iGEM values we worked with BioBricks that we designed ourselves as well as with BioBricks of previous teams.   Read more about how we worked on the characterization of the B. subtilis integration vector BBa_K823023.
History of data storage
The concept of storing data in DNA molecules was created and     published in the 1960s by the Soviet physicist Mikhail Samoilovich     Neiman [12] . He came up with the idea that digital data can be     stored in the base sequence of DNA. Because DNA exists of four     different nucleotides, the information density can be up to two     times higher compared to our familiar binary storage systems. Since     the transition from analog to digital storage devices the storage     half-life of our digital information has dropped a lot. Besides     this current efforts to guarantee longevity of digital data storage     are scarce [13] . Optical and magnetic storage devices are not     reliable for long-term data storage. When DNA is encapsulated     within silica spheres and stored at -18°C it is possible to     recover data more than 1 million years later. But if you don’t have     a freezer and live in central Europe your data will be safe for up to 2k     years [14] . So storing information in DNA can be done with higher     density and it can be kept much longer.
The first messages that had actually been stored in DNA had to     wait until 1988 where Davis managed to do so [15] . In 2010     scientists were able to encode 7920 bits in synthetic DNA [16] . Up     to this milestone it was difficult to write and read long perfect     DNA sequences. In 2012 Church et al. developed a new strategy to     encode arbitrary digital information with an encoding scheme that     uses better DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies. In this     research they were able to encode and decode a message containing a     little over 50k words and a few images [17] . To learn more about"

Videocall with Bryan Saavedra
Keeping on with our international validation on the presence of foulbrood, its implications, and our project insights, we were able to contact a Chilean beekeeper thanks to our colleagues from UChile (LINK collaborations). Bryan Saavedra dedicates to honey production, pollination, and queen bee breeding and exportation. He has dedicated more than a decade of his life to beekeeping and he counts with more than 1000 beehives.
“Approximately 13% of  the  Chilean  working  population  is  engaged  in
agriculture, and agricultural products represent about 4% of the gross domestic product (GDP). The fruit sector is very important and includes crops such as grapes, melons, apples, and peaches.1”
After UChile team sent us the beekeeper’s contact we were able to get in touch with him and schedule a video-call. During the meeting, that lasted approximately 35 minutes, we were able to discuss the presence of bee diseases in Chile, its implications and some activities of Chilean agencies in charge of supporting the development of agriculture, forests, and livestock.
Foulbrood occur in Chile as foci of infection,  once  an  infection  is  detected,  which  most  likely  originated
from contaminated equipment, the SAG (Agricultural and Livestock Service) proceeds to burn and then bury the infected hives; the decision of burning the beehives is quite drastic but it is the only effective way to take care of the rest of the Chilean apiculture. The last outbreak of foulbrood the beekeeper noticed about, was in last February; normally the infection comes from Argentina, which is where the disease most often occurs. In Chile, they mostly struggle with varroa and nosema and for purposes of the SAG and exportations, the varroa mite is treated with organic products, that result inefficient and expensive. Antibiotics are also used against Varroa, getting back to the resistance problem. Regarding this topic, the beekeeper wondered if our product would help against varroa, and we could tell him how one of the most important consequences of varroa is that the"

Mathematical Overview
With a knowledge of Michaelis-­Menten enzyme kinetics, we were able to propose a model with appropriate parameters that are supported by data found in literature. Following on from previous MQ iGEM modelling, enzyme concentrations were derived for optimal production of chlorophyll a.
The initial velocity of the reaction (Vi) directly depends on the rate of the conversion of ES to P. It is also dependent on the total enzyme concentration [1]. By using the following formula, the total enzyme concentration and the speed of the reaction for the highest possible yield of chlorophyll a can be calculated from the values of Vi and S [1].
This is an example of 6 steps of the thirteen step pathway to chlorophyll a:
This reaction was translated into a mathematical equation which demonstrates the equations used for each enzymatic step used in the MATLAB models:
Our Models
The abbreviations used for the intermediates in all graphs are shown below. There are 13 intermediates/substrates for the 12 step pathway.

The first precursor to this pathway begins with the tetrapyrrole precursor aminolevulinic acid (ALA), synthesised via the C-5 pathway. ALA is naturally produced in E. coli however we have also added it to increase the production of PPIX and hence more chlorophyll a. This precursor produces the colour"

Liquid cultures of transformed cells are then induced with 0.5 mM or 1 mM IPTG at OD600 0.6 to initiate expression of defensin. After lysing the cells by sonication and collecting the cell debris with centrifugation, both the supernatant and the resuspended pellet are analyzed using SDS-PAGE.
Expression, extraction & SDS-PAGE [❓]
Figure 4. Expected size: 10.7 kDa. Result of the SDS-PAGE run at 200 V, 3.00 A. (1) Protein ladder (2) Def1 1.0 mM supernatant (3) Def2 1.0 mM supernatant (4) Def1 1.0 mM pellet (5) Def2 1.0 mM pellet. Unrelated samples on the gel were covered for clarity.
The absence of visible bands corresponding to defensin could be due to a too low concentration of the protein in the cell lysate. However, there could be another reason. Besides bands corresponding to the protein of interest, there is also expected to be a substantial amount of other bands corresponding to the proteins normally present in the bacterial cells. The absence of most of these proteins and defensin indicates that the sonication might have been to harsh and degraded most of the proteins.
Demonstrating efficient biofilm inhibition by Def
A crystal assay was performed to evaluate the inhibition efficiency of defensin on biofilm growth by P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, respectively. Different volumes of cell lysates from BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pSB1C3-T7-Def are tested. Differences between the negative control and Def are then evaluated using Student’s t-test. A p-value <0.05 is considered statistically significant.

Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to"

The kidney and liver for example, can be successfully preserved with UW for 24-36 hours. Other organs such as the heart and lungs can only be stored for about 6 hours.5
QGEM this year decided to help improve transplant medicine by working to solve the organ storage problem. We want to ameliorate preservation techniques by using a method that is already found and used effectively in nature by various organisms: antifreeze proteins.
The Ice Queen
This summer, our team chose to investigate AFPs and explore their potential application in cryopreservation. Our AFP of choice was the type III protein from the ocean pout fish. Our central project focused on optimizing antifreeze activity by anchoring multiple AFPs to a self-assembling protein scaffold. Our AFP-scaffold complex, affectionately termed the Ice Queen, sets out to increase the local concentration of AFPs, enabling more favourable interactions between proteins and ice crystal surfaces.6 These interactions slow down the ice recrystallization process by depressing the freezing point, a concept termed thermal hysteresis.
The Ice Queen employs a coiled-coil anchoring method; a high affinity, highly specific E/K coil system. This is a structural motif consisting of two engineered, heterodimeric alpha-helical coiled-coils. The interaction strength has been shown to be of similar strength to covalent interactions thus acting with minimal reversibility.7 The appeal of the specificity and strength of this system presented an attractive means of anchoring our Type III AFPs to the each of the scaffold subunits.
Icefinity
As an addition to our project this year, we decided to further explore the topic of AFPs and their variety of applications. Protein stability is of great importance when considering the use of AFPs in industry. Typical industrial processes often involve harsh conditions which will lead to denaturation (i.e. loss of function) for the protein. Therefore, in conjunction with improving the activity of the Type III AFP, we set out to increase the stability of the protein through circularization techniques.
Using Heidelberg’s intein biobrick BBa_K1362000 , we performed the intein-splicing reaction with the AFP to generate a circular protein: Icefinity. Heidelberg and other research parties have shown an increase in thermostability after cyclizing any protein.8, 9 This summer,  Circularization of the AFP has been a wonderful addition to our exploration of this fascinating protein. It also gave us the chance"

How our human practices have been integrated into the project
HP into the design of our project
In our iGEM Booklet, we gathered background knowledge about ""What is solid tumor and how to treat it"". As an educational booklet, knowledge is carefully summarized, including background information, social situation, and critical learning questions. Therefore people with limited Biology background could easily learn something from the booklet. But more importantly, when we gathered information for this handbook, we were also enriched with the knowledge, which helped us design our project at the very beginning more rationally.
For example, by making the booklet, we knew that bifidobacterium, an anaerobic gram positive bacterium, and has been validated on anti-aging, anti infection, relieving constipation, and improving lactose which is not resistant to disease and nutritional immunity. In addition, it has an inhibitory effect on the occurrence and development of a variety of tumors. The characteristics of bifidobacterium impressed us, therefore we decided to make bifidobacterium a part of our design.
Other information we got when we make the booklet are also important and then be integrated into the design of our project. Such as the application of plasmid pMB – 1, the design of adding HU-promoter to improve the expression level of apoptin. More information can be found in our booklet and the website.

Professor Kang was also generous for contributing the experience about in-situ injection. Thanks to Prof. Kang, our experiments were able to progress smoothly.

We’ve read about a technique that can stain iron, which is essentially the same as the creation of Prussian Blue ferritin. Using this method we could exploit the iron core of ferritin by running a native PAGE and staining the iron core. This would then confirm the presence of our protein, therefore we ran initial tests of this method by running dilutions of the ordered ferritin solution in addition to other things. This method worked extremely well for staining ferritin controls, although the E. coli samples lack the bands, which is problematic as this indicates  either there is no ferritin being produced, or this stain isn’t sensitive enough for the amount of ferritin produced.
On a happier note, our work with Gibson assembly has finally produced one of our constructs, the fusion of the heavy and light ferritin chains to an E coil ( BBa_K1189018 ). Because this method appears to be relatively successful, we intend to order more primers and use Gibson assembly for the construction of other parts as well.
Week 19: September 2 - September 6
We got more Gibson primers for the creation of the fusion proteins containing TALA and TALB connected to ferritin ( BBa_K1189021 ). The pieces were extracted with PCR and the Gibson reaction was attempted and subsequently transformed. All of the resulting colonies did not contain our desired part and this may be due to the presence of template vector originally used for the PCRs. Therefore we will attempt to treat the DNA with DPNI in order to chew up the original vector.
Week 20: September 9 - September 13
The western blots for β-lactamase and the TALE constructs ( BBa_K1189007 , BBa_K1189029 , BBa_K1189030 )appear to look good, despite the very faint bands seen on SDS-PAGE. Therefore it is possible ferritin is being expressed as well, but is too difficult to see due to background. We may attempt to try to clean up the sample through some crude purification techniques such as treating the sample at 75 degrees Celsius, exploiting the stability of ferritin. Alternatively, once we attach the His-tag to our main coil-ferritin construct, we can try to observe ferritin expression through western blots as well.

Tec-Monterrey,2010,Team:Tec-Monterrey#Geneticframe_-_-_TEXT.html," second part of the construction is in charge of producing the reporter proteins. According to our research on biological sensors, the reporter molecule must be easy to detect and it must be a substance that is not naturally produced by the organism. Fluorescent proteins are great reporter proteins because they fulfill both of these requirements. The team from British Columbia University used three different fluorescent proteins in their project in the 2009 competition: Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP), and the Cherry variety of the Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP Cherry). We ultimately decided to use the same three molecules because they have been widely characterized and there is plenty of information regarding their fluorescence spectrum and behavior.
When the sensing part of our construction produces one of the bacteriophage activators, this molecule enables the expression of one of the reporter proteins. Because these promoters produce very high PoPS numbers, the amount of reporter molecule produced is elevated, even though the arabinose concentration isn’t. The following figure is a detail that explains the mechanism behind the production of reporter proteins.
Figure 6: shows the reporter part of the final construct.

Phage Activators
The most basic bio-bricks created in our project were sequences from the genome of the Mu bacteriophage that attacks E. coli. We needed some sort of sensitivity tuner for our biosensor and the registry had only one family of promoters and protein activators that could be used for the construction of these devices. After some research we came to Mu bacteriophage, where we found two different families of promoters and protein activators: Mor protein – Pm promoter and C protein - Plys, Pi, Pp and Pmom promoters. We took the reported sequences of Mor, Pm, C (Kumaraswami & Howe, 2004) and Pmom (Jiang, 2008) . The proteins sequences were optimized for their expression in E. coli with Mr. Gene’s optimization algorithm; we added an Elowitzribosome binding site and finally the BioBrick prefix and suffix to create the bio-bricks that we used. We only added the prefix and suffix to the promoters sequences.
The Proteins
Mor and C are both proteins encoded in the genome of Mu bacteriophage, and they have similar characteristics. Both are proteins that bind to DNA in a specific sequence, both have about the same size, sequence and have similar secondary structures and domains.  Figure 7 (Mathee, 1990) shows the amino acid sequence alignment of Mor and C proteins.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Modeling#Tutorial_-_-_TEXT.html,"c(t)\]                              \[\dfrac{d}{dt}c(t)=-k_{-1}c(t) + k_{1}s(t)(e_{T}-c(t)) - k_{2}c(t)\]                              \[\dfrac{d}{dt}p(t) = k_{2}c(t)\]
We have one further simplification to make. This is the rapid equilibrium approximation, by which we assume that equilibrium between \(s+e\) and \(c\) on a much faster time scale than the reaction of \(c\) to \(p\). With this approximation we can write the following equation:
\[0=-k_{-1}c(t) + k_{1}s(t)(e_{T}-c(t)) - k_{2}c(t)\]
Leading to:
\[c^{*}(t)= \dfrac{k_{1}s(t)e_{T}}{k_{-1} + k_{2} + k_{1}s(t)}\]
Now we can see that \(c\) is no longer an independent variable, but instead tracks the other variables. This can be referred to as \(c\) being in quasi-steady state. By including this new expression into our model we are left with:
\[\dfrac{d}{dt}s(t) = -\dfrac{k_{2}k_{1}s(t)e_{T}}{k_{-1} + k_{2} + k_{1}s(t)}\]                              \[\dfrac{d}{dt}p(t) = \dfrac{k_{2}k_{1}s(t)e_{T}}{k_{-1} + k_{2} + k_{1}s(t)}\]
With this we have an expression describing our enzyme catalysed system in the form of a single reaction. The rate of this reaction is known as a Michaelis-Menten rate law. By defining \(K_{max}=k_{2}e_{T}\) and \(K_{half}=\dfrac{k_{-1}+k_{2}}{k_{1}}\) we can express in the more familiar form:
\[rate \: of \: S \mathop{\rightarrow} P = K_{max}\dfrac{s}{K_{half} + s}\]
It is worth noting that there are a number of ways to derive this formula, each involving different approximations. These methods may lead to the constants \(K_{max}\) and \(K_{half}\) being defined differently.

added 330 uL of water to the concentrated sample to dilute it down to 15% w/v
a small note: after refrigeration (4 C), the concentrated sample will look like it has gelled. However, if you let it ""thaw"" for  a while, it will become liquid again.
Spinning
we used an 18 gauge needle to draw 0.8mL of the silk into a 1 mL syringe
then replaced the needle with 10cm of the PEEK tubing
interestingly, no air bubbles formed when drawing up the plunger. (drawn up very slowly)
extruded the dope at 6 uL/min, into 3 different solvent
Ammonium Sulfate
the dope just coagulated into a blob. Similar to cellulose acetate spinning into water
Ethanol (70%)
the dope came out as a fiber
however, sometimes it seemed like multiple fibers were extruding from the tube at once
upon using tweezers to pull away the mass at the tip of the fiber, it sometimes started extruding as a single strand
Isopropanol (70%)
it was very similar to the ethanol spin
sometimes, multiple strands came out of the PEEK tubing at once
sometimes, a single strand comes out
the fibers that came out settled on the bottom of the beaker in a tangled mass
all fibers were left to soak in the coagulation bath overnight"

I’m a synthetic biology enthusiast with a mathematical background and crazy ideas. I’m definitely an optimist so often I need somebody to keep my feet on the ground. I’m very curious and one of the best entertainment is to find out how everything works. I also love to code but lately, I haven’t had too much time for that. In fall 2014 I started my Master’s studies in Biotechnology at ETH Zürich and I’m majoring in Synthetic Biology.
In 2013 I heard about iGEM and I knew immediately that I want to participate in it. I took an initiative to found the first-ever Finnish iGEM team and thus, I ended up being the team captain. This means I’m the jack-of-all-trades trying to peek my nose to everything but I’m not really getting things done. I’ve been writing tons of emails, funding applications and developed new ideas but pretty much all the credit of implementing them goes to the rest of our awesome team.
I used to play piano and frisbeegolf, do scouting and go cycling. Since I moved to Switzerland (this odd country with a weird set of languages not familiar to me) I’ve tried to enjoy cycling as much as possible because those other hobbies do not really work out here. After iGEM I’m going to look forward to try something new and get involved in new projects. And I already miss sauna and rye bread!

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," diagnostics is not centralized like it is for vaccines. As an example, he mentioned the current situation of malaria diagnostics, where 95% of all diagnostics are produced by only two companies. Moreover, it can be very difficult to actually implement the tool due to regulations and bureaucracy, especially if there already exists a diagnostic for the target disease, even if the new one is better in multiple aspects.
On the positive side, he mentioned that our project has the advantage of being flexible, due to its modularity, and efficient, due to the basic level of training required. Another advantage we could look into is making the diagnostic quantitative, as this would allow for identifying the severity of the disease. This would result in better decision making of personnel in terms of sending patients to the hospital.
On the topic of outbreak prevention dr. Erwan Piriou told us that developing diagnostics for these targets is often difficult, but our system has the advantage of being modular and easy to scale-up. Preventing recurrence comes down to screening in the field with diagnostics, which means that these need to be available with long shelf life, as well as data communication to central labs. However, money nor personnel is available for these practices, leading to a lot of examples of disease recurrence in the recent decades. The WHO is attempting to centralize funding for diagnostics somewhat by making an ‘essential diagnostic list’. By coming to an agreement, worldwide funding for these diagnostics might be sped up.
We showed our device and let him ‘experience’ it without any instructions about its functioning. He quickly understood how everything was supposed to work and said:
people would definitely be able to use this device in the field
and also mentioned how he didn’t see a need for extensive training of personnel. He asked us if we thought about multiplexing for different diseases and carrying out multiple tests for multiple patients at the same time. He mentioned how tests for the 5-10 most common diseases would reduce the amount of nonspecific antibiotic prescriptions to patients. He also mentioned how our device could benefit from being open-source as it could easily be modified due to its modularity. However, this would lead to problems with attracting investors.

Shanghaitech,2017,Team:Shanghaitech#Workshop_-_-_TEXT.html," dinitrotoluene sensing bacteria were created. Whenever dinitrotoluene, the decomposed product of the TNT, is present, the bacteria will generate GFP (green fluorescent protein) to alert mine searcher. The three basic element in this case is:
input (dinitrotoluene sensor)— processing (direct) — output (GFP)
To demonstrate the concept of logic gate, we made some extension to this example. Logical processing, the application of logic gates, might increase the accuracy of the detection to a large extent. For instance, co-sensing dinitrotoluene and metal by two sensors, using AND gate, can solve the problem of gas (dinitrotoluene) dispersion.
The three basic elements are then:
Input (dinitrotoluene sensor, metal sensor)—processing (AND gate)—output(GFP)
Synthetic Music (BioArt)
The second example is about art and design, which is an iGEM project done by NYU Shanghai. This example helped in keeping the attention of participants with background in designing. They made full use of the randomness of biotics to show the beauty of the nature. They made a device to detect the position of fluorescent light in culture dish and then generate electronic sound. They were able to make a synthetic music eventually.
The three basic elements are:
Input (direct)—processing(oscillator)—output(GFP/RFP/YFP)
Bio-adder (signal processing)
This might be intriguing for experts from the Information Science to design a Bio-adder. In this case, the most complicated part is processing, which includes multiple logic gates like NOR gate, AND gate and OR gate.
The three basic elements are:
Input (fluorescent sensor)—processing (digital circuit of Adder)—Output(GFP)
After these three cases, the participants had a better understanding of the circuit designing logic, and got an overall impression about synthetic biology.

Hardware & Software display
The previous session has prepared the participants with basic knowledge of synthetic biology. There are three main elements in the gene circuit designing session: input, processing, and output.
However, designing genetic circuits has a high bar in expertise, which might be too complicated for non-biology workers. In addition, due to the relatively small gene capacity of a regular plasmid, putting all element gene in one plasmid is very challenging even for experts.
To help makers to realize their enlightening designs, we invented MagicBlock, a set of gene logic gates, including the interactive software and automated hardware, to reduce the bar for constructing genetic circuits. By separating each element into different"

Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," (Nedierholtmeyer et al (2010) Applied and Environmental Microbiology (2010) 76: 3462) showed that by expressing the Zymonomas mobilis glucose facilitative transporter (GLF) gene in Synechococcus, glucose and fructose were detected in the culture medium at levels as high as 30 uM and 150 uM respectively. Based on these results we decided to express GLF in Synechocystis. Our hope is that by expressing GLF in the AGP KO/INV overexpressing line, we will be able to produce enough glucose to the surrounding medium to support the E. coli biofuel production.
ThiE K.O./GLF Construct Design
To integrate the GLF gene into the Synechocystis genome, we have decided to use an alternative insertion site. In this case we will insert the GLF overexpression gene cassette along with a chloramphenicol resistance cassette (CamR) into the coding region of the thiamin monophosphate pyrophosphorylase (ThiE) gene. The rationale for creating a ThiE knockout mutant is that it will lead to the creation of an auxotophic mutant that will only survive when the grown in the presence of thiamin (Vitamin B1). Therefore, the transgenic Synechocystis will not be able to survive outside laboratory and the chances of environmental contamination will be decreased. We will simultaneously create the ThiE mutant and the GLF overexpressing line by creating an ThiE gene replacement construct in which the GLF overexpression gene cassette and a chloramphenicol resistance gene cassette are inserted into the coding region of a subcloned ThiE gene. This dysfunctional ThiE construct will then be transformed into Synechocystis and through homologous recombination, replace the native ThiE gene.
ThiE K.O./GLF Construct Components
ThiE Gene: The sll0635 open reading frame was PCR amplified from total Synechocystis PCC6803 genomic DNA and subcloned into pSB1a3. Forward and reverse primers were designed with 5’ extensions containing iGEM prefix and suffix sequences.

A new batch of LA-medium was made and used to make ampicillin petri dishes.
A restriction digest was done on the lld promoter, as described in the protocols . It was cut with EcoRI and SpeI, and will be an insert with RBS <partinfo>BBa_B0030</partinfo> as backbone. This will then make the plasmid <partinfo>pSB1A2</partinfo> the backbone.
Sunday 05.08.12
Plasmid DNA was isolated from pllD-1B and <partinfo>BBa_B0014</partinfo> cultures were isolated by miniprep. DNA concentrations were measured as 41,2/42,5 and 53,3/52,8 ng/uL respectively (two measurements per sample).
Inspected agar plates in incubator inoculated on 3/8: VGB+RBS religation: 1 colony VHB+RBS+lysis: Good growth VHB+RBS religation: ~ 20 colonies VHB+RBS + lysis: Good growth pBAD (w/ backbone), religated: 40+ colonies pBAD +YFP +DTT: 7 colonies
Comments: Judging from the growth on the religation plates, colonies with non-insert plasmids is a possibility on all plates. pBAD is especially worrisome, as the number of colonies is lower on the insert ligation plate than on the backbone religation plate. The lysis part used in the above constructs already has an RBS, so the RBS part is redundant.
Induced one 5 mL culture (induction culture) pllD + lysis (3/8) with 210 uL ~ 1M lactate and addded 210 uL dH2O to another (control culture). Sampled 200 uL from both before induction, for OD measurements.
Inoculated 5 5 mL LB + Amp cultures with colonies from the following agar plates: VGB+RBS+Lysis (3/8) VHB+RBS+Lysis (3/8) pBAD + YFP +DTT (3/8) (3 colonies)

NRP-UEA-Norwich,2012,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," time for the whole NRP UEA team. At the beginning of the 12 weeks that our project would span, we didn't imagine the amount of knowledge and experience we would gain and the fun we would have. Not only did we work with many very interesting researchers at our university, we also became part of the great community that iGEM is and met other students that were just as drawn in by synthetic biology as we were.  A highlight for this was definitely the UK team meetup that we hosted in London.  All this made us grow close together as a team and the summer flew by. We celebrated our results and rejoiced when hard work payed off. But not only did we enjoy our time in the lab, we also made the most of our free time. We threw birthday parties, traveled together, enjoyed culture and music and in general just had a good time. To be honest, not everything was pleasant and in the lab especially first tries often did not succeed. We soon realised that research can confront you with setbacks that press down hard on moral. Everyone who has experienced this will know that team spirit is very important. Be it a failed gel purification or the realisation that you spend the last 3 days working with the wrong plasmid, it is never pleasant to see a team member disappointed. We were lucky to have an easy cure for this. We passed the time with fun games that sprung our imagination or were inspired by funny realisations or activities. Pegging, Dress-Up Thursday and mini prep queen/king, to name only things that caused lots of laughter and joy. But the game Ninjas was always the highlight be it during late nights of research, sunny lunch breaks or during the UK meetup where we played with lots of other teams. Team spirit has been high the whole time of iGEM 2012 and was one of the things that made this summer so rememberable. Read on and be inspired by the fun!
When 7 UEA undergraduates collide, we come together and have lots and lots of fun. Thanks to this awesome opportunity that iGEM has provided, the last few months have been AMAZING. We worked really hard but we also played hard and we would like to take you through some of our experiences and share the Joy - yes pun intended, with you.
This was our 10 weeks in, shortened to 6 minutes. It has been crazy experience and scary how fast it flew by. Below are some activities that we played more than a lot. We changed some of the rules around a little but we hope this gives others an idea of how to enjoy"

Among these India is reported the most caused by big 4 including Russell's viper, Indian cobra, saw-scaled viper, and the common krait. Indian cobra is found the most famous and make the highest fatality rate (43%) in India and Southeast asia.
Indian cobra venom contains a potent post-synaptic neurotoxin which acts on the synaptic gaps of the nerves, thereby paralyzing muscles, and in severe bites leading to acute respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. The components of venom include lysis enzymes such as hyaluronidase which increase the spread of the venom. Its toxicity is found one of the highest based on LD50 value in mice. Symptoms of cobra envenomation can begin from 15 minutes to two hours after the bite, and can be fatal in less than an hour.
Despite the advance in emergency therapy, anti-venom is often only the effective treatment. In treatment anti-venom is injected into patient intraven"

Thessaloniki,2018,Team:Thessaloniki#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," - 3/3/2018
At the high school level, we came in contact                                                 with two major educational institutions,                                                 “Eniaio Ekpaideutiko Kentron” and “Frontistirio                                                 Agrafiotis”. The owners and professors showed                                                 interest in our project and we wanted to make                                                 sure that the students could learn about an                                                 interdisciplinary branch of science, synthetic                                                 biology, as well as understand our project.                                                 Even though we came in with high hopes, we                                                 could not have imagined the amount of questions                                                 and excitement that the students shown. During                                                 our presentation, we explained them the basics                                                 of synthetic biology by showing them exemplary                                                 projects as well as the project we were                                                 designing.
In our country, the final years of high school                                                 tend to be very stressful and taxing for                                                 students [1]. The PanHellenic exams are very                                                 competitive and, on top of that, students                                                 confront the difficult task of deciding their                                                 school of preference/ preferred field of study/                                                 career orientation in such a young age. We, as                                                 an iGEM Team, are characterised by                                                 interdisciplinarity and many of us could not                                                 ever imagine that we would be involved in the                                                 design of a biological system in an                                                 undergraduate level. So, we made an effort to                                                 highlight that interdisciplinarity [2] is one                                                 of the main characteristics of modern academia                                                 and industry, as well as that there are a lot                                                 of opportunities to evolve and get into novel                                                 scientific branches, such as Synthetic Biology.                                                 Therefore, we believe that our interaction with                                                 the students gave them the chance to learn                                                 about contemporary science beyond school books.                                                 In addition, we gave them examples proving that                                                 their chosen field of study is not confining                                                 and, through interdisciplinarity, they can                                                 pursue their goals and get involved in exciting                                                 projects and activities. We were thankful to                                                 have the chance to promote science in such an                                                 interactive way, and have made plans to further                                                 extend our outreach after the competition.

Overnight cultures of Top10 strains transformed with PompC-rfp, rfp, pSB1C3 and RBS-rfp-Ter respectively grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics were diluted at least 1:100 in the medium and incubated at 37 °C as fresh cultures. After their OD600 reached 0.2~0.4, the fresh culture was diluted 1 : 3 into 4 ml of LBON medium(1g Tryptone, 1g Yeast Extract in 100mL H2O). [4] For osmolarity conditions, the cultures were diluted with NaCl supplemented medium to the final concentration of 0%, 0.25%, 0.50% and 1% (wt/vol). After 12 hours of induction, the results are as follows.
With the osmotic pressure increasing, the expression of RFP didn’t increase in experimental groups as we expected. That is to say under natural conditions, the expression of EnvZ-OmpR is too low to regulate the activity of PompC promoter. However, from the pictures we can see the colony of experimental groups still became red. It shows that the existence of EnvZ-OmpR makes the PompC promoter become a little bit active under the natural conditions, the basal activity of the PompC is correspondingly higher. So if we want to try to control the expression of the downstream target gene of the PompC by using EnvZ-OmpR-PompC circuit, we’d better knock out the EnvZ-OmpR gene in the engineering bacteria first.

Purpose:
One of the novelties of our human practices this year is the contact between enterprises and us. This is the first time for us that we try to have positive action to communicate with social enterprises, raising awareness in the society about iGEM and synthetic biology. We approached two biotechnology companies in order to achieve the following points:
1: Communicate with different kinds of social people and get some advice from them.
2: Spread iGEM to more individuals and groups who want to have a good understanding of synthetic biology.
3: As we want to apply our Magnetotatic E.coli into the biofuel cell, we would like to learn more about the market situation.
4: Initial contact to the Chengdu Biology Maker,seek future cooperation.

Plasmid preparation - Miniprep
Back to protocols .
Plasmid preparation procedure known as ""miniprep"" is used to extract plasmids from small bacterial cultures. Bacteria undergo alkaline lysis to release the plasmids, while genomic DNA stays bound to cell structures. Cell debris are eliminated by centrifugation and the supernatant containing plasmids is loaded to a DNA binding column, it is first washed, than DNA is eluted. DNA conentration can be measured with a spectrophotometer.
For miniprep procedure bacterial cultures are grown overnight in 5ml LB with with antibiotic. These cultures are started from a single colony grown on a LB-agar plate, usually the selection plate after transformation or it can be a streak of glycerin stock.

As of 8 June 2011, all the solutions in the kit are already mixed. Therefore, most of the ""Before Starting"" steps of the instruction leaflet can be skipped.
The TE buffer is replaced by EB buffer. The TE buffer inhibits sequencing reactions, therefore it is avoided.

They won me over and since labwork isn't my experties I took on the task of managing our team's social media accounts and the wiki stuff.
iGEM might stress you out from time to time but working in this team is a nice alternation to the daily student life.

ORF314 (BBa_K1846000)
This is host-specific subunit of the short tail fibre protein of bacteriophage lambda. The C-terminus of the protein (ORF-314) contains the recognition site that confers binding specificity to the OmpC membrane protein of E.coli[1].
To transform ORF-314 sequence into a BioBrick basic part, we had the coding sequence synthesised, including the BioBrick prefix and suffix. The sequence was optimised to remove illegal restriction sites. We restricted both our synthesised ORF-314 and the linearised plasmid backbones (pSB1C3 for shipping, and pSB1K3 for further processing) with EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes, before ligating the two pieces together using T4 DNA ligase. Success of the cloning procedure was confirmed by restriction with EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes followed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 1), with pSB1C3 alone and ORF314 alone as controls. The construct was also confirmed by sequencing. ORF-314 was submitted as BBa_K1846000.
Figure 1. Agarose gel electrophoresis of ORF314 inserted in pSB1C3 and restricted with EcoRI and PstI. The expected band sizes are 1 kb for ORF314 and 2 kb for pSB1C3. Successful results were obtained for samples 2 and 3.
stf (short tail fibre) gene (BBa_K1846004)
The stf gene encodes the short tail fibres found in the Ur-lambda bacteriophage, the original isolate [1]. The wild type lambda strain (λ-PaPa) that is most commonly used in research carries a frameshift mutation in the stf gene sequence producing no such fibres. It has been shown that the presence of these additional thin tails results in the more efficient adsorption to the host, E.coli [1].
The stf gene is a product of two open reading frames: ORF-401 and ORF-314. Introduction of 1 bp just after ORF-401 removes the frameshift fusing the two coding regions together which"

We tried using the Biovision NADP+/NADPH Assay kit along with a freeze-thaw lysis process.  However, the results came out negative.  We decided to skip using the kit in the future and, instead focus on the combined experiment testing our NADPH levels along with the cells excreting and producing the 3α-HSD enzyme.

Integrated Human Practices (Gold)
In the youthful stages of project design, we had researched the vast epidemiology of Leishmaniasis as a neglected tropical disease, and read into the Lutzomyia longipalpis saliva protein, LJM11, as a solid solution for immunisation against the disease. But we felt there were many questions which still needed to be answered before we could be sure that it is a worthwhile investment of both time and money;
Is our Limitless Lactis vaccination actually needed in the developing world? Is the disease as prevalent as we had read? How would it add to current available prevention/treatment and provide benefit to the population?
Is it something that the population will accept?
Would the regulatory bodies in afflicted regions approve of this therapeutic? What problems might be encountered?
Is there any way that we can improve our therapeutic design to make it more beneficial to these areas?
Outside of therapeutics, are there any other ways that we could combat the disease?
However, despite our extended efforts to find the answers to all of these questions by filtering the available online database, we couldn’t answer all of them. We were left frustrated. We soon realised that we were looking in the wrong places. These are real world questions which need real world answers. Leishmaniasis is a disease which resides primarily in the developing world, where the web is an underused resource. These answers weren’t all online, they lied in the people living on the soil of the affected areas. Thus, this realisation instigated the next step in our project - to reach out to those who live in the affected areas.
We researched the areas affected by Leishmaniasis, and debated which country would be most beneficial to visit to find these answers. Following careful deliberation, we decided to go to Honduras in Central America.
                                    Figure 1 Figure 1                          
We chose Honduras due to the immense numbers of reported cases of Leishmaniasis in the country and due to the current climate of governmental support for the disease. Last year"

Manufacturing Considerations
Pill manufacture is not only concerned with drug release but also by synthesis, purification, packaging, storage, administration and quality control. The E.ncapsulator has been designed to address each of these important manufacturing considerations. By taking these considerations into account, we hope to present The E.ncapsulator as a viable, cost-effective alternative to current drug production and delivery methods.
If The E.ncapsulator is to be adopted as a drug delivery platform, it must be able to synthesise any polypeptide. To this end, we have designed a 'universal adaptor' such that peptides which do not begin with the amino acid methionine can be synthesised. In addition, we have 'codon optimised' all non native E.coli genes to maximise gene expression efficiency.
In The E.ncapsulator, polypeptide synthesis (Module 1) and encapsulation of the cells(Module 2) occur in the same place. This duel production and delivery platform means that there is no need for expensive downstream purification processes.
As The E.ncapsulator is designed to be safe to consume, purification of the drug is not necessary. This means that our solution represents a cost-effective alternative to current production methods.
Storage has been considered in two ways. Firstly trehalose facilitates freeze drying and secondly we have been experimenting with a number if secondary encapsulation technologies including: xantham gum, milk protein and gelatin.
Trehalose is a naturally occuring sugar which is known to be important in resistance to dessication and temperature shock by many bacterial species. We have included several genes coding for the enzymes responsible for the conversion of glucose to trehalose. Secondary encapsulation is further processing that can be performed to allow for pill manufacture.
The encapsulation of the cell with the colanic acid coat facilitates transport of The E.ncapsulator through the stomach, and protecting the contents against acid breakdown. Furthermore, we have experimented with different secondary capsules that are edible and cheap to produce. This post-processing means transport and dose control of the product is much easier.
Since we are depending on a population of cells to produce a biologically active polypeptide our bets are hedged. In that if one cell fails to produce any protein it will have a minimal impact on the whole system.
Another important aspect of quality control is safety. To minimise risks associated with our product, we have chosen a GRAS (generally"

Introduction
After inserting inducible promoters in our violacein pathway, our system now has inbuilt switches. This means we can automate the pathway with computers and control the production of all four metabolites in the violacein pathway by applying control theory. We have come up with the idea/plan behind the implementation of this idea. Our ultimate objective is to control the concentration of all four metabolic products in solution, in real-time automated fashion.
To achieve our objective, we have planned the theory, schema and designed models of two different systems: a culture management system and an image processing & response system. We believe that this will be a step forward for future projects involving the violacein pathway as well as a proof-of-concept for the automation of metabolic pathways in general. Our pages for drylab include:
Design : An explanation of the motivation and scientific theory, as well as our implementation of our design.
Hardware : Technical explanation of our setup parts.
Demonstration : Preliminary Explanation of current undertakings and progress.
Conclusion
To achieve our objective, we have planned the theory, schema and designed models of two different systems: a culture management system and an image processing & response system.The setup that our team developed so far will be able to determine the relationship between RGB values and metabolite concentration. By first elucidating this relationship and creating the physical chemostat and Raspberry Pi setup, we believe our work can already be translatable in many different situations and experiments for other teams in the future. The machine learning aspect of our plans would be the most time-intensive and difficult part to master. But, with more time, we would like to develop our plans and put them to fruition, eventually building a proof-of-concept system for the automation of metabolic pathways in general.

Material and Methods
Available X-ray Data
3D structures of the CBM3a and mSA2 protein domains are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We chose to use 4JO52 and 4JNJ3, both solved  by X-ray crystallography, with a resolution of 1.98 and 1.90 Å respectively.
After obtaining these files, we faced two problems. First, the endogenous linkers of the CBM3a that we use to connect our heads together had never been resolved by biophysical methods, due to their flexibility and length. Secondly, 4-azido-L-phenylalanine (AzF) had never been modelled, in its native state or covalently bonded to another molecule. This process will be detailed further on in this page.
3D Structure Prediction
This did however present a complex challenge for the prediction methods used. Our protein is 366 amino acids in length, containing two protein domains structurally organised in protein secondary structures (CBM, mSA2) and two peptide linkers, one connecting the CBM and streptavidin and the other one free on the C-terminus of the protein. The linkers are known in the literature to be highly flexible1;2 and as Intrinsically Disordered Regions (or IDRs) and therefore their structures have never been successfully resolved by biophysical methods.
The three prediction software tools we chose to use were I-TASSER, Swiss Model and MODELLER. This allowed us to obtain a 3D structural model of our protein on which we could start calculations.
I-TASSER is an online platform hosted by the Zhang Lab (University of Michigan) that can perform 3D model protein prediction4. It computes it by searching reference templates in the PDB database through the LOMETS server, filling the unidentified regions by replica-exchange Monte Carlo Simulation. It then assembles the input structure to the 10 most probable models found on the database. It performs optimization of the structure and searches for protein domain enrichment in different databases such as Gene Ontology.
SWISS-MODE"
Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"). mntH is part of the Nramp family of proton-coupled metal ion transporters (Que. Q., Helmann. J.D.; 2000). It is also classified as a secondary transporter (Membrane Transport website).
It is also known that mntH is regulated negatively by increasing manganese ion concentrations. This is allowed to happen through the promoter called mntR (Que. Q., Helmann. J.D.; 2000). This means that B.subtilis has the ability to limit the manganese metal intake system when the intracellular concentrations of Mn2+ starts to approach cytotoxic levels.
Cadmium Sensing
If our project is to process cadmium and not other metals, we need to genetically engineer Bacillus subtilis to carry out a set of cellular processes based on the action of metal sensors. These metal sensors will detect cadmium through a system known as AND Gating.
There are two metal sensing repressors, which are known to respond to cadmium: ArsR and CzrA (also known as YozA).
i) ArsR
ArsR (also known as YqcJ) is a protein which is part of the ArsR-SmtB family of transcriptional regulators. It is a regulating protein for the arsenic resistance operon in Bacillus subtilis (NCBI website – arsR family transcription regulator profile) (Moore. C.M and Helmann. J.D; 2005).
The ArsR protein acts as a repressor until it is conformationally changed by the presence of arsenic ions (Harvie. D.R, et al; 2006). However, arsenic is not the only metal which can cause this action to happen; it has been noted that silver (Ag(I)), cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) (Moore. C.M and Helmann. J.D; 2005) can cause this action to happen.

CzrA (also known as YozA) is a member of the ArsR-SmtB family of transcriptional regulators (Moore. C.M and Helmann. J.D; 2005)(Harvie. D.R, et al; 2006). Like ArsR, it is a regulator protein which can be relieved from binding to the DNA by being bound to by metal ions – these include zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co), nickel ("
KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," and sustainable alternative for insecticides. Our modified E. coli, the BanAphids (meaning ‘to ban aphids’ as well as provide plants with ‘benefits’), would produce the aphid’s own alarm pheromone, E-β-farnesene (EBF), to repel them off the plant. On top of that we want to attract aphid predators such as the ladybug via the production of Methyl Salicylate (MeS), a phytohormone, by our BanAphids. This way we ensure aphids are thoroughly removed from the plant.
We devised two different systems that might use these molecules. We did this because of response we received from both private end users and the general public.
In the first system, our honeydew system , we spray our BanAphids directly onto the plants. In this system our BanAphids will only produce MeS when aphids are present because they are sensitive to the high concentrations of glucose found in the honeydew produced by the aphids. This interaction minimises the burden on the plant’s metabolism, attracts predators only when needed and avoids aphid habituation.
Honeydew System
Shows our BanAphids producing EBF to get rid of aphids and MeS to attract ladybugs.
Honeydew system
We devised a second system with input from the private end user: the sticker system .  Our second method starts from the principle that the BanAphids may not come in direct contact with the plants because of safety and ethical concerns. For this we turned to the sticker model of the Groningen 2012 iGEM team to use as a container. The sticker is composed of a plastic film, whose pores are too small for the BanAphids to pass, but large enough so that the volatile pheromones it produces still pass. The Groningen 2012 iGEM team has already investigated the biosafety of this sticker. However this means the BanAphids lose direct contact with the honeydew and the Honeydew System fails. To overcome this and permit this containment, we designed our own oscillating system so that there is an alternating MeS and EBF production.
Finally we want to define the impact of both these systems on the ecosystem. In collaboration with the relevant industries we performed various plant and insect experiments for the E. coligy part of our project. This allows us to demonstrate the effect of our systems on the ecosystem.

What We Do
The  burning  of  fossil  fuels  generates  greenhouse  gases  that  are  damaging  the  atmosphere  and  impacting  the  global  environment.  Energy  from  sustainable  sources  such  as  wind  and  solar  is  difficult  to  store  for  times  when  the  wind  is  not  blowing  or  the  sun  is  not  shining.
In  order  to  build  a  sustainable  energy  source  for  energy  on  demand  we  are  creating  a  system  using  living  organisms.  E.  coli  will  be  engineered  to  synthesize  lactate  which  will  then  be  used  to  feed  a  Shewanella  biofilm.  Shewanella  is  a  bacteria  that  can  transfer  electrons  to  a  cathode  and  produce  a  current  to  light  a  bulb.  The  community  will  be  involved  through  a  DNA  Code  Game designed  for  middle  and  elementary  school  students  to  raise  awareness  of  synthetic  biology  and  iGEM.

However, specific binding of the insert at the correct size in the clones indicates proper presence of device in each ligation product.  Forever, GFP screening using the Invitrogen gel box aided in screening colonies, electing those that fluoresced under standard conditions (no the case for Device 3, but for Devices 1 and 2).
Next steps
Three colonies were selected from each device (1-1, 1-2, 1-4, 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, and 3-1,3-2,3-3), excluding one colony based on purity of the band and potential for differential insert via non-specific binding.
Each corresponding 49 ul suspension was use to inoculate 10 mL of LB with chloramphenicol (34 ug/uL), and placed O/N in a 200 RPM shaking incubator at 37 degrees.  A negative control using the sterile LB of interest in the colony PCR was placed in the same media and incubator O/N.
OD will be checked for all cultures tomorrow with 1mL of culture.  Additionally, 500 uL will be used to glycerol stock each clone.  3 mL will be used to miniprep the device plasmids and small aliquots will be taken for sequencing.  The remains will be diluted and used in 96 well format for fluorescence practice assaying using the BioTex plate reader and software.

Given both $u_s$ and $v_s$ are in proportion to $e^{{\lambda}t}$, it can be deduced that ${\lambda}$ is equal to the eigenvalues of the matrix in (A). And as the matrix in (A) has two eigenvalues, it can be said that $u_s$ and $v_s$ are described as a linear combination of $e^{{\lambda}t}s$. If all of ${\lambda}$s are negative, $e^{{\lambda}t}$s get smaller and smaller as time passes. It means every time when (u,v) feels any small fluctuations, (u,v) returns to the point $(u_0, v_0)$. In other words, if all ${\lambda}$s are negative, $(u_0, v_0)$ is a “stable” point. On the contrary, if any of ${\lambda}$s is positive, as $e^{{\lambda}t}$s whose ${\lambda}$ is positive gets larger and larger, it can be said that (u, v) won’t return to $(u_0, v_0)$.

The importance of palm oil as a sustainable source
Since the population has become more aware of the impacts of palm oil cultivation, more and more companies attempt to obtain their used palm oil from sustainable sources. Unilever, a big multinational company for food, household goods and hygiene products, purchases nearly 3% of the global palm oil production in 2016 (1.5 million tonnes). Buy the end of 2019, Unilever plans to buy 100% physically certified palm oil and its derivatives [25,26].
The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), the currently prevalent certification system for sustainable palm oil, is criticized by many NGOs like Greenpeace [27]. As the University of Manchester iGEM Team 2013 mentioned, the supply options allow companies to use only a little amount of CSP(K)O (certified sustainable palm (kernel) oil) and claim to support sustainable palm oil [7]. Additionally, studies indicate that the RSPO is involved in deforestation and destruction of peatlands for the development of oil palm plantations, because its standards do not ban these [7,27]. However, more than 250 organisations worldwide have signed a declaration in which they criticize the RSPO certification as “greenwasing” [28].
Because of the need for a truly sustainable palm (kernel) oil to reduce environmental problems and the not transparent certification systems, a biosynthetic alternative to palm kernel oil may be the answer.
OUR PROJECT AS A QUESTION OF MORALITY
The environmental destruction that goes along with palm (kernel) oil production (as described here LINK) was what initially motivated us to develop a synthetic alternative but we knew that there are also other factors to consider. As the University of Manchester iGEM Team 2013 has outlined in their Human Practice work [7], there are millions of people in Indonesia and Malaysia involved in the palm oil industry and the introduction of a synthetic alternative might have a negative impact on them, such as forcing them into unemployment. Building on team Manchester’s work, we wanted to look into the possible ethical consequences of our project. We went on to research the situation of workers on plantations and found that there exist serious ethical problems within the current palm (kernel) oil industry"
Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html,"To analyze the functionality and fluorescent properties of the Malachite Green Aptamer we performed in vitro transcriptions and measured fluorescence in regular intervals. We prepared two negative controls (Blank) which were either depleted with T7 RNA Polymerase or without malachite green. The functional setup contains DNA template, polymerase as well as malachite green dye to monitor the transcription in real time by an increase of the fluorescence signal. If our Malachite-Green Aptamer read-out system functions properly, we expect an increase at an emission wavelength of 650 nm only for functional setup. The blank values should stay at zero. The results (Fig. 7) indicate that we do not see any increase of fluorescence for the blanks. All measured values show a fluctuation around 0. The graph of the functional aptamer with malachite green and T7 polymerase shows an increase of fluorescence over time. We were able to record a classical enzyme kinetic curve of a polymerase using the malachite green system (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, to confirm our data and to show, that the transcription efficiency is not hampered by the malachite green dye, we performed denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 7C). The gel shows similar band intensities in presence as well as in absence of the dye if T7 polymerase was added to the reaction. Thus malachite green does not influence our transcription efficiency.

in vitro transcription reaction was performed in presence of the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2/DFHBI and Malachite Green Aptamer DNA template/malachite green dye. Fluorescence was measured in regular intervals. During the reaction we were able to sense the decrease of ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 fluorescence and an increase of the fluorescence corresponding to the Malachite Green Aptamer. Controls (w/o T7 RNA polymerase) show no change in the fluorescence signal over time. Thus ATP consumption and RNA strand synthesis can be analyzed in real time.

IngenuityLab_Canada,2016,Team:IngenuityLab Canada#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"3-D Design – caDNAno2
To design the DNA scaffold structure, we used caDNAno software to design the 3-D structure. This program is simple to use and it gave us the computational tools to design such complex structure with relative ease. Our design is different from the DNA scaffold that Dr. Seidel’s Group develop because our aim was to simply the process as much as possible. We design the scaffold that using M13mp18 DNA because of its low cost and our structure’s hollow cavity is 4 helices by 4 helices. A smaller hollow cavity allowed our structure to retain all the functions that allows DNA gold precipitation but have far lower numbers of staple DNA strand required. The helices at the center which serve to attach a Gold Nano particle functionalized with Poly (T) DNA strand, has two sites of binding, while Dr. Seidel’s group developed their design using four strands of attachment.
 
Figure 1: Front view of the helices that form the DNA scaffold that is designed using caDNAno Software. The numbers indicate the helices number while helices 49 and 51 represent the strands which has Poly (A) protruding into the cavity which allows the DNA functionalized Gold-Nanoparticle can bind.
 
 
Figure 2: Screenshot of the design process using caDNAno2. This figure shows the “autostaples” function provided in the cadnano2 program. We had to make manual edits to the staples where appropriate.
 
 
Figure 3: Schematic showing gold nanoparticle functionalized with Poly(T) oligo strands being captured by Poly(A) oligo capture strands located on helices 49 and 51. The schematic also shows gold precipitation within the cavity of our structure; demonstrating the “moulding” ability of this design.
 
 
Figure 4: This is the three-dimensional model of our finished DNA origami nanostructure that was generated using Maya 2015 (Autodesk. Inc.). Autodesk and cadnano2 worked together to provide a plugin between the two programs.
 
Our design of the DNA based Gold Nano particle is likely biocompatible which allows it to be applicable in health care field. One field we tried to explore as a potential application of our circuit design is using Photosystem II to pass electrical current through the Gold nanowire. Since each scaffold is ~40 nm long, we aligned DNA based Gold nanowire using the Teslaphoresis technology developed at Rice University.

Production of Violacein by an E. coli Co-Culture
Before we started our experiments, we obtained a violacein standard from Sigma-Aldrich, Item:V9389-1MG . We used this standard to measure the absorbance of violacein at varying concentrations, obtaining the standard curve shown below. Full wavelength scans were obtained, but as shown by previous iGEM teams ( Cambridge 2009 ) the maximum absorbance of violacein is seen at 575nm and is reported here.
During our experiments we worked with several different strains of E. coli, each containing plasmids with different violacein constructs:
Strain 1: pcdfDuet+VioABE
Strain 2:pcdfDuet+VioDC
Strain 3: pcdfDuet:VioABE+VioDC (full operon)
While other teams and papers have reported that extracting pigment from cultures is the best way to perform analysis and quantification, several different solvents have been reported. The 2009 Cambridge iGEM team used acetone to extract, so we tested extraction of violacen from Strain 3 (full violacein operon) using acetone as well as methanol and ethanol.
Our results show that ethanol was the best solvent to use for extraction and so the rest of our extractions were performed in ethanol. The details of growth and sample analysis can be found on our protocols page.
Violacein Mono- and Co-Culture Wavelength Scans:
Strain 1, which only has the first half of the enzymes necessary to produce violacein is still able to produce a green pigment. When the pigment is extracted from"

At the end of the event, we drew lots among the people who solved the final puzzle. The winner was awarded a grand prize: a bike! (Sponsored by Bike in Paris)
The event was supported by several French institutions: The Ministry of the Environment, the Respire association, the Souffle Foundation, Bike in Paris, the Journal des Grandes Ecoles a University newspapers, the Pasteur Institute and the Paris City Hall. The Ministry of the Environment even highlighted our event on their website
The game was a great success as 108 people registered and nearly 95 participated in the treasure hunt. Like the rest of our project, the security of the players was our top priority. To do so, we filed a request to occupy public space, with the Paris City Hall and the Paris police headquarters. On account of our route passing through famous spots such as Notre Dame de Paris, the Pantheon, the Senate, Boulevard Saint-Michel ... Also at each step of the hunt, there was a safety officer that could immediately inform the police if any accident occurred.
In addition, this event received the congratulations of the Mayor of Paris, who said on Twitter: ""Congratulations to the team of the @ iGEM_Pasteur for this educational and fun action on the #Pollution of the air"" and was featured in several national newspapers: Le Parisien and 20 Minutes.
This innovative event allowed us to establish a dialogue outside the laboratory. Its playful nature made it possible to start a dialogue and debate openly without any barriers, and discuss in an original way around our synthetic biology project. We also sent a questionnaire to all participants after the game. The results of the 43 responses are presented below.
As we can see, 93% of the participants thought the Hunt for particulate matter, allowed them to discover synthetic biology and learn more about air pollution. All the players appreciated the idea of participating in a treasure hunt to discover a scientific topic. We also asked other questions about our device and took into account the answers while designing our product.
We also asked the following question: From what price would you say this product is too expensive? The average of the answers was 81 €.
Finally, we asked a more technical question about using our Aether product: The filters do not have an unlimited life, we consider the following charging system: The user will receive a notification on his phone indicating that it is necessary to change his filter. He will then replace the old filter with a new filter,"

Testimony in science
In the scientific community there is collaboration in almost every aspect of science. Our amount of accepted knowledge is too vast and complex for one scientist to understand all of it. As a scientist one needs to be able to base one’s research on the testimony of other scientists. That is also why researchers refer to other articles which forms the basis of their knowledge, and quite possibly helps them think of new hypothesis to test.
Referring to other researcher’s articles helps to carry the burden of proof but it also works as an internal control of the different research areas.
There seems to be an incompatibility between what we normally think of science and the idea of testimony; The idea behind science is thinking by one self and being a fallibilist. But when it comes down to working as a scientist there are presumptions that we accept due to where it comes from. If my professor tells me that something is true, I tend to believe him. The problem occurs when choosing which expert is a true expert.
Confirmation in science
When confirming a hypothesis one needs relevant empirical consequences that are true or actually observed. This means that if one experimentally tests a hypothesis or theory and it then survives, then it seems intuitive to think that it might be a true hypothesis or theory. The confirmation is relative to a set of background beliefs that are necessary to limit the confirmation. The background beliefs also function as auxiliary hypotheses which describes the beliefs and assumptions that are constitutive for the hypothesis’ confirmation. For example: For every F, then G confirms Ga if Fa is present. The constraint forbids that the junction of Ga and Ha (something irrelevant) can’t confirm the hypothesis “for every F, then G”. Since the hypothesis is about F’s and G’s then the evidence should be too (Fa and Ga and not Ha) Put formally: Ga confirms relevantly (1): ∀x(Fx → Gx) given Fa. As constraint: Ga∨Ha doesn’t confirm (1) given Fa. Otherwise there is room for cheap confirmation, where the hypothesis is confirmed with non-relevant evidence SCHURZ, G. 2013.

David Hume stated that we can never know something with complete certainty. Our knowledge will always be based on a finite set of observations. Hume believed there to be only two types of statements in the world: Relations of Ideas and Matters of fact.

Nanjing_China_Bio,2012,Team:Nanjing China Bio#projects_-_-_TEXT.html," Researchers can also modify bacteria with gene engineering and synthetic biology techniques to improve their lethality upon tumor cells. [3],[4]
7)When bacteria spread in human bodies, they could be controlled effectively by antibiotics.  Unlike virus, most bacteria parasitic in tumors cannot survive in cells.  Their function is to deliver relevant target anti-cancer genes.  Meanwhile, bacteria occupy certain parts both outside and inside of cells, competing for nutrition with tumor cells.
8)If we combine bacteria therapy with traditional chemotherapy, targeting on both internal and external parts of tumors, we could get more ideal curative effects. [2]
Once the bacteria penetrate into the tumor, bacteria can replicate unimpededly by the macrophage and neutrophil clearance mechanisms that normally serve to eliminate them.  At the same time, they can sensitize the immune system to induce tumor clearance.
Dating back to 19th century, researchers have found out that some tumors of cancer patients shrank after infections of bacteria.  In 1860s, a German surgeon tried to use Streptococcus to cure a female patient with neck tumor who was near death, pioneering in curing cancer with bacteria therapy.  After that, bacteria therapy started to be applied in tumor treatment.  However, people could not take control of those bacteria drugs at that time, and terrible side effects occurred sometimes.  In some cases, the tumors didn't reduce and the patient died of bacteremia.  This side effect became the biggest inhibition for the development of bacteria treatment.  Therefore, US Federal Regulators cracked down this dangerous therapy a century later and demanded more clinical trials to improve bacteria treatment, hoping to decrease this side effect.
3 Salmonella
1)The bacteria we normally use today vary from obligate anaerobes (Clostridium and Bifidobacterium for instance) to facultative anaerobes (Salmonella and Escherichia for instance).  In the late 20th century, some scientists from Yale chose an attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium as a new drug against solid tumors like melanoma.  Compared to common microorganism, this Salmonella Typhimurium has the following unique advantages.
2)The modified bacteria can infect human and mice with high invasiveness and low pathogenecity.  Concerning no ideal animal models at present and the infections caused by Salmonella in human and mice are similar, mouse models are usually used in researches to conduct the preclinical evaluation of the anti-cancer effect of Salmonella.

In vivo co-spinning simulations have previously been conducted using the transgene in silkworms, producing functionally fluorescent N-terminal – GFP- C-terminal fusions that successfully incorporate into endogenous Bombyx more silkworm silk monomers (Kojima et. al., 2007). These N-Terminal and C-terminal regions are not only easier to clone due to their non-repetitive structures, but additionally allows for storage and assembly of endogenous ampullate spidroins (Askarieh et al., 2010). Composite silkworm-spider silk chimeras have shown improved mechanical properties, and may increase the ease in high-yield production due to the easier manipulation of silkworm silk monomers (Teule, et. al. 2012). Yet, this process still relies on the use of transgenic silkworms, which have longer developmental cycles, require larger storage and nutrient conditions, and difficulty to harvest relative to bacterial counterparts (Murphy et al., 2009).
An ex situ co-spinning process has been developed for the production of composite N. clavipes – B. more silk fibers with functional protein fusions in bacterial chassis (namely, laboratory strains of Escherichia coli ). This process results in the construction of a transgene that can be modularized using restriction enzymes to incorporate a wide range of functional peptide binding sites or other proteins, including avidin-biotin binding domains, RGD-cadherin motifs, albumin binding domains, or antibody affinity domains (Jansson et al., 2014). Specifically, this composite structure focuses on the ability to express functional sfGFP in silk fibers as a marker for successful co-spinning, and verifies proper NC-sfGFP expression using SDS-PAGE analysis.
A Standard Registry part encoding sfGFP (BBa_K515005) flanked by conserved N. clavipes N- and C- silk heavy chain terminal domains (NC-sfGFP) has been produced. This part is ligated in the standard registry pSB1C3 vector backbone, and transformed into electrocompetent E. coli cell cultures. Expression of the fusion protein is induced using IPTG, and extracts are purified using Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) using a Ni-NTA Sepharose resin bed designed to pull down polyhistidine tagged protein constructs.

Toronto,2017,Team:Toronto#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"2 promoter, therefore placed under the regulation of LacILOV
The AcrIIA4 expressed from the BBa_R0051 promoter, therefore placed under the regulation of cI:LVA.
Figure 8. The layout of our CRISPR/anti-CRISPR switch is depicted above
The basic states of our switch are as follows:
In the dark: LacILOV is bound to the Ptrc-2 promoter, therefore all genes under control of Ptrc-2 are not expressed. This means that neither the sgRNA nor mCherry should be expressed, and therefore no fluorescence should be measured at 610nm. Since cI:LVA is downstream of Ptrc-2, no cI:LVA is produced and therefore both YFP, and AcrIIA4 are transcribed. AcrIIA4 binds to any dCas9-sgRNA complexes in order to block the PAM site, rendering the CRISPRi system inactive. Produced YFP fluorescence is measured at 528nm.
In the light: LacILOV unbinds from the Ptrc-2 promoter and cI:LVA, the sgRNA, and mCherry are transcribed, therefore fluorescence is measured at 610nm. cI:LVA binds to the BBa_R0051 promoter and prevents transcription and expression of AcrIIA4 and YFP. Consequently, the CRISPRi system is active.
The genetic circuit should be co-transformed with a pdCas9 plasmid, for CRISPRi, as cleavage assays are not possible in E.coli due to lack of HDR repair mechanisms. The pdCas9 plasmid that used was aTc inducible (addgene - plasmid#44249). Additionally, due to the fact that our pdCas9 had a chloramphenicol resistance marker, we employed a pKDL071 (kanamycin resistant) backbone for the assays where pdCas9 was to be co-transformed with our assays.
For the purpose of testing our AcrIIA4, we decided to design our sgRNA such that it would target the Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 AraC gene in the arabinose metabolism pathway. We collaborated with iGEM British Columbia, who used their sgRNA modeling program to generate sgRNAs with higher partition functions than the previous sgRNAs that we had generated. Ultimately, we selected TGGGCGTTAAACGAGTATCC targeting the non-tamplate strand (with the PAM 33nt from"

What can we learn in the future?
The remaining questions:
How can we search for new ways to couple reduced flavodoxin production to growth? Is it possible to do this?
Will require a reexamination of the reactions flavodoxin is involved in, their roles in metabolism, and the essentiality of parallel pathways.
How can we extend our analyses of supplemental metabolites, in order to optimize cell energy and growth?
A possible approach to this problem involves extending our analysis from simple metabolites to more complex cell media.  Given a database of available media, or a way to create our own media, we could provide a comprehensive formula for lab use that is optimized to provide the most energy to the cell.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," energy source (Crabtree, 2006) . Solar panels would therefore be a perfect solution to solve the energy problem. However, the efficiency of solar panels is still very low nowadays and has to be increased to make them profitable. One promising finding is the use of microlens arrays (MLAs). It is already proven that the use of a MLA as an encapsulation layer for the solar panels results in 20% to 50% increase of the efficiency (Jutteau, Paire, Proise, Lombez, & Guillemoles, 2015; Nam, Kim, Lee, Yang, & Lee, 2013) . However, the production of these MLAs is still relatively expensive and especially very environmental unfriendly (Nam et al., 2013) . Therefore, it is economically not favorable to use MLAs at the moment and perhaps even more important for us, it does not fit the idea about environmentally friendly solar panels. After all, the production is very environmentally unfriendly.
Our biologically produced microlenses can form a solution for this problem. The biologically produced microlens is an extremely small lens that can be used to make environmentally friendly and eventually cheaper microlens arrays. The biological MLA as encapsulation layer will therefore result in more efficient and more environmental friendly solar panels.
Cameras
Schematic representation of light field imaging (Lytro, 2015)
Both camera manufacturers Nikon and Olympus told us that light capturing becomes a more and more limiting factor in the camera industry. Especially for high-speed-imaging and low-light-imaging the hardware is very developed, but they cannot improve techniques further because of the inability to capture enough light. Microlens arrays could provide a solution to this problem.
Also research is done into the use of microlenses to produce lightweight cameras that can be used in for example smartphones. For smartphones it is important that the cameras are both lightweight and have a high resolution. Microlenses could be used to create both lightweight and high-resolution cameras, according to (Nikon)
Microlens can also be used to achieve light field photography. The LightField is defined as all the lightrays at every point in space travelling in every direction. It is essentially 4D data, because every point in three-dimensional space is also attributed a direction. Where normal cameras only can record a two-dimensional representation of a scene, LightField cameras have a microlens array just in front of the imaging sensor. In this way the lenses will be split up what would have become a 2D-pixel into individual light"

BioBrick-A-Bot Version 1.0 is made up of 2 LegoRoboBricks, called ALPHA and PHI. Here we provide the open-source RobotC codes for ALPHA and PHI. Other iGEM teams can build their own 'bot's, based on our construction specifications and then download our software. Please note that, you will need to replace the Lego NXT firmware with RobotC firmware to run the software.
BioBrick-A-Bot Version 2.0 will be made up of 3 LegoRoboBricks, called ALPHA, PHI and MU. We will also implement Single-Master-Multiple-Slave Synchronization, so that it will support user-defined LegoRoboBricks too. Other iGEM teams are encouraged to build and share various user-defined LegoRoboBricks to extend the functionality of BioBrick-A-Bot. We will collaborate with other iGEM teams, and make other user-defined LegoRoboBricks available for download on this website.

We tried our best but we did not succeed in creating a silk construct.
Working with PHB
In the lab we wanted to start out by 1) creating a library of promoter hybrids to determine an optimal construct for the production of PHB, 2) determine the ideal purifaction method, 3) increase the production of PHB by using panK and characterize the effect of panK on the proteome, 4) have the cells secrete PHB to ease purification efforts, and 5) 3D print the recovered PHB.
PHB Production and Extraction ( Top )
Retrieving a pure sample of PHB from the cellular cytoplasm has proven to be an expensive task. We have tested four methods of extraction in order to determine, which extraction method is optimal for large scale production of PHB, considering pricing, environmental strain, required equipment, toxicity, yield and purity.
Digestion with Hypochlorite ( Top )
A method for extracting biodegradable plastic, is simply digesting the cellular components with hypochlorite , where it dissolves the cellular components and leaves the polyester behind. The advantages of using hypochlorite as opposed to digestion with surfactants (e.g. sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)), is that it dissolves the membrane. Thus a single treatment can provide high purity and yield of PHB. After treatment with PHB the samples were centrifuged with 4000xG. A small side effect of hypochlorite is that it causes degradation of the PHB granules that greatly reduce the molecular weight of the molecule and thereby losing some PHB Jacquel, N., et al. (2008).

Another method of  PHB extraction is treating lyophilized biomass with a solvent in which PHB is soluble. Removing the remaining biomass by filtration and then precipitating the PHB will provide a sample with high purity. We have tested two different"

Module PHI
PHI
PHI is basically the pipette. PHI controls 3 pipette actions, Aspirate, Dispense and Clean. It consists of three motors whose functions are as follow
Motor 1 (3-way Toggle switch)
This motor controls the flow of the air. If you look at it from the side when the switch is visible:
When the switch is to the left, there is a direct flow from the pipet head to the air. This makes it possible to use the second motor (motor B) to attempt to aspirate without aspirating any liquid, and enabling it to blow extra air out.
When the switch is in the middle, there is no connection.
When the switch is to the right, the pressure built up in the air tank is released into the pipette head.
Motor 2 (Aspirate or Dispense Liquid)
This motor is connected to a piston, so it can aspirate and dispense liquid.
Motor 3 (Clean Pipette)
This motor is connected to compressors compressing air in the air tank. It runs for seven seconds once the air is released.
PHI module in action
This video shows Phi running by itself.
Current Functionality and Limitations
BioBrick-A-Bot V1.0 is only a proof-of-principle prototype.  In its current implementation, it is not user-friendly enough to be used by a standard molecular biologist directly. In our current program, both ALPHA and PHI provides a set of primitive functions that can be called by a driver program. ALPHA has a command that allows the pipette head to move to any location and tell PHI to do an action. PHI has primitive functions for ASPIRATING, DISPENSING and CLEANING. In Version 1.0, we still need a programmer to write a driver program and hence it is not usable by a molecular biologist.
In the planned version 2.0, we will build a nice GUI where a molecular biologist can specify what they want to do, without the need of having a programmer to write the driver program. The cost of a typical commercial liquid handling system is about $10,000. The hardware cost of this project is only about $700. We have developed the primitive functions to show that the robot works. The rest of the work is software based, and will not increase the cost of the robot, if we provide it to the user community in the form of open-sourced"
Paris,2009,Team:Paris#Production modeling2_-_-_TEXT.html," and the γ0 parameter:
Using r= 300 nm and r’=100 nm (the vesicle size ranges from 25 nm to 175 nm), we estimate the outer membrane intrinsic curvature as
Obtaining an estimation of this parameter is essential to model and simulate the membrane dynamic deformation under osmotic pressure differences as we will see.
Modeling membrane deformation
To obtain a reasonably simple model, we assumed that E. coli cells can be represented as cylinders, as a first approximation. This way, we could develop a 2D model of a transversal section of cells, using cylindrical coordinates.
Because of osmotic pressure differences, we assumed that the intracellular membrane is pushed against the -perfectly circular- peptidoglycan layer. So, only outer membrane deformations have to be modeled. The difference of osmotic pressure between the intra-cellular environment and the periplasm, and between the periplasm and the extra-cellular environment comes notably from the turnover of peptidoglycan molecules [ 1 ]. This hypothesis has been made by  Zhou & Doyle [ 3 ]
To model membrane deformation, we use the equation proposed by Ou-Yang and Helfrich [ 4 ]:
After simplifications, we obtain the following equality.
In this equation, γ is the variable membrane curvature, Δp is the osmotic pression difference, c0 is the membrane intrinsic curvature, and other parameters are as described in Ou-Yang and Helfrich [ 4 ].
A formal connection between the membrane curvature γ and the cylindric coordinate variables r and θ can be obtained by the following polar curvature simplification approximation:
where
Lastly, by combining the two equations given above, we obtain the following set of differential equations describing membrane deformations:
Considering that we have low concentrations we can obtain a simpler formula analogue to the perfect gases law:
Finaly we have:
Here we observe that the model is depending of the volume V which will stabilized the equation and totally define  all the parameters of the system.
In addition, we decided to model the role of the Tol/Pal system as boundary condition for the system of differential equations : cluster of Tol-Pal are considered as a point with a radius equal to peptidoglycan's one plus the length of the protein. Furthermore, as the surface is closed, we must impose the fact that r(0)=r(2π) to account for closing the vesicle.

Tol and Pal are membrane proteins which are located respectively in the outer and"

Lab Space
Officially, our team operates under the Energy, Environmental, and Chemical Engineering (EECE) Department at Washington University in St. Louis. The majority of our wet lab work is done in the Tang and Zhang Labs, both of which are Biosafety Level 1 (BSL 1). Both labs are equipped with open bench space and biosafety cabinets, and they share 4°C, 30°C, and 37°C rooms for cell cultures and plates. Within the Zhang and Tang labs there are also safety showers, eyewash stations and fire extinguishers throughout. The Zhang lab designates a specific area and enforces safety measures for work involving the use of Ethidium Bromide (such as in gel electrophoresis). In addition to wearing proper lab attire and designated gloves within Ethidium Bromide areas, while working with or around the EtBr we only used designated lab equipment and instrumentation. Any waste connected to EtBr was disposed of in designated EtBr waste containers.
Safety Training
Prior to starting lab work, we took a mandatory online training course and attend a lab-specific safety training session. The online training required the completion of a lengthy slideshow and a safety quiz in order to receive certification from WashU's Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) department. Our lab-specific training was given by graduate students in the Zhang and Tang labs. During the lab-specific training, we learned the specific location of safety equipment and other materials as well as the various safety protocols instituted by both labs, including safety equipment training and hazardous waste disposal protocols.
Personal Protective Equipment
Our PPE falls in line with the requirements of BSL 1 laboratories. This means our attire entering the lab includes long pants, appropriate closed-toe shoes, and shirts with sleeves. Once we enter the lab, we also put on fitting nitrile gloves, lab coats, and goggles/glasses when necessary.

SynthetINK's advantage in the global marketplace is its sustainability. Our method of pigment production will have little to no byproducts which will allow us to appeal to the environmentally friendly consumer base. The only byproducts of our pigment production will be carbon dioxide from the bacteria growing, and the cellular debris from the filtration of the pigments. Specifically, our product will have the advantage over carbon black and other inorganic pigments in that we do not require the burning of petroleum or other harmful processes for the production of the colorant.
Shift towards renewable energy
In recent times the world has been shifting away from practices that are harmful to the environment and investing in more renewable sources of energy (this is shown in Figure 1). This change towards renewable energy will result in a reduction in the amount of petroleum being burned for energy. The decrease in the use of petroleum will result in a reduction of the carbon black available for use in its associated industries. This is where SynthetINK will fit into the global landscape. Our environmentally friendly practices will allow us to fulfill the need for pigments within the evolved green energy society.

Solving the equations
There are fundamentally two ways to solve a series of ODEs: analytically and numerically, usually using software. We first attempted to solve analytically. This involves integrating the equations so that you get a variable as a function of time. We actually have 4 variables: FURt, Fe2+. time and amilCP. The first 3 are all independent and amilCP is dependent. Trying to solve this with 4 variables is near impossible, so we let FURt and Fe2+ be constant and let time and amilCP be our two variables. In this way, after integrating fully, we would get amilCP concentration as a function of time. An attempt was made to do this. However, it proved to be unsolvable. The final equation was a second order differential of amilCP as a function of time and amilCP mRNA and even Wolfram Alpha was unable to solve it. This being the case, we then opted to try using software, namely MatLab. Note that the k_tx and k_tl values are 0 up until a specified time. This is because in Eyal Karzbrun et al [7], they observed a delay in mRNA and protein synthesis: 
“Under TX/ degredation, mRNA appeared after a delay of τ0 = 15 ± 5 … We attribute the delay to the time required for TX of a single mRNA” ["

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some widespread fish disease in China.
After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

Communication activities
Introduction video to GFP protein and awards
This August, Institute of Physics Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing Association for Science and Technology etc organization held a “3 minutes for science” activity, aiming to collect videos which introduce scientific phenomenon to the public. Our team members made a video to introduce GFP protein and relative knowledge, won the special award and had our video broadcast in the Scientific Carnival in Beijing Olympic Parks.
Our own We Chat official account
Since WeChat has been widely used in China, we decided to create our own official account to get more people know us and iGEM competition. In the past two months, we have shared introduction of iGEM competition and some details of our team's project. To sum up, we received 7731 clicks and more than 3783 persons read our passages.
