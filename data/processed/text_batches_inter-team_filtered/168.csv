Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#test bild_-_-_TEXT.html,", the current need is a simple detection method which could be applied to grass samples to be able to check if a pasture is secure for horses to graze on. Therefore we have analysed the possibility of developing the second worm buster by studying fluorescence in grass samples. Our results were promising since the fluorescence was clearly visible in the grass!
The Global Worming Problem and Society
As you can see these little worms can cause a lot of harm. While we hope that our practical work will help solve the physical problem, all of the problems that come with these worms cannot be solved in a laboratory.
The strongyles harm the horses but the collateral damage is extensive - sentimental value, resistance against anthelmintics, the effect the drugs has on environment and the noteworthy economics are all involved [6]. These are all aspects that make the issue bigger than it appears at first glance.
Figure 7: Some members in the team with our mascot Gromit.
Raising Awareness
We have attacked the problem at several angles to raise awareness for our project. We have performed a market analysis of the problem and sent out questionnaires to better judge the severity of the problem. We’ve even been published in a local swedish magazine, explaining the problem and raising awareness locally.
Financial perspective
The equine industry includes many areas like stud farms, breeding, slaughter, trading, training and sports stables, and riding schools [18]. In Sweden the equine industry has a turnover of 450-500 million EUR and horses graze around in fields that in total correspond to 600,000 football fields [17]. There are approximately 350 000 horses is Sweden (2016) which gives Sweden a larger horse/person ratio than many other European countries [18, 19].  A large amount of money is spent on horses within and without the borders of the EU, so this is clearly a global problem.
Even though all the available data points at a high demand for our product, more data is needed to predict how an eventual new GMO product would be perceived. That is why we have worked on the market analysis and economics modelling. The result from these decides if the eventual solutions actually will be possible to implement in real life.
Uppsala 2018 is on a mission for the future of iGEM
In iGEM Uppsala we are worried about the future of iGEM members wellbeing and have seen multiple cases of burnouts. This is something that has to be changed to make iGEM sustainable for the future. To combat this problem we have hosted an event with iGEM Stockholm and Lund which shed light on"
Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Implementation#testing_-_-_TEXT.html," an all-or-nothing response, and is thus not tunable. Christina Smolke of Caltech published a paper investigating the dynamics of the Gal induction system, in which she discovered that knockout of the Gal2 gene makes pGAL1 tunable, giving it a linear response to concentration of galactose.
Gene knockout in yeast is a surprisingly simple procedure.  Amplifying the kanamycin resistance gene using primers each containing 30-40bp of homology to a site on the yeast chromosome yields a product that, when transformed into yeast, disrupts the gene at the chosen locus while integrating the Kan gene. This renders knockout cells  resistant to the antibiotic G-418, which is then used for selection.  We have preformed the Gal2 knockout using the primers designed for the paper, and hope to use pGAL1 as a tunable promoter

YFP
The spectra of these three fluorescent proteins can be separated to quantify their individual concentrations.  We have had success imaging our strains on a confocal microscope, where different lasers are used to excite each fluorescent protein at a precise wavelength sequentially, minimizing the possibility of bleed-through.
Viability Tests
In addition to testing the promoters and parts provided to us, we wish to apply our network to tests that involve
Apoptosis test- induce apoptosis externally and then save cells with the limiter device! -this test has important medical relevance, seeing as many tumor phenotypes are characterized by a noted decline or absence of apoptotic activity
-for yeast, extrinsically-signaled apoptosis depends on oxidative stress or salt  -involves the following system:  Possible target for downregulation could be Bir1p (from BIR1 gene), a homolog of survivin from humans that is thought to stabilize XIAP Another possible target is AIF1, a homolog of the human AIF1  -released from mito.and travels to nucleus -interesting fact about S. cerevisiae is that they are facultative anaerobic yeast and can survive even with complete removal of mitochondria, making them an ideal system for studying PCD (Frolich- Yeast apoptosos)

In addition, we found that 87.5% of our surveys hope to search by functions, so we also extract functions as part of the keywords, and expand the information by keywords, basic information of parts, wikis and sites, interactions, etc. All the information mentioned above are closely connected and stored in BioMaster.
Fig.7.The keywords that users want to use to find the parts.
ID Search
BioMaster combined different IDs in different databases. It supports multiple database ID retrieval methods, enabling users to find the desired biobricks in multiple ways and view the same data from multiple perspectives.
Sequence Search
We find out that many users hope to find desired parts through sequences, so we provided BLAST method inside BioMaster. Users can locate the biobrick they want by providing sequence information and set proper threshold.
Data Download
For biobrick data, we provide data download in fasta format, and for the whole database, we provide data download in sql format, you can create an identical database directly through it.
Promoter prediction
We constructed a CNN-based promoter predictor. In the preprocess of the sequence, we use the method of 'One Hot Encoding' to convert the nucleotide sequence containing ATCG into a numerical value.
Sliding window was used to identify promoter regions in large-scale sequences.
We use our promoter prediction tool to analyze the genome of E. coli and build a database of predicted results combined with Ensembl gene annotation information.
Web Page
In order to make our webpage database come true, we choose php as the background programming language which is simple, flexible and friendly to the database. By using php, we can call to mysql and it can realize the accurate extraction, filtering and sorting of the data in the database.
Based on this, we use Thinkphp as the framework to write the front-end code, which makes the process of passing the background data to the front end accurate and reliable, and its frame structure is clear enough. The packaging method is convenient to call, and the workload is simplified.
In the front-end display, we refer to Bootstrap and adopt its beautiful and practical layout. And we also apply some css style files to ensure that our database interface is clear, concise and beautiful. In order to provide users with more convenience, we use Angularplasmid-master, cytoscape.js and other plug-ins and html and css to visualize data. By using these tools, we can make"

Summary
We had the iGEM Latin America 2018 Meet Up! We had the pleasure to receive teams                                         from all over Mexico and Latin America such as Brazil, Ecuador, and Chile where                                         they presented their projects and got feedback from specialists. This Meetup                                         was important for the teams to get an overall look into their work and                                         something to note is that the event got a lot of diffusion online.                                          We also started the plan"
SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT#HP#Magazine#iGEM Thinking_-_-_TEXT.html,"ed to lower the cost of antimalarial drugs. In 2002, Wimmer, an expert of virology in NYU, announced that he and his research group had bought some short DNA fragments from a biotech corporation, and chemically synthesized some polioviruses, which have the same infection vitality as natural viruses. In 2010, Yoshihiro Kawaowa's group from University of Wisconsin-Madison cooperated with Ron Fouchier's group from medical center of Erasmus University. They transformed H5N1 avian influenza virus, so that it had a new pathogenicity that can spread among mammals(e.g. Ferrets) . In addition, in 1953, geneticist James Watson, together with physicist Francis Crick , unveiled the double-helix structure of DNA, creating the possibility for human to reconstruct life. In 1980, the first genetically modified mouse was born. In 1996,the first cloned sheep Dolly was born. And in 2010, American scientist Craig Venter's research group created the first artificial cell in history. From then on, synthetic biology have declared a war to the nature.
In the face of such a series of achievements in the field of synthetic biology, there are two of the most acute questions. The first one is the biological safety, while the second one is bioethics. As synthetic biology improved, we’ll worry about that whether it will be used in manufacturing the biological weapons by terrorists, as well as whether it will lead to serious catastrophic events as a result of some operation errors taken by the scientists. Furthermore, whether the artificial ""life"" is same as the nature ""life"", having the same social attributes. After creating artificial life, whether the human beings will treat life, including human life, unscrupulously. In the process of creating and constructing a new life, the nature, which is no longer domesticated gently, and is no longer simply distorted or manipulated as well, instead, is thoroughly designed or rebuild to form ""the second nature"" that is different from our nature. Consequently, the synthetic biology replaces autonomous evolution with directed evolution, which not only controls the dynamic mechanism of evolution, but also distorts the fundamental aim of it.
In western academia, in order to denounce the unnatural relationship between the human and the nature, scholars use the term ""playing god"" frequently. However, do biological scientists have privileges ""playing god""? Jim Collins, a professor of biomedical engineering from Boston University, said, ""this achievement of synthetic biology ruined our basic beliefs about life attribute, which were of great importance in the way"

Integrating Our Microfluidics Knowledge
As our work on MARS progressed, many of the interactions we engaged in over the Summer had a direct impact on the project. Specific areas that were developed and modified as a result of our synthetic biologist and industry interactions are influencing the structure and content of our MARS chip archive, increasing accessibility to researchers through Microfluidics 101, and building the fluid functionality checklist. Through integrating the feedback, comments and advice received from various sources, we were able to significantly improve and refine MARS as a whole.
Biological Design Center and iGEM Outreach
In order to determine what would make microfluidics more practical and accessible for synthetic biologists we reached out to the Biological Design Center at Boston University. The BDC promotes collaboration between scientists in order to create new biological innovations. We asked the BDC researchers what types of biological protocols are performed day-to-day in the lab. Based on their feedback we were able to identify eight common protocols performed by synthetic biologists:
Cell Lysis
DNA Digestion
Ligation
Transformation
PCR
Fluorescence Testing
Antibiotic Resistance Testing
Cell Culturing
These eight common protocols informed both the layout of our MARS Repository into Isolation, Modification, and Quantification, as well as the chips within it. Of our nine MARS chips, eight were designed to each perform one of these synbio protocols.
We also reached out to the iGEM community via a poll. The purpose of this poll was to gauge how much the iGEM community knows about microfluidics, what procedures they perform every day in the lab, and what would get them interested in microfluidics. In total, we received 42 responses from teams all across the world. The results from this poll are summarized below.
These results validated our educational components of MARS. The introduction to microfluidics and video tutorials serve to educate the iGEM and greater synbio community about what microfluidics are and how to use them. Furthermore, this poll validated our choice of nine synthetic biology protocols to move onto microfluidic devices housed in the MARS archive.

Background
Our system hinged on finding a protein which could bind other proteins to the outside of the cell, but whose interaction with these proteins was weak enough to be disrupted by another small molecule. streptavidin presented itself as a logical choice.  Several protein tags (such as the Nano-Tag1) have been developed to bind streptavidin at the biotin binding site, but can be released when biotin is added to the system and binds to streptavidin.  The ability for peptides to bind streptavidin and be released upon the addition of biotin is a technology currently used on a daily basis world-wide by labs purifying proteins.  The major difference between the traditional system and our system is that streptavidin is attached to beads which are used in a column format in the traditional protein purification method.  Our system will have streptavidin attached to the surface of the cell.  Combining the display system with our target and secretion vector our vision is complete.  A single cell can then produce, secrete, bind, and release any protein of interest.
The Nano-Tag binds streptavidin with 4nM binding affinity and has been used to purify multiple proteins. The ability of biotin to compete off the Nano-Tag in biding assays indicates that the binding occurs at the same site of streptavidin. Of great importance for incorporating streptavidin into our display system is that streptavidin is a common protein used in bio-chemical assays. Its ability to bind biotin is one of the strongest non-covalent interactions known. This allows for the utilization of biotin and streptavidin to act as molecular connectors in protein systems. Furthermore the availability of biotinylated and streptavidin linked fluorophores allows for an easy assay of their presence, using fluorescence microscopy2.
Next we needed a way to anchor the streptavidin to the outer membrane. The obvious choice was to use the LPP signal peptide and Outer Membrane Protein A (OmpA) because this system has been extensively characterized as an expression system to display proteins on the cell surface"

Hong_Kong_HKU,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," manufacturing processes. This shows that impacts on human health should be our top priority when modifying our MFC.
Production constraints are the second most important category after we have shown the video. However, the only factor that can be related to our MFC is the low production yield which we think is beyond the scope in which we can improve during the time span of this iGEM season. As a result, the next focus on our MFC moderation will be on the possible pollutants that the MFC might produce during its electricity generation. We have identified that CO2 is the only greenhouse gas pollutant that will be released from our system. The modification of this will be discussed in the integrated human practices section of this project.
Amongst all the other choices, the social cost including the ethical issues on crop usage and land use seems to be relatively less important as Hong Kong have alternatives to these issues such as using kitchen waste as energy source instead of growing new crops for bioenergy or using offshore wind farm as an alternative to wind farms on land. As a result, the scale of our MFC system can have more flexibility than what we have originally thought to be limited due to the limiting living space available in Hong Kong.
Summarizing all the valuable feedbacks from our potential users and the different aspects of our project, we have arrived to the following conclusion:
Survey results indicated that concerns on human health and the production constraints are one of the highest concern in choosing a renewable energy type.
To address one of the public's concern on the environmental pollutant, MFC system modification to reduce CO2 emission was considered by integrating insights from Prof. Bookhart.
Further education on renewable energy may be required for the general public in Hong Kong before the implementation of a new renewable energy.

Our project this year is to design, create, and test a working cadmium water tester. We are going to do this by altering the existing biochemical pathway that Yeast has to recognize the cadmium, and then create our own code that will make it fluoresce red. When we originally had the idea for a water tester, we looked for metals, pesticides, and other harmful substances that are a problem in water supplies. Through much research, we found that cadmium is often a byproduct of many industrial processes, and is often leaked or exposed to the environment. Also, yeast recognizes the presence of cadmium already, so we figured it would be much more simple to alter an existing pathway than to create an entirely new one. We hope through research and experimentation that we are able to make cadmium much more detectable in the environment.

Fig. 4: ComE dependent promoters containing bases matching (blue) and differing (red) from the CEbs consensus sequence. (figure modified from Martin et al. 2013)
To test the functionality of our model, first, the two component system was cloned into the integrative vector pBS2E from the Bacillus BioBrick Box under the control of Pxyl, an inducible promoter that responds to extracellular xylose (see fig. A). The corresponding QS-dependent promotor was cloned in the vector pBS3C-lux , thus fused to luxABCDE.  If QS-molecules are detected from the two component system, PQS will trigger the expression of luxABCDE, resulting in luminescence which was measured by a multi-mode plate reader (18 hrs, 37 °C, shaking).
In the distant future, the quorum sensing two component system, under the regulation of an inducible promoter, will be combined with an quorum sensing promoter expressing specific killing factors (see fig. B).

S. aureus Sensing
We constructed the biobrick <bbpart>BBa_K316036</bbpart> encoding for a composite part containing  the AIP-II sensing two component system AgrC-IIA [1] And the AIP-II sensing dependant promoters P2  and P3 <bbpart>BBa_K316037</bbpart>, <bbpart>BBa_K316038</bbpart> P2 [2] and P3 [3]
As a first step we recorded the promoter backgrounds of the P2 and P3 promoters with a luminescence reporterassay , using the strategy outlined in design. (Fig.3) As expected according to the strength of the -35 and -10 signals, P2 is the stronger promoter showing a higher background, compared to P3.
In a next step we induced the expression of PxylA-agrCII-A by adding 0%, 0.02%, 0.2% Xylose at an OD600 of about 0.1.  The result is depicted in Figure 5. This result is in accordance with our expactations since strong overexpression of the two-component system should lead to unspecific induction of the P2 and P3 promoters, and thereby can be used as a method to measure relative expression of agrC-IIA.

Inoculation of Tamura Colony
Plates were streaked two weeks ago with transformed E-coli cells containing an alternating sequence of wild type silk and GFP, specifically: N-terminus-GFP-C-terminus. An isolated colony was picked and inoculated in Lysogeny Broth (commonly referred to as Luria broth, an excellent growth medium for bacteria) overnight for 16 hours.
Procedure
Colony picked with micropipet and inserted into a culture tube containing 10 mL of LB and 10 ul of Ampicillin."
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#ImprovePart_-_-_TEXT.html," device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP"

Groningen,2018,Team:Groningen#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," participate in the biohackathon and set to brainstorming. As we were throwing around some ideas for the hackathon in our office, some of our lab experts came to us. They told us they were making buffers for the lab, and that they were wondering if it would be possible to automate this task. This initial thought spawned the idea of buffy the bufferbot, our automatic buffer adjusting robot.
Soon we flew to Vilnius, Lithuania and were greeted by the the Vilnius iGEM team’s charming Lina and Ieva, who graciously hosted us during the weekend. The biohackathon took part from friday till sunday, and was concluded by pitches from every team. It was decided that we would create the brains of “buffy” at the hackathon and work on the hardware aspects of the project after we returned to Groningen. We presented a demo of our project, which uses carefully designed machine intelligence to keep track of the pH of the buffer and to make predictions of how best to adjust this pH to reach the desired goal. After careful deliberations, the judges awarded our team the prize for the best pitch!
Concluding the hackathon, there was a fruitful meeting between the present iGEM teams, Groningen, Lund, Helsinki and the Vilnius team themselves. We discussed our projects and offered each other useful feedback. We look forward to seeing all the teams again during the Giant Jamboree and we are especially grateful for the Vilnius team’s amazing hospitality.

Dutch iGEM meetup Leiden
In August we were invited to the Dutch iGEM meetup in Leiden. It was a nice opportunity to meet our fellow Dutch iGEM teams and discuss with them our hopes and dreams. We eagerly sent a delegation to go to Leiden. After a lengthy train ride from Groningen to Leiden, and a short struggle to find the right patch of grass, we arrived to find the warm hospitality of the Dutch iGEM teams. In addition to the Leiden team, the teams from Utrecht, Delft, Eindhoven and Rotterdam were also present. After a nice barbecue, kindly provided by the Leiden team, there was a pubquiz about our iGEM projects; A fun way to learn about each other's projects! It was wonderful to discuss our project with the other teams, and it felt unifying to discover they were running into similar struggles as we were.

Then we planned to add alr gene into the plasmid backbone, to form a complementary plasmid and to prevent                     plasmid loss. In the condition, antibiotic resistance marker can be deleted for biosafety, and the selection                     can be completed by auxotrophic selection[7].
Figure 12 the knockout of genes responsible for D-type amino acids synthesis of E. coli cell wall and formation of a complementary                     plasmid, according to National University of Singapore[7].
However, after 2 months of knockout experiment, we failed to knockout the genes. Fortunately, we obtained the strain from                     National Univeristy of Singapore after looking for their help and confirmed the character of this strain                     of E. coli Nissle 1917 (Δalr, ΔdadX) in our laboratory (Figure 12).
Figure 13 The growth ability test with (a) and without (b) D-alanine. Only when the medium is added with D-alanine, the E. coli Nissle 1917 (Δalr, ΔdadX) can grow.
We’ve successfully ligated alr with the pSB1C3 backbone.
Figure 14 alr gene with original promoter and RBS from genome is ligated into pSB1C3 backbone by Gibson Assembly. The map                     the plasmid is in the figure.
After several times of attempt, we found it hard to transform the engineered plasmid into this kind of strain in the same                     way we applied in E. coli Nissle 1917.
We are going to continue our experiment in the future.
Improvement of Gifu 2016 Project
At the same time, we improved the project of 2016 Gifu iGEM team. We used the same pathway in our project. The difference                     is that they used this pathway to clean the bird dropping. Here’s their abstract.
“In Japan, environmental pollution caused by excrement of birds is a problem that should be solved. For example, dieback                     of trees and spoiling the cityscape are major problems. Birds’ dropping consists mainly of uric acid                     and that is really insoluble. Uric acid can be degraded to soluble material, urea. So, our goal is to                     catalyze uric acid to urea and make it possible to wash away dropping by rainwater. We’d like to lead                     our project to the solution of the pollution. Considering purine metabolism pathway, three enzymes, urate                     oxidase, allantoinase"
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Off targeting_-_-_TEXT.html,"trm{'} = \frac{1}{1+\frac{\alpha \Sigma_{on}\mathcal{R}}{\Sigma_{off}\mathcal{R}}} \tag{9}$$
From our experiments, we estimate α$=452$. In the case of no amplification, we can set α$=1$. The amplification step improves the reliability of the system from 10% up to 40-95%, even in the case of higher mismatch tolerance ($\Delta C=0.30$,$\Delta I=0.85$)
Figure 8: Reliability of a positive output for crRNA 1 to 4 on the genomes of four organisms. Reliability of positive output as represented by the ratio between the probability of a true positive output (blue) as compared to a false positive output (orange). Simulation with $\Delta C=0.30$,$\Delta I=0.85$. We take into account a 452-fold amplification of the on-target signal as a result of the gene amplification and in vitro transcription. For each crRNA, the different bars represent the E. coli genome, S. aureus genome, S. epidermis genome and Bos taurus chr. 27 from left to right respectively. The reliability of the system is improved from less than 10% to 40 to 95%.
As such, gene amplification and sensitivity not only increase the sensitivity of the detection method, these two steps in sample preparation also reduce the probability of false positive results and thereby increase the reliability of the detection system. We can now simulate $P_{FP}^\textrm{'}$ for different ratios between on- and off-target cleavage probabilities, and determine the amplification factor required to achieve reliable detection above a desired threshold $\beta$ (Figure 9). Analytically, this amplification factor can be calculated as follows by setting $P_{FP threshold}'=\frac{1}{\beta}$:
$$ \alpha_{required} = \frac{\beta}{1-\beta} \frac{\Sigma_{off}\mathcal{R}}{\Sigma_{on}\mathcal{R}} \tag{10}$$
We can see the reliability of the system increase as a function of α for different rations ($ \frac{\Sigma_{on}\mathcal{R}}{\Sigma_{off}\mathcal{R}} $) and can read-off the amplification factor required to achieve an input that is 95% reliable (i.e. the probability of a true positive given a positive output).

Controlled environment means here a bioreactor, at least a process occurring in a environment where parameters are set and controlled, downstream processes are connected, and releases containing organisms are destroyed.
If we were certain of the necessity of developing such a process we were not sure about which already existing biotechnological process (mainly phytoremediation processes) our process could be connected to.
Mr Sigoillot
Pr.Sigoillot , an process engineering expert, helped us to shape our project in a economical way: we decided our process should absolutely end on nanoparticle production in order to produce a highly valuable form. Bibliography had showed us that nanoparticles are indeed more and more used in industry and interest for nanoparticles are steadily growing.
Moreover Mr. Sigoillot and Mr.Triboit brought us  both a crucial aspect of platinum pollution: sewage sludge are so polluted than people would pay to get rid of it! Thus a process starting from sewage sludge as a basic raw material would have positive financial and environmental balance!
All these interactions with various people had helped us a lot, and shaped our process during all the year of iGEM 2016!

One of the main aims within our project was to develop a detection method to detect the presence of specific RNA sequences without the use of any complicated laboratory equipment. Furthermore, this method should be cheap and widely available to everyone. We indeed succeeded in developing such a method and this page is dedicated to describe how this novel measurement method was implemented in our project. It is based on structures called 'coacervates'.
Coacervates are polymer-rich regions in solutions of mutually attractive polymers. The process of mutually attractive polymers phase-separating into a polymer-rich and polymer-poor phase is known as coacervation. This process can under some circumstances be observed by the naked eye, as coacervates generally cause solutions to be more turbid."

Indeed, the photocycle of ChR2 (Figure 2 and Figure 3(Yizhar et al.,2011b))has different spectral characteristics .In ChR2, adark-adapted state absorbing at 470 nm (D470) converts rapidlyupon illumination to the conducting state P520, via the shortlived photointermediates P500 and P390. Illumination of theopen channel at this step with green light terminates the photocurrent (Bamann et al., 2008; Berndt et al., 2009) by photochemically shifting the channel back into a closed state, which may bethe dark-adapted state D470 or the light-adapted state P480(Stehfest and Hegemann, 2010), effectively resetting the photocycle. This photocycle-shortcut pathway may be relevant only atvery high light intensities with wild-type ChR2.
Figure 2-2: The working principle of ChR2.
Figure 2-3: Simplified model for the photocycle of ChRs. The D470 dark state is converted by a light-induced isomerization of retinal via the early intermediate P500 andthe transient P390 intermediate to the conducting-state P520. The recovery of the D470 dark state proceeds either thermally via the nonconducting P480intermediate or photochemically via possible short-lived intermediates (green arrow). The late or desensitized P480 state can also be activated (blue arrow) toyield the early intermediate P500. Additional parallel cycles may be present (Yizhar et al., 2011b)
2.3.2 chETA
Inanother approach addressing both desensitization and deactivation, considering the crystalstructure of BR led to modification of the counterion residue E123 of ChR2 to threonine oralanine; the resulting faster opsin is referred toas ChETA (Gunaydin et al. 2010).
This substitution introduced two advantagesover wild-type ChR2. First, it reduced desensitization during light exposure, with the resultthat light pulses late in high-frequency trainsbecame as likely as early light pulses to drivespikes (a very important property referred to astemporal stationarity).
Second, it destabilizedthe active conformation of retinal, speedingspontaneous isomerization to the inactive stateafter light-off and thus closing"

This was in the last week of our main wet-lab phase, so by then we had wrapped up most of our work and were looking for ways to develop our presentational skills, as well as our Human practices and the potential design of our main project if taken past the proof-of-concept stage. In particular we discussed the viability of a paper-based system with iGEM Warwick

She was born in Canada, raised in Florida, and spent high school in Oregon, but there is no better place than Ithaca, NY where the winters are everlasting and you get frostbite walking to class.  Working with the CUGEM team has allowed Angela to overcome her intimidation of bioengineers and appreciate the scientific process, filled with all its stops and turns.

James Mathew is a sophomore Biological Engineering student at Cornell University interested in biomolecular and protein engineering. Besides enjoying long walks on the beach, James also prefers spending his extra time working on a device to detect infectious diseases using DNA-nanobarcodes in Dr. Dan Luo’s research laboratory, and organizing campus events for the Cornell Entrepreneur Organization.  After moving to New York, James developed low iron levels from a sore lacking of good beef from his home state of Nebraska. He joined CUGEM for the cool stickers and stayed for the creative freedom to invent and explore the possibilities of synthetic biology.
Hyundo Reiner
Hyundo was born in a small town in the Republic of Sudan. At the age of two, he was found alone in his cradle by a wandering salesman after a group of local bandits had looted his home and frightened away the inhabitants. The salesman took him along his travels across Africa to the Ivory Coast, where recent newlyweds and avid travelers Robert and Dorothy took custody of him and smuggled him back into the States. Although Hyundo regards himself as an American, he will usually speak in Sudanese while his interpreter translates.

In both cases, the strong band is near the 30kDa marker, so it can be inferred that the protein in the gel is indeed the expected one. The gel shows that the best method is standard extraction, because it gives a cleaner product.

In the SDS-PAGE, it was possible to observe a band at ~30kDa. This band possibly is the GFP or the GFP quencher. This shows there is a protein that has the expected size of one of these. Nevertheless, the expected size of the K1903015 BioBrick protein, the GFP-Quencher is 55kDa. The absence of a band of this size suggests that the linker between the subunits does not keep  together the two proteins, maybe because of the action of bacterial proteases or also because of the reducing agent in the SDS-PAGE. The best method for the extraction of GFP is with urea, because of its hydrophobicity.

3rd Parisian Meetup
This year, our team participated in the 3rd Parisian Meetup, organized by the Pasteur Paris team . This meetup gathered most of the french iGEM teams and allowed us to share our project and our experiences with the other teams.
This meetup also gave us the opportunity to meet an expert in synthetic biology and in engineering,  but more importantly allowed us to meet other iGEM competitors and to share our thought and iGEM experiences. It is also here that we started our fruitful collaboration with the Evry Paris-Saclay team .
We sincerely thank the Pasteur Paris team for their invitation to the 3rd Parisian Meetup and we hope that we will all meet again at the Giant Jamboree!
Mediterranean Meetup
For the first time, we decided to create a meetup to gather iGEM teams from the Mediterranean shores.  This idea came from realizing that some iGEMers didn't have the chance to take part in a meetup before the Giant Jamboree.  This is unfortunate because meetups let us share experiences, practice presenting our project and allow us to meet each other.
We quickly decided to create an international Mediterranean Meetup.  As this was the first edition, we didn't invite many teams.  Finaly, the Bordeaux , Technion Israel and Valencia UPV teams joined us in Marseille to share experience about their projects.
We organized presentations of the different projects and poster sessions, but we also visited part of Marseille.  This allowed us to better know each other.  At the end, this mediterranean meetup was amazing not only in a scientific way but also in a social way.
We thank Bordeaux , Technion Israel and Valencia UPV teams for coming in Marseille and we hope to meet them soon at the Giant Jamboree.

Design
Based on the actual size of the dormitory, we built a simulated room with the KT board  and designed a walkway.  Our experiments are divided into three groups: control group, the chemical group and the biological group.
Control group
The control group did not add any pharmaceutical agents.
Chemical group
The chemical group was divided into two groups, namely the chalk group and the Premise cockroach gel bait
Biological group
The biological group was placed with the second generation of GreenGround.
Experiment
We will place 30 cockroaches per room. The experimental period of each group is 3 days, and each treatment consists of 3 parallel groups. The main data recordered are mortality, migration rate (to the aisle and room B).
The cockroaches in the room B and the aisle are considered to have been migrated. The purpose of setting up a control group is to know mortality and migration rate of cockroaches without the influence of any pharmaceutical agents, and these data can provide references for our analysis of chemical and biological groups.
our experiments
Statistical Analysis Results
As is shown on the chart, we can analyze that cockroach killing chalk and BAYER-Premise have a big impact on migration rate, they both cause it higher than the control group, while the M.anisopliae emulsifiable powder's is lower than those three groups, that shows the M.anisopliae emulsifiable powder is more attractive to cockroaches and has less impact on neighbors. From the perspective of mortality, chemical group has higher mortality. Although M.anisopliae emulsifiable powder group has lower mortality within three days, it can show a difference more time."

Monday: Today is suppose to be a holiday, I'm not really sure why, but the team is still working. The building seems abandoned and we are the only ones in here muajuajuajuajua (evil laughter).
About our work in progress: we have our second arduino project. It is a photoresistor able to measure the intensity of light inputs. The arduino program is linked to old Juano's c# aplication so we can see a graph of the data in real time. We have only tried it with LEDs so far and the system proved to be sensible enough. The next step is to measure bacterial biolumniscence. We hope to do so tomorrow.

Assay Preparation
Take 3 independent colonies from each plate of your controls and samples and place each colony into 5 ml of LB with the appropriate antibiotics.
Leave to grow overnight at 30°C.
Take 50 μl of each overnight and inoculate 5 ml of fresh LB containing the appropriate antibiotics. Do this twice for every independent colony.
Allow these to grow at 30°C shaker until the O.D of each inoculate is between 0.3-0.5
Once the O.D is between 0.3-0.5 take 3 x 1 ml samples of each culture and place into separate Eppendorf tubes.
Take a further 1 ml and place into a cuvette and  subsequently measure the OD600 marking down the OD for each replica.
Spin down the 1 ml cultures of each replica at 13,000 rpm for 3 minutes.

Waterloo,2017,Team:Waterloo#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," good communication in science, and the ethics regarding synthetic biology. It was emphasized that good science extends beyond producing results in the lab – it stems from thorough analyses of the feasibility, ethics, and impact on society on both small and large scales. When it comes to opening up the new science to the world, students were made aware of how something with many benefits like GMOs could still be receiving such controversial responses. We then explained one way to minimize these negative results is through good communication. In our final discussion, we invited students to share what they believe contributes to ethical scientific practices. Key topics brought up by students included: safety, responsibility, and the overall benefit to the world.

Conclusion
Overall, we believe that the workshop was very successful for both the students and the iGEM members who were working with them. Students showed continuous enthusiasm in learning about synthetic biology, and had a very positive experience overall. We were able to achieve all of our goals, and received positive feedback from the students.
Based on surveys results, all students felt that they had a significantly better understanding of synthetic biology related terminology and a better grasps its current and potential uses. Following the discussion on GMOs, it was found that more students felt comfortable using GMOs and products made with GM technology since the workshop began.
We received very positive feedback on the lab portion of the workshop. Students enjoyed getting to use new lab equipment, and the opportunity to conduct molecular biology experiments. One particular piece of feedback that was received from the students is that having microscopes available in the lab for attendees to view their microbes would be really fun and educational.
Students actively engaged in the conversation and demonstrated the ability to think critically about the underlying issues that face the uses of synthetic biology. There was also a focus on the importance of the practice of unbiased and well-communicated science, that is, being transparent and truthful in one’s work while avoiding any personal bias. This workshop was a great experience for the members of iGEM, and we hope to continue to work with SHAD Valley in future years to educate future university students about the field of synthetic biology. It is also an effective way to inspire prospective students to get involved with iGEM in their future years. In the spirit of iGEM and making science accessible to all, our team has made all our presentations and protocols free-to-use for educational and non-commercial purposes. Our team would be happy to answer any questions"

A composite part is a functional unit of DNA consisting of two or more basic parts assembled together. BBa_I13507 is an example of a composite part, consisting of an RBS, a protein coding region for a red fluorescent protein, and a terminator.
New composite BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts (like Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators, Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on).

Sample preparation and protein loading
5. Incubate samples at 37 °C for 15 min or for up to 60 min for samples that were in pellet form. Avoid boiling samples, because membrane proteins can irreversibly aggregate in SDS at temperatures >50 °C.
6. Mount the gels in the vertical electrophoresis apparatus (see EQUIPMENT), and add anode buffer as the lower electrode buffer and cathode buffer as the upper electrode buffer (anodes and cathodes are commonly marked red and black, respectively, by the suppliers).
7. Load samples under the cathode buffer. Apply 10-μl sample volumes to 0.7 × 5 mm sample wells.For the optimal resolution of peptides of 1–5 kDa, reduce the amount of SDS in the incubation buffers, for example, by fourfold and reduce the volume applied to 5 μl. Reducing the amount of SDS facilitates electrophoretic separation of peptides from the bulk of SDS. To avoid streaking of peptide bands, peptides and bulk SDS must be separated before the faster-migrating bulk SDS and the peptides immediately following reach the separating gel. The sample volume applied for Tricine–SDS-PAGE should not substantially exceed 10 μl, because stacking of proteins in the range 20–100 kDa is less efficient than in Laemmli–SDS-PAGE.
Electrophoresis conditions
8. Set running conditions appropriate to your type of gel; guidance on appropriate running conditions are given in the table below. Start electrophoresis with an initial voltage of 30 V and maintain at this voltage until the sample has completely entered the stacking gel. The next appropriate voltage step can then be applied. The initial current may be as high as 80 mA for a 0.7mm 10% gel. Gels may warm up, but the temperature should not exceed 35–40 °C. Approaching the end of the run, voltage can be gradually increased to shorten the total time of electrophoresis. Fast runs give better results than overnight runs, especially with 10% acrylamide gels. Alternatively, a constant power of 10 W per gel might be set to ensure an even distribution of heat. The specific settings for electrophoretic runs depend considerably on the apparatus used"

Algorithm
Introduction
We design and develop a software tool, iGame, which supports database written in MoDeL format, to perform task of automatic modeling. Actually, automatic modeling is a database-dependent network-searching-and-developing process from the initial conditions. Besides the database, users are required to provide initial environment condition, such as initial plasmids with biobrick parts. iGame will generate the network of the biological system in SBML standard. Please refer to User_Interface to know more about input and output of iGame.
Algorithms for automatic modeling will be shown in the following sections. An overview is as follow:
Section Algorithm flow chart gives an overall description of the general framework of our algorithms;
Section Special reactions and volume strategy tells details about the methods and strategies our program utilizes to handle with some special reactions;
Section Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme provides details of sorting as well as weighting scheme and their functions;
Section Structural pattern match of template species provides details of the core algorithm of iGame: how to find matchings between template species defined in database and species existed in the bio-system;
Section Generation of products based on reaction templates describes the mix-trim-split method to generate products.
Algorithm flow chart
Before stating our own algorithm, we will first make an analysis about the difference and difficulty brought by introducing a new language system. The general algorithm idea is common: find out all species and reactions between them. Ignoring the efficiency of program, the most obvious method is doing the following recursively until no more species is generated:
find reactions between species have been found and generate products as new species
Similar idea applies to our program. Some modifications must be made because in other software tools, reaction-searching is name-based. However, in our program, it is structure-based. Matching of species name is much easier than that of Chain-Node structure, which is featured as the most important part of our program."

Minnesota,2014,Team:Minnesota#Templates_-_-_TEXT.html," control measures were taken as outlined in EPA method 1630. All MeHg standards (ongoing precision recoveries) were within the acceptable range averaging 96%.
The samples showed growth of both encapsulated and unencapsulated “E. coli” and “Pseudomonas” carrying “pBBRBB::mer” after 36 hours, and complete demethylation of the 1mg MeHg in both the encapsulated and unencapsulated samples. No cell growth was observed in strains containing the “pBBRBB::gfp”negative control, LB (abiotic) or LB (abiotic) containing 0.5g empty encapsulation beads, and methylmercury levels remained relatively unchanged. This preliminary run showed that methylmercury levels could drop to undetectable levels in the presence of our bacteria (both E.coli and Pseudomonas) but not in their absence.
Methylmercury Results (II)
2nd MeHg-  - It was expected that the rate of demethylation would increase exponentially, and thus we took samples at time points that would reflect that rate (Fig __).  Within 24 hours, methylmercury levels dropped slightly  in the abiotic LB sample, most likely only due to photolysis in the presence of light            - “E.coli” cells with the GFP control plasmid absorbed (number - abiotic)  mg into the cells before their eventual cell death.             - abiotic encapsulation beads absorbed as much methylmercury from the surroundings as the E.coli cells with the GFP control plasmid.             - E.coli cells with the mer operon remediated all of the methylmercury (1 mg in 1L) in the samples within approximately 5 hours.             ""Pseudomonas” could not survive or decrease methylmercury levels in the samples after 24 hours. We suspect that the “Pseudomonas” require a longer time for the construct to be activated, since they were able to grow and decrease methyl mercury to below detectable levels twithin 36 hours.   The ""E.coli"" cells containing the mer operon were tested in both 1mg/L and 4mg/L of methylmercury chloride. (48 samples)  MeHg was only demethylated by 1 mg before reaching a stationary level. We suspect that this concentration was too high for cell survival that initial demethylation of MeHg occurred due to the presence of enzymes within the cells after being grown overnight and before their addition to the"

pANDORRA Design Algorithm
“If you know yourself and you know your enemy, you shouldn’t fear the result of a thousand battles”-Sun Tzu
If knowledge is power, then modeling is the key to a successful engineering endeavour. Our modeling of the biophysical characteristics of the classifier circuits that follows in this section is largely based upon the exciting work of research teams led by Professors Z. Xie and Y. Benenson [ 1 , 2 ]. The latter’s newest paper [ 2 ] faces the same questions: it analyzes the modeling process and optimizes the classifier’s logical expression. Standing on their shoulders, we expand upon their work by analyzing architectural variations of the classifier circuits, which add an additional optimization axis.
Architecture of a cell-type classifier
pANDORRA is based on a family of layered genetic circuits that aim to biophysically implement logical expressions involving miRNA molecules in 2 basic roles: upregulated or downregulated (on the target cells in respect to the control). The family is characterized by a basic structure emanating from these two roles. The target gene (the system’s output) is controlled by a promoter and RNA interference (RNAi) from the downregulated miRNAs and forms the lower layer of the system. The upper layer comprises target sites for the upregulated miRNAs and an inhibitor for the lower layer.
This basic architecture can be significantly improved with a double-inversion module for the the upper layer [ 1 ]. It takes the form of a middle layer with a promoter that is activated by the upper layer’s product and in turn produces the inhibitor for the lower layer. This extra part significantly improves the system’s efficiency.
But how do we define the system’s efficiency and how do we optimize its architecture, out of the many options left open by the previous definitions? And after finding the optimal architecture, how do we choose the optimal miRNA targets to separate"

Moreover, Prof. Dr. Alfons Bora who is a professor for sociology of law and technical assessment will give a lecturer in this seminar. He was a member of the German Ethics Council from 2012 - 2014 and since 2014 he is a member of the Joint Committee of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and the German Research Foundation (DFG) for the Handling of Security-relevant Research.
Psychologist Dr. Lilian Streblow is from the faculty of Educational Sciences and a member of the ethics council of Bielefeld University.
Prof. Dr. Marie I. Kaiser studied biology and philosophy and is a professor for Philosophy of Science at Bielefeld University. She is interested in the philosophy of biology and in the metaphysics of science.
We were also able to win Prof. Dr. Ralf Hofestädt for our seminar: He is a professor for Bioinformatics and a specialist in petri nets.
The seminar should take place at Bielefeld University as a long-term course where students get insights into different views about DURC and biosecurity. Our provided detailed slides serve as our contribution from the iGEM team Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2018 to the seminar to fill the first slot. As we could see in our survey many students do not know the meaning of DURC. We think it is time to change this, so the seminar is an important step to spread awareness!

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Project#pqs_-_-_TEXT.html," microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Overview
To get a better understanding of the dynamics of the system, we made a model of the system using the Cain software [1] for stochastic simulations. While stochastic simulations are more computationally demanding than deterministic models based on solving ODE's, they allow for random fluctuations that may have a big impact on the system in a cell [2] .
As we want our system to react to two different signals, three promoters were required. One to respond to lactate, one to respond to low oxygen and a third to respond to signal molecules controlled by the two other promoters. The last promoter would then control cell lysis. For lactate sensing, we have adapted the lld promoter of E. coli, the vgb promoter from Vitreoscilla is used for the oxygen while the lux promoter from Vibrio fischeri was used for lysis control.
The model can be divided into three parts; the lld promoter, the vgb promoter and the lux promoter. Each of these systems was first modelled separately. This made it easier to observe the effect of changing individual parameters and make reasonable estimates when experimental data were not available. The final model contained 66 reactions and 46 parameters, many of which were estimates. However, we experienced that working with the model and observing how parameter changes influenced protein expressions gave valuable insight into the system.
Stochastic models, as opposed to deterministic models, describe the presence of species with the number of molecules. For small molecules, in this case oxygen and lactate, this gives very high numbers. For example; a 1 mmol concentration of lactate gives about 400000 molecules in the cell assuming a cell volume of 0.7 µm³. This many molecules are computationally demanding to keep track of and the diffusion of these molecules through the cell membrane"
TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#Electrace_-_-_TEXT.html," paper strip, $4 for the potentiostat circuitry, and $5 for the casing. Although coarse, this price estimate clearly shows a price difference of about four orders of magnitude compared to a fluorescence microscope (without a lab, personel, etc.). Therefore, we could state that the ELECTRACE system is inexpensive compared to current methods.
Portable
The commercialized device as we envision it is very small. This will not be very hard to realize since all the major components (cells, circuitry, microfluidics) are small by themselves. Since the ELECTRACE system does not need a high voltage to work, a very small battery can be used. The fact that our device will be small will of course make it portable. This will provide great advantages for a range of applications. It should however be noted that at this stage of developmetn, we have not succeeded in scaling down the ELECTRACE system to a microfluids setup, as can be seen from the DropSens experiment data .
Easy to handle
To do a measurement with the ELECTRACE device, the only thing a user has to do is injecting an analyte in the microfluidic chamber. Doing this by hand is extremely difficult because applying a too high pressure damages the microfluidic system. To make this easier, some kind of small syringe pump has to be integrated in the system. This would make using the device fairly easy. Antoher way to make adding the analyte to the system easier is by making use of capillary forces: the device would then ""soak up"" the analyte.
Quantifiable
In current microbial biosensor systems, the concentration of analyte is coupled to the amount of emitted light. This light then has to be detected and converted to a current. This current is then measured to obtain a quantitative result. Our ELECTRACE system provides a direct coupling between the concentration of analyte and the current. In this way, we sidestep the optical step in the process, which will reduce noise. Also, the coupling between light-emitting proteins and detected light is highly non-linear and these kind of measurement are therefore dependent on complex calibration curves. [8] In the ELECTRACE system, the input/output relation will be much more simple. This makes quantification very easy compared to current microbial biosensor systems.
Plug-and-play functionality
The ELECTRACE system is very generic; the only thing specified for the sensing module is that it has to somehow activate a promoter. Therefore, essentially every biosensor promoter can be coupled to the electron transport module. In this way, our"

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#HumanPractices#Killswitch#Regulation_-_-_TEXT.html,"Arb serves as a negative control.
In order to test the control of these promoters and riboswitches, we constructed them independently and together upstream of GFP ( BBa_K082003 ) with an LVA tag.  Figure 5 shows these circuits for the mgtA system.  Identical circuits were designed for all three systems, however only the top two were needed for the MOCO riboswitch system.
We then tested the aforementioned circuits by growing cells containing our circuits with varying concentrations of their respective ions.  Our detailed protocols can be found here .  We then measured fluorescent output, normalizing to a negative control not expressing GFP.
Results
So far, we have been able to obtain results for our magnesium system, as can be seen in Figure 6.
Figure 6: This graph represents the relative fluorescence units from the mgtA promoter riboswitch construct as well as the riboswitch construct under the TetR promoter (BBa_R0040). We can see a decrease in the level of GFP output with increasing concentrations of magnesium. There is much steeper decrease in the GFP output in the construct with the magnesium promoter and riboswitch compared to the construct with just the riboswitch alone.
As the graph shows, there is a much larger decrease in the GFP output when the mgtA promoter and riboswitch are working together as compared to the mgtA riboswitch alone under the control of TetR promoter ( BBa_J13002 ). This suggests that having both the promoter and the riboswitch together provides a tighter control over the genes expressed downstream. This also suggests that the magnesium riboswitch alone is sufficient in reducing gene expression downstream of a constitutive promoter.
It is important to consider however that the control elements of the system, PhoP and PhoQ , that were described above were not present in the circuits tested and therefore there is GFP expression in at the inhibitory concentration (10 mM MgCl2). We believe that having the regulatory elements would give us better control and limit the leakiness.
Although the magnesium system is highly regulated, it is not a suitable system for the purposes of our bioreactor. The tailings are composed of very high concentration of magnesium, as high as 120 mM (Kim et al. 2011). As can be seen, this would inhibit the system. Therefore, if our bacteria were to escape into the tailings, the kill genes would not be activated and the bacteria would be able to survive.  However, we feel that this could still be an incredibly useful system for other teams for both killswitch"

OPEN-ENDED ACTIVITY
At the 85th anniversary of Beijing Institute of Technology, we were invited to show iGEM and our project to alumni. In our display case, we played some interesting biology games and we told students what synthetic biology is. Then we introduced our former projects to audiences and they can had a good understanding about iGEM through our past competition experiences. Meanwhile, we improved our project through the suggestions given by students. In this open-ended activity, we communicated with more than 3000 people and got more than 500 suggestions. In the open-ended activity, we select sweet substances as our better inducers.
TEAM UP WITH YAN’AN UNIVERSITY
This year，we invited four students from Yan'an University to be our team members to design and implement our project together. In this process, they not only expanded their knowledge of synthetic biology and improved their experimental skills, but also learned how to build an iGEM team.  All those will help them to establish an iGEM team next year on their own. More importantly, we were getting closer to the idea of iGEM and spread synthetic biology to more people.
MEDIA CAMPAIGN
In September, we were interviewed by the Propaganda Department of Beijing Institute of Technology, and we had launched a website campaign on the BIT official website of synthetic biology and iGEM. In the course of the interview, we carried out scientific exchanges on the knowledge of sweet substances.
COOPERATION WITH OTHER UNIVERSITIES
At the latter phases of our project, we organized University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou University and Jilin University to make a big conference about what we had done so far and held three scientific speeches to introduce the development and the common use of sweeteners in our daily life, which contributed to the increase of popularity of iGEM as well as Synthetic Biology. Ultimately, we collected the critical advice from the audiences in time and accept one of them, which recommended us to set saccharose as the standard sweetener, after that running the test would be more reasonable.

Fudan,2014,Team:Fudan#pro_-_-_TEXT.html,"However, these three methods have their pros and cons. The first method, seems perfect to introduce four transcription factors into a differentiated cell and sufficiently return it into a pluripotent situation. However, it still requires many steps to differentiate this “most versatile cell” into specific types. Due to the existence of a strong oncogene c-Myc, the so-called omnipotent iPSc is not absolute security, its cells’ oncoenicity and fidelity remains to be tested. The second method, as early as 1987, Davis used the overexpressed transcription factor myoD’s cDNA successfully transdifferentiate MEF-mouse embryonic fibroblast into myoblast. Vierbuchen also successfully overexpressed Ascl1,Brn2 and Myt1l in MEF and got mature neuron in 2010. By knocking down PTB in MEF, Xue Y also got mature neuron in 2013. But over these years, it’s more difficult to get real lineage specific cell, which is similar to the mature cell, directly from somatic cell transdifferentiation. The reason is that the influence of few transcription factors is limited to cell transdifferentiation. In addition, the cells obtained by this method are too simple to make decisive assistance to the formation of mature tissue, and the cells barely have self renewing ability because of terminal differentiation.
The third method is the middle stage of the first two methods, it contains the advantages in the first two, but also obtain the disadvantages of them.
So we hope that through stably transfected a super plasmid named “iGemage” into mammalian cells, which contains four transcription factors OSKM （Oct4,Sox2,Klf4 and c-Myc）through connecting by T2A linker (used to induce reprogramming iPSc ) , with Sox2 gene ( used to induce reprogramming of inducible neural stem cells iNSc ) as well as with the PTB shRNA gene ( for transdifferentiation into neurons ) . It will be achieved the conversion of cells in various states by adding two different drugs --dox and tamoxifen.
Design
The goal we want to achieve this year is to construct a logic circuit which can perform as many kinds of boolean calculation as possible while keeping the circuit as tiny as possible to make it much more useful when served as a brick to construct larger scale system.
Let’s draw a coordinate graph first, mark X-axis as Input1, Y-axis as Input2. There we can see four regions representing different input state: low [X] low [Y],"

This system is often made by small proteins or proteins recognized by a ligand membrane exposed to the targeted cell surface.
Finally, the last element is the stealth system. Why, and against who?
A vector, usually bigger than 60nm and potentially charged, is detected by the immune system. It is one of the principal issues of this technology. That is why stealth systems were elaborated.
All vectors do not have the same components, and the same possibilities. Each vector type has its own characteristic.
Back to top
Vector types [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]
Two big vector classes exist: biological vectors and chemical vectors.
First vector type, viral vector. Viral vectors are viral particles carrying an artificially modified genome, in comparison to viral strain from which is derived the vector.
Viruses represent natural vectors the most evaluated for foreign genetic information transfer in a cell. Many viruses have been adapted in vectors: the most advanced are retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses (AAV).
Natural viral cycle is divided in two distinct parts: infection and replication. Infection consists in the viral genome introduction into the cell. Viral gene expression leads in a second time to new viral particles formation, this is the replication.
During the production of recombinant virus, viral particles encapsidate a modified genome containing expression cassette of the therapeutic gene of interest at the place of all or a part of the viral genome.
Transduction is defined by an abortive infection by the defective recombinant vector, for the replication, which introduces only functional genetic information in a targeted cell. This vector type has an advantage, it is naturally a genetic information vector, it has then all the capacity to move in the circulation flow, to recognize a targeted marker and to enter the interest cell to integrate the therapeutic gene. But it gets drawbacks as well: its high immunogenicity, the possibility of viral genome recombination in vivo and its industrialization.
Another type of viral vector, which is bacterial: phages. These viruses have others characteristics than eukaryotic vectors. They function on the same way; they are natural vector of genetic information as well. On the other hand, native of the prokaryote world, they are safer to use, easier to produce, and less efficient face to an eukaryotic environment. Their genome should integer specific sequences, which permit them to increase their transfection efficiency. They possess"

ULaval,2018,Team:ULaval#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," chemical production of adrenaline. Half of them considered GMOs not harmful in any way whereas the other half were not so fond of them, but still considered chemical synthesis even worse. Finally, only a few respondents (4%) thought that GMOs are worse than the chemical production of adrenaline.
The results show acceptability of GMOs throughout our respondents, but it may be due to the academic background of the respondents. Indeed, a large proportion of them have a high understanding of biology and have heard of genome editing prior to taking this survey. Thus, our results could be biased.
The risks of synthetic biology
Since most of the respondents were informed about biology, we asked them if they could come up with some risks about synthetic biology that we did not identified ourselves.
Here are the most frequently identified health risks:
- Risk of mutations in the modified yeast that could result in the production of toxic alternative products. (16 respondents)  - Side effects that could occur on the human body. (12 respondents)  - The preservation and stability of the compound while stored or transported could be different than the chemically produced adrenaline. (9 respondents)  - Contamination from other microorganisms. (7 respondents)
Concerns about health risks were more frequent, but many economic and technical concerns were also raised:
- Is the adrenaline stable during the extraction process? (1 respondent)
- Is there a molecule produced on the metabolic pathway that is toxic for the yeast itself? (1 respondent)
- Could an another industry make something out of it? (Energy drink / Beer / Sell it on the black market) (9 respondents)
What is natural?
We constructed our survey in order to educate people about synthetic biology and GMOs, and to trigger ethical reflection about what is natural. In this section, we explained how ""natural"" is a complicated and often subjective word. Indeed, it is often used as a metaphor to mean good and healthy. In our survey, we explained how it is hard to define “nature” or “natural” in the context of industry, particularly in light of humans’ long history of interaction and effect on other species, humankind, and the environment29. In other words, according to some people’s definition of natural, even farm animals and plants cannot be considered natural.
We then asked respondents to rate their perception of natural from 1 to 3 (see chart on the side). As you can see, the large majority of respondents answered that natural means “found in nature in its raw state”. After that, we asked them if they considered our yeast-produced adrenaline natural and the answers were quite divided.

Fluorescence results
In order to check if both constructions are functional, we induced expression using several media as depicted in this protocol . The supplemented SD media (which contains methionine and histidine but not leucine nor uracil) allows the selective growth of transgenic yeasts to obtain a big inoculant which will grow better in a glucose-rich media (YPD8%), leaving us with a culture in exponential phase and high biomass. The expression of ZsGreen1 takes place when our yeasts are deprived of glucose and there is presence of ethanol. Further information about molecular mechanisms is here .
In order to quantify cell growth and normalize fluorescence, the DO at 600 nm of each sample was measured. Fluorescence intensity was measured at an excitation wavelength of 493 nm and an emission wavelength of 505 nm.
Figure 3 shows expression of ZsGreen1 in our transformed yeast –and not in non-transformed yeast– in YPRE broth , that is, in presence of ethanol when glucose is absent. Figure 4 shows intracellular expression of our protein. Moreover, there is such a great level of ZsGreen1 expression that it can be seen it with a naked eye, as shown in Picture 5.
Further experiments are required for a better characterization of our constructions, in which we are already working, but cannot be shown because of the lack of time.

Description
What is Saccharomyces cerevisiae ?
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a single-celled microorganism commonly known as the brewer's yeast. This yeast is a facultative anaerobe which means that it has both the ability to grow using oxygen via cellular respiration as well as to undergo fermentation in the absence of oxygen.1
What is adrenaline ?
Adrenaline is a hormone secreted by the medulla of the adrenal glands. Its production is increased in response to fear and stress in order to prepare the body to react promptly. It causes a raise in blood pressure, vasodilation in the skeletal muscles, bronchodilation and pupil dilation. 2
What are the uses of yeast ?
S.cerevisiae is the Brewer’s yeast!
Indeed, it is the principal microorganism
responsible for the fermentation process
during brewing. It is also used in baking to
leaven bread, in winemaking to ferment the
beverage and in various scientific
research as a model.1, 3
What is the use of adrenaline ?
Adrenaline
is used as an
emergency treatment
during life-threatening
anaphylactic reactions
and  cardiac arrest. It
may also be used
to control minor
bleeding and
asthma.4
So, what's the problem ?
Beers are doing just fine. However, the current chemical manufacturing processes to produce adrenaline struggle to keep up with the demand, often leading to shortages of potentially life-saving medicine5. In addition, the chemical synthesis of adrenaline involves the use of toxic and dangerous substances6.
Our Solution
The union of yeast and the adrenaline enzymatic machinery.
We intend to use S. cerevisiae to produce adrenaline that can be purified and stored.
Bonus !
As the enzymatic pathway also produces metabolic intermediates of biomedical interest, we intend to create three strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae producing dopamine, noradrenaline or adrenaline2.
Our approach
We designed a two-plasmid system which harbors synthetic human cDNAs encoding the adrenaline enzymatic pathway. We explored how the insertion of this plasmid system into a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain engineered to overproduce L-tyrosine can be used for the biosynthesis of adrenaline7. The metabolic intermedi"

June 12, 2013
It's win number two for the University of Lethbridge student researcher/entrepreneurs who form the Synbiologica Ltd. team.
CEO Isaac Ward (third-year neuroscience student), first-year biochemistry student Erin Kelly and chemistry and biochemistry master's students Mackenzie Coatham and Harland Brandon have developed a new method of detecting hormones, and are in the process of patenting their idea.
Their proposed biomedical device technology -- called ""Biologically Enhanced Assay in Real-Time"" -- is expected to bring next-generation hormone detection to the research, agriculture and medical markets.

In addition to winning $10,000 in the SouthVenture Business Plan Competition in March, the group recently took first place in the Tech Stream side of the Chinook Entrepreneurial Challenge, an annual business planning competition hosted by Community Futures Lethbridge Region.
They received another $10,000 in cash, a one-year lease on space in the tecconnect Centre for New Commerce, a high-tech business incubator operated by Economic Development Lethbridge, plus a host of other in-kind prizes including business consulting from MNP and ActionCOACH, and several thousand dollars worth of media services.
""I am extremely proud of the Synbiologica group for their achievements and wish them continued success,"" says Dr. Dan Weeks, the U of L's Vice-President (Research). ""The U of L is a comprehensive research institution that offers significant research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students. This approach is important as it equips our graduates with the knowledge and ability to thrive in their research and entrepreneurial careers.""

Prepped 2 tubes of LB(5mL) with chloremphenicol and picked colonies of Bba-xxxx [1] to generate a starter culture for protein expression. Also prepped 2 tubes of of LB(5mL) with kanamycin and picked colonies of PET24a in order to miniprep and generate more plasmid.
We are growing the starter culture for the silk protein up to an OD of 0.8.
For the starter culture, because we started the incubation at 3pm, and we dont want to overgrow, we will put the cells in the 30 C shaker until tomorrow morning, at which point we will transfer to the 37 degree shaker.
The starter culture was placed in the 37 C incubator for one hour, and then transferred to the 30 C incubator at 4 PM"

Korea
By chance, our project of this year is directly related to the regulation of the GMM since it would be the actual GMM product if we complete our project and try to materialize them. Our project this year was to make an edible probiotics, which is considerably regulated by the government’s control for they  directly interact with one’s biosystem.  Rather than simply considering the GMM regulation of Korea, proceeding a collaboration project with various other teams  gave us the knowledge and insight about the biosafety which helped us a lot in many aspects while we proceeded our annual project. And it was pleasure to consider in what way can an iGEM project change the society.
The act of investigating also lead us to an unusual chance. A contact with a member of the GMM regulating-institution, in order to get informations required to fill in questions of this document, gave us a chance to meet the member of National Assembly, who mainly take charge of enacting GMM law.
India
As a part of foundational advance, this year our team is working on a square wave generator with applications in varied fields. Seeing the potential it has to revolutionize the field of periodic drug delivery and biological clocks, the GMM regulations will be a great source of help to commercialize the iGEM project with the rules laid down for business across the globe, guiding through the best place for setup. Also, the import and export of GMMs across countries, for iGEM projects as well as business, would then be easily guided with minimized issues in the customs and thus their timely delivery.
Canada
UAlberta’s outreach initiatives include education for the general public and establishing a Synthetic Biology student group at the University of Alberta.  For our education outreach, we are developing modules on scientific literacy and producing a video on the importance of Alberta’s science curriculum in providing a foundation for the future. An element in our modules for high school students may introduce biotechnologies, including GMO’s, and international legislations regulating the use of these biotechnologies. We are also starting an official student group at the University of Alberta dedicated to discussing and understanding the overarching reach of synthetic biology and biotechnology. Documents like these put to perspective the concerns associated with genetic modification of organisms.
Discussion
As a final comment, we wanted to reflect on the principles standing behind any GMM related legislations: ensuring citizens’ safety. As any scientific field, synthetic biology makes enormous contributions to the development of a more sustainable future. iGEM teams alone have created numerous"

Conclusion
Our team successfully introduced a new immobilization system; the Peptidosome. We established a robust protocol for creating the Peptidosomes and so we are able to encapsulate bacteria that can live and grow inside the Peptidosome. In addition, we managed to functionalize the cages by decorating the surface. We can proudly announce that the Peptidosomes are a new fundamental approach for generating and applying encapsulated bacteria.

We made a social sciences report based on our research of the role of division of labour in modular systems, by finding links between various systems, ranging from social to biological ones. We interviewed other iGEM teams, and analysed our own, on topics of role allocation (specialisation), team structure, communication and supervision. We then applied the principles to bacterial systems, and adapted the design of our scientific project to include the lessons learned. See here for more information.
Gold Medal Criteria
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry.
We improved the characterisation of eleven parts, which can be seen on our judging form . For example, see our improved characterisation of part BBa_I11012 here .
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
This year we have collaborated with the UCL team. We used our antisense RNA generator software to provide them with the optimal antisense gene for knocking down their target gene. We also analysed their existing antisense gene and tried to predict its efficacy. UCL helped us out by testing our prediction on this matter with the resultant real world data on its efficacy. For more details, see this description .
We also worked with the Zurich team, providing some raw data for one of their models, which utilised some of our metabolic wires.
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on past Policy & Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities.
We interviewed six iGEM teams, in order to inquire about how their teams divided their tasks, how they communicated, and how they were organised. See full description of the strategy here . We then applied the findings from our interviews to the design of a bacterial system, and adapted the design of our own scientific project accordingly. We also generalised our findings, so that they can be easily adapted for use in any system, be that a bacterial system, an iGEM team or otherwise. See"

BIT,2018,Team:BIT-China#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," understanding of nature. Therefore, we                         choose yeast because of its practical application value and great potential in future.
Animal Model and Human Study (2000s)
Gradually. people realized the defects of the chemical methods, and began to detect                         antioxidants through animal model and human study which has higher biological relevance and                         credibility, after all the 21st century is a century for life science. Unfortunately, animal                         model and human study are time-consuming and expensive so that the initial antioxidants detect                         is not suitable. There's no doubt that cell-based detect is faster and cost-effective.
That's also the reason why we design cell-based detect system.
Cell-Based Method (CAA) (2007)
In 2007, Cell-based detection was first reported in the literature (CAA assay), which was a                         breakthrough in the history of antioxidants detection methods and was referenced widely. CAA                         assay characterizes the consumption of antioxidants on synthetic ROS (ABAP for Peroxyl                         Radicals) after entering cells by the fluorescence intensity of DCFH-DA fluorescent probes.                         Regretfully, it also has some shortcoming.
● On the one hand, both fluorescent probes and free radicals are artificially added from                             the external environment, which means introducing exogenous interference and it is not a                             completely endogenous cell detection.
● On the other hand, the credibility of the DCFH-DA probe has been criticized in the                             literature and it is also a question whether the synthesized radicals (ABAP for Peroxyl                             Radicals) can represent the endogenous ROS accumulated in cells.
To address these problems,
we need to consider the                     following things:
● On the one hand, in the system we designed the detection process needs to be completely                             intracellular without introducing exogenous interference.
● On the other hand, the signal we detect need to be representative of intracellular ROS.                             And we choose intracellular H2O2 as the final signal.
Why do we choose intracellular H2O2?
We choose intracellular H2O2 as the final signal to represent all kinds                         of ROS in cell and for                         this case our output component roGFP2-Orp1 has high H2O2-specificity.                         Why?
● Most intracellular ROS comes from mitochondria respiratory chain and all kinds of ROS                             will convert into H2O2 under the intracellular antioxidant enzyme                             system. Once H2O2 accumulated, it will transfer to the cytoplasm.
● H2O2 is the final form of all kinds of ROS.

Interviewing Ming Ding
We had a great talk with Ming Ding, professor in orthopaedic surgery at the Southern University of Denmark, about how we can use our plastic as coating for implants and how the material can be used for slow release of antimicrobial peptides. Mr. Ding’s team is currently working on some experiments with release of E-vitamin from implants in animals. This method could also be tested with combining our plastic and antimicrobial peptides. Especially since our plastic is biodegradable, which is a requirement for this type of coating. Mr. Ding also pointed out that it would be an advantage if the material would be able to stimulate blood vessel formation and thereby increase the speed of wound healing. This is some of the qualifications that our spider silk contains, so the silk could also be worth considering when working with implants. The interview gave us information about the possibilities in our project and reassurance of the great potential there is in developing new biomaterials for implants.
Interviewing Coloplast
We presented our project to Coloplast with the intention of getting their point of view on our project as a whole and in relation to our three sub elements. They believe that our spider silk and bacteriocins are the most interesting and relevant elements in relation to a commercial product perspective of our Bacto-Aid. The reason why PHB is not the most relevant, is that the use of plastic materials in wound care dressings are low compared to other uses of plastics. Instead, the topic of biodegradable polymers is more relevant in other areas and applications. Coloplast are already aware of the great qualities of recombinant spider silk and bacteriocins, however the idea of combining the two elements are completely new to them. They see a big opportunity in this idea and encourage us to continue the work on this project. Their feedback really helped us finding our focus in relation to future development of our product and in relation to how we could improve our project.
Upcoming meeting with LEGO®
We have been in contact with LEGO® in the weeks up to our wiki deadline, and they were very interested in our sub project with producing PHB. Due to a Danish holiday it was not possible to meet up before the deadline, but we have already set a meeting with LEGO®'s director of materials for when we come home from Boston. LEGO® has a large division with research and development of materials from whom we can learn a lot. LEGO® could also end up being a future consumer of our plastic.
Interviews with Experts and Companies
Interviewing Laura Jakobsen
Do"
Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportBiosafetyBiosecurity_-_-_TEXT.html," bioethicist being an emergent form of expert mediator in the ethical debates that surround new biotechnologies. In fact, the CEO of Rep X says of hiring bioethicists : “I'm surprised more companies don't do it. It doesn't cost us anything, and in the end it may save us [money, time or reputation]. I mean, the whole idea of it is so reasonable. We've always said that if we're going on the front page of the New York Time we'd better make sure get it right”. In other worlds, bioethics is an integral component of Rep X business model.”
This preventive aspect is about to put them strategically in a debate which is about to take more and more weight in the next year, even faster if something like Church's proposals are carried out. That way, they could get the part of bioethics experts in the new born agencies or biosecurity organisations. This taking into account of ethical and biosecurity matters can also be seen through a political, economic and strategic positioning, for example, supporting risk precaution about biosecurity more than biosafety.
Biosecurity concerns impose on actors to privilege “political” solutions in addition to “biological” solutions about security. Thus, the world that appears under our eyes has two components, embodying both naturality and artificiality : the living and the political. We can reiterate here that the life' that is at the heart of our reflexion is a synthetic life, and so, the question of its naturality will be much more complex. The natural element to which we refer here is the thing on which anguish and risks are built on. It is the last natural part resting after handling and lab manipulations : the risk of modification of the organism through its evolution. Thus, even in the case of a synthetic organism, it is its membership to something like a dynamic of the living, connecting it to naturality, which is the focus of the ethical discourse. In other world, even if there is very little that is natural in a synthetic organism, that naturality will be the purpose of the ethical discourse. Life is so understood through concepts as “out of control”, “irregular” and “unpredictable”, leading us to risks and necessitating regulations. That regulation process will be lead by an other kind of artificial organism, created by man : the State. Artificiality of the State, already theorized by Thomas Hobbes (Hobbes 1651) , now take on the meaning of that regulatory body. Our way to deal with risks, unpredictability and uncontrollability"
