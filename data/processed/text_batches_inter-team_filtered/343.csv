Finally, we are taking measures to get LearnSynBio incorporated into actual classrooms: We have established a          collaboration with the high school team Broad Run iGEM (see Collaborations page) to incorporate our modules into          their advanced science classes and after-school science clubs. Additionally, we are working with some of our former          high school teachers to introduce LearnSynBio to VAST, the Virginia Association of Science Teachers, for incorporation          in classrooms all around the state. Lastly, it is our hope that the presentation of LearnSynBio at the Jamboree          will encourage the spread of LearnSynBio to schools all around the world!
BwB
In addition to LearnSynBio, we also completed several public outreach events. We were awarded a grant from Building            with Biology  to host public outreach events over the course of the iGEM 2016 season.
We held a science workshop          targeted at at local children and their parents which allowed them to get some hands-on experience with the exciting          world of modern biology. We had more than 70 people in attendance and together we extracted DNA from strawberries,          learned about synthetic biology and the benefit of standard biological parts, and discussed our questions and concerns          with GMO food.
We also held a forum on the topic of Genome Editing targeted at the general public. At the forum, we briefly discussed          the implications of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool and explored various ways that it could be applied to real          world problems. Among the topics discussed were: stabilizing the Honeybee population by increasing expression of          ‘hygiene’ genes, engineering yeast for efficient biofuel production, and using CRISPR to decrease human susceptibility          to HIV infection. We had over 30 participants for the forum and we received great feedback from our attendees!

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

One was heated for two minutes with a Bunsen burner, the other was not. Both slides were touched down on an agar plate with the bacteria-coated surface pointing towards the agar. Unsurprisingly, no cells grew from the heated sample, while the control showed a lot of healthy bacteria (Figure 2).

We have therefore implemented a sure-fire method of sterilizing the final product into the fabrication process of our solar cells.
Binding of Heavy Metals
Due to the metal binding domains on the curli fibers, the biofilms are able to bind not only zinc oxide, but also heavy metals. This might present a safety application since biofilms could scavenge toxic heavy metal ions out of wastewater.  Copper, nickel, gold and cadmium were tested. Two different methods have been applied. While the first two were detected by a decrease in absorption of UV and visible light, gold and cadmium nanoparticles were synthesized directly on the biofilm. A color change indicates a successful binding event. For further information, see results.

Sharing knowledge and receiving feedback
At the beginning of july the deanery and student association of molecular medicine in Tuebingen cooperated to hold a symposium titled ""Degeneration and Regeneration - Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Concepts"" in the university hospital Tuebingen. Invited were students of life sciences, molecular medicine and, thanks to our efforts, iGEM teams from all over Germany.
Because of its futuristic yet approachable nature iGEM is able to gather lots of attention
Master courses and PhD programs in several German cities were advertised and the iGEM teams presented their past or present projects with a focus upon projects with a possible medicinal application. We as iGEM Tuebingen used the opportunity to showcase iGEM in general and our 2014 and 2015 projects to the gathering. In discussions with the attendees we talked about our this year project and received a lot of valuable input concerning, for example legal matters of a genetically engineered probiotic, from attending professionals.
Intellectual exchange and receiving feedback is crucial in optimizing ones project"

(growing in M9 salts with casamino acids and no tryptophan eliminated the faecal odour entirely, as the smell is due entirely to tryptophan derivatives).
The RaspberrE coli were incubated for two and a half days with 3 or 9mM p-coumaric acid and 50mM arabinose to induce expression. The cultures were then shaken with ethyl acetate which was then run on an LCMS setup (which was only possible due to the kind giving of time and expertise by Ben Pilgrim at the Cambridge Department of Chemistry).
As a control, one of the tubes incubated contained a strain of E coli resistant to chloramphenicol but with none of the raspberry ketone producing genes. There was one peak that existed on the RaspberrE coli spectra but not on the control, which when run through the mass spectrometer turned out to be benzalacetone, the precursor to raspberry ketone.
A comparison of E.coli transformed with the benzalacetone generator (BBa_K1484317) against a control strain with none of the relevant enzymes.
None of the E. coli which also contained the benzalacetone reductase gene produced any peaks which gave mass spectrum peaks corresponding to that of raspberry ketone. These results suggest that while the 4-coumarate coA ligase and benzalacetone synthase both worked, the benzalacetone reductase, as shown once already by the Dutch research team who first cloned the enzyme’s gene sequence (led by Jules Beekwilder in Wageninen, The Netherlands), does not actually reduce benzalacetone.
A comparison of bacteria incubated with p-coumaric acid. Top: Transformed with benzalacetone generator (BBa_K1484317) Bottom: Transformed with benzalacetone generator and benzalacetone reductase (BBa_M36705) as a polycistronic operon. No raspberry ketone was detected in either culture.

we can add some EDTA too but then we need to buffer exchange it before we load it onto the Ni column

you still need the lysis buffer for this tough

we can use our gravity column with an IMAC resin and that's fine
we need to store our protein in a buffer that's not super high salt
so we can elute, dialyze or buffer exchange
the lysis buffer can be the same as the initial buffer for the column though the lysis shouldn't have any imidizole
if that column doesn’t work well we can ask to use his HPLC machine

The only technical process is the deposition of the electrolyte and the sealing of the complete solar cell, which prevents the cell from drying out.
Biofilm
According to a IUPAC recommendation, a biofilm is an... “Aggregate of microorganisms in which cells that are frequently embedded within a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) adhere to each other and/or to a surface. [...] A biofilm is a system that can be adapted internally to environmental conditions by its inhabitants. […] The self-produced matrix of EPS, which is also referred to as slime, is a polymeric conglomeration generally composed of extracellular biopolymers in various structural forms.” (Vert et al., 2012).
Figure 1: Steps of formation and maturation of a biofilm (Vlamakis et al., 2013).
Bacteria form the three-dimensional structures shown in Figure 1 to survive in the face of environmental stress. To assemble these aggregates, the bacteria have to specialize themselves to attach to the surface and to communicate with other microorganisms. In the process, they will lose their flagella, produce proteins for quorum sensing and induce expression of extracellular polymeric substances usually called slime.
The importance of curli fibers for our project
Curli fibers, or simply curli, are thin, extracellular, proteinaceous structures produced by E.coli and other bacteria. Next to influencing community behavior and host cell adhesion, these amyloid fibers play a role in surface contacts and cell aggregation and mediate the formation of biofilms (Barnhart and Chapman, 2006).
Curli-related proteins are the products of two operons containing seven genes in total: csgBAC and csgDEFG. Of the seven proteins, CsgD is the transcriptional regulator and CsgE/F are responsible for the processing of CsgA. CsgC mediates the secretion of CsgA through the translocator CsgG. CsgB serves as the origin of nucleation and anchors CsgA, which makes up the majority of curli fibers, to the outer membrane (Nguyen et al., 2014; Hobley et al., 2015). The production of curli is demonstrated in Figure 2.

I really enjoyed the first talk by Dr. Cees Dekker about nanotechlogy how it is connected to biotechnology and a short iGEM history lesson, at least from Delft. But it certainly inspired me to proceed to promote iGEM at my home university where the competition is still fairly new.
Afterwards we had the opportunity to get to know the film team from Evry who asked me to do an interview for them. After a short coffee break the scientific talks proceeded, sadly I was quite preoccupied with events unfolding at my hometown Hamburg. As we enjoyed our time in Delft more and more footage arrived from Hamburg, depicting Hamburg in flames. What happened? G20 happened. For the next 2 days more and more footage arrived showing protesters clashing violently with the police, which reacted with more and more force. A spiral of violence, so I was thinking about all my friends and family that was still there.
Gladly distraction came quickly! First, we had lunch and then after all the talks ended we proceeded with the poster presentation. And this is where the real awesomeness started, to hear about all the cool projects that young aspiring scientist, like me, had thought about and were putting all their time and effort into were a real blast. Plus, I had to explain our own project repeatedly while we received a lot of valuable feedback.
After all the serious stuff was done it was time for socializing, we had an amazing barbeque and a whole lot of beer and good conversations. To conclude the evening, we went on to explore the Delft nightlife, and what happens in Delft stays in Delft.
iGEM Team – An interdisciplinarity check up! with Mirjam Brassler
The iGEM team consists of students from a huge range of academic disciplines: Biology, Chemistry, Education, Psychology, Nanoscience, Molecular Life Sciences, Communication Studies, and Information technology. In order to achieve a holistic understanding and find solutions to complex issues, interdisciplinarity is highly needed. However, interdisciplinary teamwork exhibits a large potential for conflicts and in practice most collaborations fail. As usual, also the interdisciplinary iGEM team experience difficulties in communication, inappropriate expectations, and underestimation of collaborative work.  The interdisciplinary checkup dressed these issues with an introduction into recent findings of research regarding interdisciplinarity, deriving strategies for an effective interdisciplinary teamwork and exercises in interdisciplinary communication and reflection of the interdisciplinary teamwork"

There are also other efforts for landmines detections. There is a tool sensor which uses a ground penetrating reader and a metal detector. However, this is not commonly used due to the fact that is quite expensive. Another experiment is a plant that reacts to nitrogen, turning into a specific color. But, this is subjected also to some limitations. Another experiment for detection was by using bees.  In the end this was classified as an inefficient method.
Apart from asking about the current used methods, we also asked more details about the process itself. Mr. Brady exemplified on one of their most recent works in Lebanon –where they are doing battle area clearance from the 2006 war. They tend to have a team of nine people going out early morning, coming back mid-day. The limitations of this approach: once they fund something, need to deal with national authorities that regulate that.
The most efficient method: the tool box –manual demining  represents “the bread and butter” of what they do, although is not as fast as dogs and machines (flails, rollers) are also employed, mostly to discount areas. The first challenge is that they are given a very large area and delineating  it down takes some time. Therefore, the first step is discounting the initial area to get to the area where the actual problem is they go with a manual team for the surface clearance.
Typically a single deminer –one man lane can clear approximately 25 square meters per day, up to 50 square meters depending on the conditions. Anything beyond this number is questionable in terms of safety, comprehensiveness and accuracy.  In addition, the soil type impacts  the number of  false positives.
To overcome the dog usage limitations, there are experiments with loose free range dogs. This implies, not keeping them on the line, and thus bringing some versatility. In the current methods they are boxing the area.  Moreover, one organization is using rats for detection. The idea is similar as the dogs for the detection method.  However, “at the end the day they are back to one man detection”. There are areas that are so contaminated that goes directly to excavation, according to the standards.
We asked Mr. Brady if the current methods suffice.  His main answer was that methods that are faster would be great.  For instance, he gave an example about a South African Company that takes their samples across instead of brining the dogs. That has been useful to overcome the limitations of the dogs, but not completely.

In the process of designing the site-directed mutation, we communicate with Team Jilin_China about our problem. They offered us a software Discovery Studio 3.5, which can speculate the rough 3D structure of a protein molecule according to its amino acid sequence. This software gave us a reference about which site should be mutated without the exact 3D structure.
8.SYSU-CCiC MEETING
It was a great honor to be invited to SYSU-CCiC meeting organized by Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) to share iGEM experiences with other teams. CCiC(Central China iGEM Consortium) is a national iGEM seminar held by Chinese universities, aiming to promote the communication of Chinese iGEM teams and publicize the conception of synthesis biology.
On the morning of September 2, 2016, we took a flight to Guangzhou from Tianjin. One hour later, we arrived at SYSU. Upon our registration, we exchanged ideas with some teams. At 7 pm, the opening ceremony began and each team made a brief introduction. In the following two days, we simulated the process of iGEM Giant Jamboree, presenting team projects and posters.
At 5 pm of September 4,2016, the seminar was coming to a close. We took a photo together as a reminder. After dinner, we attended the closing ceremony. Afterwards, we went back to Tianjin and got occupied with our experiment again.
We are so grateful to SYSU for invitation and treatment. During the seminar, we have made a lot of friends and had an understanding of other teams’ projects. In the meanwhile, we also got a number of beneficial suggestions. P.S. SYSU-CCiC Handbook"

Starting this summer, we have formed connections and maintained communications with other high school                     and                     collegiate teams, and we are glad that we could offer our help to some of the teams, and happy to                     receive theirs.
RDFZ-China
We provided lab resources to team RDFZ-China for two times. In the first time, we provided Kit Plate                     4 N4                     L12 and Kit Plate 3 G6 I6 F22 to their team. In the second time we provided bacteria solution of PSB                     1c3                     with designed restriction enzyme cutting site. Since high school teams do not usually have the                     financial                     support from school, most of the lab materials used by RDFZ are purchased by their team members. We                     are                     very happy to share our lab resources and help keep their experiments going and make their project                     come                     true.
Shipment Coordination
Because of the fact that the person responsible for receiving part in Genescript has recently                     resigned                     from his position, so there was a period of confusion where all the teams in China didn’t know who                     to                     send their parts too. One of our team leader Ruohong Wang actively communicated with the Genescript                     company and after rounds of negotiation finally got to know the new recipient of all the team’s                     parts.                     After knowing this piece of information, Ruohong spread the news the all the teams in China and                     helped                     all of them with this shipping problem.

Therefore, while we using our LEGO robot to present protein translation to public, all of them can understand and feel interested in this bio-synthesis process. We tried to educate people, particularly children, with this funny method and allow more people participate in biology filed.
Requirement 2: Help other team
We provided plasmids, E. coli and Arabinose for NYU-Shanghai to support their experiment. We synthesized the two kinds of functional plasmids. One was the plasmid of FwYellow chromoprotein BBa, noted for K1033910. Another was that of Aeblue chromoprotein BBa, noted for K1033902. We also supplied 5000uL of BL21 competent cell for them to create new type of E. coli. For inducing the expression of chromoproteins, we gave them Arabinose as inducer. All these biology materials were packaged hermetically and Victor Zhou sent them to teammates in NYU-Shanghai in person in order to prevent any separation during transportation. Three weeks ago, they used our donation and made more samples.  They thanked us a lot and we were also proud of supporting other groups in iGEM competition."

Sustainability
Bioethics of space exploration and use of co-cultures.
Sustainability is, needless to say, an important theme to have in mind when doing absolutely anything this day and age. The term changes identity somewhat when it comes to space however, because there we have even worse opportunities to recycle, and, obviously, quite simply bringing 'more stuff' is not an option.
One must be capable of growing things in space, and one must be able to remove the tracks of that action. To that end, no less than biodegradeable materials secreted from sporulating bacteria will do; so that very little mass can be brought out, cultured to become a lot of mars, and then degraded to become lactate (a possible fertilizer) - thus closing the ""cradle to cradle""-loop.
It is not only in space that we reflect on how our choices effects the planet, we have also decided to have organic, Fairtrade t-shirts for the Giant Jamboree
The Workshop
Human Practices workshop!
We had so much fun hosting the new (hopefully) annual human practices! Even before the workshop, we were already, great friends with the other Danish teams. Whenever we were talking about the medals, there was one subject that kept coming up, – what is this “human practices” thing? So, we decided to host a human practices workshop. We wanted our friends and ourselves, to learn by doing. We also invited several other of our friendshipteams (read more here) and our friends from Göteborg, came all the way from Sweden to join us!
At the workshop we also involved ourselves in patent reflections, philosophy, public speaking and general human practises.
The workshop was a great success and thanks to Anna from headquarters, who were also at the workshop, we was invited to make a talk at the Giant Jamboree about making a workshop.
Anonymous: “It was great! The number of people and the venue helped to have really good interactions among people. The projects will be very highly benefitted from an activity like this. This event was amazing, I hope more meetups like this happen next year!”

Ethics
We held a human practices workshop for us and some of our iGEM friend-teams, where the main focus was dedicated to ethics in science. We did this to underline two things - how important ethics are, and how aware you must be of them.

Restriction enzyme cut test, take 3
We repeated the restriction enzyme reaction once more to obtain a better and more definitive gel image, and we used the following formulation:
8 ul of 1x BSA/Buffer 4
2 ul of DNA (used the 79.4 junction PCR product again)
0.5 ul of BsaI-HF
This time it was incubated at 37*C for 15 minutes, and the product was PCR purified.
1.5 ul was run on the gel.
We can clearly see the appropriate sized bands (717 and 578 bps) after cutting our cross junction product with Bsa1
Redoing the isothermal assembly/transformation for Pos con 77 and the 3 controls
Today we redid the isothermal assembly for Pos con 77, Zif268, OZ052, and OZ123 using our previous protocol.  We also performed a chemical transformation using Top 10 ChemComp cells, and plated them with 100 ul each plate.  We will have to wait and see whether colonies grow tomorrow.
We also performed a cross junction PCR on the isothermal assembly product to make sure that it worked, using our usual protocol. The gel (pictured below) shows appropriately sized bands for the cross junction.
All our isothermal assemblies worked, since we can see bands at ~1.4 kb.
Practice plate library assembly
We cut 20 ul of CB bottom plasmid using the following recipe:
2 ul of 10x Buffer 4
16 ul of DNA (at 40 ng/ul)
1 ul of enzyme
1 ul of BSA
This was run out on a gel, and the band at size 2756 bp was extracted.  This will be extracted and used in a ligation reaction tomorrow.

Lambda red recombination of zeoc"
UNAM-Genomics_Mexico,2011,Team:UNAM-Genomics Mexico#Modeling#FBA_-_-_TEXT.html,", key researchers at our University warned us against the project due to the widespread presence of endogenous hydrogenases (the word ""impossible"" was often used, which only got us rebelliously stuck on proving them wrong). These native enzymes play the opposite role of the activity we were interested in, they consume molecular hydrogen instead of producing it. Apparently, since Nitrogen fixation produces molecular hydrogen, some Rhizobial species developed capture hydrogenases to recycle the protons into the all-important proton gradient that feeds cellular machinery. However, our particular strain, CFN42, doesn't have any capture hydrogenase. Nonetheless, since nature developed pathways to do the exact opposite of what we're doing, we were interested in finding out any toxic or deleterious effects our system might have. Therefore, out goals can be stated as being:
Under symbiont form, our transgenic chassis is capable of Hydrogen production?
To what extent does the Hydrogen production affect core metabolism, and Nitrogen fixation?
Is there a toxic effect derived from Hydrogen production?
Theoretical Background
FBA is part of a larger set of models known as the Constraint Based Analysis (CBA). Since cells may adopt an astronomical level of possible solutions for a given set of conditions, CBM models create constrains on the solution space to limit the complexity of the solution and render it easier to compute, interpret, and/or understand.
FBA starts at the assumption that pathways strive towards homeostasis. Thus, it assumes the cellular chemoton will adjust whatever it has to do in order to maintain chemical stability. In other words, this model does not require pesky kinetic constants, something that made our lives easier. For some light reading on this, you can consult ""Systems Biology: Properties of Reconstructed Networks"", by Bernhard Palsson . Or you can always go ask the All-Knowing-Oracle here .
The Simulation
A researcher at our institute had already done a metabolic reconstruction for the core metabolism of our chassis under symbiont form. The proteins in this reconstruction were chosen based on microArray data, and the pathways were reconstructed using the then-available literature. The data looks like:
The Toolbox
We performed the FBA calculations using a particular toolbox in iGEM's favorite program: MATLAB. In particular, we used the COnstrained Based Reconstruction & Analysis toolbox (COBRA) , originally by the Palsson Lab. I have to confess, the poor documentation (version 3.1.2) made our life difficult. It appears the toolbox has a lot of functions for various CBA, though a simple tutorial would have been"

♦iGEM Southern California Meet-up♦
The SoCal iGEM Meet-up was a great opportunity for our team to share ideas and challenges with one another. iGEM members from UCLA, UCSD, Alverno High School and Marburg attended the meet-up. Each team gave a presentation on their project and were given feedback from the other teams. We then went on to discuss the structures of our iGEM teams, challenges we face, and solutions that might work for those challenges.   Discussion lead to relationships and mini mentorships being built as the high school members of our team were able to stay in contact with Alverno High, a first year iGEM team, to mentor them through some of the struggles they were facing. It was decided that Southern California is the best. :)
♦TU Delft♦
Our advisor, Jennifer Tsui, filled out a survey for TU Delft answering questions about last year’s competition and how it influenced policy and education.

Our project could be used for ethanol production, pharmaceuticals, and food industry. We originally came up with the idea when discussing Mars and the below freezing temperatures at night which make growing plants almost impossible.
What risks might your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use? What future work might you do to reduce those risks?
The increased freeze-tolerance of this strain of cyanobacteria could allow a lot of improvement in terms of ethanol production, pharmaceuticals, and food industry. It could further lead to the evolution of this organism, which may change the metabolic regulation.

After we interviewed the specialists who are famous in the food and sweeteners area, the current situation of sweeteners was getting clearer in our mind.Generally, most of them used by us have the  main shortages which are high calories and bad taste even though they might be very sweet.We based the human sweetness receptor on our design and hypothesized to construct the signal conduction path in the yeast
VISIT SOME AUTHORITATIVE CORPORATIONS
When several constructions of gene had been finished and tests had been carried out, the COFCO which is the one of the top 500 corporations and the most advanced food suppliers in China became our next interviewee.Some of the managers showed up to welcome us and  they are the principal of innovating new product—Mrs.Zhao, the one of vice chairmen of the company—Mr.Huang and the doctor who is responsible for the manipulating of electronic tongue technique—Mr.Liu.We had a long but meaningful chat about the current device used by most of the  food producing companies, which made us realize that the generally used machine’s range is so limited that it is hard to measure the sweetness conveniently as well as some devices like electronic tongue technique would only be efficient after the association with the assessment given by workers, which results in the humongous uncertainty.Therefore, an innovative bio system which relies on Synthetic Biology to observe and select new types of sweeteners will have a non-negligible contribution to the society.Finally, we accept the advice which came from COFCO and what they suggest is to let us start with some classical and conventional sweeteners like stevia rebaudiana,  liquorice and Momordica grosvenori.
COOPERATION WITH OTHER UNIVERSITIES
At the latter phases of our project, we organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University etcetera to make a big chat about what we had done so far and held three scientific speeches to introduce the development and the common use of sweeteners in our daily life, which contributed to the increase of popularity of iGEM as well as Synthetic Biology.Ultimately, we collected the critical advice from the audiences in time and accept one of"

It mated with a-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae PVRVC, and then yeast cultured on Sc-His plate. As can be seen from the figure above, the reorganization efficiency is high, which reaches 50.8 percent. This proves that our Mating switcher is fast and efficient.

There are 325 yellow colonies and 31 white colonies in the field of view.
Apart from mating, we also transformed plasmid pRS416 with vika gene into the PVRVC. The efficiency is up to 91.3 percent in this figure.
Compare above two methods, we found that mating was not as efficient as the transformation of the plasmid. After analysis, we came to the conclusions as follows. For the mating method, vika recombinase has stopped expressing when BY4742 mated with PVRVC in YPD medium. The previously expressed vika recombinase may be degraded during the growth. In contrast to this, with another method that the plasmid was transformed into PVRVC directly, vika recombinase was continuously expressing during growth. So the efficiency of the second method is higher than the first method.

Network Restriction: If you want to carry out topological identification, this file lets you cut unnecessary edges between species and restrict special rate term form of ceritain species. For other cases, this file also plays the role to input a certain topological structure. Compared to Initial Parameters File, there are two less columns in this file. The first three columns ""flag"", ""object"", ""activator"" are used to specify an edge in the network while the last column ""func_list"" determine type of the edge.
Parameter Restriction: Lets you specify a parameter value that holds at all times during the identification. The organization of this file is absolutely the same with Initial Parameters File. This file is not needed unless you want to do identification.
Parameter Relation Restriction: Lets you specify mathematical constraints on one or more parameters, species, or compartments that must hold during a simulation
Parameter Range: Lets you specify the feasible range of parameters regardless of ""7. PARAM_RESTRI"". The organization of this file is similar to Initial Parameter File, while the last two columns ""min"" and ""max"" are minimum and maximum value of a parameter, instead of a certain value.
Candidate Function List: All possible types of functions following different kinetic laws (see Table.1). User define functions are added to the end of this file.

LMU-Munich,2014,Team:LMU-Munich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"unich , we created a a few handy parts for B. subtilis.
Modeling
We discovered that high translation and transcription rates of the involved mRNA's and proteins play an important role in making the suicide switch work. While high basic concentrations of involved substances are reciprocal to a successful lyse.
Furthermore, we were able to simulate the chemotactical driven movement of BaKillus according to a given concentration gradient of respective substances. Now we have the prototype for a tool helping us to anticipate the statistical propagation of BaKillus in the patient.
Application
We developed a nasal spray for the application of BaKillus against sinusitis. Furthermore we checked in a self-experiment that B.subtilis is viable in the nasal mucosa and can survive long enough to conduct its job of killing pathogens.

Hi there!
Welcome to our Wiki! I'm BaKillus, the pathogen-hunting microbe, and I'll guide you on this tour through our project. If you want to learn more about a specific step, you can simply close the tour and come back to it anytime you like. So let's start!
What's the problem?
First of all, what am I doing here? The problem is, pathogenic bacteria all around the world are becoming more and more  resistant against antimicrobial drugs. One major reason for the trend is the inappropriate use of drugs. With my BaKillus super powers, I want to reduce this misuse and thus do my part to save global health.
Sensing of pathogens
To combat the pathogenic bacteria, I simply eavesdrop on their communication. Bacteria talk with each other via quorum sensing systems, which I use to detect them and trigger my responses.
Adhesion
The more specific and effective I can use my powers, the lower the danger is of provoking new resistance development. So I catch pathogens whenever I get hold of them and stick to them until my work is done.
Killing
Talking about my work - killing pathogens is finally what I am made for. In response to quorum sensing molecules of the pathogens, I export a range of antimicrobial substances leading to dissipation of biofilms and the killing of the targeted bacteria.
Suicide switch
When the job is done and all the bad guys are finished, you don't need a super hero anymore. So after fulfilling my work I say goodbye to the world by activating my suicide switch.
Application
Of course"

Why Monitor Temperature?
In planetary exploration, monitoring temperature changes in the atmosphere is important for predicting weather patterns and atmospheric stability. At different heights above the planet’s surface, the temperature can vary drastically. The way that the temperature changes from hotter to cooler than back to hotter temperatures can be used to predict how weather and wind patterns will move across that region. This is helpful to know in planetary exploration because it can help predict the weather that various rovers or exploration outposts would have to deal with without relying on expensive satellite equipment. Additionally, the vertical temperature profile of a certain region of a planet’s atmosphere can be used to predict how easily a payload will fall through the atmosphere and land on the planet’s surface [1].
On Earth, vertical temperature profiles can be obtained using electronic temperature sensors mounted on weather balloons. These balloons go up to different heights in the atmosphere and relay real-time measurements of the atmospheric temperatures. While these electronics are easy to obtain and replace if they are broken on Earth, in the context of planetary exploration, they are irreplaceable and unreliable because it would take years to send replacements if they break and are impossible to fix without also sending replacement parts along the mission. Thus, a biological temperature sensor was developed in order to address these concerns. This biological temperature sensor can be expressed in a small culture of E. coli and be easily replaced simply by maintaining a culture of that particular bacteria.
In order to build a biological temperature sensor, we used chromogenic proteins from the DNA2.0 paintbox and from the iGEM registry (Figure 1)."

File:T--UT-Tokyo--Modeling--Fitting.zip
Result and Discussion
We inputted the data from the experiments mentioned above into our parameter fitting tool, but unfortunately, meaningful output was not acquired. For, when inputted the same data for several times, outputted parameters were different every time.
We considered that the result of this parameter fitting did not converge to a valid parameter set simply because there were too many unknown parameters to estimate from the finite amount of data. If we had conducted more experiment and obtained more data, there was a likelihood that the result of this parameter fitting converged to a certain set of parameters.
Parameters Estimation from Literature
We referred to the table below to decide parameters. Each literature showed various values. For this reason, we referred just the order of the parameters.

SYSU-Software,2017,Team:SYSU-Software#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," with researchers working in the lab, we were surprised that lack of ideas is one of the common problems when they work on a synthetic biology project.
Since ideas are so significant to a project, where do researchers’ ideas usually come from? We did a small survey of researchers in several labs. Check Integrated Human Practices page.
We learned that the majority of researchers’ idea source is professional research articles and journals, they work before, but a novel idea may arouse from them if the researcher reuses their essence and aims to an accessible direction. However, each paper usually describes its design in the author’s own style and standard, which is usually hard to understand and absorb its design ideas for one’s own creative work.
Inspirations of our project
How to come up with an idea or to trigger one’s inspiration is a challenge for us, because “inspiration” is such an abstract concept, and is hard to measure. But hope is still alive: several related previous works may create a new idea. To find out related projects and to guide users to a clearer direction, are what we consider to achieve in our software.
Learning related policies
Motivation
To know more policies which may affect our project, and to discuss the questions we don't understand in policies.
Practices
We searched the related safety policies on iGEM website. We got together and discussed any problems if we couldn't understand the policies. Especially, we discussed the biosafety issues and different risk groups.
Inspirations on our project
The risk group of chassis is one of the safety standards to assess the chassis. Besides, whether a part is attached to ""Red Flag"" tag or not is another way iGEM uses. As an intact software for synthetic biology, S-Din should engage this function.
Figure3: We are discussing biology safety.
Consulting the Biosafety and Ethics Advisor
Motivation
How to guide the public attention to bioethics and biosafety is the urgent need before we design and develop our project. We are particularly concerned about one question:
What are biosafety risks easily ignored by us in a virtual genetic design in the computer?
Practices
In September, our team visited Prof. He Zhumei, a biosafety advisor from Biosafety Committee of Sun Yat-sen University. He not only researches biology but also devotes to guiding the public to bioethics and biosafety.

Weronika Krzynowek is twenty-one years old
She's polite and always does as she's told
For a girl her age, she's considerate and nice
But she wants to be just like she's throwing the dice
She doesn't mind living with her sister, dog, and cats
Though she'd rather share a home with spiders and bats
There she could reflect on the horrors she has invented
and wander dark hallways alone and tormented
But imagines dipping her in wax for his wax museum
He likes to experiment on her dog Abocrombie
In the hopes of creating a horrible zombie
So that he and her horrible zombie dog

Her thoughts aren't only of ghoulish crime
He likes to paint and read to pass some of the time
While other kids read books like ""Go Jane Go""

TSAI,LU-AN
Day 2
At the second day of the camp, we prepared a lecture for introducing the future development of synthetic biology; at this day we aimed to let the students know some basic knowledge as well as the competition methods of iGEM and how we did the experiments.
We did our best to introduce many contents in easy way. However, Mr. Tsai captured the students’ attention by his humorous speech, so that he turned the abstract and hard molecular biology concept in an easy way. Moreover, students also took their notes hard. At the end, they could totally get into the profound of the synthetic biology. Pearl introduced many interesting applications of synthetic biology and amazed the students. They also contributed some interesting ideas during the Q&A time.
We answered students’ questions anytime anywhere and helped them catch the main concepts of the synthetic biology.Overall, we first introduced the development of the synthetic biology,then the origin, the competition and where the iGEM competition is held.
Then, we talked about some basic biobricks to yield our target proteins, and introduced the functions and properties of the enzymes that were usually used.
In order to let students have more complete experimental structure, we designed a cyclic illustration to represent the relations of each step, and introduced each experiments contents and necessities by simple words.  In order to allow students clearly understand the concepts and methods of the synthetic biology, we edited some basic introduction and easy examples into the handouts. So they could understand the course easily as well as do exercises right away to test them whether they really understood what we had taught in the class. Because most of them were year 2 Senior high students and part of them were year 3 Senior high students, their background knowledge were different. As a result, we needed to make year 2 Senior high students understand but would not be too easy for year 3 Senior high students. And it was also a challenge for us to edit the handouts. Finally, we chose some examples like the regulator mechanism of the lactose, the fluorescence mark of the protein, etc. These were all questions we wanted to test them, and we hoped that they could learn a lot from the courses.
Day 4
On the fourth day of biotech-camp, we prepared special half-day experimental course for students experience to the experimental techniques which our team used frequently: bacteria culture, plasmid extraction,"

In response to this, an interesting biology or genetics fact pops up every time the game is played.     In this way the player is constantly exposed to synthetic biology in easily digestible chunks which may inspire them to study the area further. In the early stages of development the app was reasonably confusing to play for the first time and left some ambiguities about the point of our project.     An easy way to fix this was with the introduction of an interactive tutorial.     Now it is much more accessible to new players and is far more meaningful in explaining our project. Some people who had been playing the game since its initial release on the store eventually came to find the game too easy. As such, we decided to add a game mechanic whereby the player not only had to catch ions out of the water, but also had to catch nutrient molecules in order to avoid starvation.     This simple tweak made the game much harder and more intense, keeping experienced players interested.
Open Day
One of the best opportunities for feedback we had was during the University of Exeter open day on September 2nd.    As part of the public outreach for this project, three team members represented iGEM at the open day.    It was not only a great chance to talk to prospective students and their families about the opportunities offered by the university, but also to talk about our project and intentions. Primed in the teaching lab with a few demonstrations of our filtration system we received lots questions, feedback and encouragement.    Firstly, we explained a bit about the iGEM competition as many of the people approaching us were unfamiliar     with it. We then proceeded to explain the project and the inspiration behind it. After answering their questions     we asked them if they were willing to try our app. Intrigued, everyone one asked said yes. The feedback we received was very consistent, with the general consensus being that it positively helped to visualise our project and that it was very enjoyable; with many people commenting on the cute concept and good music.    However, we also took on board some constructive criticism at the same time. The graphics seemed quite underwhelming, there were a handful of technical difficulties and – partially due to the nutrient mechanic mentioned previously- the game was quite difficult to play for beginners. With this feedback in mind, we made a concentrated effort to reflect and act on the improvements they suggested.    Firstly, we consulted an illustrator and commissioned some new graphics to improve the look of the game.    The technical difficulties were fixed and the game was split into two separate modes.

Just to see everyone create artwork with living organisms instead of paper and pencil and to get people excited about Synthetic Biology and the iGEM competition is amazing. This night we brought our mission to Mars a little bit closer again and reached for the stars.
September 20th - Safe by Design conference
The National Institute for Public Health invited us to get engaged with them on the topic of Safe by Design. In a series of meetings and finally this public conference, the issues regarding safety and thereby necessary regulations in this highly new field of science were explored together with the other iGEM teams from the Netherlands. Much more on this topic and the results of these sessions can be found at our Safe by Design page ./p>
Oktober 17th 2016 - Performance @ The Museon
The Museon in The Hague is a popular scientific museum. They are currently building a new permanent exhibition, called One World, where the hot topics in science should also be included. We approached the museum to ask whether they were planning to include the promising field of synthetic biology, and whether we could contribute to this. Since building a museum exhibit isn’t something that can be achieved in a couple of months - let alone be financed - we decided together to organize a public lecture on this topic instead. Whereas doctor Bertus Beaumont from TU Delft told all about the techniques and approaches involved in this highly new field of science, we are allowed to inspire the public with the broad variety of applications, mostly focussing on one of the hottest-topics right now: space exploration.

Ashlee videotaped Clay and Sam's presentation to the Science-U highschoolers.
Worked on presentation and put finishing touches on the slides. Prepared activities and set up room in 11 Life Sciences. The presentation went extremely well. We had a well behaved group of kids and it was nice to be able to see some of the faces that I (Sam) have been working with all summer. They really enjoyed it and we got free t-shirts for our time. I think we may have inspired a few people to become future scientists! Purification of yesterday's digestion product, ligation, transformation, plating.
Wednesday, July 30, 2014
Ashlee picked 2 colonies from the L6 plate for overnight growth to make cryogenic storage and to plasmid prepare. We are going to save the original L6 plasmid as long as possible because it was sequence confirmed. Emily digested the Lambda Red Recombinase system with XbaI and ClaI restriction enzymes.
No colonies observed again, so the transformation was redone using the initial ligated G4 (7/16) and the one that was prepared previously this week. Sequencing results from Monday confirm G2.3 and G3.3 as correct.
Thursday, July 31, 2014
Ashlee and Emily plasmid prepped one of the previously picked colonies.  This was then digested with XbaI and ClaI so the Lambda Red Recombinase system could be inserted.  The other picked colony was used to make cryogenic stock for potential use later.  A Rescue PCR was done on overlap region 3 and ran on a gel for purification. All 4 PCR reactions failed.
There were several colonies on the plate that were transformed with the old G4 ligation, but only 2 on the plate that had the new G4 ligation. Two (2) colonies from each plate were chosen and inoculated so that could be mini-prepped tomorrow. Cultures inoculated with streaks from G2.3 and G3.3 for preparing cryo stocks. Four cultures inoculated with G5.4 (from 7/18 plating) to"

iGEM Japan is an organization which was founded last year for iGEM teams in Japan to cooperate each other.
In March, iGEM Kyoto held iGEM-Japan West meeting. In this meeting, we shared each team's project and advised each other. This meeting was very useful because we could find our idea's weak point.
In August, iGEM TMU-Tokyo held iGEM-Japan East meeting, and we made presentations about our projects and criticized each other. Thanks to these meetings, we developed quality of our projects.

Overview
From ethical codes, we examined whether our projects and their application can be sanctioned. However, “ETHICS” is not steadfast rather mutable. Each SOCIETY, RELIGION, and CULTURE, which one belongs to, ingrains us what we call “ETHICS.” Even in the same society, religion, and culture, a slight difference among educational levels and living situations lets us have nonidentical moral values. Being in such dissimilarity, researchers must take the diverse values into consideration in order to justify their researches and applications.
The regulation including the law, which is standardized from prevailed beliefs and ethical values among the society, permits individual’s act unless violating others’ rights. We deduced that the regulation is involved with attitudes toward the research along with various ethical values. It is essential for each iGEM member to understand and comply with the law, regulations, and guidelines which are determined by international organizations and domestic government agencies.
However, it is difficult for undergraduate students such as iGEM members to fully understand these laws, regulations, and guidelines and apply them to their projects. Here, we edited a brief version of the complicated matters for other members. We also assessed our current projects in terms of their safety and risks, which can be caused by their application, and then we clarified that our anticipated risks would not surpass our risk management"

E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2 and E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2(66-575) were cultivated in a total volume of 3 mL at 37 °C and 130 rpm. The growth difference between the two strains observed in previous cultivations could also be observed in this experiment carried out by the team from Florence. E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2 reached a final OD600 of 0.329 ± 0.037 while E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2(66-575) reached a final OD600 of 0.664 ± 0.033.
The results obtained by iGEM team UNIFI validate our results, since the same difference in growth can be observed between the truncated version PtNTT2(66-575) and PtNTT2. Also in a 96 well plate, E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2 reached only 49.5 % of the final cell density of E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2(66-575) (40.2 % for the cultivation carried out in 12 well plates). After 27 hours, the final OD600 of the strain carrying the full-length version of PtNTT2 was 0.329 ± 0.037, while the final OD600 of the strain expressing the truncated version PtNTT2(66-575) was 0.664 ± 0.033. These results clearly indicate that it is highly beneficial for higher cell densities and better growth to cultivate in larger well plates. Furthermore, shaking at higher frequencies"

TO DO
research the topic you have chosen until the next meeting in 2 weeks! (enzymes, sequences, sources etc.)
Wednesday April 4th
Overview
The main aim of the meeting was to collect all information we gained and to know how we will move on in the laboratory. In some points we are able to order BioBricks already, but nevertheless more information are needed.
People: Volker, Georg, Jeffrey, Mary, Simon, David, Ingmar
Human Resources / General topics
19 Members are in the list (Wiki) and as soon as the semester starts (next meeting) hopefully everyone can come to the meetings.
We will need a brewer -> Georg will ask Hr. Zankhof if some students of his group are interested and Georg will also send an email at the 'Studienkoordination Brauwesen' if some like to join our group. Nevertheless: Does anyone of you know a brewer-student?? Please keep that in mind. Same with Product-&Mediendesign, does anyone knows a student in this field? Will be very helpful in a couple of weeks!
On the Mailing list, everybody of the wiki-list is included (thanks to Fabian) - you already got an email. Fabian will also create an iGem-Emailadress.
Please register at the iGEM-Homepage ! See also the link on the main page (registration on iGEM) After everybody registered, Prof. Skerra will accept us and the team is complete (so no code is needed).
Prof. Skerra ordered an computer for us, it will be in the lab of Prof. Skerra. He also recommends to use the program APE for DNA editing.
On the  Saturday we will work together (remember the doodle), Volker will give us a basic introduction of how to check if the BioBricks we like to order for our experiments are okay and working.
Projects

Questions
What’s the shape of the growth curve under normal growth condition?
What the impact if the lethal effect is considered?
What is the time to turn on the RNA temperature switch?
What happened if the cooling system was removed?
Build the normal cell growth model
Build the growth model with the lethal effect considered
Build a model which can be used to predict the temperature change tendency
Fig. 14 the red curve shows the result with the lethal effect considered, the blue curve shows the normal logistic growth result.
The initial inoculation amount of this model is 1 unit. The proposed intrinsic rate is 0.05. And we set the maximum number of cells that the environment can support is 100 units. As can be seen from the simulation , from 0 to 200 units of time, the number of cells are in a growth state in both cases, no lethal effect is greater than the growth rate of cells in the presence simulation lethal effect of simulations; after 200 units of time, two kinds of simulations have tended to steady state, the growth of non-lethal effects of simulated results of the final number of the environment can accommodate the largest state, while the presence of the number of lethal effect of significantly less than the maximum number of steady-state simulation results is about 90 units.
Fig.15 time evolution of heat accumulated in the fermenter
We could get the information that the heat in the fermenter will accumulate over time without a cooling system from the above figure. Once the cooling system was turned on, a steady state could be achieved as shown in the figure above.

Gel electrophoresis of Raida's PCR products: BBK primers that anneal before the multiple cloning sites. Lane 4 and 5 : Lux0047 A + B0015 psB1AK3 Lane 6: J23002 + Lux0047E, Lane7: R0040 + I3502, Lane 8: Lux0047E, Lane 9: Master Mix
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of Chris's CpxP colony PCR in plasmid form. The gel was allowed to run for one hour and it did not move from 25 minutes to 1 hour.
Raida
Today I set up and ran two 1% gels: one for my PCR products from yesterday and the second one for Emily's PCR products- both of which were done to test whether our primers are working or not. Please see the gel to the side: As we can see in the gel electrophoresis image, the expected results has been obtained. For example, Lane 8 contains only the Lux0047E gene where as Lane 6 has J23002 + Lux0047E, hence the band in Lane 8 goes slightly further relative to Lane 6 because it is a shorter band. Lane 7 shows no band because the primers did not and was not supposed to anneal to the site because R0040 + I3502 was in a standard plasmid from this year and has a different sequence than all the 4 other plasmids that were used for this particular PCR. The primers are not complimentary to the sequence of the plasmids being used this year. So the fact that Lane  7 shows no band means there was no amplification- so the result is positive. Lanes 4 and 5 show exactly the same band because they are the same genes in the same plasmid backbone. Furthermore, Lane 9 shows no band because it is the Master Mix and our negative control. Therefore,"
UNITS_Trieste,2011,Team:UNITS Trieste#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," signals (OC8 and OC12, respectively). This assay, which gave good results, showed that these constructs coding for an AHL-inducible beta-glucosidase allow bacteria to survive in a glucose free medium supplied with cellobiose alone. Finally, we also tested our bacteria for the production of AHL on thin layer chromatography.
8th Week (15–21 August)
Analyses on the eukaryotic construct showed some errors in its sequence due to an incorrect excision of the CMVie sequence. We then set out to reassemble the construct from the start.
The bacterial construct A0-RFP was cloned in the pSB1K3 vector. After transforming DH5α bacteria with this plasmid, bacteria were newly made competent in order to successively transform them with a second plasmid containing A1-A2. Meanwhile we tried to ligate the constructs B2 and B3 together.
9th Week (22–28 August)
We finished working on our eukaryiotic construct containing a Trabox-CMVmin sequence followed by the synthetic sBLA cloned into pIRES2-EGFP lacking the constitutive CMVie.
Doing some assays to evaluate the communication between bacteria and HeLa cells we successfully obtained eukaryotic responsivity to the prokaryotic lactones, but had some problems with the co-culture of the two type of cells.
The construct B1-GFP was cloned into pSB1K3, meanwhile we ligated the glucosidase to a new constitutive promoter, in order to further test its activity.
10th Week (29 August – 4 September)
The completed eukaryotic construct (Trabox-CMVmin-sBLA-IRES-GFP) was correctly verified with a series of control digestions and through DNA sequencing. HeLa cells positive to the cotransfection of this construct and the transactivator p65-TraR were isolated through FACS, in order to try and expand a stable cell line.
We successfully ligated the bacterial constructs A1 with A2 and B2 with B3. The constructs A1-A2 and B2-B3 thus obtained were cloned into a pBBR vector, while we also transformed competent bacteria with either A0-RFP or B1-GFP (the beta-glucosidase coding constructs with the respective reporter). These bacteria were then made competent again, in preparation of their further transformation with either A1-A2 or B2-B3.

We’ve made a lot of mistakes along the way so I don’t know if I trust research and peoples’ judgment. (I explained to her that domesticating animals is a way we’ve done this in the past, to which she responded…) I think all that would’ve naturally fallen into place anyways. Dogs really do love humans and they need to connect with a pack. Horses, if they really didn’t want to be trained, I don’t know if you could train them. Whereas, I believe they feel good when they’re serving a purpose as well. So I think those connections would’ve happened automatically. I don’t know if we can take complete credit for those modifications. I guess what I’m thinking is more that horses were the size of a dog and they evolved into the size they are today. I don’t know. I’m all for research certainly, but there’s also the question how far will it go. Is that going to be to evolve to the perfect human? And whose perception is the perfect human?""”

Methodology
How We Designed the Technology
User Based Approach
ISO Standards
To build the best device possible we took a professional approach to our design and development processes.
User Based Approach
The L.A.S.S.O. is more than just the development of an idea; we wanted to see whether this device could be realistically implemented in practice. To create a product that had a future in a real-world situation we decided it was vital to talk first to the people who would be using it: the patients and the CF healthcare team  - people  who understand the daily struggles and realities of treating Cystic Fibrosis. So we took a customer based approach by meeting with patients and medical staff to hear their view on how the L.A.S.S.O. should be designed to best meet their needs.
ISO Standards
After obtaining a clear direction for our device from potential users, we spoke to representatives from relevant industries. In particular we contacted a local company that developed medical equipment; the Institute of Medical Science and Technology . We were informed that the main body for devising procedures by which medical devices should be built is the International Organisation of Standards (ISO). As we live in a global community where such standards are important to ensure that “products and services are safe, reliable and of good quality”1 there are strict procedures that must be adhered to. During the development of the L.A.S.S.O. we attempted to apply as many of the points given in the quality management standards 9001 and"
UT-Tokyo,2015,Team:UT-Tokyo#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," and allow for those ideas to enter the mainstream.
It'is a product derived from their hard work and knowledge, thus deserve protección.
If it is not secured, somebody might use it for bad things.
Patent helps protect the right of inventor(s) from being violated.
There is no reason why denying patent filings.
NO(excerpt)
Patents represent a barrier to the sharing of knowledge, which is socially produced. They tend to distort the responses of research centers,                       universities and industries towards social needs, since they encourage the development of profitable technologies instead of prioritizing human                       needs. This is clear, for example, when we look for the existing disparity among researches dealing with diseases affecting poor countries and   those                       dealing with diseases affecting rich populations in the global north. Synthetic Biology should be open for all, avoiding big industrial groups to   rely                       on their patents to avoid other social actors to develop researches in the field in an open source way. Far from encouraging developments in the   field,                       patents lead to a logic of ""the winner takes it all"", especially when one consider the ""building block"" structure of Syntethic Bilogy.
They have not invented anything, they are playing with life.
Because the main reason for patenting are economical, so no one else can exploit the invention, and there are many inventions such as this one   that are a great breakthrough in science and should be exploited by other people to see its                       capabilities and should no be used only for economical reasons.
All discoveries should be shared to facilitate further researches.
They took effort to make that happen. They deserve a reward.
Knowledge with good purposes should be free.
NOT SURE(excerpt)
I am not an expert on the subject, and I do not know the impact of a technology being patentable.
Method itself should be patentable because it is their invention. But created bacterium should not be patentable.

Liquid-air
Floating pellicles
The effect of the surface on the biofilm phenotype
Since (by definition) liquid-air pellicles cannot be grown on a solid strength-providing carrier material, they are uninteresting for our project. The solid-air type is the most well-known and can be grown on a simple agar plate. This is convenient, but our setup is nothing like an agar plate, and it is not clear that a biofilm grown on a solid-air interface can cope with the water flow in our setup. The solid-liquid type has the advantage of living at the right kind of surface, but is difficult to grow. In our project we tried growing both the biofilms on the solid-air and on the solid-liquid interface. We found that the solid-air type biofilms were strongest and therefore most suitable for our application.
Different states of Bacillus subtilis
The Bacillus subtilis that is used in our project is able to form a biofilm naturally. However not every Bacillus subtilis with the same genotype is in the biofilm state. One Bacillus subtilis strain knows different behaviours or states. For example, a bacterium can swim around freely, which is called the planktonic state. But B. subtilis can also form spores, or work together in a biofilm community. This biofilm state aids in the survival of the bacteria under harsh conditions.  A biofilm originates from one or more bacteria that adhere to a surface. By growing in aggregates and producing an extracellular matrix of polymeric substances, a complex community of microbiological life is established. In the biofilm every bacterium has its own role in maintaining the community. Although these bacteria have the same DNA, they express different genes. This phenotypic heterogeneity is the result of certain genetic pathways being activated. When a biofilm matures, some cells start to express different genes and divert into a planktonic state. In this planktonic state the bacterium becomes motile and starts to disperse into the environment. From this planktonic state a new biofilm can be formed by only a few bacteria. The bacteria once again start to change their gene expression and start to express matrix genes to form a biofilm (Vlamakis et al., 2013).
Engineering the biofilm state
Our project requires a stable, robust biofilm. To accomplish this we need to fix the cells in the biofilm (matrix) producing phenotype. The phenotype of Bacillus subtilis is determined by the activity of different genetic pathways. A"

Error-prone PCR
Similar with Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), error-prone PCR is also a powerful method to produce linear DNA fragments, but results in random mutagenesis. This mutagenic PCR, which introduces random mutations by reducing the fidelity of the DNA polymerase. This process is similar to standard PCR cloning of a target sequence except that, for constructing a diverse mutagenesis library, a much larger pool of transformants are needed to increase the diversity of the library, making the process tedious and inefficient. As a result, various processes have been developed to streamline the methods.
The process of mutating P-atp2 is cockamamie, when it does not require excellent skill of experiment or advanced technology. Even though there are several ways to change the reaction condition, we finally chose to put manganese ion into our error-prone reaction system. So our error-prone PCR was performed in 25 μL reaction solution (Table.1).

Measurement of enzyme activity
To verify the promoters after the error-prone PCR, we used LacZ alpha, encoding the enzyme β-galactosidase with LacZ beta, as a report gene to reflect the ability of promoters. With the purpose of high throughput screening promoters, we measured them on the 96-well cell plate. As these bacteria grew normally and the OD600 was up to 1.5, we lysed cells, then"

Temperatur measurements of BPUL at 10°C and 25°C. Measurements were done via optical density 420 nm.
Today we started another exciting measurement. Today was all about temperatures. Through our cooperation with the clarification plant we found out that the waster water here in Germany has a minimal temperature of 10°C throughout the year. We used this value together with our previous measurements at 25°C to complete the temperature gradient of our measurements. Eventhough ECOL shows an increased activity at 10°C, it does reach a comparable OD value as the samples measured at 25°C. The increased activity is expressed by achieving the maximal OD420 slower than the laccase measured at 25°C. This seems like good news for Team Modeling. On the other hand BPUL shows nearly the same great activity at 10°C as at 25°C. Of course the reaction is a bit slower, but nevertheless the saturation is reached after 3 hours.

Our project is focused on fundamental issues related to measurement and computation in cells. For our Human Practices work, we decided to educate people about our project. For which, we made a game, Codonut, which describes codon preference in a fun way. Apart from this, we pondered over what avenue we should direct our energies for human practices and public outreach. We settled on Genetically Modified foods for several reasons, the most important being the raging debate ongoing in our country over certain crops like GM mustard and the impact it would have on agriculture and farmers. In order to understand the current scenario of GM technology in India and the conflict between anti-GM activists versus current government, we decided to understand the issue from technical and political point of view.
GMO In India
Survey
Agriculture is demographically the broadest economic sector in India which accounts for approximately 13.7% GDP and 50% of the workforce (approx. 600 mil). The conventional technology currently in usage is not self-sufficient for the ever-growing population. It also requires usage of pesticides and insecticides which deteriorates the environment. Owing to the GM crops' high productivity, low pesticides and insecticides usage, drought resistance and high nutritional quality, we took the task of exploring more about the GM technology and creating awareness on both the fronts, pros and cons.
Currently in India, 93% of cotton grown is Bt cotton. There are several crops including rice, maize, mustard etc. are under field trials, with a huge ongoing debate scrutinizing its biosafety levels. For a new GM crop to be introduced, it has to go through many regulatory processes by the government.
Since most of the population is unaware about GM technology, we tried to understand the advantages and disadvantages of GM crops along with how it is tested for safety in India. This prompted us to investigate GMO related issues by reaching out to it's stakeholders, general public (consumers and farmers), NGOs and regulatory authorities. Our objectives were to answer following questions:
1. What percent of general public have heard of GMO and are aware of it's economical, technical and political implications?
2. What is the perception of public regarding the consumption of GM foods?
3. What do people believe as better in GM patenting regime of the country?
4. What makes a person opt for GM food consumption? Is it better knowledge and understanding of GM?
Considering these, we designed our survey. We conducted our survey in"

Because the results of the above experiment were surprising, I repeated some of it using cells that had been pelleted from 8/4 and 8/3 (AE Blue only) and had remained on the lab bench in a sealed falcon tube. As I did before, I put 20 uL of clumped cells and 1 uL of .134M EDTA into a PCR tube. As before I heated the PCR tubes to 70 °C for 1 hour, and as before Cupid Pink turned purple. (pictured below)

Note: the blue that both AE blue and Blitzen Blue now appear looks identical to the blue the AE Blue on the previous test turned. These color changes are not reversible.
●
While it is now unclear what is causing the chromoproteins to change their color, it is appearing more likely that it has something to do with the denaturation of the protein.  This makes sense in context of some of the papers I have been reading about chromoprotein structure. For instance, http://www.jbc.org/content/281/49/37813.long (Structural Characterization of a Blue Chromoprotein and Its Yellow Mutant from the Sea AnemoneCnidopus Japonicus. Mitchell C. Y.

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Cholera - Detection_-_-_TEXT.html," that the species of cholera that we were to work with be of those two serotypes. Dr. Grose explained that bacteria are grouped serotyped based upon how our immune system reacts to them. It isn’t important what serotype cholera is, because any type will make a biofilm. Also, if the biofilm is removed, any type can be destroyed by stomach acid.  Questions to Research:  What is the composition of the biofilm in Cholera? Exopolysaccharides (EPS) are a principal building block. EPS in most species has a negative charge and is (thus not surprisingly) chlorine resistant. What other components are there? Has anything successfully degraded its biofilm? We know of multiple papers that document biofilm reduction in seemingly every species BUT cholera, but we have failed to find any that is cholera-specific.
March 15th- Whitney Hoopes -Compared research articles/data gathered for ideas on how to destroy the cholera biofilm -Quorum sensing is the regulation of gene expression in response to fluctuations in cell-population density. Quorum sensing bacteria produce and release chemical signal molecules called autoinducers that increase in concentration as a function of cell density. The detection of a minimal threshold stimulatory concentration of an autoinducer leads to an alteration in gene expression. Use quorum sensing to trigger transcription of genes that turn on and produce enzyme transcripts to degrade the biofilm? -Reviewed research papers and reviews to gather ideas and plan what genes to clone in -Discussed genes we researched: Dispersin (DspB) 106/107 Aiia 109/110---B. subtilis CytR 111/112 Deoxyribonuclease 113/114---B. subtilis Subtilisin sowirlane 115/116---B. subtilis Apple favonoid 117/118 Nuclease NuCB 119/120 Dnase 1 121/122 Amylase (AmyA) 123/124 Biofilm targets Holin endolysin 129/130 Anti-LPS 125/126 (bacteria target) Out of biofilm ChapK

SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT-China#criticalThinking_-_-_TEXT.html," its departments working under it and these regulations are classified into administrative laws and regulations and/or Departmental rules, it’s not so possible for the regulations to work as powerfully and compulsively as law made by People's Congress.
Limited by the development of government department, these regulations were put more emphases in principle of legality instead of practical operating. For example, as stated in Human genetic resources management interim measures, research and development institutions in our country shall enjoy the exclusive ownership of human genetic resources information within the territory of China, including important genetic genealogy and genetic resources like data, materials and samples from specific areas and without permission, no one should transfer the possession of this information to others. Actually, where we should come for permission is still puzzlement.
Meanwhile, shortage of compound talents with gene science background and legal professional knowledge and ability is another obstruction that impedes the development of gene technology legislation research. During the conversation with Prof. Zhou, she mentioned several times that she has not enough talents to carry out more researches in gene legislation, for life science itself is difficult for professional students to understand and it’s easy to picture a law school student without life science background is pressed up against the wall unsurprisingly when he/she try goes deep into research.
The Chinese law concerning gene is permissive.
It’s more common to regulate gene therapy by administrative laws and regulations in China, such as technical guidelines for Gene therapy research and preparation quality control, which is not powerful enough to regulate gene therapy systematically, a rapidly developing and changing subject, for its temporality and contingent character.
Legal remedy problem is another theme that China must face in the field of bioscience. Technical guideline is just rules or instructions that are given by the official organization telling you how to do something, especially something difficult, and it is not equal to law that has the power to compulsively urge people to abbey. When the infringement happens, it’s the law, not the guideline to cope with the problem during the lawsuits.
To summarize, laws in our country China is permissive and patchy and we need to learn from counties with thorough law system and to do research to seek out the compatible pattern in biology to avoid potential accidents and disasters buried under gene editing and therapy.
C. Suggestion for Legislation in China
What should the Chinese government do?
Government can choose to compile a specialized legislation for gene technology including the gene therapy and gene editing so as to systematically regulate and promote academic research and market practice. And at the same time, there should be a specialized department with specialized talents in charge of gene technology for professional supervision.

Final Test
Verify the function of monitoring antioxidants in                         real time
Our engineered yeast should finally have the function of monitoring antioxidants in real time.                         To demonstrate this, we integrated the two subsystems together into ∆yca1 yeast and had series                         of tests on it, in which the increasing of ROS in yeast can be effectively captured by our                         roGFP2-Orp1 protein.
In order to regulate endogenous ROS, we replaced yeast endogenous YNO1 promotor with a                         galactose-inducible promotor, GAL1-GAL10. We then constructed the plasmid                         pESC-TEF1p-roGFP2-Orp1-CYC1t, a shuttle vector marked with trp1. Cellular redox status were                         monitored by measuring the fluorescence ratio at 488 nm (reduced state) and 405 nm (oxidized                         state). Cells were cultured in SD medium supplemented with 1% galactose at 30℃, during which                         GAL1-GAL10 promotor was induced when galactose added. It suggests that overexpression of yno1 gene will increase cells ROS level and decline the fluorescence ratio at 488 nm and 405 nm,                         which means there are more ROS in our modified strain.
As the results showing, our output subsystem can reflect the accumulation of endogenous ROS                         caused by regulator subsystem.
Fig.1 Intracellular ROS accumulation.
The red curve indicates the fluorescence ratio at 488 nm (reduced state) and 405 nm (oxidized                         state) of engineered yeast which overexpressed Yno1 and constructed the plasmid                         pESC-TEF1p-roGFP2-Orp1-CYC1t. And the blue curve indicates the fluorescence ratio at 488 nm                         (reduced state) and 405 nm (oxidized state) of engineered yeast"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,". The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace"

Our team met at the Domplatte in Cologne at 11 am and together with the iGEM teams from Bielefeld, Bonn and Aachen as well as hundreds of other (non-iGEM) participants marched
2 kilometres
(
1.24 miles
) downtown to the Rudolfsplatz. On the way there several interested people stopped and listened to our slogans for free science.
At the Rudolfsplatz a lot of speeches and talks from a variety of journalists, physicists and biologists, like Ranga Yogeshwar and Mark Benecke were given. We discussed fakes news and biased data of governmental proclamations as well as the repression of scientific work. An additional important aspect was the responsibility of the scientific community in representing themselves to the general public. Therefore the work of science journalists is very important for public relations. Some of the speeches picked out the working conditions of German scientists regarding permanent employment and resulting problems in life balance and family planning.
The speeches at the event were very informative and showed how important it is to be well received by the public. This event was the reason why our team decided to put more effort into public relations."

Given Sam's great enthusiasm for space, we started exploring it in greater detail as a team. We tried combining some of the other ideas with space exploration and discussed different ways that synthetic biology could help with the long journey to the next planet/system/galaxy. This is where we also started exploring Fred's idea of using Shewanella oneidensis (""Shewy"") as a long term food or energy source in space. It was interesting during these early stages of the project, for the biochemists as least to puzzle over some unfamiliar aspects of biochemistry and see how we could incorporate them into our project. However, at times we were too bio heavy, perhaps lacking a focus on the engineering aspects of what we're trying to achieve. Instead of approaching things from an engineer's perspective, targeted on making a design that works with as few original ideas as possible (to loosely quote Freeman Dyson), we fully went down the biochemist's route of 1) a wacky idea, 2) lots of wacky idea discussion and finally 3) does this actually work?

THE HUNT: BACTERIA STYLE
Bacteria mean business. The swarm growing from the left, Myxococcus xanthus, hunt their prey by spreading as what scientists call a biofilm aka ""bacterial slime"".
Biofilms can form virtually anywhere. Not only are they responsible for dental plaque, the muck on the inside of fish tanks and the slime on recently fresh fruit, they are also involved in up to 80% of all the microbial infections that we acquire.
They are responsible for causing urinary tract infections (UTIs), the most common infection acquired at hospital. Streptococcus pneumonia make biofilms and cause pneumonia. Biofilm infections lead to chronic wounds. Most permanent indwelling medical devices, such as joint prosthetics and heart valves, will have a biofilm community growing on them. Biofilms are behind a whole host of medical, industrial and environmental problems that are very costly and technically challenging to remedy.
In nature, the majority of bacteria are not free-living; instead they are found associated in these biofilms, ingenius living environments made by the microorganisms to aid their growth - and their assault on other living things.
Such an environment serves as a shelter from which the bacteria can launch their attack, whether it be on the urinary tract, the lungs of a cystic fibrosis patient or the various plants and pipelines for aquaculture. And such"

In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.

Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

PCR of LuxOD47E in psB1AC3 with gene-specific primers
Objective: To verify the presence of LuxOD47E in the psB1AC3 vector.  If our gene of interest is biobricked and in the psB1AC3 vector, than we can proceed with construction.
Protocol: Made 9x mastermix with 45 μL 10x PCR Buffer, minus Mg2+, 9 μL 10 mM dNTPs, 13.5  μL 50 mM MgCl2, 1.8 μL p Taq DNA Polymerase, 9  μL LuxO-R primer, 9  μL LuxO-F primer and 344.7  μL ddH2O.  Split Mastermix into the  tubes, 49  μL in each.  Put 1  μL BBK LuxOD47E C1 DNA template into 2 tubes, 1 μL BBK LuxOD47E C2 DNA template into two tubes, 1 μL LuxOD47E TOPO 2 tubes (positive contorol) and 1  μL ddH2O into two tubes for a negative control.
Ran PCR with the folowing cycling conditions: 94°C for 3 minutes, 36x (94°C for 30 s, 53°C for 45 s and 72°C for 90 s), 72°C for 10 minutes.  Held at 4°C.
Results: Ran both the restriction digest and the PCR product on a 1% agarose gel at 120 V with 2 μL Orange 10X dye.  Ran the restriction digest with uncut plasmid as  positive control.
Lane 1- BBK LuxOD47E  C1 digested Lane 2- C1 uncut Lane 3- BBK LuxOD47E C2 digested Lane 4- C2 uncut Lane 5- LuxOD47E BBK- C1 Lane 6- LuxOD47E BBK- C2 Lane 7- LuxOD47E TOPO (Positive Control) Lane 8- Negative Control
Analysis:  Looking at the PCR Products, it looks extremely likely that the gene of interest, LuxOD47E, is in the psB1ACM vector, as the bands in the two BBK lanes match up with the band in the TO"

Why iGEM?
I’ve been fascinated about biology for as long as I can remember, having been influenced by my Grandfather’s passion for the subject from a young age. University opened my mind to a wide range of biological subjects and I have taken interest in the microbial, genetic, and evolutionary disciplines. Having these interests naturally drew me to the iGEM project, which I saw as an ideal opportunity to not only broaden my mind on a wide range of innovative practices, but also to experience the day to day world of biological research.
Future career ideas
If the right opportunity arises after my degree I would relish the chance to enter into biological research myself; however, the education of children in science is a subject close to my heart and I would love to pursue a career in teaching.
Interests/Hobbies
Outside of biology and university I am a passionate musician and football fan.

Why iGEM?
I applied to the iGEM team as I wanted to develop my scientific skills as well as challenge myself in areas that I had no expertise in for example, the Wiki, and Human Practices.  I have been interested in science since I was a child and as I grew, I developed an interest in microbiology; our project utilises microbiology which is what grabbed me.  The iGEM competition itself is very well regarded and of a high academic standard which will allow me to excel in my future scientific career.
Future career ideas
I am fascinated by bacterial pathogenesis and infection and immunity so I hope to spend my career in that field of microbiology.  I have spent some time in hospitals in the past and wish to eventually work in the health sector so I can give back some of the fantastic treatment I received whilst in hospital.

When I’m not sitting on the sofa or at my part-time job, my spare time is usually spent playing Ultimate Frisbee!
