FAFU-CHINA,2016,Team:FAFU-CHINA#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," to use Co-Immunoprecipitation(Co-IP) to confirm their interaction. Because PET30a has the His protein tag, we planned to add HA protein tag and Flag protein tag behind α-subunit and β-subunit respectively. The target gene was amplified by PCR and cloned to T-vector and sequenced. Then link the confirmed gene to PET30a (enzyme site: XhoI and HindIII). Transform the recombination vector into expression strains BL21 when the concentration of bacterium is appropriate (OD600 is 0.6-0.8). Induce the strains by 1mmol IPTG. By using ultrasonic waves to break the cell of strain and centrifuging, we obtain the deposit. To conduct the Co-Immunoprecipitation(Co-IP), we dealed with the inclusion body to get the protein.
12.Western Blot of tCas9-CIBN Expression (NEU-China)
When we receive help from NEU-China team to help us to get the confocal photo of eGFP express in Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii, we also helped them to repeat their induction experiment. We culture the BL21 strain which contained pBD024-tCas9-CIBN transformant under various concentration of arabinose induction for 16 hours in 30℃ environment. The induced concentrations are 4mM 10mM 15mM 15mM 15mM. To test the express result, we used Ha as first antibody and rabbit-anti in western blot. As the result showed in figure10, the best induced concentration is 15mM.

The promoter site of the luxR regulator plasmid piG0041 was mutated by QuikChange site-specific mutagenesis to produce promoters of different strength. The primers oiG0031 and oiG0032 were used to establish piG0047, a plasmid with a promoter of intermediate strength (J23111). Analoguos the primers oiG0033 and oiG0034 were used to construct piG0046,  a plasmid with a weak promoter (J23109). Competent cells were transformed with piG0046 and piG0047 and selected on ampicillin-LB-plates. The sequence was verified by Microsynth using the primers oig0035 and oiG0036.

Week 6: Project planning, Gibson assemblies planning, First Matlab simulations
Wednesday, July 2nd
We have a clear organization of the different experiments we would like to perform.
We want to optimize quorum sensing to have non-leaky non-cross-talking constructs. We want to prevent cross-talk between integrases and check their dynamics with different quorum sensing promoters. Then we will test the XOR gate without production of LuxI, to check how it works without the loop, and we will finally test our final construct with the loop, hoping that the delay between GFP production and the possible second switching due to AHL production is long enough to have enough fluorescence.
The red line is our critical timeline. Numbers of days are very optimistic,therefore we multiply the whole timeline by 2. The stars stand for modeling inputs.
Tasks organization with critical timeline in red.
We have also clear plans for the Gibson assemblies to perform. As an example, here is the plan for regulator plasmids :

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing"

Doctors’ View on Current Situation
Lung Cancer
● Early diagnosis is vital for lung cancer patients as only detection and surgery in the early stage can hold the possibility of cure. However, 2/3 of the patients are diagnosed too late and have already lost the chance of being cured. These un-surgery cases can be called as advanced lung cancer.
● Now numerous people blame the cause of lung cancer on environmental problems, but even in a good environment condition, the incidence of lung cancer is equally high. To some extent, it can be said that the leading cause of lung cancer is smoking.
● According to statistics of 2012, incidence of lung cancer has now made top of all cancer incidence in China, especially for male. Obvious correlation can be observed between smoking and lung cancer. And terribly, lung cancer maintains high mortality rate. The five-year survival rate of clinical lung cancer (i.e., the probability of the patients who still alive five years after diagnosis.) is approximately zero.
● Lung cancer patients stand for unbearable and excruciating pressure both physically and psychologically. There are also some severe complications along with lung cancer, resulting in plummeted life quality after the illness. For example, advanced patients may experience struggle when breathing, chest tightness, persistent cough, and that lung cancer can also be transferred to all other parts of the body, such as brain, bones, causing severe pain, intracranial hypertension, weakness and other symptoms.
Current Treating Situation
● There are 3 main treatments for advanced lung cancer: chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy.
● Before targeted drug therapy, advanced lung cancer patients have an average survival period that is no more than one year, and that with other means of therapy (e.g. Radiotherapy), the period can be extended for only 2 to 3 months. Chemotherapy certainly lead to a plummet of life quality of patients. Finally, most patients lose confidence and Survival consciousness during their cure.
Figure 5. Interview with doctor
Doctors’ view on the 4 treatments
● In the past few decades, molecular targeting drugs visibly elongated the patient's survival periods and improve the disease control. Recently, the so-called ""four carriages"" of cancer treatment are surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and molecular targeting drugs.
● Among the treatments of lung cancer, surgery is generally practiced on early patients. The early diagnosis rate of lung cancer, however, is relatively limited because all tumors had no specific symptoms at early stage. Therefore, rate of patients who are able to be performed surgery also take a minor part. To make matters worse, cancer"

Gold Medal Criterion #4
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your project works. There are many ways in which your project working could be demonstrated, so there is more than one way to meet this requirement. This gold medal criterion was introduced in 2016, so check our what 2016 teams did to achieve a their gold medals!
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
What should we do for our demonstration?
Standard teams
If you have built a proof of concept system, you can demonstrate it working under real world conditions. If you have built a biological device that is intended to be a sensor, can you show it detecting whatever it is intended to sense. If it is intended to work in the field, you can show how this might work using a simulated version in the lab, or a simulation of your device in the field. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
Special track teams
Special track teams can achieve this medal criterion by bringing their work to the Jamboree and showcasing it in the track event. Art & Design, Measurement, Hardware and Software tracks will all have showcase events at the Giant Jamboree. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab."

function can be facilitated. By doing so, we hope that we can assist other users to find and use those parts efficiently. Ultimately we want to facilitate the implementation of the philosophy of Part Registry, which is to get and give (and share), through a better organization of ncRNA parts in the registry.
This page was written in compliance with Part Registry's format for general Catalog Pages. Currently, the information is uploaded manually because we have yet to submit our suggestions to iGEM HQ. Upon approval, we will tag existing regulatory RNAs and complete the page. Being part of the cross-cohort ""Project Riboregulator"", the page is far from complete and is expected to take shape by Summer 2015. We welcome and encourage constant update and adoption of this page in the future.

Hello everyone! This is Xiao Liu. It's my second time attending iGEM. I've grown from a sophomore, who was unfimiliar with synthetic biology and science research, into a senior who is devoting myself to them. I was in charge of our wiki last time and our whole project this time. I should say that iGEM has influenced me a lot in many positive ways. I hope our project will attract you this time and  my work can contribute to synbio in the future.

I am the student team leader and a member of the experiment division of iGEM 2016 Team NKU_China. Besides the overall management of the team, I am also mainly responsible for the conduction of the Measurement tract and the construction of standard parts. My devotion to synthetic biology is due to the fact that even the simplest bacteria are much more delicate than the most complex machines that humans have ever built. The perfection and complexity of life system attracts me to learn and discover.

Using a micropipette we spotted 2µL of each dilution onto both 4.5 ml 1x plates and .5 mL W3110 plates.
To avoid smearing, we allowed the plates to sit for over an hour and then we incubated them at 37 C overnight.

The concentrations we used are still way too strong. We will have to dilute the concentration even further if we want to see anything more than cleared plaques.

I got to know the IGEM game from my classmate, Junjie Zhang, who has attended the IGEM game last year and  also been our Instructor this year. I think IGEM is a very interesting game, and I am also an active person, so I found a lot of like-minded friends to participate in the competition together. And I plan to apply for a PHD in the United States this fall for further study. I think this Boston trip will give me a real understanding of American College. I believe this game will be a precious memory for me.

I was very regret that there was no IGEM team of graduate in our university last year. But now I have joined the SCUT Champion Park team. When I know I can attend the competition, I am very excited. From my childhood, I see many competition of many subjects, but biology competition is very rare. IGEM is a competition of synthetic biology. The team needs to have the ability to control the input and output signal with technology of synthetic biology. In my mind, it is the best way to combine study with applying. How exciting it is to build the system for achieving the goal. In our team, I am a main experimenter, and I want to grow up with my team. I like challenge, and I think it will make life colorful. I believe in this competition, we will gain the friendship.team. I like challenge, I think it will make life rich and colorful. In the competition we can study together and gain the friendship.

Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the Cas9 degradation rate was taken to be the same as the C. reinhardtii cell division rate (“degradation by dilution”), for which we used the fastest plausible C. reinhardtii cell division rate of 12 hours [11] (as a ""worst case scenario"" situation). Cas9:gRNA complex degradation rates was taken as the quicker of the gRNA and Cas9 degradation rates. All other parameters involving Cas9 formation were taken directly from the Salis Lab’s paper, which were fitted from the results of in vitro Cas9 cleavage experiments in a cytoplasm-like buffer.
2. Cleavage rates
All values from this section were taken directly from the paper by the Salis Lab, except for the volume of the C. reinhardtii chloroplast, which was taken to be 25µm3, half of the median Chlamydomanas cell volume of 50µm3 [15]. Cas9’s diffusivity and characteristic length were estimated from its structure, while the other values were fitted from in vitro experiments in a cytoplasm-like buffer.
3. Homologous recombination
Chloroplast copy number was held constant, at C. reinhardtii’s average copy number of 80 [16]. The only other relevant parameter in this section is the homologous recombination rate constant, kh. Here, we used a value of kh = 0.43 min-1, lifted directly from a paper which measured this directly in E. coli [6]. Two issues about this parameter must be addressed – firstly, that it is a parameter for E. coli, and not C. reinhardtii, and secondly, that homologous recombination was modelled in the paper as a first order reaction, while we model it as a second order one.
The literature seems to suggest that the first issue is not a problem. Chloroplasts are hypothesised to have originated as prokaryotic organisms, and behave similarly to them. In fact, the gene encoding the recA enzyme, which plays an enormous part in mediating homologous recombination, exhibits 53% similarity in E. coli and C. reinhardtii chloroplasts [17]. The second should not be a problem either, as we can safely assume that while recombination in E. coli, as with C. reinhardtii, is in fact a second order reaction - dependent on both the number of broken sites, and the number of available repair templates - there will always only be one repair template (the sister chromosome), allowing it to appear as though it"
Virginia,2014,Team:Virginia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," circularized pSB1C3 plasmid acted as controls.  The samples containing BBa_ K1357006 plasmid were also BL-21 E.coli.  The procedure was run over 60 minutes and performed on 6 identical samples of control and BBa_ K1357006.  The average of the absorbances at 530 nm are plotted above along with error bars constructed from standard errors of the mean values.
Nylon Degradation Assay
In order to assess if BBa_ K1357006 would be able to be used as a means of degrading nylon 6,6 micro and macro plastics, our team developed a nylon degradation assay.  Samples wit approximate diameters of 0.5mm were submersed in 3 mL of growth medium with BL-21 E. coli cells with BBa_ K1357006 and incubated in a shaker at 32℃ and 160 rpm for 1 to 3 days.  The growth medium was supplemented with manganese sulphate as well as a buffered solution comprised of sodium acetate and acetic acid so as to lower and maintain the pH of the mixture to 4.5 for the duration of the experiment.  The samples were massed before and after incubation, but no noticeable change in mass was observed.  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used in order to visualize the surfaces of treated and untreated samples of Nylon 6,6.
The results from the SEM imaging showed physical deformations on the surfaces of samples treated with BL-21 E. coli cells with BBa_ K1357006 that were not evident in any of the untreated samples or controls that were shaken in media without cells present.  These physical deformations were not consistent in their appearances.  Further experimentation before the 2014 jamboree is intended to explore the effects of long term exposure, to improve the consistency of the effect, establish a quantitative means of measuring the effect of our modified bacteria.
NylC Functional Assay
Overview:
NylC is a nylon hydrolase derived from Flavobacterium sp. K172 that digests the internal amide bonds in nylon 6. It hydrolyzes the oligomer form of nylon 6 and liberates primary amino groups as the oligomer is broken down into monomer 1. These free amino groups can be detected by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, which can react with primary amino groups to form orange-colored products whose absorbance is at 335-345nm2.

Na2S MEASUREMENT ASSAY
According to the information given by the company that we received our Na2S from, our sample contained at least 60% of pure Na2S.
1. Prepare a 100 mM stock solution of Na2S and bring it to pH 7.
2. This stock is diluted to 500 uM, 1 mM and 2 mM and pH is adjusted to 12 using NaOH (2M).
3. Measure the OD750 of cyanobacteria that you are willing to use (0.6 < OD750< 0.8). The OD750 of genetically modified and wild-type cyanobacteria is expected to be similar.
4. Prepare 10 mL of cyanobacteria with according concentration of Na2S.
5. Immediately after adding Na2S, take 1 mL of cells, centrifuge them for 2 mins at the highest speed and take supernatant.
6. This supernatant is measured at NanoDrop (Uv-Vis) at 230 nm. This measurement is taken before adjustment of the supernatant and nanodrop should be blanked with the normal BG-11 (pH=7).
7. The pH of the supernatant is adjusted to 12 and the measurement is repeated once again with the blank of BG-11 of the corresponding pH(pH=12).
8. Measure just BG-11+Na2S as a control with the pH 7 and 12 with corresponding blanks.
9. Repeat steps 6-7 after 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes.
Na2S SURVIVAL ASSAY
1. Fill 5 Petri Dish with 6 ml of liquid genetically modified and wild type strain cyanobacteria culture.
2. Add 150 uM, 250 uM, 500 uM, 1 mM, 2mM and 5mM of Na2S into the Petri Dishes for each of the genetically modified and original cyanobacteria cultures.
3. Check the color of samples during 2-4 days.
OIL SURVIVAL ASSAY
1. Make 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% oil solutions in 10 ml of liquid genetically modified and wild-type strain cyanobacteria cultures (It can be calculated given the oil density).

Need to make media/plates today.
When thinking about making simple tests of all of the full parts that we received, one should consider which dropouts are necessary for construction.  Note that all activators are on pRS305, which is a LEU2 shuttle vector.  All repressors are on pRS304*, which is a TRP1 shuttle vector.  Finally, all reporters are found on the pRS306 plasmid, which is a URA3 shuttle vector, with the exception of the LexA activable reporter and the Zif268-HIV repressor reporter, both of which are on the V0002 vector for some reason.  This means that to make simple tests of our parts, we'll have to primarily make plates and media with the following pairs of dropouts: LEU and URA, TRP and URA.

Through volunteering opportunities, organizing training sessions and social media, we were able to share our work with a variety of audiences. We were able to discuss application of synthetic biology in treatment of Parkinson disease. Here are some of our accomplishments.  Please scroll through several images which we took during these events:
Science Mill
In the summer of 2016, our team volunteered at the Science Mill, a science museum in Johnson City, TX, where we helped out with the exhibits at the museum, one of which involved synthetic biology and the use of green fluorescence protein in the eggs of zebrafish.
Building with Biology Events
In September of 2016, our team volunteered at the Building with Biology Events held by the Thinkery, a children’s museum in Austin, TX, where we interacted and spoke with young children about the prevalence of synthetic biology in food, scientific reasoning and skills used in research, and implications of synthetic biology research in the real world.
Training
During the school year of 2016 - 17, experienced members of our team taught fellow high schoolers introductory biotechnology and synthetic biology wet lab and dry lab techniques. This was meant as a means of introducing individuals our age to the world of research, specifically biological research, and to provide them with an experience they may not have had otherwise.
Power for Parkinson's
In the summer of 2017, our team volunteered with the organization Power for Parkinson’s, a nonprofit based in Austin, TX that provides free, local fitness classes for Parkinson’s patients in the community. We assisted at a number of fitness classes and interacted with many of the attendees. A blurb containing the implications of our project, and synthetic biology as a whole, on Parkinson’s was also sent out via a Power for Parkinson’s newsletter.
Social Media
We also used a number of social media platforms, specifically our Instagram (@lasaigem) and our Twitter (@lasa_igem) accounts to raise awareness for Parkinson’s and to direct individuals, specifically individuals our age, on how they can help at the local level. Our posts also included information on the growing relevance of synthetic biology in the treatment of diseases such as Parkinson’s.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Regulation_-_-_TEXT.html," glucose for further testing. By comparing the population-wide RFP response in the presence and absence of glucose. Based on this comparison we selected two clones to measure with flow cytometry.
In an effort to quantify the effect glucose has on the formation of subpopulations we performed a flow cytometry experiment. This analysis was done for two of the clones: B6 and C10. This method clearly revealed that glucose addition has little or no effect on the formation of subpopulations in these cells (Figure 8).
Figure 8. Flow cytometry results for clone B6 and the constitutive mRFP expression control. The images on the left are histograms that show counts of bacteria with specific values of forward light scatter (FSC-H). The histograms on the right show counts of cells with fluorescence corresponding to mRFP. The mRFP fluorescence was measured with an excitation at 561nm, measuring emission at 620nm with 10nm bandwidth.
Although flow cytometry shows that two clones do not form subpopulations, this is no reason to assume that none of the clones are able to do so. We chose to include an 18-mer RBS library on purpose. We expect that if the system described here can lead to subpopulations, this ability relies on the RBS strength. As we have not been able to measure all RBS inserts, we cannot accept nor reject the possibility that the system described here works as intended.
For future research, we modeled the subpopulation system in an effort to identify the most promising clones. The modeling is based on predicted translation rates that correspond with the transformed RBS library. To be able to relate the modeling results to the bacterial clones, we selected seven different clones to send for sequencing of the RBS insert.
Integration and Conclusion
The two systems, quorum sensing, and subpopulation formation, were designed to work in conjunction (Figure 9). When high amounts of the luxR-AHL complex are present, those would repress the 434 and λ cI operon instead of glucose. This requires the promoter of the 434 and λ cI operon to be changed to the BBa_R0063 promoter. We were unable to construct and test this total combined system due to time constraints. However, in an attempt to predict the population dynamics that result from such a system, we modeled first the separate systems and then combined both models.

We did some improvement to the procedure:
the time of centrifuge to harvest the cell, we decrease it to 4000 rpm, because it did not need 9000 rpm to harvest the cell(E.coli is easy to harvest), and the over high speed is harmful to the machine.
the Ni2+ column purify, we didn’t filter in the primary try, and the impurity will affect the column
the first refold, we made a mistake as we said before, we changed it and after the reduction ,we did the dialysis refolding.
the second purify, we can nearly ignore the concentration of proteins. It looks that the concentration we used in primary try is good enough.
Result
We posit a wrong position, mix up the elution result and the protein sample. Add the TEG elution to the GD5 gel. add TEG elution to the GD5 gel.

Dans le circuit primaire, le cobalt est sous forme d'ions et de particules. Les particules de cobalt peuvent représenter la majorité du cobalt présent. Ceci est un problème pour notre biofiltre, car la conception initiale de bioremédiation de la souche permet de capturer uniquement les ions cobalt.
A ce stade du projet nous n'avons pas pu évaluer la capacité du biofiltre pour capturer les particules de cobalt. Cependant, la souche finale ""Cobalt Buster"" produira des fibres amyloïdes (curli) qui pourraient lui permettre de fixer les particules de cobalt sur ​​sa surface.

Où utiliser ""Cobalt Buster"" ? (Avis d'expert)
1-
Selon les experts, le biofiltre ""Cobalt Buster"" peut être utilisé dans le traitement d'autres effluents, comme ceux des STEL(stations de traitements des effluents liquides).
Dans ces stations, le cobalt représente toujours un problème mais la radioactivité est plus faible et les conditions de température et de pression sont compatibles avec la survie de notre biofiltre (pression atmosphérique et température ambiante).
En outre, une collaboration soumise à un accord de confidentialité est discutée avec un de nos partenaire, afin de mettre en place des essais pilotes.

Le filtre peut également être utilisé dans un système de type barbotage,  pour traiter l'air contaminé pendant le déclassement des centrales électriques.

Autres perspectives pour le projet ""Cobalt Buster"" ?

Dr. E. coli : 世界最小の注射器
   私たちのマインテーマは三型分泌装置を大腸菌に乗せ替えて機能を確かめると言うものです。菌にあるも器官の中で三型分泌装置は驚くべきものだと思います。この注射器に似た装置はタンパク質を菌の中から標的の真核細胞に打ち込むためのものです。しかしこの装置は病原性グラム陰性菌であるヤルシニアやサルモネラの器官です。私たちが非病原性の大腸菌を用いてそれを安全使えることを目指しました。

With some help from Adam and Lesia, I got the Eugene lexer and parser running from Netbeans.  Later, we made it into a .jar file so we could use it as a library for Spectacles.  Meanwhile, I added an Import Eugene feature to Spectacles.  When the user selects a Eugene file, it will import the Devices specified in the file by storing and displaying its Components in order.  (Eugene Components are analogous to parts and Eugene Devices are analogous to composite parts.)  I also modified some existing code so Eugene Component objects are created when part thumbnails are clicked on to create new parts in the working pane.  This is still a rather simple version of import and needs a number of improvements.
Things that are not working ideally, still need to be done, or need to be considered:
Importing Eugene appends to the end of the open sequence
If a Eugene file has multiple devices, they are concatenated and show as one sequence
The above two points should be fixed once we implement tabs in the working pane so that each device shows on a different tab
Import Eugene will break if there is a Device object within a Device (i.e. in the components list of the Device)
Should there be a Component object that represents nested Devices, or should import just flatten out the structure by inserting the Components of the Devices into the sequence?
Display information about the Components on double-click or right-click
How to determine names and type names for new components created when populating the working pane from the thumbnails?
Currently newly created Components only contain an image path
This may be more of an issue for exporting to a Eugene file
Week of July 6, 2009
Improvents to Spectacles made this week:
Nested Devices are now supported
(Components and Devices are now stored in a wrapper object, and it is this object that is now backing the image widgets shown)
Added a bottom pane that displays information about the component or nested device that is selected
After Richard added in tabs for the working pane, I was able to fix import to import each device into a new tab
All Devices are stored in a DeviceTracker so Device objects exist even for top level devices (i.e. those that are not nested within another device)
(Edit) Only imported Devices are stored, I need to fix this so that a Device is created when a new tab is opened by the user
Issues to think about/discuss:
Names of Components and Devices
If more than one file is imported and there are name conflicts, how to handle them?

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," decided to buy all the materials in the local shopping centre instead of buying it from brands specialized in lab facilities. Products in stores are already developed to be user-friendly and usable by everyone. Based on the materials provided in the kit we worked out a protocol, in easy accessible language and steps. To validate our work we visited Paul at his farm, where he tried out whether or not he could handle the provided materials in our protocol.
Box content per detection:
- 1x 1.5mL clean green tube for the fresh milk
- 1x 0.5mL clean red tube

- 1x Immersion heater
- 1x Thermometer
- 1x hand-powered centrifuge
- 1x Tube with positive control
- 1x Tube with negative control
- 1x Detection holder
- Protocol
From our work we gained two insights we were able to implement in the protocol: (1) we need to reduce the number of pipetting steps in the protocol for the farmer and (2) in order to let RPA and in vitro transcription work we need to regulate temperature for 3 hours. To reduce the amount of pipetting, we envision in our protocol to provide all the enzymes, primers and NTPs dried in a tube. In this way only the rehydration buffer (with the activation reagent) and the DNA isolated from the milk sample need to be added. Furthermore, we came up with a creative way to regulate the temperature, by using the materials we already had in our toolbox thermos flask. By adding a meat thermometer that can measure up to 120 °C, we can bring the water to the right temperature and keep it around the optimum temperature for RPA an in vitro transcription.
For future research on DNA isolation from gram-positive bacteria in milk we advise to boil for at least 15 minutes and immediately put samples on ice for 15 minutes before centrifuging. We recommend testing the sensitivity of the whole tool by also testing the RNA prepared from all the different dilutions DNA with Cas13a. Lastly, it would"

The two 2-part and two 3-part CBA's were amplified using PCR Rescue and gel purified. The original 4-part CBA was transformed into E. coli electrocompetent cells using electroporation and plated on kanamycin antibiotic agar plates. The 4-part CBA was repeated to ensure accuracy. Because the CBA parts contained no plasmid DNA, the 4-part CBA could be digested by restriction enzyme Dpn1. Dpn1 binds and cuts methylated DNA sites, thus destroying any plasmid DNA remaining as a contaminant.
More issues with RBS library design, as it seems very difficult to find sequences with sufficiently high TIR. Decided to use an initial condition for the calculator, which should speed it up and also ensure higher TIR is reached. More calculations ran.
Tuesday, June 10, 2014
The original 4-part CBA worked! Many colonies appeared on the plate after incubation at 37 degrees C for 18 hours, and 12 colonies were selected for plasmid preparation. These were digested with AatII and XbaI, two restriction sites that are only both contained in the final assembled 4-part plasmid. 6/12 colonies showed the correct bands on the gel. We also prepared more 1 kb ladder from concentrate.
gblocks digested to ready them for ligation into pFTV. Not enough stock of pFTV was present, so inverse PCR ran again, this time with 3 tubes.

3 successful colonies were sent for sequencing. In order to insert the dCas9 system into plasmid 1, dCas9 was digested with XhoI and ClaI. 4 successful colonies were digested with ClaI for 3 hours, heat inactivated at 65 degrees C, and then digested with SalI-HF restriction enzyme. SalI and XhoI are compatible sites. These digestions were gel purified, resulting in low concentrations of plasmid DNA. Only two colonies were used to continue further. We met with Leah Bug and Matthew Johnson from the Penn State Center for Science and the Schools .

Heat Shock 2h
As shown in the Figure 1 (2 hours of heat shock) above, the brightness of the bright dots in the photo, which represents the level of sfGFP 1h after heat shock, decreases almost linearly as the temperature increases. According to the linear fitting, the brightness drops about 5 units for the increase of temperature of 1°C, which is about 3% of the level at 30 degrees Celsius. In the modeling part, we predicted a linear decreasing relationship between temperature and the sfGFP output level. So it coincides with our experimental results.
It is noteworthy that high temperature is likely to affect the binding of sfGFP1-10 and sfGFP11, and destabilize the sfGFP complex. So we must exclude the possibility that the result in the figure above can be only attributed to this factor, instead of the aggregation of Sup35. According to Zhang et al, from 30 degrees to 42 degrees, the fluorescence intensity decreases for about 20%, owing to the effect of high temperature. However, in our experiment, it decreases with 35%, which is obvious more than the effect of temperature only. So there must be another mechanism, which should be that aggregation of Sup35 blocks sfGFP11 and make it impossible or at least harder to bind with sfGFP1-10. What’s more, the difference of the decreasing ratio, 15%, is precisely identical to the predicted ratio in our modeling result. Thus we can safely draw the conclusion that the sfGFP level decreases with increasing temperature, due to or at least partly due to the aggregation of Sup35.
As for the Figure 2 (2 hours of heat shock), it shows that there is a huge decrease of fluorescence intensity when temperature increases from 30 ℃ to 34 ℃ while no obvious changes occur when temperature varies"

Jiangnan team communicated with the field leading scientists and other iGEM teams to seek their opinions on the significance of our project on solving some unresolved issues. We also participated in several communication events such as the 5th CCIC in Shanghai and 6th Asian-Pacific iGEM meet up in Taiwan, which were our precious memories.
CDC(Center of Disease Control)
and
Community Epidemic Prevention Station
in Wuxi (April 23rd)
According to the rules of the competition, we are not allowed to conduct experiments associated with human viruses, so we work on animal vaccines. As the principles on disease prevention are the same between animal and human vaccines, we disseminated human vaccine related knowledge to the public.
We did some market research in Center of Disease Control (CDC) and Community Epidemic Prevention Station (CEPS) in Wuxi, and found that there is a heavy demand on vaccines and large room for improvement on vaccine production efficiency. Also, we found that the public does not sufficient cognition on the importance of vaccination and lacks associated knowledge. We, thus, carried out a series of public educations and road shows to CDC and CEPS in Wuxi. Please see education and public engagement page for detailed information.
Invited
talk of experts
(June 11st to June 14st)
In order to deepen our understandings on the scientific significance of our project, we invited two world leading experts on plasma medicine from Australia to our university, discussed with them our problems in the lab and possible solutions, and interviewed them on the scope and prospects of our project from their point of view.
Rik Thompson, professor of Queensland University of Technology (QUT), is an expert working on plasma precision medicine. After an interactive discussion, Prof. Thompson has offered several insightful solutions to the problems we encountered in our experiments, given us some suggestions on modeling system optimization, and provided us with some technical guidance on the safety operation of plasma equipment in our lab. Prof. Thompson spoke highly of our ideas and our project. With his support and confirmation, we are more confident in ourselves and our project.
Katia Bazaka, an associate professor from QUT, is an expert on plasma chemistry. She has majored in several different subjects such as physical, biology, business etc."
LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," cells works. We consulted the Office for Research and Innovation of the TU Munich to discuss the patentability of our project. A decision is under way to initiate examination for patentability and patent application via the TUM in exchange for shares of the invention (Appendix 10). In order to win the acceptance of the product, it might be necessary to perform studies that prove that these 3D-structured cells are able to identify, for example, liver-toxic drugs that do not show toxicity in 2D cell culture.
Our technology also has great potential to be used for further applications in the future. The next industry to tackle is the cosmetic industry by producing synthetic skin to test cosmetics. Further applications are printing organs for transplantation in the distant future (Appendix Ref. 3) and producing meat or leather from animal cells (Appendix Ref. 4).
3. Entrepreneurial team
We met and formed our team at the „Idea Vernissage“ (Appendix 11, initial poster). Christoph Gruber, who provided the idea and is also our project leader, is a member of the LMU-TUM team participating in this year’s iGEM competition ( https://igem.org/About ).  Christoph Gruber and Christoph Bach both study Molecular Biotechnology, thus providing our team with indispensable scientific knowledge.
Christoph Gruber works in a company within the company B conglomerate. As such, he is in contact with our first potential customer company B and has a reliable network of contacts. He also keeps us updated on the results from the iGEM lab and knows when to adapt our direction to the new findings.  Christoph Bach is experienced with scientific research and highly competent in talking to our customers about the technology. Paul Kurz is studying Technology and Management and provides the team with the necessary knowhow in economic aspects of the idea, such as financial calculation and reasonability of investments.

Overall project
Synthetic biology is the creation of new functions using existing existing biological systems. In order to assist synthetic biologists, the 2009 Illinois tools team is trying to create a web-based open source program that outputs a theoretical pathway to synthesize a desired chemical product given an input and an output compound. This network will meet several constraints such as maximal reaction rates and mass balance. The ideal network will consist of known reactions taken from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)database, which consists of well-studied organisms. The capabilites of our program will be exemplified by establishing a network for the synthesis of biofuels from various input compounds.
Our program is modular and has 6 major components. The first aspect is obtaining reactions from the KEGG database via KEGG API and determining the shortest paths from the starting compound to the ending compound. The second is taking our theoretical outputs and running them through an a program like Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis(COBRA) to optimize the reactions. The result from this would then be graphed using Networkx or pyDot. After the optimal paths have been determined, the program will look for the necessary activators and promoters in the biobrick registry and give the location of those. The sixth aspect of our program is to log our results.

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#News_-_-_TEXT.html," spurred!
Group 1 finally found a strain that shows directed movement!
21 June 2012,Our first poster is designed!
Today we again talked about human practice projects. The newest idea is to plan an open day and invite students from lower semesters and pupils. In order to promote the idea of synthetic biology, we decided to find suitable projects from the last year and present them to our guests. However, it seems that a panel discussion combined with a survey to the topic synthetic biology will work best, as the summer school holidays are right now.
Group 1 decided to try a new minimal agar for the swimming assays and group 2 is now planning an RT-PCR to study the influence of the different promotors on the expression of FlhDC. Group 3 currently has some personal shortage because Ali and Anna have an internship next week but luckily group 1 and 2 offered to help out. This group will soon start with the mutation library of the Tar receptor!
13 June 2012,Task: Find a human practice project!
In today´s meeting, we mainly discussed ideas for human practice projects. All of them will require quite an organizational effort! Additionally, we decided to ask Mr. Dr. Hoppert whether he could help us to make some electron microscopic pictures of our strains. Since we have been invited to present a poster at the third annual congress for strategy processes ""Biotechnology 2020+"", we also discussed some ideas for its design.
Group 1 still faces some problems with the agar but will start with chemotaxis assays in the next week. Group 2 successfully cloned FlhDC behind eight different promotors and group 3 managed the same for the Tar receptor.
06 June 2012,Thomas Maschner, advisor from the iGEM team of the LMU Munich, came to visit us.
Today Heinz told us that he was able to organize a computer for our lab! This will surely facilitate the labwork. He also organized a meeting with Thorsten Maschner from the LMU Munich for tomorrow. Additionally, we decided to ask the sequencing laboratory of the university whether they could support us through sequencing our created vectors.
Afterwards followed as usual the presentations of the group results and the discussion of the next steps. As group 1 has some problems with the swimming assay, we decided to test some different conditions like, e.g. inoculation of the plates with different culture volumes and low nutrition media. Group 2 cloned our constructs into different vectors and they are planning to sequence them. Group 3 successfully completed the first QuikChange PCR!
01 June 2012,"
Toulouse_France,2016,Team:Toulouse France#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," since they were able to engender more reliable products, as it was the case with the production of the growth hormone. It is with the PGMs that the debate has emerged. The questions raised are often linked to them, but the confusion is present and the reluctance seems to affect all GMOs.
The risks are not the same for each category of GMOs, and to the best of our knowledge, for the moment no major health or environmental problems associated to MGMs have been reported despite more than 70 years of MGMs manipulation in academic or private laboratories. This observation has been recently confirmed to us by eminent scientist from various European ethics committees (Pr Père Puigdomenech; Dr Anne Cambon-Thomsen)
Precautionary principle in France. A very interesting law was written in 1995: the Barnier’s law, more known as the precautionary principle. It states that “the lack of certainties, given the scientific and technical knowledge of the moment, shall not delay the adoption of effective and proportionate measures that aim to prevent a risk of severe and irreversible harm to the environment to a cost economically acceptable”. It was written in response to the problems related to contaminated blood and the mad cow disease. This law applies to a lot of areas like health, environmental health, or the governance of economy and stock exchange. Thus it enables taking safety precautions even if the risk in question is not demonstrated or proven. However, no state has given this law a constitutional rank, except in France, Germany and Brazil.
The philosopher Hans Jonas tackles this subject in his book “Le Principe de Responsabilité”. According to him, every technology that contains a risk –no matter how small- of destroying humanity should be forbidden. He adds that if there are many consequences possible when using a technology, one has to decide [to use the technology or not] according to the most pessimistic hypothesis.
In France, this principle is applied for the use of GMOs and allows avoiding to the maximum the risks endangering health and the environment. However, it is sometimes difficult to quantify the risks and visualize the limit between what could be really dangerous for humanity and what is not.
Thereby, thanks to the awareness raised to this debate, numerous precautions have been taken to avoid the dissemination of GMOs, because the scientific community does not know their exact effects on the environment. Thorough studies in order to bring answers are still necessary to adapt our security measures in an efficient manner. It is thus important to act responsibly, with integrity and full conscience, and to evaluate the risks linked to using GMOs.

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

Coloring book
Scientific research is not always a dull work, it can also an interesting experience that everyone could share. In order to spread the fun and attractiveness of synthetic biology, we designed a coloring book. In this way, synthetic biology drew more attention by showing its fun part, following the idea of combining science and art. To our delight, the public were in favor of color painting and they praised our activity for being a good chance to broaden their horizons. Finally, we collected more than 200 painting works. Most surprisingly, kids loved our coloring book very much. With their creative imagination, they developed interests in synthetic biology and at the same time, gave us much courage and inspiration.
We were inspired by the recently popular coloring book Secret Garden, and we learnt from its design. In our coloring book, we simplified several important scientific items into simple stick figures, including DNA chains, viruses, bacteriophages, bacteria, so that people would understand some basic concepts of synthetic biology by painting them. Drawing itself is relaxing and thought-inspiring, and in the form of drawing, we presented our work and popularized iGEM. Hopefully, this coloring book will be a carrier of the spirit of scientific research and our wish to bring benefits to the world.
We have brought our coloring book to the Giant Jamboree, hoping that all of you could have fun with it and know more about us. We also want to discuss with the organizers of iGEM abut the perspective of publishing the coloring book, so that the spirit of iGEM could be spread out and keep encouraging more iGEMers to devote their talent and passion.

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html,". After the fourth measurement, the samples were put in eight different blinking intensities of blue light. The LED lights were blinking from dark to maximum intensity (see legend) with frequency of one cycle per minute. The times indicated are times of the day, not incubation times.
The dark-LED plate was first incubated in darkness. The and show clearly that all the samples have very similar expression profile in the first four timepoints. After this point, the fluorescence values diverge. In both cases, the higher the intensity (darker lines) the lower the fluorescence. All fluorescence levels are significantly higher than that of the control sample. The dark sample (dotted line) conditions should be same throughout the measurement but despite this fact, the fluorescence in the 4th measurement point seems to decrease. We hypothesize that the sample cooled down to room temperature while changing the plate environment causing stress to the bacteria. If the response time is short with respect to the total length of the experiment, we could state that the dotted line represents the effect of bacterial growth, not change in gene expression.
Let's pay closer attention to . Between the 4th and 5th timepoints, the fluorescence levels diverge as a result of change in conditions, just as expected. We see again the fourfold difference between the lowest and highest fluorescence values as a result of intensity difference. What is noteworthy, it seems like the fluorescence levels reach their new levels before the 5th timepoint and stay on that level, especially in case of the darker lines (greater intensities). We do see some increase in intensity, but this is likely to be result of cell growth. This suggests that our measuring frequency was not good enough to capture the response dynamics! We cannot make reliable estimations on the average response times but we can limit the maximum response times to 25 minutes which is the time difference between 4th and 5th timepoint. The response time may even be 10 seconds and we would get very similar data.
We can now evaluate our hypothesis of the effect of the blinking blue light on our light response element. Compared to the previous figure, we see a clear shift of fluorescence values at higher intensities in the . The high intensity LEDs have now weaker impact on the fluorescence. At the first glance we could say that the difference is around 0.7 times the maximum intensity value (for example, the 3.61 blinking intensity has an effect approximately comparable to constant intensity of 2,65). Let's call this constant efficiency multiplier. However, we need to once again take into account the bias in the low values"

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment"

Generate and export results in the ResultsView.
Implementation
We implemented Eugenie using C#, XAML and the Surface SDK 2.0 . We also used the MVC framework, Eugene for the creation of synthetic biology circuits, and Pigeon to display the circuits visually.
Goals
We had four goals in creating Eugenie:
Implementing top-down design
We utilized the functionality of Eugene, a programming language that is used to implement top-down design of novel genetic circuits—design that begins by specifying devices and then instantiating parts.
Enhancing sensemaking
We implemented sliding panel views, which allow users the option to view multiple sets of information simultaneously or one set at a time, helping users understand the connection between the different types of presentation.
Supporting resource integration
We give users the option to load parts from the parts registry, access parts in a Clotho database, or use a local database.
Fostering collaboration
We used the Microsoft PixelSense, which allows multiple people to use Eugenie simultaneously.
Results
Results showing users' experience with Eugenie.
We conducted user studies of Eugenie with members of the BU and MIT iGEM teams as well as with Wellesley College students; the majority of the 15 participants were biology or other science majors. Our study began with a brief introduction to the Eugene programming language, the visual language we had created, and the Eugenie user interface. Users were first tasked with interpreting genetic devices from our visual language and then translating SBOL representations of genetic devices into our visual language.
We next asked participants to use Eugenie to specify one of the genetic devices they had translated. Post task, participants rated the ease of understanding the visual language and of using the program. We also asked participants for their feedback on how the program could be improved.
The majority of users found it easier to create a device using Eugenie than to draw one by hand. Some participants also remarked that the multiple panels were helpful for understanding the device. Overall, users' response to Eugenie was positive, with many testers believing that Eugenie can become a great tool to help other young synthetic biologists with their research work.

Future Work
Our visual language
Supplement part information with additional information from previous iGEM projects and other synthetic biology databases
Allow users to access more parts from other synthetic biology databases
Expedite the process for synthetic biologists to create genetic circuits
Further incorporate the visual language we created into Eugenie's interface
Develop a companion web application to enable widespread access to Eugenie

1. The developing toxic proteins.
The toxic protein we choose is avermactins, which are a series of macrolide antibiotics with potent anthelmintic and insecticidal activity that are produced by Streptomyces avermitilis and widely used in agricultural, medical, and veterinary fields. Although this kind of insecticide is environmentally friendly and specific to termites, it is still not ideal enough.
Ivermectins are semisynthetic derivatives of avermectins B1, which is one of the eight structurally related avermactins polyketide compounds. Ivermectins have the same effective antiparasitic activity and lower level of toxic side effect than avermectins B1. The worldwide acceptance of ivermectin in livestock production and in the health care of companion animals made it a major commercial success. Its efficacy in human onchocerciasis and human strongyloidiasis also expanded the interest in its use in human medicine. In other words, ivermectin has less toxicity and costs, better environmentally friendliness and wider practicability. However, because of the large size (about 80kb) and operative complexity, it"

Risks of Our Project Now
1. Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:
We are currently working with cDNA/RNA of S1 and S2 level organisms cloned in E.coli DH5alpha and expressed in S.cerevisae. Although these organisms are not pathogenic to humans, lab coat and gloves are worn at all times during work for protection. Furthermore, the work with such organisms is restricted to sterile laminar air flow chambers. We are using ethidium bromide, an intercalating agent, for staining DNA in agarose gels.  We are aware of the fact that ethidium bromide is a mutagen and carcinogen. As such, the work with ethidium bromide is only permitted at a marked area in the laboratory and it is essential to wear nitrile gloves. The agarose gels containing ethidium bromide are disposed of in a specially marked container. While working with ethidium bromide gels, it is necessary to wear a lab coat, nitrile gloves and a face protection to avoid UV damage. Furthermore, a risk while working with agarose is boiling retardation. In order to minimize this risk, every student is required to wear special heat-stable and thick gloves. Since"

When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar,"

Also, a secondary system will be required to be hybridized to the GLOWzyme system such that when an E. coli leak is detected by the GLOWzyme, another system will be able to alert the crew so that they can respond in a proper and timely manner."
USTC,2018,Team:USTC#Model#Performance evaluation_-_-_TEXT.html,", we find that the maximal GFP concentration ranges from 0 to about 2000 nM with the increase of nicotine input. However, the strength of promoter 1 has no significant impact on the GFP maximal concentration. The heat-map shows that when nicotine input is lower than 3.5e-5 M, the GFP concentration is relative low and undetectable.
In experiment, we use microplate reader to detect the fluorescence intensity of GFP. So the specificity and threshold are restricted by the detection limit and specificity of the device in fact. To fit the real condition in experiment, we need to convert GFP concentration (nM) to fluorescence intensity (au). According to the work of 2016 William and Mary iGEM team, we can build up the function between GFP concentration and fluorescence intensity like this:
Equation 1 GFP concentration to relative intensity conversion
We define fluorescence intensity more than 100 a.u. as significant result because the data of our interlab shows that the basal fluorescence of medium is about 60 a.u. under the same excitation wavelength light. This requirement determines a detection limit of GFP concentration. The lowest of nicotine concentration to be detected is decided in turn:
Equation 2 GFP concentration detection limit
Figure 3 Relative intensity heat-map
Figure 4 Contour line of relative intensity
To get the value of fluorescence intensity of GFP, we transform the simulation data from GFP concentration (nM) to relative intensity (a.u.). Figure 3 shows the change tendency of GFP fluorescent intensity which is similar to the condition of GFP. To identify the boundary of relative intensity 100 a.u., we draw the contour line of 100 a.u. intensity. From the contour line (Figure 43), we find the when nicotine input is less than 1e-3.6 M, the relative intensity is lower than 100 a.u. and the result is not significant enough according to the criteria mentioned above.
In conclusion, the threshold of our sensing system is above 1e-3.6 M nicotine and the threshold does not strongly shift with the decline of promoter 1 strength.
Sensitivity analysis
Last section, we talk about the threshold of the sensing system which is related to the detection limit of sensing system. This part we want to analyze the response of GFP signal to different nicotine input. The nicotine input is set to be within [1e-4,1] M to cover the interval including no GFP response and strong GFP response. Because the interval we set is small, we define sensitivity according to the logarithmic nicotine concentration as the equation below

Background
The Modeling portion of the UMaryland iGEM project proposes specific adjustments to the expression levels of enzymes in the methane digestion pathways. Our modeling efforts focus on ensuring the viability of our engineered organism, and optimizing the efficiencies of our pathways. Along the way, our team encountered stumbling blocks that we would like to illuminate for iGEM teams in the future. Incorporated into our modeling page is a concise guide on getting started with the Matlab applet, Simbiology, to model simple metabolic pathways. If you have no interest in this guide, please feel free to optimize your time by skipping over the purple text.
Simbiology is a tool that enables teams with variable modeling backgrounds to build pathway architectures by using a simple drag and drop interface. Although Simbiology is an extremely useful and intuitive tool, it does require some experience to navigate, and it does have its errors; but more on that later. The first step is to open Simbiology by typing “simbiology” into the Matlab command window, then hitting enter.
Simbiology allows you to drag these elements onto an interface to design your model. For our model, we mainly used the “species” icon and the “reaction” icon.
To begin drawing your metabolic pathway, drag and drop a “reaction” icon, located on the left hand sign of the window, onto the blank canvas covering the right half of the window. Then double click on the small orange reaction circle that you placed, and enter your chemical reaction into the block property editor by replacing “null -> null” with your balanced formula. Enzymes are included in the balanced formula. Make sure your enzyme is represented as both a reactant and a product. Clicking out of the Block Property Editor will create species with arrows pointing into your reaction and arrows pointing out of your reaction. Enzymes are connected to the reaction by a dotted line, representing an intermediate that is not consumed or produced by the reaction.  You may place as many reactions and species onto the canvas as you would like. If you would like an example model architecture, our pathways are shown later.

Heavy Metals
We detect several heavy metals with a single test strip.
Heavy metals have been part in a lot of iGEM projects over the last years, so why work with them again?
Heavy metals are still a major problem. Therefore, they have been part in a lot of iGEM projects. There are many concepts to create heavy metal sensors. Some of them work extraordinary well. But most of these sensors never made it to real world applications. We aim to make a use of well characterized sensors as well as concepts and new ideas. All this sensor systems shell work on the same principle, so that we can use them to create a modular easy to handle paper based cell free test strip for detection of more substances, heavy metals in this case, in parallel. ""In my opinion the test stripe system has great potential in the field of monitoring contamination in industrial wastewater. It`s a fast and easy available system for qualitative control of several heavy metals.” (Dr.rer.nat. Andreas Bermpohl, manager of Biotec GmbH)
Why heavy metals? Heavy metals are part of Earth’s crust. Therefore, they do occur naturally in our environment. (Heavy Metals - Lenntech) In low doses some of them as copper or nickel are even essential trace elements for animals and humans (Rashmi Verma and Pratima Dwivedi 2013). A major problem is their bioaccumulation, which leads to toxicity and long term effects which include fatal diseases like cancer (Martin et al."

Our project includes 2 independent software tools-the brick worker and E' NOTE. The former is a software suit for the evaluation and optimization of biobricks, i.e., promoter, RBS, protein coding sequences and terminator. E' NOTE is a web application serving as an assistant for experiments. Its useful functions such as experiments recording and experimental template customization make experimental process easier and more enjoyable.

Terminator
Background
Gene  expression  in  both  prokaryotes  and  eukaryotes  is  frequently  controlled  at  the  level  of  transcription.  This  process  can  be represented  as a cycle  consisting  of  four  major  steps:  (1)  promoter binding;  (2)  RNA  chain  initiation;  (3)  RNA  chain elongation;  and  (4) termination. Since regulatory controls are exerted at each step, an understanding of the mechanism of each step is of general importance in understanding gene expression.
In the promoter part of our program, we've discussed the mechanism of promoter binding step and how it affects the transcription level.  To complete our biobrick evaluation program and to better understanding of transcription process, we integrated the software developed by 2012 iGEM team SUSTC-Shenzhen-B to realize the prediction of transcription termination efficiency.
Introduction
Termination, the last step of the transcription cycle, occurs when the RNA polymerase releases the RNA transcript and dissociates from the DNA template. It is important that transcription is imperfectly terminated at some terminator so that the ratio of the amount of the mRNA transcribed from upstream and that from downstream of the terminator is controlled. This regulation is quantified by the termination efficiency (%T).
Two mechanisms of transcription termination and two classes of termination signals have been described in bacteria: rho-dependent and rho-independent.
Rho-independent (also known as intrinsic) terminators are sequences motifs found in many prokaryotes that cause the transcription of DNA to RNA to stop. These termination signals typically consist of a short, often GC-rich hairpin followed by a sequences enriched in thymine residues.
The conventional model of transcriptional termination is that the stem loop causes RNA polymerase to"

Crops who have been modified with both HT and Bt, are so called stacked genes crops. HT crops allow farmers to more effectively manage pest and weeds in their fields, where Bt crops kills of pests as they feed on the plant UCN (2007) ”Current knowledge of the impacts of genetically modified organisms on biodiversity and human health”. .
The overall effect of HT crops could end with a local fall in biodiversity, as weeds and other plants, together with arthropods, are simply removed with herbicides. Another threat would be the effect of horizontal gene-transfer between related species, where wild type plants get the HT gene from domesticated plants. This is seen in the golf field grass Agrostis stolonifera from a farm and the wild type Agrostis gigantea Watrud, Lidia S., et al. ""Evidence for landscape-level, pollen-mediated gene flow from genetically modified creeping bentgrass with CP4 EPSPS as a marker."" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 101.40 (2004): 14533-14538”. . The HT gene was found in one-third of A. gigantea seeds, and up to 9 miles from the farm. This horizontal gene-transfer could lead to “superweeds”, needing more and stronger herbicide to get rid of Prusak, Anna, Gene Rowe, and Jacek Strojny. ""Is GMO"" Sustainable""?

Bt crops is toxic to arthropods, as seen with the Monarch butterfly in North America. The Monarch butterfly larvae would die from eating milkweed covered in pollen from BT crops, but thanks to Bt cotton in Mexico, the number of hibernating butterflies in cotton farms increased four times as less pesticide where needed in those areas Prusak, Anna, Gene Rowe, and Jacek Strojny.

Philippe Büscher (Head of the Unit of Parasite Diagnostics, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp), the current treatment and healthcare costs are US$100-200 per patient. Therefore, by decreasing the number of false positives, a lot of money could be saved which can then be more efficiently spent to help those in need.
By making a more sensitive diagnostic test, we aim to reduce the number of false positives. Hereby, the costs for research, equipment and health care is also reduced, while still helping those in need!

Step 11.   Evaluation
Diagnostic tests can be widely applied, e.g. for deciding on treatments for a patient, evaluating current interventions and for surveillance for disease presence (see below). However, this is not possible if the tool does not work properly! Not all diagnostic tests are suitable to be used in the field. To find out how the test can be best put into use, evaluation is necessary. Here, we address ‘outbreak-use’ diagnostics (OUDs), discuss the definition of an OUD and what its role is in tackling outbreaks of infectious diseases.
Outbreak-use Diagnostics
In the case of an emergency outbreak, the distribution of a safe and effective diagnostic to the patients in need is of the highest priority. Therefore a preliminary ‘outbreak-use’ diagnostic is developed and applied in the field as soon as possible [1]. This OUD is used to determine who is infected, how the disease is transmitted and how the disease is spreading. This data is of utmost importance for the development of containment strategies, and these can in turn be applied for limiting the number of casualties.
However, such a test has not gone through extensive performance trials yet. These trials would have taken valuable time during which the epidemic could have caused many victims. Instead of figuring out all the best practices of the OUD during long clinical trials, the performance and main best practices are mainly discovered in the field in uncontrolled environments [1]. We learned that this is the scenario where Mantis can be applied best.

The mCherry gene did not show as a band on the gel, possibly due to incompatibilities between the mCherry gene and the primers. The mCherry gene was to be used as a marker gene, giving visual confirmation of successful transformation; however, because of the possible compatibility issues we decided to explore other options.

Purdue,2013,Team:Purdue#Project#BCD_-_-_TEXT.html,"frp1 gene with synonymous DNA base substitutions and the Ptrc* promoter work at least in the context of a bicistronic expression operating unit.
The growth curve on the right contains three curves: control BL21 cells, BL21 cells with just pSB1C3, and BL21 cells with pSB1C3 with the prtc* promoter inserted. We believe that the strain of producing the antibiotic resistance delayed the pSB1C3 and prtc* cultures from entering exponential phase at the same time the control BL21 cells did. Because the control cells entered the phase quicker, they also reached the stationary phase faster. Overall, we determined that the prtc* promoter has no significant effect on the growth of BL21 cells that would be problematic for future assays.<\p>
In the graph shown, a plot of intensity vs wavelength is shown. The prtc* promoter was inserted into three separate bicistronic design constructs, which were low, medium, and high expression levels. The three plots represent the three BCD constructs, and the heights of the peaks align with the expected low, medium, and high expression levels. Although the intensity is quite low, the emission spectrum has a spike right where it should be for RFP. We believe that the low intensity of the fluorescence was due to an error in the dilution of the cell culture that we measured. The picture to the right shows the cells expressing RFP under blacklight.

Our next immediate step were we to have more time would have been sequencing the fully assembled BCD EOUs to compare them to the original BCD EOUs we received from Vivek Mutalik. We would expect them to have identical sequences up until the BioBrick scar preceding our constructs' double terminators. Identical sequences should result in equal functionality assuming other variables, such as host strain held constant. However, more rigorous characterization of BCD function would require more than the one mrfp1 coding sequence we had in our budget to synthesize.
Although we could not submit our BpiI-GGC-compatible BCD EOUs to iGEM HQ by the competition deadline, we plan to more fully characterize them and send them to the Registry in the near future. Further work should be directed towards making more promoters and coding sequence BioBricks with the BpiI sites needed for cloning into our BCDs.

Cooperative Binding Model
Since one-on-one interaction between DNT and the promoter did not yield good results, we hypothesized that this might be a case of cooperative interaction. The Hill coefficient (n) is commonly used as a way to quantify the cooperative binding effect. Making use of the Hill coefficient, equation (7.2) can be rewritten for the case of cooperative binding:    $$  \frac{d}{dt} [P_{A}] = \ k_{on}[P_{R}][DNT]^{n} - \ k_{off}[P_{A}] \tag{14} $$  This equation is almost completely similar to equation (7.2), except for the Hill coefficient appearing as an exponent. The analysis needed to find a equation relating the equilibrium concentration of the reporter protein to the amount of DNT is also completely similar to the analysis done to obtain equation (13). Therefore, we will suffice with giving the end result:  $$  [R]_{eq} = \ \frac{1}{d_{P}} \frac{k_{1}[DNT]^{n}+ \ K_{D}^{n} k_{2}}{K_{D}^{n} + \ [DNT]^{n}} \tag{15} $$  Fitting equation (15) (again with the fixed value of \(4 \times 10^{-6} \ s^{-1}\) for protein degradation) to the data in the Yagur-Kroll paper gives the parameter values given in table (1) and the fits shown in figure 6. Common methods to determine confidence intervals for the fit parameters such as obtaining them from the covariance matrix or the Jacobian did not yield correct results. We therefore tried to determine confidence intervals for the  promoter parameters with a bootstrapping procedure adapted from [4]. However, we were not able to determine confidence intervals due to non-convergence of some fits. This  is a clear indication that the uncertainty of these values is quite high.

Jianbo Wang
Professor Wang, our instructor, seems far from being amicable on first impression. He is a tall, thin man with glasses, showing extraordinary seriousness and rigidity in his eyes. For all this and the fact that he is the dean, there seems to be a great distance between him and the fellow students. After just a few conversations with him, however, we soon found out that, though strict as he is with our team, he shows great geniality and resourcefulness when communicating with us, and often provides us with all sorts of information that we need. It’s him who helped us prepare for our thesis defense, in which we won many professors’ approval. It’s him who offered to fund us with this project, so that we can do it without being hamstrung by financial problems. It’s still him who encourages us, offers valuable advices and his own experience, and acknowledges the progresses we have got. We want to thank him here for all the support he gives to us. Without him, we can’t be going this far.
Zhixiong Xie
Our instructor, Dr. Xie, is remembered by us for his symbolic smile on his face with a little baby fat. One can easily judge from his photo that he is that kind of nice teacher who keeps a close relationship with his students. He did indeed. During this graduation season, we were surprised to find that he joyfully companied his two phD students taking photos around the campus, even more excited than his students, as if the one who just got the phD degree was him. And he regards us just as the students in his lab. He never tries to hide his proud of us. When he leaded the freshmen to do the wild field training in the summer, he cannot help but talking about our creative work with them. The enthusiastic praise even makes us a little bit embarrassed. However, cautious and cool-minded as his major microbiology required, he is quite critical about our idea. While we were fascinated by our plan that our new probiotic can help us reducing weight by magnificently increasing the metabolic rate of the fatty acids, he pointed that we were over optimistic before we have collected complete data, for example, the percentage of the lipid in every day diet and the estimated maximum metabolic rate after overexpression of related genes. It proved later that these calculations were vital in the plausibility of the project and the successive experimental design. As the instructor responding"

Not everybody knows how to measure  glucose concentration in honey. Our team found the best way to apply our project, by creating a device that capable to measure the glucose concentration in honey. To ease people use the device, we create a simple software, which is cheap and easy to use
ECONEY Project is a colaboration between biotechnology and informatics technology. We createECONEYsoftwarebased on android smartphone technology, which can be used to measure glucose concentration using catabolite repression phenomenon. ECONEY software will detect RGB value and color code from single picture captured from smartphone camera.Then the RGB Luminance value will be calculated using the RGB Value detected earlier and the result showed on screen directly.Our software has graphics submenu which provide you with the standard curve. This curve is used to calculate the glucose concentration of honey.

Tuebingen,2014,Team:Tuebingen#Project#Motivation_-_-_TEXT.html," blood  preservations of at least one additional type. On the other hand patients from group O are  dependent on a supply of blood type O only. The blood type distribution of the population in the USA  for example is as follows: 44 % of the population is type O, 42 % is type A, 10 % is type AB and 4 % is  type AB.
The current blood donation and reception system in transfusion medicine bases on this comparison  of blood groups. It requires to test the blood of the involved people at least once for the donor, once  for the recipient and additionally right before the supply in form of a bedside compatibility test.  These tests are time consuming, which can be critical in some situations for the life of the patient.
Although the blood groups of donations are roughly equally distributed as the overall distribution in  a country, rare blood preservations may get scarce quickly dependent on the case of emergency.  When a patient with a rare blood group needs a big amount of blood preservations the stock can  diminish rapidly. In the worst case, this then may lead to the inability to supply a patient with the  correct blood type, which may have direct influence to the chance of survival. On the other hand  preservations of blood groups with higher frequency are excessively available and may be useless  during their storage life. Due to this phenomena huge amounts of unused blood preservations are  discarded continuously in blood institutes, due to the impossibility to use them.
However, blood groups can be converted. As shown in figure 1 the nature of an ABO blood group is  the composition of oligosaccharides that are physically exposed on the exterior of red blood cells.  Specific glycosidases, derived from bacteria can remove monosaccharides from these  oligosaccharides and therefore convert the blood groups A, B and AB to O. In our case we wanted to  use the following enzymes: N-acetylgalactosaminidase (NAGA) from Elizabethkingia meningoseptica to convert type A to O, α-Galactosidase (αGAL) from Bacteriodes fragilis to convert type B to O [3]. To  convert type AB to O one could apply both enzymes or another enzyme we used: Endo-β- galactosidase (EABase) from Clostridium perfringens. This process could be realized technically by  immobilizing the enzymes onto a column. To convert a blood preservation, it is only necessary to  apply the"

It was decided that the “Student Members” heading would correspond to our “(Donor) Team size - Student Members” column and all other headings such as “Advisors”, “Primary PI”, “Secondary PI” and “Instructors” would fall under our “(Donor) Team size - Auxiliary Members”.
The next link ollowed was finally the team’s Wiki page. This would then give us the team’s collaboration and who the recipient teams were. All team’s Wiki’s were formatted differently, but most followed a familiar format. On the top headings of the home page, a Collaboration heading could be found on its own, or possibly under the Human Practices heading. Once arrived at this page, we made a judgement on whether a collaboration was valid to record or not. Below will be our method on how we determined if a collaboration was valid or not, with example edge cases to help explain further.

What is a valid collaboration?
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.- iGEM HQ, Medal criteria
In most cases, teams reported collaborations similar to the examples outlined in the medal criteria.  However, we have found instances wherein the “significance” of a collaboration were ambiguous.  The following are edge cases representing the classes of collaboration with such ambiguity.
Edge Cases:
NEGEM
New England iGEM (NEGEM) is a Team Meetup hosted by BostonU each year. At this Team Meetup, iGEM teams will share ideas, help each other, and socialize. However, teams that attended the Team Meetup were not counted as a collaboration. This is because although NEGEM may have been the starting point for a collaboration, it itself was not significant enough to be a collaboration. The actual event did not allow enough time or resources for teams to significantly help each other. However, collaborations did occur as a result of the Team Meetup, where teams significantly assisted other teams with their projects.

2. It is not yet known whether feeding RNAi is effective for B. xylophilus.
3. There is currently insufficient data on which essential gene(s) to target.
Establishing RNAi conditions by trial and error in pine trees would be too inefficient. Using our knowledge from experimentation with B. x. B. to establish a delivery system (point 2 above), it is expected that RNAi may be used as a screening system to determine the effects on various essential genes both efficiently and quickly (point 3 above).
Methods to protect plants from plant parasitic nematodes by RNAi expression has attracted attention in recent years.
There is a report that a host plant of M. incognita, belonging to the same order Tylenchida as B. xylophilus, escaped from the parasitism of M. incognita by making the plant express dsRNA [2],[3]. That is to say, the application of B. x. B may not be limited to feeding RNAi to B. xylophilus.
15% of all nematodes are plant parasitic nematodes which have stylet similar to B. xylophilus [4]. These nematodes have caused enormous damage to important crop plants including potatoes, eggplants, rice, tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes, and carrots, resulting in an estimated annual loss of $8 billion in the United States and $78 billion worldwide [5]. Therefore, urgent measures are required. RNAi expression in plants is a powerful weapon against these pathogenic nematodes, so development of such technology has a strong potential for application.
The B. x. B. system we developed can be used as a preliminary RNAi evaluation system to target plant-specific pathogens, before initiating breeding of recombinant crops. If efficient breeding is carried out and countermeasures progress, many plant diseases will be abolished, which will have a strong impact on resolving current threats to global food resources.

Creation of a futuristic company, Quanticare and production of a thought-provoking film
As part of our human practices we decided to look into an artistic approach to bringing synthetic biology to a wider audience. As part of this we created ""Quanticare"", a fictitious and futuristic company forming on the back of a rise to prominence of synthetic biology over the next few years, as well as the results of our own projects on nitric oxide sensing and the comparator circuit. The fictitious company's latest development is to introduce a visual bio sensors in to the human body in the form of a tattoo-based health monitor, Cura.
Not only did the development of the fictitious company allow the team to explore potential future applications of synthetic biology and bio sensors, but also via the creation of a film , fuel a range of ethical questions. The team released the video on the day of the Wiki Freeze as well as bringing transferable tattoo samples of Cura to the European Jamboree as a form of marketing for the video and concept as a whole.
The team also produced a film with Amy Congdon exploring Cura itself and its many applications. They decided to angle the film as a product launch in order to capture the imagination and bring Quanticare and Cura to the public as a realistic future involving synthetic biology. The film is available to view below, we thank the Biochemical Society for their outreach grant to fund this film.
Please check out Quanticare page for more details!
Some initial feedback, the Quanticare video was launched less than 24 hours before the wiki freeze:

Angela Chen
Angela is a sophomore in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. This is her second year in iGEM. She wanted to return to iGEM because she craved the experience of working with a group of fellow undergraduates that shared the same passion for synthetic biology. She also wanted to acquire the valuable experience of managing a team to create something extraordinary in synthetic biology.There are two things that make her happy: seeing transformed colonies on her culture plates, or seeing the ominous red ink traced in a shape of an ""A"" at the top right hand corner of her chemistry exam. Aside from academics, Angela enjoys volunteering around the world. She is able to extend a hand to those less fortunate as well as learn more herself in the process. When she feels depressed, she likes to lock herself in her room with a pint of chocolate ice-cream.

Experiences in creating a team from team TUST_China leader
Persuade members to join the team
iGEM is a competition that is all about teamwork. It cannot be done just by a few people and in order to do that, you need to find a bunch of friends who are willing to follow you and do the work. Now is the time to show how persuasive you can be. Persuade all sorts of talented people. You can get some help here such as get your teacher to spread the words, get your iGEM friends in top universities to give a speech. It is mutual beneficial because other iGEM team need this as parts of requirements to get a gold medal. With all this help, you can picture an oasis on a waste land and promise to get them there. Of course, while you trying to get them on board, you need to be a gate keeper. Don't miss any talents and makes sure those that will be staying is contributing.
Tips: Don't overlook the introverts, they won't advertise how much they have contributed.
Persuade your professors
After you have assembled your team, you have to persuade a professor (ideally with abundant fund and a good heart). Keep telling him the same story and get him on board. With the resources of a professor, you can ask for a spot in his lab to conduct your experiments or borrow equipment. Or even, the professor will help you to settle down on a research topic and if that happen, you are lucky! If that doesn't happen, don't worry! You are also lucky because you can chase your own interests now! If you think about why i"

We made ampicillin agar plates and ampicillin antibiotic stock for cloning. The PCR Rescue of Lambda Red Recombinase was also gel purified.
Sam made Chloramphenicol plates for use later on.Redesigned leader sequence to be a full 60 bp, redesigned rescue primers again. Sequencing primers designed. MATLAB program updated to optimize for slow insertion time GFP. Script also created to total the insertion times of each GFP. Primers updated again as enzymes were re chosen, due to the presence of one of them in the CDS of slow insertion time GFP.

We conducted PCR Rescue to amplify the kanamycin resistance cassette (specifically the neomycin cassette, which also confers resistance to kanamycin) from pSEVA251 KanR plasmid. Two different sets of primers for kanamycin were tested, and the first set was successful - all 4 PCR's were correct. The second set of primers all failed. However, Emily had her first PCR success! Kanamycin cassette was gel purified.
Project Plan updated. Five GFPs will be ligated into pFTV separately, then dRBS will be ligated in. Data will be collected and sequencing will show which RBS was used by each colony. Cryogenic stock of cells harboring pFTV grown.
Friday, June 6, 2014
Conducted colony PCR using P. putida KT2440 strain as the DNA template to construct 1 kb overlaps for homologous recombination. All four of the first genome overlaps with gene PP_0747 were successful; only 2 overlaps with upp gene were successful. These were gel purified. We learned Gibson Chew-Back Annealing Assembly (CBA) protocol.
Gblocks arrived. Rescue PCR conducted to increase stocks of gblocks. Samples run in gel and purified. Plasmids harvested from cells harboring pFTV. Clay left early to rebuild the deck at his house. Bastard.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of g"

Collaboration connecting Theory and Experiment
This year our iGEM team established a transatlantic collaboration with the iGEM team 2016 from Lethbridge , Canada. Our joined attempt was to determine the evolutionary stability of kill switches from both, theoretical and experimental side. While we were contributing the theoretical modeling part, our colleagues in Canada worked on the experimental evidence of our drylab predictions. We worked on suitable experiment design for their hands-on part together. To help them out we had also the necessary genes for the MazF kill switch synthesized and shipped. Figures 1 and 2 show experimental work with the BNU China 2014 kill switch: Before applying UV light, the kill switch works and kill the cells reliably (figure 1). However, after application of UV light that mutates the cells, the kill switch is destroyed and genetically modified cells survive the escape into wild life conditions (figure 2). This emphasizes the danger of evolutionary unstable kill switches. Further details on their procedure can be found on their wiki .
Figure 1. Cell cultures with implemented BNU China 2014 kill switch before exposure to UV light. The working                 kill switch ensures cell death once released into wild life conditions.
Figure 2. Cell cultures with implemented BNU China 2014 kill switch after exposure to UV light. The kill switch has been destroyed through mutations and cells survive release into wild life conditions.
