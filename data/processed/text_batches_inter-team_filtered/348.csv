本小組將以上四組devices獨立出來測試與說明。
T7是一個強啟動子，所以LacI 會持續不斷的被轉譯出並累積，抑制住PLacI promoter。在充滿著LacI的環境下，啟動子的SD序列會被包覆並阻礙轉錄及轉譯的進行。
Devices C and D are two conjugated sequences and they repress each other.   Pci434 is a strongly expressed promoter and more powerful than promoter Pciip22, so device C is repressed at the beginning.  When the activator is added, however, CI 434 protein is produced and accumulated.  Therefore, the repression reverses.  Once device C expresses, device D will be repressed till the end.  No matter what surrounding becomes, the product of this memory system doesn’t change.  That is the function what we called “memory”.
C和D兩段序列是互相抑制的共軛序列；然而，位於D序列上的啟動子Pci434較C序列上的啟動子Pciip22為強，故在反應起始時，D序列的表現作用較強而會抑制C序列。在加入誘導物後，B序列轉譯出CI434蛋白並抑制Pci434，導致抑制方向逆轉。一旦C序列表現強於D序列，D序列就會被永遠抑制住，此時不論外在環境，此共軛片段產生出之結果都不再改變，也達成了「記憶」的效果。
More detail about the conjugated sequences is researched and published by KULeuven in 2008."

GROUP 7: Microscopy/Yeast
Summary for Microscopy/Yeast Group
Date: Oct 27, 2008  Status report by: Tejas  Part no.: no Biobrick part  Part Description: Yeast vector pRS414 to be temporarily used.    The yeast vector pRS414 will be temporarily used until it can be adjusted to meet registry   standards. pRS414 contains one EcoRI site and one PstI site, both directly adjacent to each   other. This may make digest a little less efficient. Procedure involves first digesting with   Pst1 for one hour, then digesting with EcoRI overnight (sequentially, not simultaneously), as   EcoRI can tolerate low overhangs better than PstI, according to the NEB catalog. The following   is a gel run on an E/P simultaneous digest of pRS414.  Lane one is log 2 ladder. Lane 2 is uncut pRS414 (supercoiled so runs fater). Lane 3 is cut   vector. It may have only one cut, with half at EcoRI and half at PstI, depending on efficiency of   the second cut occuring after the first.

4 iGEM teams in NCTU on Jul 30, 2016
At this academic exchange, we shared our story and listened to others to realize that NCTU iGEM team is working on an eco-friendly Pantide insecticide, Mingdao high school iGEM team is developing a blood sobriety test, and NTHU iGEM team is establishing a PFCs breakdown for sewage treatment plant. We had a feeling that all teams' ideas are certainly meaningful and intriguing as the good starting point to solve the unsolved or still remained problems on earth at present. And we gave opinions to each other reciprocally, sharing the same IDT biobrick problems. In addition, after the day's activities, we made a plenty of nice, charming, and talkative iGEMers as friends.
We're having our sincere gratitude to 4 iGEM teams from 4 schools, feedbacks and advices of everyone and Mingdao's instructor, the cozy environment NCTU iGEM team offered, the campus guides showing us around NCTU and NTHU, and finally the homemade table games based on the story of NCTU iGEM team which is the very so-called distillation of wisdom.
NKU iGEM team on Apr 28, 2016
We had a Skype meeting with Nan Kai University in China. We shared projects and synthetic biological application with each other. It was the NKU iGEM team that was first communicated with us. We had this chance to talk, because the person who was in charge for human practice flied to our country and staied at our school for a semester, and she helped us arrange this.
Speaking to the synthetic biology. Here comes our sharing. Genome of all nature species are expressed in different profiles and functions on the basis of their unique DNA sequences. Since every gene completes its own duty like a pile of bricks and collaboratively generate great life, ""BioBricks"" were put forward as a concept and carried out by scientists rendering a possibility to engineer creatures. Every year, iGEM organizer provides participants BioBricks as basic materials. Teams conduct genetic engineering and combine the concept of engineering to manufacture their own BioBricks. In the end of competitions, all new BioBricks are submitted to the organizer and become shared resources. Consequently, synthetic biology will be applied to numerous places and benefit greatly to the society.

RDFZ-China,2017,Team:RDFZ-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"ynthetase form until modified by 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferases, which is Sfp in the case of Bacillus subtilis. The Sfp transfers the 4′-phosphopantetheinyl moiety of coenzyme A to the carrier proteins, thereby activates them. This reaction is an enzyme-substrate reaction, which is suitable to be modeled by Michaelis-Menten equation.
According to Mohammad R. Mofid (2002), the kinetics constants for Sfp and apo-PCP in Michaelis-Menten equation are determined, with a Km of 4.45  ± 1 μM and Kcat of 96  ± 4/min. Based on the calculation of Kcat = Vmax/[E], where [E] is the concentration of enzyme in solution, we can calculate the Vmax for Sfp and apo-PCP binding. Then a system model of Michaelis-Menten equation can be built for the reaction.
Enzymic Reaction of Surfactin Synthesis
The synthesis of surfactin involves an enzymic catalyzed reaction. Therefore we use Michaelis-Menten equation to calculate the rate of reaction between substrate amino acid and holo surfactin synthetase, when the concentration of enzyme is constant. We deduced that the overall rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration of enzyme, so we multiply the concentration of holo synthetase to the reaction rate which is affected by substrate concentration.
Sensitivity Analysis
Compared to the sophisticated pathways existing in nature, our model is a relatively simple simulation, but still, it leads to a model with many parameters. Apparently, those parameters do not contribute equally to the final result. By using Sensitivity Analysis in Matlab, it is possible to find out which one is the factor that has the greatest influence.
The sensitivity analysis uses complex approximation to calculate the derivative of the final out value respect to each initial individual parameters.
Result
The graph we obtained from model using Matlab shows that the graph, the concentration of holo synthetase grows exponentially, the concentration of amino acid decreases exponentially until it reach zero, and the concentration of surfactin increases exponentially until amino acid reaches zero: no substrate available. The reaction rate of surfactin synthesis does not decrease when substrate amino acid is at low concentration and deceasing because the concentration of  holo synthetase is increasing exponentially; however, we still reckon low concentration of substrate should be more determinant compared to high concentration of holo synthetase.

At the beginning of the experiment, we directly constructed the plasmids of YebF-IL10 and                 YebF-myrosinase, but the effect of extracellular detection was not satisfactory. During the                 participation in CCiC, iGEMer suggested that we first start from testing the performance of the                 secretory tag, so we constructed the plasmid YebF-GFP shown in Figure 5A. To express IL10 and                 myrosinase, we constructed plasmids IL10-flag and myrosinase-his as shown in Figure 5B and Figure 5C.

The supernatant was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and                 the supernatant was taken for fluorescence detection. The results are shown in the Figure 6.

The value of foundational advance projects always lies in their application, whereas there's still a long way to go from lab experiments to fully functional products. For instance, it's the researchers' responsibility to consider the safety issues raised by the interaction between the application and the human society. Considering the possible application of our project, we decided to conduct an investigation on the perception of average customers held towards the biosafety issues on common biological enzyme preparation. Besides, we participated in a series of academic conferences, during which we exchanged our ideas with other participants and sought out for chances of collaboration.
Investigation
During the CCiC conference, we were inspired by the wide-ranging examination on biosafety issue team Peking presented. Considering the possible application of our system, we've decided to conduct an investigation on the perception of average customers held towards the biosafety issues on daily-life-related enzyme containing products.
We independently designed an online questionnaire, collected 451 responses and analyzed the data using SOJUMP. The analysis is as follows.
Demographic Variables
Gender and Age
The male-female ratio of respondents was not the ideal 1:1. This result might be caused by the imbalanced gender composition of our school, but we don't think this imbalance have a major impact on the overall outcomes. Other than that, this is a interesting character of our school. The respondents were of all ages, whereas the majority population (78%) were young people between 18 to 29 years old.
Gender and age composition
Occupation
The respondents were from all sorts of fields with a majority make-up of students (84%), owing to our educational surroundings.
Ocupation
Education Qualification
In the sample population, the educational qualification of majority was undergraduate degree or above, accounting for 77.17% of all respondents.

""The question is not, ""Can they reason?"" nor, ""Can they talk?"" but ""Can they suffer?”"" ― Jeremy Bentham, The Principles of Morals and Legislation
Animal Ethics
Figure 1: A laboratorie rat.
Experimenting on animals goes back to the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE BCEBefore common era. and the attitude towards animal rights has shifted a quite many times.  The issue then, is the same as today.  Can experimenting on animals reach a universal ethical justification or do we have to rely on particularism What kind of rights should animal have? Choosing the universalistic approach means that we will have to provide some arguments that cannot be refuted, and make sure that these arguments could be applied to all situations at all times and at any place. The particularistic approach gives every single situation its ""own"" ethical code. That means that what is right in situation A, can be wrong in situation B.  At first sight this seems as the most natural intuition, but digging just a bit deeper shows that its consequences is too radical and the boundaries between right and wrong becomes blurred. Through history many philosophers have joined the debate about animal rights.
The first philosophical rationalist, Renè Descartes (159"
Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#KeepFresh_-_-_TEXT.html," unknown whether the quantity or application of latex in this case will trigger such reaction, but it must be noted as a consideration nonetheless.
Interactions
The impact this technology will have on other processes is not extreme. The most significant impact that can be expected is a loss of employment. Current industry best practice requires significant labour input to hand check fruit for firmness/ripeness. A capacity to cheaply and accurately use ethyele measurements as a proxy for fruit ripeness would mean that industry would be able to significantly reduce labour requirements. A cheaper, faster and potentially more accurate method for determining the stage of ripening in fruit would also potentially mean that produce imports and exports will increase as the risk associated with produce wastage due to rotting/spoilage/over-ripening during international shipments will decrease. Increased global fruit movements could potentially increase the risks associated with cross-border biocontamination. This could be combatted by strict border quarantine routines.  Another potential disruption comes to mind when assessing the future areas of research that stem from this proposal. Once ethylene measurement has been optimized and made practical, accurate and easy, there is the potential that ethylene manipulation will be more prevalent. That is, an easy measuring system will allow for more accurate and dynamic manipulation of ethylene levels. In general, this would be expected to mean less waste across the perishable fruit and vegetable supply chains. Spoilage leads to losses globally of up to 50% of fresh produce, depending on the type of produce. An ability to cheaply and accurately measure ethylene may help producers, retailers and consumers in developed and developing countries to significantly reduce fruit and vegetable losses.
Environmental Impact
Positives
There are many positive environmental impacts of our biotechnology. From an application point of view, minimizing produce wastage results in less landfill, less garbage, and a higher return on agricultural land. Also, the stickers are 100% biodegradable, meaning that their environmental footprint it extremely low as they will break down completely. Designing the stickers to be biodegradable rather than recyclable is much more practical as consumers are much more likely to dispose of the sticker with their fruit scraps in a normal bin, rather than separating the sticker to dispose of for recycling.
Negatives
It can be argued that individual labelling of produce adds unnecessarily to the waste stream. Individually, the stickers would be small, but cumulatively the millions that would potentially be used, even if they are biodegradable, add to the environmental impact of fruit production. This can be weighed against the reduction in food waste that is expected to flow from better control"

SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
Synthetic Biology is basically the fusion of biology and engineering and can be defined as the design and construction of new biological entities such as enzymes, genetic circuits, and cells or the redesign of existing biological systems. The common goal is the design and construction of new biological functions and systems not found in nature. Therefore scientists who engage in synthetic biology research have two essential tools: The first tool is a living system which can be used as a so-called chassis. This biological system (e.g. microorganisms like bacteria, yeasts or even mammalian cells) will later accept the new synthesized DNA part which can simply be a gene from completely different organism. The second tool is BioBrick standard biological parts which are DNA sequences of defined structure and function and share a common interface and are designed to be composed and incorporated into living cells such as E. coli.
APPLICATION AREAS
Synthetic Biology includes the broad redefinition and expansion of biotechnology, with the ultimate goals of being able to design and build engineered biological systems that process information, manipulate chemicals, fabricate materials and structures, produce energy, provide food, and maintain and enhance human health and our environment.
SAFETY AND ETHICS
Synthetic Biology is an exciting multidisciplinary field that promises many benefits, whilst at the same time raising important social and ethical issues. The possibility that humans can create life, either from pre-existing organic parts or from inorganic materials – ‘’playing God’’  - has been the subject of considerable cultural worry. Opposition by civil society groups to Synthetic Biology has been led by the ETC Group who has called for a global moratorium on developments in the field and for no synthetic organisms to be released from the lab. In 2006, 38 civil society organizations authored an open letter opposing voluntary regulation of the field and in 2008 ETC Group released the first critical report on the societal impacts of synthetic biology which they dubbed ""Extreme Genetic Engineering"".

Dundee,2011,Team:Dundee#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," the debate. The stand will be present throughout the whole of the open day providing an opportunity to speak to a large number of people with an active interest in science. The open day is more than just an opportunity to educate people about synthetic biology. We feel that it fits into our program of offering solutions rather than just philosophically wondering about the state of synthetic biology. By using university open days, we will target a group of inquisitive and interested people. We believe this will be a more effective marketing campaign than wider focus events that broadly target the community in a context were people are not specifically interested in the subject. The solution of working with an engaged public and then further using this to spread information is a valuable bridging system between the scientific community and the general public.
Conclusion
Our main aim was to address problems in a practical manner while laying groundwork for future iGEM teams to develop on. Only by understanding and embracing these associated problems can we come up with long-term solutions. We feel that the Dundee University iGEM team has made a number of novel steps in the right direction, better defining the purpose of human practices while solidifying the its place within all aspects of synthetic biology.

From the components we had gathered through research, we created three initial design ideas.
TetR Design. In this design, the TLP gene is under a pTet repressor and is therefore repressed in the presence of TetR. TetR expression is regulated by the phlF repressor, which is induced by fusaric acid. When fusaric acid is not present, phlF is not able to repress and TetR is freely transcribed and translated, therefore binding to pTet and repressing TLP transcription. In the presence of fusaric acid, phlF is activated, TetR is no longer transcribed and degraded in the cell, thereby allowing for the transcription and translation of TLP.
Antisense Design. In this design, translation of TLP is inhibited by the expression of antisense RNA. Similar to the mechanism of the TetR design, TetR is replaced by TLP complementary DNA.
T7 Design. This design is similar to (A), except a T7 polymerase is controlled by pTet, which is repressed by TetR when fusaric acid is not present. The TLP is transcribed by this polymerase. Only when the T7 polymerase is expressed can the TLP be expressed.
Design
Pros
Cons
TetR
Simple, easiest to construct
Low expression of TLP (weaker promoter), iffy time scale (would TetR be degraded fast enough)
Antisense
Pretty neat idea, more novel, quick RNA degradation rates, smaller plasmid
Need correct ratio - causes need to limit TLP transcript number, slightly harder to make
T7
Optimized for production - T7 very fast, efficient polymerase
Higher metabolic toll, bigger plasmid
All
Unsure if E. coli will survive before production of TLPUnsure if TLP will be able to go outside of cellsUnsure if amount TLP produced will show significant changes in fungal growth
All three of these designs have the same logical format: If there is no fusaric acid in the environment, something will inhibit TLP production. When fusaric acid is present, that inhibition will be taken off and expression will occur.
After some mathematical modelling and assessments, we decided that the antisense system was the best option, and so it was incorporated into our final design.
Additionally, we initially predicted that eventually the overexpression of the TLP will kill the cell causing TLP release to the exterior surroundings. This TLP would be available"

Cadmium Detector
     Prompted by reports of the adverse health effects of heavy metal contamination in water, our 2012 iGEM team began working on the first of several heavy metal detectors. We wanted to help both local farmers and farmers in other countries, especially third-world ones, who have found their crops tainted by heavy metals such as cadmium, arsenic, and lead. In 2013, we read reports showing that areas surrounding Duke Energy's Buck Steam Station are affected by coal ash containing cadmium, in a region fairly close to home for our team. We decided to focus primarily on our cadmium detector, especially after learning that water affected by the cadmium containing coal ash becomes hazardous and can potentially cause health issues ranging from kidney damage to death. Our detector creates green fluorescence while in the presence of cadmium. After building the first version of our detector, we worked to increase its sensitivity, allowing it to respond to much lower levels of cadmium, at an amount where the knowledge could be useful and not redundant due to the deaths already caused by the cadmium. Last year, we added the 2007 Cambridge team's sensitivity tuners to the detector. After seeing indications of a peak at lower levels of cadmium than we had previously, we began to use test points that were closer together and discovered a peak of fluorescence. This year we built and tested an alternate version of our previous detector.
     The new detector uses a phi-delta activator instead of an Ogr activator, and we discovered promising differences between the detector and the control. According to the 2007 Cambridge team's website, they saw differing results for the efficacy of the phi-delta activator versus the Ogr activator, especially when tested with or without an induction system. We decided to test the phi-delta activator as well as the Ogr activator to see if in our different environment we had improved results with one of them.

Alberta,2012,Team:Alberta#Humanpratices_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM can help stop the spread of antibiotic resistance, which is a rising health and safety concern across the world.
      We also note that one of our advances provides a potential new mechanism for preventing the leakage of genetically modified material into the environment, i.e. a safety switch. By placing an essential gene in the origin of replication under inducible control, plasmid replication becomes dependent on the presence of the inducer. In a situation such as a hypothetical accidental environmental release, the plasmid will be rapidly lost, preventing the replication of genetically modified DNA in the environment. This is a safety switch, a genetic mechanism which backstops the usual lab hygiene practices which prevent unintended environmental contamination. Widespread use of conditional replication mechanisms such as this one could help ameliorate public concerns about the presence of genetically modified organisms in the environment.

Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," ns. This can be explained by the fact, that we manually concatenated the isomerase protein with the crystal structure of the ovispirin protein, which in this initial fusion state is sub-optimally folded. The ovispirin domain undergoes some conformational changes, since it is now connected to the larger isomerase domain Figure 3.1/3.2). We also analyzed the RMSD value over the time of the simulation only for the isomerase domain, since the iGEM Team Paris-Bettencourt was particularity interested in the influence on this domain while being fused to the ovispirin. The plot indicates some minor changes, but the conformation remains stable overall, without the ovispirin domain interfering heavily with the isomerase domain (Figure 4).
Epitope Revomal
The second step of our workflow was the identification of the T-cell MHC class II immune epitopes for the three most prevalent alleles in central Europe and their removal by specific amino acid substitutions, which do not alter the tertiary structure of the protein. In our deimmunization workflow, we focused on removing the immune epitopes within the isomerase domain, since there are barely any known homologous of the ovispirin protein. This lack of related protein drastically decreases the accuracy of our deimmunization tool and chances are high to get a structurally unstable and nonfunctional protein. That’s why the following epitope related data are for the isomerase domain only. Initially, we identified a total of 126 immune epitopes for the three alleles mentioned above in the isomerase domain. Between residue 100-130, the isomerase domain has a cluster of amino acids which are part of many different epitopes. This makes the isomerase domain a good candidate for a deimmunization, since the substitution of single amino acids in this cluster, can destroy a large number of epitopes.
Our algorithm calculated the following three amino acid substitution, as a compromise between the maximum structural integrity and the minimal immunogenicity of the protein (Table 1).
These three substitutions reduce the number of immune epitopes to 85, which is a reduction by ~33%.
Table 1 Computed amino acid point mutations in the L-fucose mutarotase protein to reduce the immunogenicity.

We set up a PCR of the construct 11 primers and BBa_J04500 + TALE A and BBa_J04500 + TALE B template DNA. The gel of the PCR products showed bands about ~2900bp in length.
Because the PCR product was shorter than expected for the first Kapa PCR (construct 10), we also did a PCR of the BBa_J04500 + TALE A and BBa_J04500 + TALE B with BioBrick primers and with specially designed TALE primers to confirm the length of our TALEs. The results were good (figure 23).
Figure 23.Kapa HiFi PCR products of construct 9 and 10, BBa_J04500 + TALE A and BBa_J04500 + TALE B .
We did a Kapa PCR of  TALE target sequences and the gel of the PCR products had bands of the expected size (figure 24). After PCR purification, the product was cut with EcoRI and SpeI. We also digested RFP with EcoRI and SpeI. We used the backbone from RFP as the vector for our PCR product and ligated them together.

Regarding our TALE expression and characterization, we did mini expression of TALE A , TALE B , Beta lactamase, BBa_J04500 , and RFP .
Week 18: August 26 - August 30
We did a colony PCR of construct 9 ( pSBIC3 - BBa_J04500 -His- TALE B -link-Kcoil), construct 10 ( pSBIC3 - BBa_J04500 -His- TALE A -link-Kcoil) and the TALE target sequences which were transformed over the weekend. The PCR products were run on a gel, the colonies with the bands of the right size were made into overnight cultures and miniprepped. The gel of the verification digests did not have any bands and the overnight cultures were repeated with good results. Construct 9, construct 10 and the TALE target sequences were sent for sequencing.
The PCR product of construct 11 ( pSBIC3 - BBa_J04500 -His- TALE A -link-Blac) was purified and cut with EcoRI and AgeI and ligated with the vector, linker and Beta lactamase, which was cut with EcoRI and NgoMIV. The products were"

French Meetup
During the last weekend of August (29-30th), Bordeaux hosted the french meetup with the help of Capsciences (Scientific Museum in Bordeaux specialized in scientific popularization). We invited all french and francophone teams. Unfortunately, some teams couldnt assist but iGEM KU_Leuven (Belgium) , iGEM EPLF-Lausanne (Swizerland), iGEM Paris-Saclay , iGEM Paris Pasteur , iGEM Aix Marseille and iGEM Toulouse (France) came and enjoyed that moment with us.
On Saturday morning, iGEM Bordeaux organized a scavenger hunt in the city. The objective was to answer questions about synthetic biology and other iGEM projects to find clues for the next location they needed to go to. Divided into three teams, we were able to visit the beautiful city of Bordeaux which ended in a picnic at the Cap Science Museum!
There, teams presented their projects in front of other teams and general public at Capsciences and  we talked about the inconvenient and advantages of each project. Each team had to make their presentation understandable for everyone. We also were lucky to have a theatre expert who gave us constructive feedback on the best way to present our projects at Boston and to a non-scientific public. You can see the French presentations down below! When every team finished their French presentation, each team made a very quick presentation of their project in English without a powerpoint, and then again, the public gave some advice for each team. You can see our English presentation following the link down below! After a long day of walk and talk, we went into a restaurant and went home to have a well-deserved rest to be ready for the Sunday activities.
On Sunday, we all met at the Parc Bordelais to do some activities proposed by other teams. Paris Saclay organized a debate about biosafety, and prepared a short video for each iGEM team presentation. This encouraged all teams to think about safety considerations in their project and allowed us to discuss general safety issues such as containing genetically modified organisms and ensuring that they do not become out of our control.

Worm RNA from India
Flying our ideas to reality – Two team-members travelled to India  to learn about the environment our test needs to function in and to build up a network that helped us being the first to decode the transcriptome of lysed T. solium eggs and to prepare a clinical study for our diagnostic test.
T. solium is endemic in India
Data from the WHO indicate that infections with the pork tapeworm is endemic in India. When performing a literature review, we found only few small studies examining the prevalence of T. solium in India. So we were full of uncertainty, when we sent two team members to India in order to explore the context in which our diagnostic test might be used in the future.
Meeting the People's Vigilance Committee on Human Rights
Upon our arrival, we met Dr. Lenin from the Human Rights organization PVCHR, who gave us the chance to accompany social workers to Musahar communities, where poor and discriminated people live in small collections of huts. PVCHR suspected a high chance that people in these villages are infected with the pork tapeworm.
Standard of T. solium  diagnosis in India
At this point we learnt how important it is to develop a rapid field test: Currently the infection is diagnosed by microscopy, but trained stuff and equipment are usually located in regional hospitals close to the hospitals. Driving to the next hospital can take more than two hours. Unfortunately,  the villagers are forced to work long hours and in harvesting season even 6-7 days a week to secure a minuscule income for their families. Many of them never went to a hospital and are superstitious. Therefore, we and PVCHR believe it would be best, if trusted social workers handle our test on site in the village.
RNA sequencing
Next, we went to a government hospital, a private hospital and several clinical laboratories to meet physicians and to discuss our idea and their thoughts on T. solium. Many physicians, in particular Dr. Dilip Mishra (picture), were very interested in a"

Collaboration
The emphasis that iGEM places on collaboration allowed us to improve our project and connect with other young scientists. We appreciated the opportunities this provided us and understand that it is a reflection of how the scientific process works in the real world. Over the course of the summer, we collaborated with four different teams: Missouri S&T, WashU/Penn State, The University of Virginia, and the University of Georgia. As this was our first year as an iGEM team, we also received assistance from the WashU/Penn State team, who quickly became our good friends and mentor team.
In July, we attended the Heartland Synthetic Biology Meetup, hosted by Missouri S&T. We helped Missouri S&T and Washington University host a public forum discussion on synthetic biology and host an educational event for children.
Our collaboration with the Virginia iGEM team consisted of us assisting them with a survey about biocontainment. This survey will be used to create a pamphlet for future iGEM teams that provides them with information about biocontainment and help make informed decisions in order to improve their practices. Improved biocontainment also serves the dual purpose of inspiring more trust from the public. The team created a badge that is now proudly displayed at the bottom of this webpage.
Finally, we helped to characterize the expression of an mCherry gene from the University of Georgia iGEM team. They sent us cells that had already been prepared to express the gene and we used our plate reader to take measurements of the fluorescence of their cells. This was all part of a larger multi-team collaboration effort meant to gather measurements from multiple sources in order to standardize their results.
Additionally, the Washington University St. Louis / Penn State iGEM Team  provided us with water samples. We plan to use these samples to test base nitrate levels and to potentially simulate a real-world environment for the testing of our system. They also provided us numerous contacts for potential sponsorship and mentored us throughout the summer.

Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Math Book#CRISPRi_-_-_TEXT.html,"Partition parameter sets as acceptable and unacceptable.
Calculate the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) of parameter Q for acceptable sets, and for unacceptable sets.
Find the maximum of the difference between the two distributions. This is the global sensitivity of the parameter Q.
Repeat steps 5-8 for all parameters in the system.
The supporting argument for this approach derives from the meaning of the differences in ECDFs. Without loss of generality, consider the acceptable set ECDF to be always greater than that of the unacceptable set. If there is a large difference between the two ECDFs, then a change in the parameter - near the location of the difference - will cause a major change in error (past the threshold to unacceptable). This can be restated as a change in behaviour. However, a small difference in the ECDFs implies that the parameter did not have a major effect on the error and so the parameter did not significantly change behaviour compared to other parameters.
Using a Matlab script, the plots above were generated to show the ECDFs of the acceptable and unacceptable sets for each parameters. It was observed that there was a significant difference in the ECDF for mRNA YFP Degradation and production compared to most other parameters. More significantly, other parameters showed a relatively minor effect. The team concluded that in order to supplement CRISPRi repression, the mRNA needs to be the new target.

Integrated Human Practices
From our initial idea, the design of our toehold switches and our model to the future applications of our project, the opinions of specialists have been vital in influencing our work.
Here, we have broken our project down into its different parts. For each, we explain the role feedback played in improving the aspect of the project, and why we changed what we did.

Dr Kirsten Jensen
Our initial constructs used a constitutive promoter. After cloning our construct in pSB1C3 plasmid, we attempted to amplify them in E. coli. However upon sequencing the amplified inserts, none of the sequences were what we expected to find.
We asked Dr Kirsten Jensen, an expert in synthetic biology at Imperial College London for advice. She inspected our sequences and suggested that the transcripts from our constructs were toxic to E. coli. She therefore suggested that we switch our promoter to an inducible promoter to avoid synthesis of the transcript during amplification in E. coli.
Following her advice, we used an arabinose inducible promoter, which resolved the issue for the 15b-5p switches and allowed us to continue with our experiments. However, the 27b-3p switches were still toxic.
See the results page for more details.

Figure 9b. Prototype for Continuous Time Model
SIRV model for the interaction between bacteria and phage populations. As susceptible bacteria replicate and grow, they reach the threshold (the peak observed) for mass action, where the probability of phage infection increases greatly, at which point most susceptible bacteria become infected, causing a drastic increase in the population of infected bacteria. Then, as infected bacteria are lysed, their decrease is accompanied by a surge in the phage population, which reaches 2.0e9 about six hours after inoculation. As with the previous model, although the number of susceptible bacteria decreases greatly, their population is never truly zero due to the constant influx and intrinsic rate of natural increase. At any given moment, however, the entry of susceptible bacteria into the system is followed immediately by the infection of these bacteria by phages. Therefore, the number of phages continues to increase gradually, and the total number of dead bacteria also gradually increases.
Bacteria that have grown resistance to phage infection are not affected with the concentration of phages. Their growth resembles the natural bacteria lifecycle with a log phase (20-25 hrs after inoculation) following a lag phase (0-20 hrs after inoculation). Without a limiting factor (figure 9a), the log phase will continue indefinitely, as the figure on the left shows. With a limiting factor (figure 9b), the population will reach their carrying capacity, and the curve levels off into a stationary phase, as the figure on the right shows. Additional resistant bacteria may also be introduced to the system through mutation of the susceptible population.
Discussion:
This model explains the fact that bacteria and phages may co-exist in the natural environment—over time, some individuals of a bacteria population undergo genetic mutation and become resistant to phage infection. These individuals are subsequently selected for, and the bacteria population evolves. The “disappearance” of susceptible bacteria can be partly explained by evolution, and partly by our assumption that phage infection is instantaneous. A better way to construct the model would have been to use a system of delayed differential equations (DDE), but that is beyond our current ability.
The model suggests that the evolution of the bacterial population may pose a problem to the implementation of our system. If we use the same strain of bacteria and their corresponding phages over long periods of time, the entire population may grow resistance to the phage, meaning that our engineered phages will no longer be able to reproduce and our system no longer functional. To correct this problem, we may need to introduce another strain of bacteria that is vulnerable"

Draft Specification
This section details a draft specification for the next version of Eugene, Spectacles, and the Clotho environment. These specification descriptions assume the reader is familiar with the current state of the projects (i.e. has read the appropriate pages on this wiki). The specs involve an ordered list of tasks along with approximate dates when these should be completed by.

Add a way to express the relationship of parts in a device to resulting transcripts - December 2009
Currently there is no clean way to say which parts are associated to a particular transcript after transcription. It would be ideal to have a way to do this so that rules can be applied on a transcript based level. Often interactions are on a per transcript basis.
Add support for rules defined over part definitions (i.e. not just part instances) - December 2009
Current rules are constructed as such: Rule r1(partInstance1 WITH partInstance2). It would be very powerful if we could state: Rule r1(partDef1 WITH partDef2). This would remove a lot of repetition in rule creation when one wants to state something abstract regarding a whole set of parts.
More completely support SB/DTP (Synthetic Biology Data Transfer Process) with XML export and import - Spring 2010
Current we can produce a limited XML file from Eugene's interpreter. Ideally we can make this fully compliant with the SB/DTP protocol being developed.
Add support for a completely expressive control statement set (e.g. if, while, for) - Spring 2010
Eugene currently only has if-statements. We will be adding the"

By randomising the amino acid sequence of the CDR-like loops an initial library is created. The extensive loop sequence variation is tolerated by the structure so it stays stable ( Batori et al., 2002 ). Thus allowing binding of the target with high affinity and selectivity ( Skerra et al., 2007 ).
Fig. 1: Protein structure of an Monobody. Constant regions colored in green, variable regions colored in blue.
Nanobodies
Nanobodies are single domain antibodies that originate from camelids like Alpaca and Camel or cartilaginous fish like sharks ( Stanfield et al., 2004 ; van der Linden et al., 1999 .
The nanobody family consist of conventional heterotetrameric antibodies with low-affinity binders as well as unique functional heavy (H)-chain antibodies (HCAbs) with high affinity binders ( Harmsen et al., 2007 . Because a single polypeptide chain is expressed, they are better suited for phage display than Fragment antigen-binding (Fab) fragments ( Holt et al., 2003 ). The H chain of these homodimeric antibodies consists of one antigen-binding domain, the VHH, and two constant domains. HCAbs fail to incorporate light (L) chains owing to the deletion of the first constant domain and a reshaped surface at the VHH side, which normally associates with L chains in conventional antibodies ( Muyldermans et al., 2003 ).
Therefore, the production takes place in liquid cell culture and thus production in large quantities is simple with higher yields than Fab fragments ( Holt et al., 2003 ). They consist of a single monomeric variable antibody domain and a universal Nanobody-framework (in our case cAbBCII10). With a size of 12-15 kDa they are slightly bigger than Monobodies but still able to penetrate hard tissues like solid tumours ( Holt et al., 2008 ). Research lead to various applications in the therapeutically field. For example, a humanised scFv is in phase II testing to reduce mortality and myocardial infarction in patients undergoing graft surgery for coronary artery bypass ( Saerenset al., 2003 ). Also therapeutically application against the influenza A H5N1 virus has been shown in mice where it reduced the replication rate significantly.  Even in oral immunotherapy Nanobodies are used ( Harms"

Mammalian cell culture in microfluidic devices
Purpose
Microfluidic device fabricated by BU Hardware iGEM Team.
Integration of microfluidic devices has advanced considerably in quantitative biological research [1][2]. The timing of the fluid flow can be regulated with high accuracy because of the short response time of in-chip membrane valves (as quick as 1 ms)[1]. Moreover, with the aid of hydrogel, cells growing in microfluidics can be structured in three-dimensional geometries [1]. Therefore, cell culture performed in microfluidic devices could resemble in vivo conditions due to tight control of the microenvironment [2].  On the other hand, automation is another advantage of microfluidic technology. Instead of manual intervention, programmable fluid flows can automatically change chemical conditions of the culture environment. This feature would be particularly useful to examine dynamically changing systems [1]. The ability to precisely control fluid flows and chemical species as well as the automation of microfluidic technology are highly beneficial to future development of our project. Thus, the MIT iGEM team decided to collaborate with the Boston University Hardware iGEM team to develop a protocol for mammalian cell culture in microfluidic devices .
How does microfluidics benefit our project?

Collaboration
We collaborated with the Boston University Hardware iGEM Team to culture mammalian cells in their microfluidic devices.  We started with the simplest experiment, which is growing HEK293 (Human Embryonic Kidney) cells in a microfluidic device. We performed the experiment with two different device models.

We also tested the response of BBa_K381001 to NO in the Distribution Kit (Figure 3).
We transformed the plasmid containing BBa_K381001 into DH5α, and cultured at 37 ℃ overnight to dilute                 to OD = 0.4. Then we took half as control and the other half added SNP aqueous solution and induced at                 37 ℃ for 6 h. Then we detected the fluorescence using a microplate reader and a fluorescence microscope                 (Figure 4).

2.Production
At the beginning of the experiment, we directly constructed the plasmids of YebF-IL10 and                 YebF-myrosinase, but the effect of extracellular detection was not satisfactory. During the                 participation in CCiC, iGEMer suggested that we first start from testing the performance of the                 secretory tag, so we constructed the plasmid YebF-GFP shown in Figure 5A. To express IL10 and                 myrosinase, we constructed plasmids IL10-flag and myrosinase-his as shown in Figure 5B and Figure 5C.
A, the construction of our YebF-GFP using strong promoter. B, the construction of IL10 production module. C, the construction of myrosinase production module.
When testing the validity of the secretory tag YebF, we transformed the constructed YebF-GFP plasmid                 into DH5α and cultured overnight at 37 ℃. The supernatant was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and                 the supernatant was taken for fluorescence detection. The results are shown in the Figure 6. But we                 forgot to set up a positive control group. Due to time constraints, we have no time to repeat this                 experiment.
We transformed the IL10-flag plasmid into BL21, and incubated at 37 ℃ overnight to dilute to OD = 0.2.                 After 2 h of growth at 37 ℃, IPTG was added and induced at 30 ℃ for 16 h. Then, the bacterial solution                 was lysed and the expression of IL10 was detected by western blot (Figure 7).

LOV-tetR
Beside the unfolding and the dimerization, the Jα helix lies directly behind the normal Lov domain could also make the effective signal output by conducting the allosteric signal. This kind of physical mechanical interaction is delivered by the lever arm like helix. This kind of methodology is successful achieved by
Devin Strickland and his colleagues.  Under our condition, constructing a lever arm between the As Lov2 domain and the tetR is quite crucial. Our strategy is forming a helix to helix connection. The C-terminal of Lov2 and the N-terminal of tetR is directly linked together by delete the non-helix-forming amino acid sequence at the linker part. The linker itself construct a Jα lever arm. At the dark situation, the Jα delivered allosteric effect make the lov domain become a hindrance of the tetR binding to the DNA. When the protein exposed to a 450nm blue light, Jα can release the LOV domain, DNA binding activity is restored. That trigger the repression switch, expression under the PtetO will be repressed.
Spectrum Analysis
Thus the synchronized oscillation is spatiotemporal distributed; the observation and analysis should be space-time continuum. In order to realize the demonstration of synchronization, we have developed an analysis methodology combining the time-lapse photography and the frequency spectrum analysis.
Time-lapse photography
TOne crucial requirement for the synchronization is the evenly distribution of the bacteria. That means our synchronized oscillation should be performed on a Petri dish, the observation and analysis should adjust to the dish incubation. And there should be absolutely no light disturbance from the environment.
We have built a wooden camera obscura where the bacteria are cultivated. Digital SLR on the top take photos of luminescence every five minutes. Such a process is considered as the Time-lapse photography. This method allows us to analysis the synchronization spatiotemporally and demonstrates it vividly.
Frequency spectrum analysis
Time-lapse photography provides a series of images which listed according to the time order.
To ensure the synchronized oscillation is detectable and reasonable, we choose more than 2000 sampling points on the dish image, and extracted time serials data of each sampling points, and then shown the distribution of frequency of all sampling points by histogram.
By this processing, we could easily"

SWOT Analysis
Risk Analysis
Risk is an extremely important factor of any venture. The key to mitigating risk is to first understand possible risks before they happen, and develop a comprehensive plan to deal with them. Analyzing key strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, a SWOT analysis, can also help in determining where issues may arise.
Understanding our Risks
As with any start-up venture, there are a wide variety of risks that we could encounter. The key to managing these risks is to understand the possibility of them occurring and plan carefully as to how we would mitigate each risk should it arise. There are many different types of risks that we could face including legal, financial, technological & operational, market, people and systemic risks.
Legal Risks
For FREDsense Technologies, we foresee that our key risks will be in the legal category, surrounding the regulatory landscape. As our product is designed to meet a growing market need in Alberta surrounding monitoring in the oil sands industry, successful penetration of our market will involve gaining the necessary safety and technology approval for use in mandated monitoring. This poses a significant risk; if we are unable to obtain this regulatory approval, we will need to identify an alternative route to market or potentially encounter difficulties in industry adoption of our technology. Possible reasons for an inability to obtain this approval could be due to lack of capital to do"

Yale,2014,Team:Yale#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," be the first group to use a genetically recoded organism (GRO) to incorporate L-DOPA in-situ, eliminating the need for any post-translational modification.
Component 2: Anti-Microbial Domain
As our anti-microbial domain, we selected LL-37, a member of the cathelicidin family of peptides, due to the potency of its lipid bilayer disruption by toroidal pore formation. Because this peptide is toxic to the E. coli in which we intend to produce it, we designed a controlled, inducible system that limits basal expression. A novel T7 riboregulation system that controls expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels was designed. This improved system is a precise synthetic switch for the expression of cytotoxic substances.4,5
Addressing Environmental Concerns
Concerns of environmental toxicity often arise in materials being investigated for anti-fouling activity such as copper paints and Muntz metal. Therefore, we set out to develop an anti-fouling coating with strong adhesive activity to limit leachants into the environment. Additionally, the selection of a MAP, found in a biological organism, as our adhesive domain is crucial to maintaining the soundness of our product's eco-friendliness.
Video Walkthrough of our Project
Project Goals
Control Expression of Anti-Microbial Peptides Using an Improved T7 Riboregulation System:
Since we intend to synthesize an anti-microbial peptide, it is possible that the peptide will be toxic to the E. coli used in our synthetic route. To improve our overall protein yield, we designed a plasmid with specific locks in place to control expression of the T7 RNA polymerase, an RNA polymerase from the T7 bacteriophage. When the T7 RNA polymerase is expressed, it can then specifically target the T7 promoter located in a different plasmid upstream of our coding sequence, initiating protein translation. The specific mechanism of our T7 riboregulation system is outlined in a section below.6,7
A Modular Anti-Microbial Construct based on Mussel Foot Protein:
As our adhesive domain, we selected the mussel foot protein (mefp) consensus sequence mefp 1-mgfp 5-mefp-1, which was found to be effective in Lee et al., 2008.8 At the N-terminus, we included a twin Strep-FLAG tag, used in the purification and isolation of our construct and that can be readily cleaved.

Transform ligated C#, M# into DH5alpha.
Day 35
To Do
i)
If colonies have formed from the transformation of ligated C# and M# in DH5alpha, pick colonies and set up overnight cultures in the afternoon. Someone will need to come in on Saturday to miniprep these cultures, consult Mabel for tips and tricks on miniprepping if necessary.
James and Lychee performed minipreps on Saturday and will update on where the miniprepped DNA are in the freezer.
ii)
If colonies have formed for the MG1655 and deltaFliC with C*, D#, L#, O#, pick colonies and set up overnight cultures in the afternoon. These cultures do not need to be miniprepped. The next day, make two tubes of frozen stocks out of each culture, and also since it is now the end of the week, streak some of the liquid cultures onto agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics. If unsure about where frozen stocks of expression cultures should go, consult Mabel.
James and Lychee made frozen stocks out of these cultures on Saturday.
iii)
E* has yet to be inserted into pSB1C3: PCR from gBlock solution.
E* PCR failed. We shall consider PCR-ing directly from gBlocks again, or design long primers to PCR E* out of the completed E# (inserted in pBAD/HisB) plasmid.
iv)
We currently have D# (Lsr Holin), but not an endolysin needed to complete the Holin-Endolysin lysis system. In case our Art-E part (M#) again fails to successfully be cloned, procure BBa_K112806 [pSB1C3] from the 2015 Distribution Kit (Plate 3, Well 12K) and transform into DH5alpha. Subsequently we can potentially insert a promoter in front of it to complete the lysis system.
Colonies formed and the plate was transferred to the cold room.

The nickel chromatography was not completely successful, but there is some purification of Tn5. The Tn5 did not completely bind to the nickel resin and was observed in the flowthrough and wash (lane 6-7). It is recommended to further optimize the nickel chromatography to further reduce losses, and reduce contaminating proteins due to non-specific binding to the nickel resin (lane 9-10). However for our purposes, the losses were tolerated.

SDU-Denmark,2013,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour11_-_-_TEXT.html," one of our main goals with this wiki, to give the community some tools to make good looking, easy to navigate wikis. Access our Style Sheet , Tour Menu , Header and Footer to get a glimpse of the source codes behind our wikis standard elements.
Compliance with the iGEM 2013 wiki requirements
The wiki requirements’ primary purpose is to ensure that the wiki will continue to function, even several years from now. Also, it is important that future teams can look to previous wikis and learn from them; hopefully resulting in even better wikis in the future in the spirit of iGEM’s community sharing.
All wiki requirements are met. Below is an outline of focal points:
All pages, images, and files are hosted on the 2013.igem.org server
This also includes all necessary javascript and JQuery code needed for the wiki to function properly.
No flash was used in the making of this wiki
Since flash is not open-source, it would be impossible for other teams to see how it is made. Besides, flash is not visible from many modern mobile devicesModern mobile devicesiPhones, iPads, Windows Phone 8 and Windows tablets. , which would make the wiki less accessible. Consequently, all animations were done using javascript.
Project description on front page
To welcome new readers, the front page focuses on our project description.
All pages are in the team namespace
We made sure that all our pages are created in the correct namespace, in our case under the Team:SDU-Denmark.

We kept the original iGEM logo in the header as a link to igem.org. The user editing menu is also visible on every page, just above our header. Note that the header collapses to save space, and you may have to scroll to the top of the page to view it, exactly as it does on the igem.org site. This way, menus are in their expected positions and easily accessible to future teams.

About the University
Calgary
Calgary is the largest city in Alberta, and has a population of over 1 million.  It was founded in 1875, when the RCMP erected Fort Calgary (then Fort Brisebois) to protect the western plains from whiskey traders. When the Canadian Pacific Railway reached the area in 1883, Calgary grew into an important commercial and agricultural center. Currently, Calgary's economy is dominated by the oil and gas industry, and major attractions include Canada Olympic Park (the site of the 1988 Winter Olympics), Calaway Park, the Lilac Festival, and the Calgary Stampede (touted as the Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth founded in 1912).  Calgary is also situated near the Rocky Mountains, and plays host to a unique weather phenomenom called the chinook. Famous Calgarians include the young, incumbent mayor, Naheed Nenshi, who is the first Muslim to become mayor of a major Canadian city, as well as the current Prime Minister of Canada, Conservative party leader Stephen Harper.
The University of Calgary
The University of Calgary is ranked as one of Canada’s top comprehensive research institutions. Currently, more than 30,500 students are enrolled in 14 faculties in undergraduate, graduate and professional degree programs. The University contains more than 30 research institutions and centres, including the O’Brien"
Illinois-Tools,2009,Team:Illinois-Tools#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," pathway between the compounds.
Results
Depending on whether the user specified 1 or 3 pathways, IMPtools will generate and display the top pathway(s).  The way it displays the compounds and reactions is through the use of the KEGG ID names that were assigned to them.  One could even look these up on the KEGG database for more information using these codes if they wanted to. Now suppose you see a compound that you do not want to be involved in the pathway.  Simply click on the ""x"" button below the compound to tell IMPtools to ignore that compound, and to re-calculate a new pathway. One can also alter the weights that were assigned to the original query and then re-generate a new pathway by clicking update.
Once you find a path that you like, you are taken to another page in which you will be given the available enzyme and gene data.  With this gene data, ideally you could transfect these genes into a host organism that you would grow colonies of, and your new colonies would essentially be able to convert compound A to compound Z.  Once you have finished looking at the genes and enzyme data, there will also be a stoichiometric matrix that you could look at.  This stoichiometric matrix gives info on what are the costs and products for this pathway.
To finish up, one can download two different files to keep record and organize their results generated by IMPtools.  The first file is a CSV file that one can open up in Microsoft Excel.  This document will include compound, reaction, enzyme, and gene data as well as the stoichiometric matrix.  Although, this feature is not exactly perfect yet and is still in development.  The second file is a text document cantaining XGMML code which can be imported into Cytoscape, a network graphing program.  Using Cytoscape, one can view a diagram of the artificial pathway that they created using IMPtools (example below).
Compounds are represented by circles, and reactions are represented by squares.  The pink circles are the main compounds that are involved in the artificial pathway.  The beige circles are the side-products and side-reactants involved in the pathway that are needed for each reaction in addition to the main compounds.  The black arrows represent the main pathway, whereas the blue and red arrow represent the production and consumption of side products and reactants respectively.
Lastly, out program will be able to take the gene data that you generated with IMPtools and export it as Biobrick(s) (adding necessary primers, etc). These one would then submit"

For the second question, the bacillus strain we selected is native to the bees' gut. It is normally not found in the honey stomach of the bee, even if the bacteria were to get into honey, it will still be in the natural levels. Other than that, according to literature, IPTG is never traced in honey, so our little germs, even if they can make it into honey, will be killed because of our kill switch.
The third question was a hard one because there is actually no real data about the p-coumaric acid levels let alone it is not known if such a thing as p-coumaric acid overdose exists. We used in our system a constitutive promoter for the production of it too. What we expect and what we could argue from literature is that having p-coumaric acid is in all cases preferable. Maybe exceeding levels could cause increased energy consumption and maybe even acid accumulation, a decrease in tyrosine(a precursor of p-coumaric acid) etc. What most probably will happen (and what we actually hope for) is that the natural feedback mechanism will be triggered and control the process. But you are right, a inductive system would have been prettier :)
For the last question, p-coumaric acid is mostly produced by plants. Even vanilla production and cinnamon flavour begins with p-coumaric acid. Many plants produce p-coumaric acid so p-coumaric acid exposure should not cause any harm to them. Besides, p-coumaric acid will be produced in the midgut of the bee, so it is unlikely for p-coumaric acid to find its way directly to the plant.

Ethics
Introduction
The field of genetic engineering is one that is vehemently debated with regard to ethics. We, therefore, must strongly consider the ethical aspects of our project, and make a case as to why this technology should be implemented.
The four moral principles
A good place to start is the four moral principles, as set out by Tom Beauchamp and James Childress. They are non-hierarchical and must be equally examined against each other when we are thinking about a medical treatment.
Respect for autonomy: The patient should be able to choose their treatment (assuming they are able to consent).
Beneficence: We should provide treatment that benefits the patient.
Justice: Health resources should be distributed fairly according to need, fairness and equality.
Non-maleficence: The patient should not be harmed or injured.
A lot of these seem very obvious, but there are examples when the moral principles come into conflict and we must decide on the correct course of action. For example, Jehovah’s witnesses will refuse blood transfusions due to their religious beliefs, even if it means they will die. This scenario brings the principles of autonomy and beneficence into conflict. If we administer the blood transfusion then we will save the patient and abide by the beneficence principle; however, the patient’s autonomy will be compromised. Conversely, if we do not the give them the transfusion, the patient’s autonomy is respected; but they will die and we will not be providing benefit.
Respect for autonomy
In medicine, a patient must always give informed consent if possible. Their decisions should be voluntary, intentional and based on an understanding of any treatment. They should also be able to refuse the treatment and be able to withdraw if possible.
A possible problem with GM probiotics is that a person could accidentally ingest the probiotics if they are found in the environment. This could particularly be a problem in countries with poor sanitation. The bacteria will consequently be given safety features to prevent them from entering the environment.

Biobrick contains biobricks from PartsRegistry together with other similar components created by users. Compartment contains cells and other microscopic organisms that can multiply. compound contains small molecules like IPTG and other compounds. PlasmidBackbone contains plasmid backbones come from PartsRegistry or defined by users. Substituent contains substitutes for template modeling.
:: Species: This container contains definitions of various species defined by Chain-Node Model. Each component stores the cnModel structure of chains and trees. Related reactions are also stored. It is suggested that the constructor of a database stores template species instead of real species in this container. Only in this way can he make use of the power feature of template modeling of MoDeL.
:: Reactions: This container contains definitions of various reactions. Each component has its own compartments, reactants, modifiers, products, substituent transfers, and kinetic law. This forms a detailed description of reactions. Again, constructor of a database is suggested to store template reactions instead of real reactions.
The organizational structure of components in MoDeL is shown in the following figure.
Figure 6: Structrue of MoDeL components
As mentioned above, reference relationships are stored in most components. The following figure shows the relationship between different components, the pointer pointing to a component indicates referencing to that component.
Figure 7: Reference relationship of MoDeL components
It is worth noting that MoDeL does not attempt to include all information about each component. In PartsRegistry, a long list of data in XML format is provided including part author, status, sequence, and even group access information. Such data are redundant for our database since they are not necessary elements needed to construct reaction network. Only the useful data is retained.
Relationship with SBML
SBML(The Systems Biology Markup Language) is a machine-readable language in XML fashion. It's oriented towards describing systems where biological entities are involved in, and modified by, processes that occur over time. As a widely used model exchange standard, SBML is chosen to be the output of our auto-modeling module.
Generally speaking, MoDeL needs not to be conformed to any constraints set by SBML. However, since SBML is a widely used standard, it is better for MoDeL to share common concepts and components with SBML as many as possible. For example, MoDeL still uses rules, function definitions and unit definitions in SBML. By doing so, it will be easier for software tools to change formats between"

In 2006 he became group leader at the Chemical Genomics Centre of the Max Planck Society, Dortmund. Here he was working on the chemical biology of nuclear receptors to understand and modulate the nuclear receptor-cofactor interaction, in close collaboration with Bayer-Schering Pharma, Merck-Serono, and Schering-Plough.  In the middle of 2008 Luc Brunsveld received an ERC starting grant and became full professor in chemical biology in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. In his research Luc Brunsveld uses chemical biology approaches to study protein-protein interactions. Two general themes are: 1) Supramolecular Architectures are being pursued as instruments to modulate protein-protein interactions and 2) the Nuclear Receptor – Cofactor interaction is being investigated as a specific protein-protein interaction with many unsolved questions, possibly amendable via chemical biology.

Dr. ir. Tom de Greef is an expert at modelling dynamic systems and synthetic circuits. Tom is a big help when it comes to the computational and modelling part of our project, giving us feedback and helping us to find the information we need. This often results in enough reading material to fill your day. For a more extensive biography, click on the arrow:
Dr. Ir. Tom de Greef (1980) was born in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and studied at the University of Eindhoven (TU/e), where he received his MSc degree in Biomedical Engineering cum laude in 2004. He completed his PhD at the Department of Chemistry at the same university in 2008 with professors E. W. Meijer and R. P. Sijbesma, working on novel polymeric materials based on quadruple hydrogen bonding motifs. Subsequently, he moved to the Biomodeling and Bioinformatics group headed by prof. P. A. J. Hilbers at the Department of Biomedical Engineering (TU/e), studying self-assembling systems from a computational perspective. He also became assistant professor at this department in 2010. In 2013, Tom de Greef was a visiting scholar in the group of Prof. D. Weitz (Harvard) working on protein affinity screening using droplet microfluidics. Current research themes are centered on the engineering of artificial cellular systems (bottom-up synthetic biology) with the aim to rationalize physicochemical design"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP."

Description
Der var så dejligt ude på landet; det var sommer, kornet stod gult, havren grøn, høet var rejst i stakke nede i de grønne enge, og der gik storken på sine lange, røde ben og snakkede ægyptisk, for det sprog havde han lært af sin moder. Rundt om ager og eng var der store skove, og midt i skovene dybe søer; jo, der var rigtignok dejligt derude på landet! Midt i solskinnet lå der en gammel herregård med dybe kanaler rundt om, og fra muren og ned til vandet voksede store skræppeblade, der var så høje, at små børn kunne stå oprejste under de største; der var lige så vildsomt derinde, som i den tykkeste skov, og her lå en and på sin rede; hun skulle ruge sine små ællinger ud, men nu var hun næsten ked af det, fordi det varede så længe, og hun sjælden fik visit; de andre ænder holdt mere af at svømme om i kanalerne, end at løbe op og sidde under et skræppeblad for at snadre med hende.  Endelig knagede det ene æg efter det andet: “pip! pip!” sagde det, alle æggeblommerne var blevet levende og stak hovedet ud.  “Rap! rap!” sagde hun, og så rappede de sig alt hvad de kunne, og så til alle sider under de grønne blade, og moderen lod dem se så meget de ville, for det grønne er godt for øjnene.  “Hvor dog verden er stor!” sagde alle ungerne; thi de havde nu rigtignok ganske anderledes plads, end da de lå inde i ægget.

Biology can be used as a technology and biotechnology can be broadly redefined to include engineering of integrated biological systems for purposes of processing information, producing energy, manufacturing chemicals and fabricating materials.
The popularity of Synthetic Biology has grown over the last few years as a result of DNA synthesis technology becoming more accessible and cheaper; it is now more affordable to synthesise DNA rather than to clone it. Advances in the field also rely on progress in other technologies increasing speed and lowering costs. This includes DNA sequencing, synthesis of genes and modelling how synthetic genes behave. DNA sequencing increased the understanding of components and organisation of natural biological systems, and the technology that synthesises genes provides the ability to test designs of new parts. Without these advances in technology and their lower costs, Synthetic Biology would not have made as much progression!
Synthetic Biology has done many amazing things. To mention a few: scientists have made plants that glow in the dark hoping to replace lamps in houses so as to use less electricity [6] and other researchers have grafted human skin cells to frames meshed with spider silk, [7] illustrating that Synthetic Biology can be applied in the health and medical fields as well as in the fields of technology and engineering.
Synthetic Biology is growing rapidly and loads of people are getting involved in order to develop new, novel ideas. Students and academics from many different backgrounds are coming together to make a difference in this new and exciting area of study and research. Students can get involved with the iGEM Competition ,  which is a worldwide competition where young scientists design and carry out their own Synthetic Biology projects each year. More Synthetic Biology degree courses and conferences are popping up all over, so it is easy to get involved in this innovative new field!

Do you see our product usable for patients with burns?
“With a bit of change, the product could become useful.”
What kind of wishes have you had earlier for a useful product to burn patients?
“A better handling of the liquid production of the wound, that is often a major problem in the first week after the accident (includes first and second degree burns).”
According to you, is it a type of product that should be focused more on, even though the number of burn patients is decreasing?
“Yes, there is always a need to develop a better, cheaper and more patient friendly bandage.”
Could you imagine our product being used for a different condition or type of wound?
“It could be used as a bandage after surgery in the inguinal region. It is often a quite problematic healing region due to the serum that can create pressure and tighten the region. Serum tapping is a passage for infection every time tapping is made. It is a region of contamination due to tight bandage, patients can not avoid to create pressure on the wound (when they sit), often very moist region (due to sweat) and many more challenges are encountered with diabetics, smoking and overweight patients.”
Should there be added anything to our product so it could be more effective or making the burn treatment easier?
“ A better fluid handling.”
Have you ever encountered resistant bacteria in your working department of the hospital? What measurements have been taken into account to treat these patients?
“Yes, and many different kinds of them. Isolation, protection, hand hygiene and antibiotic treatment after current guidelines for every kind of bacteria, are being followed.”
Can you see a potential in covering the silk in lidocain* to reduce the amount of pain burn patients have to go through? Are there any cons in giving this (today patients who come in to get their bandage removed and gets fibrin** scratched off are not receiving any kind of pain killer)? Can anything be done to get the bandage easier off when it has to be changed after the first couple of days (this type of wound is typically very wet the first couple of days after the injury)?
“Typically, the caregivers recommend the patient to take pain killers (paracetamol and ibumetin, and sometimes morphine preparates) approximately an hour before changing the bandage to reduce any kind of discomfort if the bandage should grab or got stucked in some skin. It could be a possibility to cover the silk with, for example,"

Abstract
iGEM@home is a distributed computing platform build upon the BOINC framework. Volunteers download a client software that receives and runs work packages distributed from a central server. Combining the computational capacity of at least hundreds of personal computers, this approach allows (1) future iGEM teams to run heavy computations without the need of access to a big server cluster and (2) offers the opportunity to spread information about Synthetic Biology and iGEM events and projects. By actively promoting the platform and constantly motivating a growing community of iGEM@home supporters, we managed to accumulated more than 1.5 TeraFLOPS of computational power and displayed about 40,000 screensaver slides"

Notes on culturing
Nitrosomonas europaea
Because this chemolithoautotroph metabolizes ammonia as its primary energy source, this bacterium strain covers a large range of substrates useful for bioremediation, waste management, and possible pollutant degradation. In addition, Nitrosomonas is nitrogen oxidizing and as a result, can limit carbon dioxide fixation in plants.
obtained starter culture from Freddy Chen from George Wells's Lab in the Environmental Engineering department
it is grown in the dark, at 30C, in a special buffer called NE buffer (has specific concentrations of ions)
instead of measuring its OD, (researchers have not been able to culture it past 0.1), we monitored growth by pH
the starting pH should be around 7.5, after about 21 days, the pH will drop to about 6, at which point the culture will need to be split into new flasks
Streptomyces rimosus
Streptomyces is a bacterium that naturally produces key antibiotics used on a daily basis in synthetic biology (such as chloramphenicol and neomycin). This particular strain is one of the best industrially characterized strains for the purpose of antibiotic production. Better understanding its genetic compatibility may help with antibiotic resistance.
obtained starter culture from the Kelleher Lab in oncobiology research
it is grown in ISP-2 at 30C, in liquid and on plates
optimal pH for growth is around 7-7.2
Pseudomonas fluorescens
Pseudomonas fluorescence is a lesser known strain of bacteria that naturally produces an antibiotic called mupirocin, which can be used for the commercial purpose of treating ear, skin, or even eye disorders. From a more industrial aspect, this bacterium aids crop growth for agricultural purposes by providing protection from environmental pathogens, infections, and/or toxic pollutants.

Tamagotchip: an online microfluidics demo
Microfluidics Main | How-To Part I | How-To Part II | Tamagotchip
In our quest to promote the use of microfluidics within the iGEM community, we decided to make iGEMers play with a chip from the comfort of their own labs. To do so, we built a web-controlled microfluidics setup, where users can view the chip live and control the valves from a web browser. For historical reasons (see bottom), it was called Tamagotchip, a play on the words ""Tamagotchi"" and ""chip"".
Outline of the web-controlled system: users see a live stream from our microscope, streamed through EPFL's Flash Media Server, and can control the chip from a standard form. AJAX requests, sent by the user, are relayed by the web server to an EasyDAQ card, which in turn controls the solenoid valves of our setup.

The Game
The first demo showed flow and mixing of fluids on chip shaped like an iGEM logo. Two dyes, red and blue, as well as transparent liquid, could be injected into the chip from each side. We showed this demo in Amsterdam during the poster session, and to other groups at EPFL. The demo stayed live for half of September, and most of October, allowing other groups (mostly on campus) to try it out.

Appendix 1-Desk research: Landmines
WHAT IS A LAND MINE?
A land mine is a bomb that is buried in the ground and that explodes when someone steps on it or drives over it [1]. It can lay dormant for years until a person or animal triggers their detonating mechanism. Land mines cannot be aimed and therefore indiscriminately injure or kill not only their targets but also innocent civilians [2].
TYPES OF LAND MINES
There are two main types of land mines: Anti-personnel (AP) mines and anti-tank (AT) mines. Anti-personnel mines are specifically designed to rer"

From 2009.igem.org
Internal Meeting 11 May 2009
Action Points of the Meeting
Set a date for Modelling Tutorial with Goksel.
Model of Metal Intake
Model of sinI Operon
Model of comK system -> someone to write a brief summary on the model(Hanny?)
Promotor library -> Write a program (Java)
Email N.J Robinson regarding building of model (??) (Mathew?)
Email GeneArt directly, asking for discounts (Arun?)
Email Dr. Aldridge regarding DNA shipment (?)
Germination (?)
Prioritise which bricks to synthesize, pull out individual bits (major, exciting parts that will earn medals) due to limited funds. Example: germination stochastic switch, metal sponge, etc.
Mathew to forward the email from N.J Robinson.
Reason why gene is selected
Hybrid promoter for sigma A
Coding (JSim) -> Generate CellML Model on a frontline (James?)
Write up on Cadmium and the environment
Decide which awards to aim for, using Matlab would not get a prize, need to use/rewrite models.
Lab space -> Need to take turns, therefore need to come up with a proper schedule
Minutes of the Meeting
iGEM get-together in Edinburgh 23-24th June (Monday-Tuesday) -> May need to postpone labwork as a result.
sin I operon -> do we really need it? sporulation..?
need pretty pictures of things changing -> criteria for prize.
sigmaA - want to express mnth all the time with sigma A
have 2 promoters infront of smta
make hyprid promotor -> try to model, can do a write up as an idea and put it up on the wiki
Promoter library - Want to build a promoter library with different strands and strengths, not single strands.
Need to alter some of the consensus
Write a program using Java
By looking at the levels derived from ... radiator, find the strength, rank cross no. experiments. Cannot compare the absolute no. microrate -> level of expression for each gene (amount of mRNA of each gene, measure intensity via a software).
