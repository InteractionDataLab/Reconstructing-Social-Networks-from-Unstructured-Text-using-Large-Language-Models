Introduction
Please see"
Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#BioPlastic Recycling: PHB_-_-_TEXT.html," are working to biologically synthesise PLA. We have designed E.coli to secrete proteinase K to form lactic acid monomers, forming half of a second bioplastic recycling system. Lactic acid is used in the chemical synthesis of PLA and so this system could also be implemented in an industrial setting.
Specification
Degradation of P(3HB)
Our bacteria should resist any toxic effects that are associated with P(3HB) or 3HB
Our bacteria should secrete a functional (P3HB) degrading enzyme
Synthesis of P(3HB)
Our bacteria should take up and internalise 3HB from the surrounding media
Our bacteria should be able to utilise P(3HB) as a sole carbon source
Degradation of PLA
Our bacteria should secrete a functional PLA degrading enzyme
Our bacteria should be tolerant to lactic acid
P(3HB) Degradation: Pathway▼
The phaZ1 enzyme from Ralstonia eutropha can break down PHB. This bacterium uses PHB as storage molecule and expresses PhaZ1 when it needs to mobilise the nutrients from the polymer inside the cell. In our system, the enzyme will be secreted.
P(3HB) Degradation: Biobrick design▼
BBa_K1149010 : Extracellular expression of phaZ1, PHB depolymerase enzyme. The construct design incorporates the RBS 0034 and is regulated by a strong xylose-inducible promoter BBa_I741018 . For extracellular secretion, we fused pelB secretion tag BBa_J32015 to the N terminus of the protein.
There are many strategies for secretion in E.coli and you can read about these on our Secretion Guide page and find the corresponding biobricks and iGEM projects. If you are currently in the process of designing a Genetically Engineered Machine and aim to secrete a protein in E.coli, this page provides a good starting point to look for information.
Synthesis of P(3HB) from 3HB: Pathway▼
For the Plastic Fantastic recycling module, we designed a modifications to the PHB synthesis pathway of the Resourceful Waste module. The additional steps connect 3-Hydroxy-Butyrate to the downstream metabolite of the synthesis: acetoacetyl-CoA where from the next two steps are carried out by phaB and phaA enzymes, as described in Module1.  This pathway contains both new enzymes that we are"
AHUT_China,2016,Team:AHUT China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," displayed and deeply explained our project, to which they gave some great advice such as taking time into consideration in case of traffic congestion to optimize our path planning, shifting the current quaternary system to ternary or binnary system to improve the efficiency in solving comparatively short distances and so forth, which were all very practical, valuable and meaningful.When furthering our understandings, we came to realize some obstacles getting in their way which we might be able to help. In the end, we made decisions about assisting them with producing a practical model designed by them through our 3D printing technology. The practical model is a physical unit which can degree 3-PBA thoroughly and sterilize agricultural waste water. Through our concerted efforts, we have successfully helped them produce the real model of their physical unit, which will be applied to the field to purify farmland runoff water. And we are really looking forward to the physical unit being put into the farm widely and helping to clean up the rural sewage.
（As above pictures presented, the machine was printing the physical model.）
Collaboration with UESTC-Software:
(https://2016.igem.org/Team:UESTC-software/Collaborations)
We helped team UESTC-software to accomplish the part of software testing. They were the developer of the software Bio101. For they need someone who can do an objective testing. We tested the fault tolerance and randomness of Bio101 as their first user and offered them with a software testing report. Meanwhile, we analyzed bzip2 compression algorithm they used in Bio101 through building mathematical modeling. And our members found some problems when using Bio101 in respect of restoring and extracting DNA data. After further analysis, our team made some suggestions to them. Through our cooperation, both of our teams firmly believed that the problem of storing an astronomical number of our pathway information could be solved. Also, their project Bio101 can be put into practice and be got upgraded.
Collaboration with JSNU-China:
(https://2016.igem.org/Team:JSNU-China/Collaborations)
We made a quick flashing video with JSNU-China iGEM team, which was also an interesting part of our human practice. Both we were wearing T-shirts “iGEM” printed on it and dancing. In this form of collaboration, we are like a big family working together to promote iGEM Competition to people around us.

Predator attraction to MeS induced aphid infested plants
Aim: To determine the effect on aphid predators’ attraction to Methyl Salicylate (MeS) induced plants.
Experimental setup: We continue with the same plants used in the experiments to determine aphid population preference (see above), this way we try to create an as close as possible in vivo situation. The predators were subjected to choice experiment - cafetaria model.
Predators: Macrolophus adults
Plants: Small potted MeS induced paprika plants in two ways: via the root or via the leaf, 60 in total.
Concentration: 1ng/ml, 0,8ng/ml, 0,4ng/ml, 0.1ng/ml, 0.01ng/ml of MeS (Sigma-Aldrich, ReagentPlus®, ≥99% (GC)).
Cafetaria model
In the cafeteria model shown above, each concentration will be placed, plus the control, randomly in a circle. The plants should not be close to the edge of the cage in which the experiments are carried out. The plants should be placed in rotation with every repeat of the set-up to eliminate other factors.
Releasing the Macrolophus:
10 Macrolophus (adult) are shaken out of the pot and placed in the middle of the cafetaria model (see picture)

But before that we will present rapidly our iGEM Grenoble history!
iGEM GRENOBLE-ALPES STORY
1) How did we know iGEM ?
We have never had lessons on iGEM but each member of the team has heard about the competition at Grenoble Alpes University (UGA) or Grenoble INP school, by the members of the previous team and the teachers who took them framed.
Then, the team met last November via Pierre Cavailles (the main advisor and a biotechnology teacher at the UGA), and that's how the story started.

    Since the process of encryption and decryption can derive a series of interactive activities, the idea of biological cipher machine itself can be a good carrier of synthetic biology. How does our Enigma machine inspire the public? And what will these voices outside the lab inspire us to reflect on our project?  Continue to find the answer!
 
 
STEM scientific festival
    In July, STEM scientific festival was held in Suzhou, China. STEM is a concept of education that advocates students learning like scientists and engineers, which fits well with the aspects of synthetic biology in a way. We introduced synthetic biology and our project to the public by setting up a stall in the exhibition hall. With the help of a room escape computer game, we attracted lots of attention. We successfully educated people come there, and also got useful feedbacks.

Oneyouth talk and the fair
    We collaborated with a local youth public service organization, and join them as speaker of a national famous skill sharing activity in China, Oneyouth Talk. We talk directly to the public, and heard lots of voices outside the lab. And we also set up our stall in the fair, which allowed participates to sell original goods. In the process of selling the postcards with codes on the back (designed by ourselves), we talked to people who are interested and got useful feedbacks.

Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," However, note that there was significant red fluorescence in all colonies, which is against our expectations seeing as the plates had a fair amount of methionine in them (meaning that the promoter driving expression of the repressors, PMET25, would be inhibited) and no galactose (meaning that there is no inducer for the promoter driving expression of the activators, PGAL1).  Thus, one might expect lower levels of RFP for all plates, low levels of YFP for the activator networks and high levels of YFP for the repressor networks.  These discrepancies could stem from the fact that there is leakiness of the PGAL1 promoters (explaining too much RFP) or the mCYC promoters (explaining too much YFP in the activator plates), that the yeast strain used could have different pathways that affect the activity of the promoters in a different way than originally observed by Ajo-Franklin, or that the media itself contains something that could affect the activity of the promoters.  Also, is the Bacto Agar completely free of both amino acids and galactose/methionine?  If not, it could contribute to changing what we observe on the plates, but would have no effect on the liquid cultures.  The only way it would have an effect is if the Agar somehow complemented the auxotrophies itself, thus allowing cells to grow without being properly transformed.  At the very least, this would explain the difference between the brightfield and fluorescent views. Another possibility to consider is autofluorescence.  What is interesting is the difference in the number of observable colonies between brightfield and fluorescent modes.  One might expect that all colonies on a plate would have the same fluorescence because, in order to grow, they all need to complement the correct auxotrophies as those contained in the shuttle vectors.  That there is a discrepancy here as well might even point to how we linearized the DNA.  It might be worthwhile to run a gel on the linearization digests in case we suspect that they did not cut as we wanted them to.
Description of Bacto Agar:
""BactoAgar is optimized for beneficial calcium and magne-
sium content. Detrimental ions such as iron and copper are
reduced.Bacto Agar is recommended for clinical applications,
auxotrophic studies, bacterial and yeast transformation
studies and bacterial molecular genetics applications.""
It seems we don't have a problem using BactoAgar.  This quote came from http://www.bd.com/ds"

James innoculating LB with pre-culture
1ml of preculture (which had been left overnight) was taken and used to inoculate 200ml of LB (standard bacterial broth). The flask which contained the mixture was then placed into the shaker, which both incubated the culture at 37 degrees Celsius and constantly shook the flask.
Once 2 hours had elapsed, the optical densities of the cultures were taken using a spectrophotometer. This was to determine whether the cells had grown and if they had, where the cells were in their growth phase. For competency, E.coli need to be in early log phase. The results were as follows:
Sample

The next step was to transfer the three cultures into a centrifuge and allow them to spin for 10 minutes, at a speed of 8,000 rpm and at a temperature of 4 degrees celsius. Because balance is required in a centrifuge (i.e. even numbers), we only used two of the tubes.
Hanny preparing pre-culture sample
Once spun, the supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in calcium chloride, which had been placed in a fridge since the solution was made. The concentration of the calcium chloride was 0.1M and the volume was 40ml.
The cells emersed in the calcium chloride were then held in ice for 40 minutes.
Once 40 minutes was complete, the cells were once again centrifuged at a speed of 8,000 rpm and at the temperature of 4 degrees celsius"

The combined functionality was characterized by iodine staining (see picture below). It was performed with Lugol's iodine which dyes glycogen in a brownish color. If more glycogen is present, the color of stainend cultures is darker. The darker staining of BL21 Gold (DE3) transformants of BBa_K1585321 indicates considerably more glycogen accumulations compared to the wild type.
Iodine staining BL21 Gold (DE3) + glgCAB vs. wild type

According to the results from the sequencing order will have to start over constructions since the 1st-steps. A Purification step will be add for all 1st-step construction in order to  get round our resistance issues.
Cloning session :
-> 1st-step construction: RBS-CinI
-> 2nd-step constructions:
TetR-CinR
MerR-CinR
MerR-LuxR
LacI-LuxI
-> 3rd-step construction
pLac + TetR-LuxR
Digestions: Because we are having issues to get 2nd-step constructions. We tried both 3A Assembly and Standard protocols.
Cheking and purification gels: We add a cheking step, before performing ligations on Standard Protocol. To maximise our chance to get 2nd-step constructions, we tried to purified the inserts.
On purification gel, plasmids seem to be digested but inserts is missing. On checking gel, cinI wasn't digested correctly.

6 out of 8 sequence alignments failed.
To perform this constructions, we used standard protocol: we kept the plasmid of the shortest biobrick which we inserted the longest biobrick.
The problem was identified as coming from a wrong identification of antibiotic resistants. In most constructions below, vector and inserts had the same antibiotic resistance. So, even wrong constructions were selected on Petri Dishes.
Enzyme checking
Because we had no results with the latest cloning session, we tested our enzymes.
We tried to digest each site individually. We obtained linearized plasmid. So, enzymes are well working.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Model#Off Targeting_-_-_TEXT.html,".5$). The cleavage probability relative to the on-target is plotted for different types of mismatches. Single mismatches (blue line) are not tolerated well in the central seed region. Two consecutive mismatches (orange line) can be tolerated in the beginning and end of the target. Three consecutive mismatches (green line) are only allowed at the target’s 5’ end.
As can be seen from Figure 3, a maximum of approximately 3 mismatches is tolerated by Cas13a. We can use a binomial distribution to compute the probability that a random target and spacer have at most 3 mismatches (thus having 25 or more matches) is low:
$$ P_{\textrm{at least 25 matches}} = \sum ^{28}_{m=25} \frac{28!}{(28-m)!m!} \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^m \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{28-m} = 1.276 \cdot 10^{-12} \tag{7}$$
Having found suitable model parameters for $\Delta C$ and $\Delta I$, we can now employ the model to compute the cleavage probability for different guides and plasmids (or even entire genomes). We started by investigating the relative cleavage probability of our crRNA 1-5 on the tetracycline-resistance conferring (TcR) plasmid that the crRNAs were designed target (Figure 4). We were able to confirm that crRNAs 1-4 target the plasmid at the desired position. However, we also found that crRNA 5 did not meet the design requirements of the PFS: the position 3’ to the target sequence was a G. This finding prevented us from wasting time on testing crRNA 5 in the lab. This is also the reason why we will not consider crRNA 5 in the remainder of the simulations.

MichiganState,2018,Team:MichiganState#HP Expert Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," small local seed company, Ann Arbor Seed Company, who seemed justifiably nervous about GMO due to risks they have to their business model and the vision of importance of genetic diversity of seeds that we’re losing so quickly. Huge numbers of people growing the same seeds means specialty varieties may become scarce because seeds are not saved or lost. Small companies are even being sued by huge corporations that have GMO seed sovereignty and patents.
Do you shop specifically for non-GMO products?
I shop specifically for organic products, which by definition means I shop for non-GMO products. I appreciate GMO labeling, because people have the right to know what’s in their food and how their food was grown. Preventing somebody from labelling is surprising and unfortunate. But, I also have options of local or non-local organic products. I try to find local, non-GMO, and organic food when shopping, and I can’t always find food that meets all of these criteria. Non-GMO is not as important to me as shopping local though.
What effects do you believe GMO products have on human health?
I have looked at some research on it, mostly older research shared among the organic farming community. One study found that cows chose non-GMO corn over GMO corn when given the two options. In grad school, I learned that higher lignin content in GMO corn may make it taste not as good as non-GMO corn. Early studies have also shown liver and kidney issues, such as studies with the Flavor Saver tomato. I am a follower of the precautionary principle for toxins, herbicides, GMOs, et cetera. However, many of the crops in the United States have skipped the precautionary time period. There has not been enough time to do long range testing on new products to make people feel more comfortable. GM crops came too quickly. Lower income folks felt there was no choice to opt out of this large scale experiment when we converted large portions of corn and soybeans to GMO.
Do you have any other comments or concerns you would like to discuss with us?
The curve of acceptance among GMO farmers was very steep, 90 or 95% acceptance, in crops, but has now leveled out due to price and economic farmers. Some conventional farmers are now relying on non-GMO products. I’ve also talked to conventional growers in West Michigan who have stated that GMO is not worth it anymore. They can get the same yield from non-GMO hybrids as GMO. In some cases it’s simply too expensive to keep growing GMOs.

Overview
Just like “Plants vs. Zombies"" has become one of the most popular games, CRISPR/Cas system learned, borrowed and modified from the natural game “Bacteria vs. Phages"" has been the hottest technology for genome editing. The CRISPR craze wept across scientific community last year. Synthetic Biology and iGEM were no exception. Twelve 2013 iGEM teams worked on CRISPR in their projects, with chassis varying from E. Coli, yeast, to plant and Mammalian. More than a dozen parts related to CRISPR/Cas were submitted last years. Some of them are in the DNA Kit of Parts for 2014 iGEM, shipped worldwide from the iGEM Headquarters. The sgRNA design tools are an important part for CRISPR/Cas technology and have attracted bioinformatician all over the world.
However, all available tools neglect the purpose of a given experiment, pay no attention to BioBricks standards, and do not support standard for synthetic biology data exchange (SBOL). Thus, a sgRNA design tool for genome editing in synthetic biology is desirable. In this project, we present CRISPR-X, a sgRNA design tool fully supporting SBOL and BioBricks standards with dynamic algorithm based on intent function, chassis, and newest experimental data. It adopts a C/S and B/S framework. The program on the server side is implemented with C and front-ends are implemented with Python (Browser ends) or JAVA ( Android ends, Desktop ends ), making it across all platforms.
The Brief Introduction And Functioning Of The CRISPR-Cas Systems
Development of tools for targeted genome editing and regulation of gene expression has significantly expanded our ability to elucidate the mechanisms of interesting biological phenomena, and to engineer desirable biological systems. The clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) in combination with a CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) were recently demonstrated to be versatile tools for genome engineering [1]. Figure 1 shows  the functioning of the type II CRISPR-Cas systems in bacteria. Phase 1: in the immunization phase, the CRISPR system stores the molecular signature of a previous infection by integrating fragments of invading phage or plasmid DNA into the CRISPR locus as ‘spacers’. Phase 2: in the"

The design of experiment
We chose Bacillus subtilis as our chassis, because it has some characters that are very suitable for a “safe moving vaccine factory”.
The following are the reasons:
1. Bacillus subtilis can form biofilm that we think is important for being transferred from fleas to dogs.
2. Bacillus subtilis has many advantages as a tool for vaccine vector.
3. Bacillus subtilis has already been used as probiotics and maybe exists in the internal environment of fleas.
The experiment designs and genetic circuit are as follows:
1.For the vaccine question
In order to know whether our vaccine can activate the immunity system of dogs, we used bacillus subtilis as vaccine vector to express secreted glycoprotein. Five proteins are present in rabies virus particles: nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrixprotein, glycoprotein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Because of containing the neutralizing epitopes which are the targets of vaccine-induced immunity, the glycoprotein can stimulate the organism to produce antibody against Rabies.
Fig. 1. shows the genetic circuit of the device secreting Rabies virus strain ERA glycoprotein in bacillus subtilis. Part K541501 contains constitutive promoter veg(K143012), Ribosome Binding Site spoVG(K143021) and signal peptide SacB. iGEM11_FAGEM designed this part and"

UCLouvain,2016,Team:UCLouvain#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," Ni2+). If, on the same medium, a mutant survives in presence of the ions and dies in its absence or vice-versa, it possibly contains a porin for which the gate opening or closing is regulated by Zn2+ or Ni2+. The mutants selected through this step should be further investigated and characterized.
In the picture below (figure 8), 83 mutants obtained after the first selection have been spotted on 4 selective media to check their potential regulable behavior.
Figure 8: Second selection on selective maltodextrin media in presence and absence of our transition metal ions (Zn2+ and Ni2+).
Here, we can already see some growth differences in several mutants that suggest an influence of transition metal ions present in the medium. However, we didn’t have enough time to replicate the data and further characterize these mutants.
Mutant screening
To analyze the potential regulable leaky mutants, we performed colony PCR reactions to amplify the pIV gene and then check the mutations introduced within the gates.
For the amplification, we used two primers that amplify most of the pIV sequence. This corresponds to 987bp and covers all the mutated regions.
Cycling conditions
Electrophoresis
Figure 9: Amplification of the pIV porin.
Sequencing
Due to a lack of time, we were only able to sequence over 16 leaky mutants that went through the first selection step, each presenting mutations within one of the two gates (see figure 10). For some mutants, we can observe a strong histidine enrichment within the 15 amino acids mutated region, which demonstrates the efficiency of the QuickLib method used for mutagenesis. We observed up to 7 histidines in one of the mutants and the actual porin is made of 12 identical subunits, which means a total of 84 histidines added right on the hinge of this door. Interestingly, some amino acids present in the mutated regions remain quite stable through mutagenesis, suggesting that they may be important for the integrity of the porin. Also, it’s quite surprising to see that the mutated regions are rather resistant to mutations, with some porins presenting more than 10 mutations in the gate.
Figure 10: Sequencing results of the mutated porins. Histidine mutations are shown in red and other mutations are shown in yellow.
These first results are very promising since a lot of colonies were obtained after the first selection step and the sequencing analysis shows mutants with many different amino acid combinations. With additional sequencing results, it will be interesting to do some statistical analysis of"

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice"

2.Would the application of these anti-highlight plants steps into legal area?
Applications, mostly generalization, particularly for merchant manufactory, merchant usage and releasing in environment, may refer to several specific law about variety certification, such as relevant regulation in Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms Safety evaluation management approach, Measures for the examination and approval of major crop varieties which was enacted by Department of Agriculture, and Measures for the examination and approval of forest varieties which was enacted by Department of Forestry and so on.
3.What certification should this kind of plants get before applying in actual manufacture?
Experiments, detection, and even variety judgement, are required to attain relevant certifications after passing regulation process.
Each region has its own regulation. Main forest species passing city level judgment are given certifications respectively by city Forest Variety Approval Committee, and are announced by city Forest Variety Approval Committee.
The species ,which should be certified but have not passed the judgment , should be affirmed by Forest Variety Approval Committee if needed for production. Forest Variety Approval Committee should specify using time limit and appropriate area. If generalizing outside the appropriate area which certificated by the announcement of variety certification, the plants are viewed."
Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html,"anococcus janaschii wild type tyrosyl tRNA consists of two arms: Firstly, the acceptor-minihelix, where the ncAA will be attached to the 3' end and secondly, the anticodon containg arm. Synthetases interact mainly with the acceptor minihelix of the tRNA. Due to the lack of a recognizing element within the anticodon-containing section, a mutation of an anticodon base has a comparatively small effect on the aminoacylation efficiency and may explain why a variety of ncAA can be incorporated with this tRNA. Example measurement proving incorporation of amino acids:
Figure 2:  normalized fluorescence spectrum of mRFP1
Figure 3:  normalized fluorescence spectrum of sfGFP as a sign for successful amino acid incorporation via tRNA/synthetase pair for tyrosine via amber supression
The wild type Methanococcus janaschii tRNA/synthetase pair for incorporation of tyrosine at an amber termination codon (the pair containing the tRNA mentioned above) is co-transformed with pFRY , a flourescent reporter plasmid for measurement of incorporation of ncAA into BL21 DE3 gold, which is induced by 100 µM ITPG. pFRY is one part of the two plasmid reporter system for measurement of incorporation efficiency of ncAA via amber supression. It consists of two fluorescent domains connected through a linker sequence containing an amber stop. When induced with IPTG, a the fluorescence can be measured. A red fluorescence is always visible upon induction, and if an amino acid is incorporated in response to the recoded amber stop codon, a green fluorescence intensity is also measurable. Fidelty and efficiency of the incorporation can be determined by comparison of fluorescent levels. This experiment is performed in order to obtain fluorescence spectra of mRFP1 and sfGFP. As shown above (fig. 3) GFP formation is measured as a result of successful amino acid incorporation via amber supression. Excitation and emission spectra of mRFP1 (fig. 2), and sfGFP (fig. 3) were obtained through measurements with a modified Biolector set-up. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .

NKU_CHINA,2018,Team:NKU CHINA#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," gave some guidance to them and tried our best to help their school build up an iGEM team.
As one of our contributions to the promotion of synthetic biology, we decided to make this popularization of science as an annual event.
5. Cooperate with Team OUC-China
When attending the CCiC conference, we met OUC-China fortunately and collaborate with them in public education and science popularization.
OUC-China provided a science brochure about synthetic biology we used when we promoted synthetic biology in Tianjin’s Middle Schools. The popularization of science was as important as the innovation of science and technology. It was the wings of innovation and development. We took synthetic biology as the foothold of science popularization and participated in the popularization of science together, which greatly improved the depth and breadth of science popularization and strengthened the inheritance of synthetic biology. This is an innovative cooperation.
6. iGEM League Conference in Beijing-Tianjin Region
On September 16th, NKU-CHINA participated in the iGEM league conference in Beijing-Tianjin region. We communicated our experiments and cooperated with other teams. In addition, we invited teachers from the Institute of Biophysics to guide the work of various iGEM teams, who are expert in modeling.
After our discussion, we decided to form a league to hold such a meaningful activity annually. Furthermore, we would do our best to apply for National Science Popularization Day with the help of the league.
7. The iGEM University Joint Conference in Nankai University
On July 6th, we held the iGEM University Joint Conference in Nankai University . This event aimed to promote communication and cooperation between nine universities iGEM teams, and at the same time carry out science popularization to show the charm and essence of iGEM. This was the first time that NKU-CHINA successfully conceived and held this large-scale collaboration activity. Each team introduced their experiments and look for teams that can cooperate according to our needs, the exchange atmosphere was warm and reflected a good collision of thoughts.
What’s more, to show the charm and essence of iGEM, and at the same time to better promote iGEM and synthetic biology among college students so that more people can focus on synthetic biology and participate in iGEM, each team introduced their experiments and preliminary work about synthetic biology on the basis of a common theme. After the report, the teams also answered the audience’s questions one by one in front of their own exhibition boards, expanding the public's understanding of synthetic biology.

Fluorescence Studies
Our fluorescence studies supported the findings of our plating tests. We were able to observe that fluorescence was rapidly lost in the negative control. This was expected due to plating tests demonstrating the loss of plasmid from that group. We were pleasantly surprised to observe that Hok-Sok was able to maintain fluorescence for a longer period of time than typical chloramphenicol pressure.
DH5α Cell Line
Figure 6. Fluorescence measurements of K1783002 (Constitutive unstable RFP) in DH5α cells grown in media containing antibiotic. All measurements are blank-subtracted. Fluorescence is initially high, but rapidly diminishes over time.
Figure 7. K1783002 (Constitutive unstable RFP) in DH5α cells grown in media without antibiotic. Fluorescence is initially low and rapidly diminishes over time. This result supports the notion that cells grown without any pressure quickly lose their plasmids.
Figure 8. K1783003 (Hok-Sok+Constitutive unstable RFP) in DH5α cells grown in media with antibiotic. Fluorescence is initially moderate and diminishes over time. The use of two maintenance systems does not appear to better maintain fluorescence levels than chloramphenicol alone. We suggest that the proximity of the Hok-Sok cassette to the RFP construct somewhat represses expression of RFP due to promoter interference, leading to a lower initial reading.
Figure 9. K1783003 (Hok-Sok+Constitutive unstable RFP) in DH5α cells grown in media without antibiotic. Fluorescence is initially moderate, but remains relatively constant over time, a one-time spike notwithstanding.
Figure 10. Fluorescence measurements of K1783002 (Constitutive unstable RFP) in BL21 cells grown in media containing antibiotic. All measurements are blank-subtracted. Fluorescence is variable throughout testing suggesting an uncorrected factor influencing results. Note: Our initial tests using the BL21 cell line were inconclusive due the need to calibrate our testing protocol.

Midwest iGEM Conference
Michigan State University hosted a small conference for nearby iGEM teams on July 1, 2018. Five teams, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, University of Iowa, Carroll High School, Michigan State University, and our team, attended and each team presented their project design and their plans moving forward. We gave and received feedback regarding design components and potential experiments moving forward.
Rose-Hulman Institute
Following the Midwest iGEM Conference, we reached out to the team from the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology about a potential collaboration. Over a Skype video call, we discussed the current status of our projects and the role that each of our teams could play in helping the other. They were willing to read a few papers that we intended on using as a basis for our mathematical models and suggested two different routes that we could focus on. We provided feedback on their wiki, giving tips and suggestions to make the information more clear and accessible to others. While both of these were relatively simple tasks, they went a long way toward helping us each accomplish our goals.

Model the ComK system – Jane has looked at equations on Goksel’s suggested paper but needs to confer with lecturer about it. Managed to get a simulation working for next meeting!
Model Sin Operon – Goksel has constructed a map with all of the elements involved in the sin operon. Has also written equations in CellML. In addition, Goksel has attempted to write equations for ComK in CellML. Needs to get this stochastic switch model simulation up and running.
Investigate if Sigma A is turned off during sporulation – Jess has put a paper on wiki under ‘Useful Links.’ The researchers found Sigma A in the spores but were unsure whether it wasn’t used until germination. Sigma A is used in early spore formation. Needs to research a more recent paper concerning Sigma A and sporulation as paper researched is from 1999. Dan has offered help if needed.
Calculate cost of synthesizing promoter library – Arun has consulted GeneWorks for costs. Needs to now find consensus sequence for promoter and submit them to the company. Also needs to decide degeneracies because degeneracies cost money!
Contact Leendert Hamoen to register to iGem wiki – have done so but he is unable to confirm his place as advisor for the iGem team.
Contact Nigel Robinson concerning metallisation – have done so and got a good response. However the right question has not been answered and so another email will be needed with the question better clarified (with examples just to make sure the right question has been asked). Also another question needs to be asked: Can certain promoters be inhibited by metals?
Take Pictures of meetings – Needs to be done on Monday’s meeting!
Questions about Modelling
Need to install MatLab once contact to the company has been made. Also need to look iGem Website for discounts (e.g. GeneWorks) for synthesizing promoter libraries.

Looked at timetable for previous action points
Still need to consider making flyers for sponsors
Still need to implement modelling but it is ongoing
Need to transfer files from internal wiki to external wiki.
Review of modelling tasks – ongoing
Review of BioBrick standards – going to be covered later today
Need to consider population modelling. Also need to have page on wiki listing all of the genes along with constructs and reasons for selection for the project. Need to also design a few experiments demonstrating ‘cool’ concepts, e.g. stochastic switch – this is to prove that several elements"

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Human Practices#Activities_-_-_TEXT.html," ears to prevent more hearing impairment cases, together with elaborate studies on hearing using biological methods, tend to be the profound and lasting resolution. He mentioned that our project idea is good to solve the root of the problem.
Medication
After consulting with otologist, we learnt some knowledge about treatment for hearing-loss people.
Ear is composed of four main parts. Outer ear is the entry of sound waves. Middle ear amplifys sound waves. Inner ear is responsible for the transduction of sound energy to electric signals. Acoustic nerve transmits the electric signal to the nerve center. All parts are important for the ability of hearing and any damage will result in hearing loss or disability.
The treatment for hearing loss involves reconstruction of the ability of each component. Normally there are five major approaches, external ear reconstruction, tympanic membrane repair, ossicular chain reconstruction, hearing aids, and cochlear implantation. Those surgical cure methods generally recover the structures in the ear for normal function, and hearing aids create the sound vibration with engineering methods.
Sensorineural hearing loss is a hearing loss the most difficult to cure. At present, for mimicking function of cochlear, cochlear implants (CIs) are used to create special electric signals responding to different sound signals it catches. However, ear can sense more than 100,000 kinds of sound frequencies, while the manufacture we made can only generate about one hundred kinds of sound frequency. As a matter of fact, the signal generated by CI is also different largely with natural cochlear.
For the most important part, CI is more than expensive for a normal family.
Apart from those function and cost issues, CI is potential to lead to immune response and other problems for the body as an artificial equipment in a human’s body.
To deal with these problems, firstly, we believe that we should advocate people to protect their ears. In addition, for people who have suffered from these problems, we want to do something to improve their social acceptance and discover better resolutions for hearing loss treatment.
Charity associations
We consulted several local charity associations about the issues they concern related to hearing-impaired population. We also expressed our interests and we hope to further our Human Practices after the Jamboree.
Lions Club of Shenzhen: They irregularly hold activities to help blinds in rural areas of China under the help of government. In Shenzhen, they keep tight contact with community health center all over the city and they periodically organize health care for people with hearing impairment. Other events including helping them with employment and other living problems and holiday consolation are often arranged. They also have special service team formed by individuals and authorized"

It is expected this model can help us to understand how our system can inhibit bacterial growth and help to improve our biological device to make it more effective.
Some Equations:
Threshold – The minimum number of cells required for the target cells to become virulent and cause infection. The target cells must be below this line by the critical time in order for them to not be harmful (due to the body being prepared to fight off the bacteria).
Critical Time –The time period during which the body can fight off subcritical the infection loads.
Using this model we could calculate the effective time window of our spiRNA for a number of different infections using data specific to both the pathogen and to the gene targeted. As such, it could be used as a tool for finding the optimal gene to target, given the correct data."

Nitroreductase (nfsI)
Background
Nitroreductase is an Enterobacter cloacae enzyme which reduces nitrogen containing compounds (Nicklin & Bruce, 1998) . Other nitroreductases were found to convert nitro drugs such as metronidazole into their active forms, which is an essential part of their toxicity (Nillius, Muller, & Muller, 2011) . Bearing this in mind, we decided to look into nitroreductase's potential as a counter-selectable marker.
Cloning

Nanjing-China,2015,Team:Nanjing-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," technologies encounter the problem of sediments which contained a variety of heavy metal such as lead. The combination of our two teams not only identified the significance of collaboration, but could solve some real-life problems as well.
2.SJTU-BioX-Shanghai
This year, we were very close with Nanjing-China team. They are dealing with heavy metal problems through biofilms. When we talked about collaboration, we first thought about binding two projects on seawater desalination field. Thus, we discussed an application with this two project combining. Our team is responsible for explain this application and its supporting fact. Nanjing-China team will explain the details which needs to be discussed to make this working for real.
First, we start with the features of seawater and the end purpose of the combination project. Most of the seawater desalination plant use open-water intake near costal to avoid intake costs. This also means that the factories can’t avoid to deal with different pollutions in costal seawater, including heavy metal pollution.
The main source of coastal heavy metal pollution is runoff and atmospheric sedimentation. From 2006 to 2007, Oceanic Administration of People’s Republic of China did a massive-scale offshore detection for water condition. In its report, the concentration of lead, copper, zinc and mercury in seawater which is over the first seawater class at some monitoring spots. Among them, average lead concentration in the Bohai Sea is over the first seawater class, and some of the monitoring spot detect a number over the second seawater class. The natural degradation of heavy metal is very difficult. Also, the offshore is relatively big water body which makes the pollution hard to increase as well as decrease. Overall, the heavy metal pollution of Chinese offshore cannot be overlook when we use seawater as material.
In normal desalination process, even normal resource water has to go through some sedimentation processes. In fact, one of the safety concern of general seawater desalination is what do we do with those sediments. The idea of cooperating two project is to merge Nanjing-China team’s project to achieve a new seawater recovery and utilizing system.
The word “circular economy” should be familiar to most people. In China, this is one of the guiding ideology for the economic and society development. The core of the concept is to maintain the balance between resource and waste. To balance the rapid consumption of resource, man should not only depend on nature but also ourselves to turn wastes into resources.
Unlike water has a strong nature balance itself, heavy-metal’s nature circulation is much slower. We need to use"

After successfully transforming these plasmids into competent E. coli NEB5alpha cells we then performed a diagnostic digest and gel electrophoresis experiment to ascertain that these plasmids contained the gene we expected.  Each plasmid was digested using two restriction enzymes chosen to digest DNA as specific points on the plasmids and create fragments of known length"

        There are three main types of lithic relics in Hangzhou; they are stone sculptures, stone towers also known as Dhavaja, and stone inscriptions. The stone sculptures are primarily represented by Feilai Peak (飞来峰), Ciyun Ridge (慈云岭), and Statue of Mahakala in Baocheng Temple (宝成寺麻曷葛剌). Stone Towers are primarily represented by White Tower (白塔). Stone inscriptions are primarily represented by Hetingwuhe Fubei on Lonely Mountain (孤山放鹤亭舞鹤赋碑).
        Plus, Feilai Peak and White Tower are National Key Historical Relics.      Most lithic relics encounter physical, chemical and biological interaction, resulting in weathering corrosion, pulverisation lesion, cracking, contamination, and colour mottling. Those phenomena jeopardise the value of lithic relics and even lithic relics themselves, and the lithic relics in Hangzhou are not of exceptions.
        In 2002, some of the classic lithic relics were inspected and it was found that the surface of Feilai Peak Sculpture was greatly ruined (Figure 1), and there is leaking on Ciyun Ridge Sculpture (Figure 2)..
    Meanwhile, Cultural Relics Department of China has been trying to maintain and recover the lithic relics. Since 2002, Cultural Relics Department of China mainly has been removing surface deposit, depleting pounding, strengthening crag, and changing flora; the government washed Feilai Peak Sculpture for many times (Figure 3).Government built a top above the Ciyun Peak Sculpture, this relic no longer had to expose to sun and rain henceforward (Figure 4).
    White Tower was comprehensively cleaned and strengthened by silicone by Zhejiang University of Technology (Figure 5).
     The power plants and railways were removed. During the washing, the staff intentionally left part of this tower intact, and made an contrast for further research of anti-contamination and anti-weathering (Figure 5-3, 5-4)
    However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage. Some"

The particularity of lox66 is that it has an altered sequence at the end of it's left arm compared to loxP. This sequence variation reduces affinity of the Cre recombinase for the arm. As a consequence, after a recombination between a lox71 and a lox66 (altered right arm sequence), one of the two resulting generated lox sites has very low recombination potential as it inherited both mutated arms. Use of lox71 & lox66 sites is potentially interesting when the recombination reaction must be ""irreversible"".

The questionable placements of these bands indicate that the cut sites, thus the fragment length and containing sequence, do not match the planned construction. Therefore, it is not likely that they contain functional GFP, introns or lox, which would result in a lack of fluorescence in the final stage of construction. Further testing to reconstruct the contaminated clones is necessary for the functional final product; however, lab work has stopped due to time constraint. A diagnostic digestion at each step is recommended to circumvent any similar issues upon the continuation of this project.
3.0 PRACTICAL APPLICATION
The biggest advantage of the ribozyme project is the ability to create in vivo protein fusions. These can then be applied to a larger number of modular systems that can be used to make complicated expression systems. One such system is the creation synthetic antibodies. If protein sequences are flanked by intron sequences and then set up along the same stretch of DNA, different combinations of fusion proteins will be created based on how the intron excision occurs. Another system where the ribozyme project can be applied is DNA shuffling experiments. The Cry toxin is used as an effective biopesticide, however for now it has a very small range of insects that it effects. The ways to increase its range would be to change the structure of one of the vital domains so that it is able to recognize a wider spectrum of receptors in the host mid gut cell. To create different variations of this domains an in vivo DNA shuffling experiments using the ribozymes could be carried out.

SCUT-ChinaA,2018,Team:SCUT-ChinaA#Practiceoverview_-_-_TEXT.html," synthetic biology and molecular biology, there are still many people who have misunderstandings about biology or fear of biological tools such as transgenic technology and gene editing technology. To let more people learn about biology, we went to elementary school and brought the latest biological knowledge to the children there.
Public engagement
While conducting our experimental projects, we also actively organized or participated in communications with other iGEM teams. Through learning exchange activities again and again, we continued to draw on one of the parties and eventually improved our project.
Gold
Software tools
After consulting with several fermentation engineering experts and conducting field research, we found that how to screen out the optimal wiring method is the most important thing in establishing cell engineering. So, in order to achieve the goal of the cell factory, we modeled the metabolic pathway of Yarrowia lipolytica and finally designed an available software, which can obtain the corresponding optimal metabolic by simply inputting and outputting data.
iGEM popularizationls
In the process of communicating with the outside world, we found that synthetic biology is still only a few people's carnival, which is still unattainable for most ordinary people. So we have organized many science education activities, not only describing our project to the public, but also popularizing science education and promoting iGEM. In this process, we gained a lot of partners, and under our promotion, we were honored to guide Jinshan High School to participate in next year's iGEM.
Social work
After our research and analysis, we found that most people are looking forward to synthetic biology, but they also have concerns. So, we need a more suitable entry point to integrate synthetic biology into more people's lives instead of boring presentation. In order to keep up with the footsteps of the Internet era, we rely on WECHAT to develop a set of emojis that can be applied to normal life, hoping to bring the distance between synthetic biology and ordinary people closer, and attract them to understand the interest of biology. We are very happy that this set of emojis has been well received by students."

Certain degrees of privacy and lighting are also requirements) and what new functions a habitat on Mars would need to fulfill (for example protection from the harsh environment and radiation). We also had to investigate the different options for Martian habitats that exist already, craft the mission architecture, and consider the laws and regulation of planetary protection that would certainly impact our project.
In order to get the best possible answers to these questions we engaged directly with experts planning the exploration of Mars, and overseeing the protection of the planet.
Our first contact was Oliver Morton, a British science writer and former editor of Nature. We presented our rough ideas about our project to him, and he gave us guidance on how to present the information more effectively and what areas we needed to explore more. And, perhaps most importantly, he also questioned our motives. He asked why we wanted to design a Martian habitat in the first place, when we could also easily focus on the earth and probably have a greater immediate impact. It was a difficult question that required us to be introspective about a notion that seemed so obvious at first. After a lot of dialogue we realized, while designing a Martian Habitat may not benefit the maximum number of people, designing in Space gives us the freedom to explore new ideas and materials without having to worry about the constraints of the market and competition on Earth. After our first interview with Morton, we had a better understanding of the direction we needed to go in and why. We were now ready to discuss with specialists in Martian and space travel.
Team Members Emilia Mann, Leo Penny, Arvind Veluvali, and Advait Patil with Oliver Morton
We interviewed Dr. Michael Meyer, the lead scientist of NASA’s Mars Exploration Program (https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mgs/michael-meyer.html), to answer some of our primary questions about what the design of a human mission to Mars would like.  We asked about which options for martian habitats are currently being explored by NASA--he shared two, both 3D printed structures, one created from a composite made from Martian regolith the other ice--as well as questions about the longevity that is required of the mission, the estimated budget, the kinds of experiments that would be run, the benefit of having people on Mars versus and Rover, and how does NASA define acceptable risk.

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," aim to study the learning ability associated with neuroscience and behavior psychology, we need to develop a new platform which allowss us to explore the internal mechanism. Compared to the traditional methods, light stimulation is more easily to control and more reliable for the following data analysis.
That is why our project is so important.
It employs the optogenetics and neuroimaging to record the change in each neuron during the formation of new ability, so we can know what happened exactly inside the brain. Moreover, the application of microfluidics in our platform allows us to combine the process among ability-training and neuron-activating, and makes the research becoming easier to carry out.
In the future, our platform can also be applied in different fields, such as the simulation of the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The BCI can help the paralysis patients obtain the ability to move and operate things. But the signals from the human brain is too complex and difficult to deal with. If we can decipher the neuronal signals during learning progress when the patient’s mind interacting with the computer, it is possible to simplify the network and build more connections between them.
We are now using our platform to study the alcoholism by trainning worms to be addicted with alcohol and then study the neuron networks during the formation of this behavior. Hope one day we can figure out the logic networks of alcoholism and help to treat more serious social problem.
What is MiniMos?
The miniMos transposon is used to carry transgenes into the C. elegansgenome by the means of inserting a transgene into a modified Mos1 element (miniMos). The miniMos transposon can carry the inserted transgene (together with a selection marker) into the genome where insertions are generated directly by injecting worms. It will take approximately 1 week to get the result. The insertion site is random and can be identified by inverse PCR on the strain.
The miniMos system contains 4 vectors——transposon with target gene, transposase, mcherry and peer-1 markers. Transposon needs transposase to cut and paste in the genome. mcherry and peer-1 are two negative selecter that can help to select the target strains.
The MiniMos system
The method has some advantages:
1)The insertion frequency and fidelity is high.
2)The exact insertion site can be determined.
3)Large transgenes can be inserted.
4)The miniMos element is active in C. elegans.
5)Transgenes are expressed in the germline at high frequency.

As a classic model organism"
NUS_Singapore,2017,Team:NUS Singapore#Model P_-_-_TEXT.html," Circuit. One of the biggest drawbacks in the Automated Circuit is complexity. With increasing complexity comes issues surrounding propagation delay, metabolic stress, and construction difficulty. For example, when compared to the functional model of the Automated Circuit, the functional model of the Simple Circuit performed 33% faster killing thanks to its simple design. However, as mentioned earlier, because of its simple design, the Simple Circuit sacrifices modularity and control for faster response and less metabolic stress. This trade-off, as shown through modelling, is a reasonable justification as to why we construct the simple model in the lab. After all, we aim to generate a kill switch as a secondary function that can kill the probiotic host quickly and effectively too. Therefore, we can propose that for simple kill switches (less than two input sensors), a user can employ the Simple Circuit design, and for more complex systems (more than two input sensors), a user can employ the Automated Circuit design.
Conclusion
Using our modelling workflow, we successfully demonstrate in silico how a customised genetic circuit for engineered probiotics can be made easier. Our results from modelling can be used by the experimenter to guide them during construction. We have mentioned examples of using modelling to recommend solutions to problems that may be faced during the construction of the kill switch. Making the engineering of customised kill switches for probiotics easier enables anyone to use their own biosensors to develop their own kill switch for engineered probiotics. We hope that with the proliferation of different sensors and killing mechanisms, anyone will be able to utilise our workflow to develop kill switches and in turn, meet regulatory standards.

UNAM-Genomics_Mexico,2010,Team:UNAM-Genomics Mexico#Modules#In vivo_-_-_TEXT.html," Cultures were grown  overnight (~14hrs) at 37°C with spinning at 100rpm under blue light (470nm) conditions. Then cultures were diluted 1:1000 into 5ml of fresh LB media with antibiotics. These were grown for approximately 4.5 hours under the previous conditions under blue light (470nm). After this step the OD600 was measured from each culture.  Based on this OD measurement, the cultures were diluted to the same OD (0.15) in 5 ml of LB fresh media. Then three 200 µL aliquots from each culture were transferred into a flat-bottomed 96 well plate. Samples were loaded in the plate as is shown in the next picture:
An initial measurement of OD600 and fluorescence (530/25 nm excitation filter, 590/35 nm emission filter) by triplicate was done. Using the light emission device to irradiate the incubator, the plate was maintained during 17 hrs at 37°C with spinning at 35rpm inside the incubator but with a mask in the samples selected for the dark conditions.  Then, a second measurement of OD600 and fluorescence was done. Initial data with the second measurement were compared. Background absorbance and  fluorescence were determined by measuring wells containing only media, and the values obtained were used to normalize the other samples.
Results
The average ODs of the wells with only media and antibiotics changed drastically from the initial to the second measurement(km/amp from 0.282 to 0.09, and km/cm 0. to 0.093), dificulting the data analysis. So the data obtained were inconsistent and even it was intented to analyse them, there was not the expected difference between light and dark conditions.
Conclusions
According to the aforementioned results, we think that LovTAP could possibly work well. However we have to improve the characterization protocols in order to support with enough evidence this conclusion. As well, more replicates and controls must be included in the experiments.
We also think that using other reporter system to describe the transcriptional activation activity of LovTAP using a cascade of double repression, might generate better results.  So we will test LovTAP behavior with the cI inverter.
YcgF/YcgE BLUE RECEPTION SYSTEM
OBJECTIVES
The main goal for this section of the project was to implement a system for blue light reception using the YcgF/YcgE sytem, naturally present in certain strains of Escherichia coli.
This reception system would be coupled both to a reporter gene (i.e"

Creating Leucine auxotrophic S. cerevisiae strains
We have developed protocols for producing auxotroph mutants of existing brewing strains. The first step in creating novel brewing yeast strains is to modify an existing strain that has either been purchased from a home brew supplier or isolated from a bottle of beer so that it becomes auxotrophic for a particular key nutrient.  This is an essential step as it provides a means to select subsequent strains that have been further genetically modified.  We have designed a set of genes parts that enable the user to create auxotrophic mutants lacking the ability to synthesize uracil and leucine that are key amino acids required for protein synthesis.  These mutant strains will therefore only grow on a media containing uracil or leucine or via further genetic modification which restores the strains ability to synthesize these amino acids.

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," General Secretary of MEXMUN 2018, and asked him a space for iGEM Tec-Chihuahua in this year’s edition. We explained to them what we wanted to do, how we wanted to collaborate, and our approach to synthetic biology. The team liked the idea and accepted us in MEXMUN 2018, which is going to take place in Mexico City, the capital of our country, on October 26th and 27th.
There are 12 committees in this edition that are going to be performed by junior high and high school students from all over the Mexican Republic. These students registered themselves in the committee they liked the most, they reviewed their committee’s handbook in order to investigate how their country relates to the given topic, write their official position as delegates, and discuss their information and proposals at the day of the event.
We collaborated in the First Committee on Disarmament and International Security (CDSI in Spanish) by developing Topic A: “Synthetic biology as a tool for the development of biological weapons.”
In order to develop the topic, we wrote an essay about how synthetic biology has been used to create organisms able to cause damage to humanity when misused, antecedents of how institutions (such as the United Nations) have developed protocols to regulate the misusage of this new technology, actual situations that involve synthetic biology, facts about the storage of dangerous biological samples, facts about dangerous laboratories around the world, and biohackers.
As well, we attached what we expected from delegates during the event. These points are:
The position of the country they have chosen to the use, development, storage or acquisition of genetically modified organisms as biological weapons.
Measures carried out by the country to abolish the creation of genetically modified organisms as biological weapons.
Actions carried out by the country to prevent the development of genetically modified organisms as biological weapons.
Proposals to suppress the development of biological weapons through synthetic biology.
Organisms that could help victims and how would they contribute.
Limits that should be established in the use of synthetic biology according to the country.
In order to grade delegates, we wrote aspects/issues that should be solved during the debate. These aspects are:
Countries must assess the new risks that arise every day about synthetic biology.
Countries must enforce the ban on genetically modified organisms as biological weapons.
Reach a resolution regarding the storage of dangerous biological samples.
Regulate access to genetic material and laboratory instrumental for their use on not authorized spaces by non-certified individuals (this can be via the Internet or through illegal means) since it could provide a broader framework for the storage of biological or toxin weapons"

     Reproducibility is one of the pillars of science, it allows separate groups of scientists to perform the same experiments and come to the same conclusions. Despite the importance of reproducibility, studies 1 and 2 show that oftentimes the conclusions published in high-impact science journals are not reproducible. As iGEM is a synthetic biology competition, we wanted to find out if synthetic biologists also encountered similar problems. We reached out to scientists to ask for their thoughts on reproducibility, and whether or not an online protocol database would help to increase reproducibility in science. The survey was emailed to 155 recipients, the majority of whom were iGEM advisors and student participants. A link to the survey was also posted on the iGEM facebook page. In total, 55 responses were received, and were used to aid our design of ProtoCat.
     We asked participating teams about their experiences with the protocols that iGEM provides on their website. Surprisingly, 78% of teams encountered issues with, or had to make adjustments to one or more of the iGEM-provided protocols that they used. Even though the iGEM-provided protocols are classic molecular biology protocols, and among the most commonly used in the field, a large majority of users had problems with them. With this information in mind, we wanted to gauge the appeal of a software like ProtoCat. We asked scientists whether or not they could see themselves using a multidisciplinary, online protocol database, with 73% indicating 'yes', 27% indicating 'maybe', and none indicating 'no'. Given the positive responses, we felt certain the ProtoCat would be appealing to scientists searching for protocols.
     Respondents provided plenty of ideas such as giving users the ability to search for, review and rate protocols. We implemented as many of these as we could, placing particular emphasis on creating an efficient and easy to use search engine as many it seemed to be the most important part in the respondents' minds. More information on the results of the project can be found here ."

Sensing h.p.
In this section, we aim to use our gene parts for making E. Coli, sensing H. Pylori’s existence and activating a pathogen-killer system, after it gets into the mucus layer. Targeting this pathogen will be provided by sensing Auto-inducer 2 (AI-2) and ammonia (NH3), both secreted from H. Pylori. AI-2 will be sensed by Lsr operon system and NH3 will be sensed by TnrA-pAlsT regulation system. Getting only one result of these two systems when they are sensed seperatley, is provided by Toehold-Triger RNA system. The output of this system, which works in the existence of these two molecules, is an endonuclease called TEV protease. Produced TEV protease will activate the antimicrobial peptide Pexiganan after this molecule synthesized in an inactive form and accumulated in cell. Activated Pexiganan molecules are expected to leave the cell, become free and kill H. Pylori.
Background
Helicobacter Pylori Sensing:
Helicobacter pylori lives in stomach, by connecting to epithelium cells under the mucus layer.This bacteria releases some molecules around which comes from its metabolic waste. Two of these molecules are Auto-inducer 2 and ammonia.
Ammonia (NH3)
H. pylori  synthesizes urease to buffer the pH of its microenvironment within the stomach. H. pylori dedicates several genes to the biosynthesis of its cytosolic urease, a Ni2+-containing enzyme which hydrolyses urea into NH3 and CO2. B"

Macquarie_Australia,2016,Team:Macquarie Australia#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," of a chlI1:chlD:chlI2 hexameric enzymatic motor complex which forms in the presence of ATP. The chlH and gUN4 proteins bind Protoporphyrin IX and form an activated substrate complex which behaves as a substrate for the motor complex to insert magnesium into the bound Protoporphyrin IX upon ATP hydrolysis.
The assembly of this complex requires milliMolar concentrations of Mg2+ and ATP to assemble. While the substrate complex also requires microMolar concentrations of Protoporphyrin IX and chlH for optimal activity.
This part has the potential to be used with other plasmids and genes to complete the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway.
Properties of the Plasmid confirmed
1. The 150kDa chlH protein is highly expressed and visible on SDS-PAGE and confirmed by proteomic analysis. This should sufficient to produce Mg-Protoporphyrin IX.
2. Mg-protoporphyrin is not produced in DH5- E. coli containing this plasmid when induced with IPTG. But Mg-protoporphyrin IX is produced in a hemH mutant background of E. coli containing this plasmid when induced with IPTG.
3. The Mg-protoporphyrin IX produced in this strain demonstrates that metabolic engineering of E. coli is required to generate sufficient Protoporphyrin IX substrate for the assembled magnesium chelatase complex to successfully make Mg-protoporphyrin IX."

Aberdeen_Scotland,2014,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#Ethics#Introspection_-_-_TEXT.html,"cher, Head of the Unit of Parasite Diagnostics at Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp and Liesbeth Van Nieuwenhove, PhD Biology & Veterinarian.  After explaining our project to them, we kindly asked them if they could provide us with antibodies against the most common trypanosomal antigens, VSG 1.3 and 1.5. They have been extremely understanding and helpful and they even sent more samples that we asked for, to allow us to test our novel trypanosomal detector. Thank you!
Unfortunately, 10 weeks did not allow us to test those tryapanosomal antibodies, as we wanted. Frustrating enough, we have both the mimotopes for trypanosomes and the antibodies provided in the -80°C freezer, waiting for a future Aberdeen Team to be tested.
Influence on our project and advice for other iGEM teams
We realized that our initial, enthusiastic plan of working with real trypanosome pathogens in the laboratory was not achievable, but we could say that it helped us develop a novel approach to tackle the same problem without any safety and ethical concern, by getting in contact with researchers that work on the disease, who are more than keen to offer help to undergraduates.
Moreover, we realized that people’s fear for synthetic biology and genetic engineering sometimes expands beyond boundaries. Mass populations fear the evolvement of deadly viruses and random cloning, due to poor understanding of synthetic biology and scientific achievements. Therefore, we aimed to educate the public and we targeted different audiences:  general public-short radio interview; more specialized public-publishing Blogposts on the Aberdeen University magazine website and giving a short presentation for the Explorathon European Researchers’ Night. Moreover, we presented our project both at the beginning and the end of the summer, by going to the iGEM Scottish Team Meeting and Synthetic Biology Conference in Edinburgh, respectively to Professor Muffy Calder, Chief Scientific Adviser for Scotland, at The Royal Society of Edinburgh. We also created an interactive DNA translating device, which could be used by a 10 year-old and we used social media (Facebook, Twitter and Goggle+ account) to advertise our project, iGEM  and synthetic biology.
We encourage further iGEM teams to never give up on their project idea, because there are always safe and novel ways through which they can address it. Where there is a will, there is a way!

UMaryland,2016,Team:UMaryland#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,".  M. capsulatus is the most extensively studied methanotroph and its genome has been sequenced7.
Once the methane is converted to methanol, another strain of recombinant E. coli will metabolize the methanol. This will be able to happen in two different pathways, dubbed the “fructose” and “formate” pathways.
Our “Fructose” plasmid consists of three enzymes found in Bacillus methanolicus. These enzymes provide a pathway for metabolizing methanol. B. methanolicus is a thermotolerant bacteria, growing optimally at 50 C that uses methanol as its carbon source8. It can be found in freshwater marsh soil9. This bacteria can be used to generate amino acids from methanol, thereby converting the toxic alcohol into protein building blocks.
This plasmid is an improvement based on work done by Team Aachen in 2015. The part they created was a composite of four enzymes - methanol dehydrogenase (MDH2), 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (HPS),  6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase (PHI), and D-Xylulose-5-phosphate-phosphoketolase (XPK). One of our modifications to their part includes replacing a constitutive promoter with a lac + pL promoter, allowing for us to selectively induce the genes. We also optimized all the codons, ensuring most efficient expression by E. coli.
Additionally, our plasmid did not incorporate D-Xylulose-5-phosphate-phosphoketolase (XPK). XPK is an enzyme that is used in the pentose phosphate pathway to eventually get a product used in glycolysis10. However, the product of D-Fructose-6-Phosphate, is already a molecule that is incorporated in glycolysis. Having the cell express XPK is unnecessary and will only tax the cell to make more enzyme than it requires, thereby slowing its growth.
Overall, this enzymatic pathway incorporates the carbon from methanol into fructose-6-phosphate. This transformation from a 5 carbon sugar to a 6 carbon sugar allows the product to be broken down further via the glycolysis pathway, providing energy to the cell. It is important to note that this pathway requires an input sugar source, since the 5 carbon derivative is essential for the complete reaction.
The second pathway utilizes the “Formate” plasmid, which takes. We designed the plasmid with the same MDH"
ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#blog_-_-_TEXT.html,", these modules are successive. After the logic module, we added a production module, which is responsible for the production of our outputs (GFP and an Homoserine Lactone that depends on the type of cell modeled). As one of our output is a messenger molecule, it has an influence on the quorum sensing module, which detects those molecules. Therefore, we have a feedback loop. This feedback loop comes from our choice to put only two different strains in our grid.
Decomposition of our system in different modules and submodules. The inputs are AHL and PAI2 and our output is AHL and GFP going out from the Production module.

Week 3: Plasmid design started, Modeling started
Wednesday, June 11th
We started plasmid design :
First draft of plasmids. The sensor plasmid is the same in every cell. Different logic + repressors plasmids are present in cells p and q. The logic + repressors plasmid from cells p is producing the quorum sensing molecule p, and another version is present in cells q which produces QSq. Colonies of p and q cells will be arranged in an alternate way on the millifluidic chip. Here as an example we use the lux system for p cells and the rhl system for q cells.
ΦC31 and Bxb1 are integrases. LuxR an RhlR are quorum sensing repressors. A riboswitch construct is placed around quorum sensing constructs to prevent leakiness of lux and rhl promoters. Type p colonies produce AHL by expressing the enzyme LuxI. Type q colonies produce Rhl by expressing the enzyme RhlI. In fact, we don't know yet which quorum sensing systems we will use. We will have to perform cross-talk experimetns in order to choose the ones that are the most orthogonal.
We tried to print our first agar millifluidic chip : we printed it too small, and the printer had resolution problems.
We wrote all reactions and found parameters from the literature for our model.

Week 2: Investigating microfluidics, Writing a modeling pipeline
Wednesday, June 4th
This week, we have talked with people from the microfluidics group and it came out that we should be able to use beads to encapsulate our cells and use a microfluidic chip. Therefore we will try to develop this possibility in parallel with the 3D-printed agar chip.
We have set up a modeling pipeline. We"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," toxicity of a full length version compared to a truncated version of PtNTT2.
Cultivation performed by iGEM team UNIFI as part of our collaboration
Collaboration - Lokalization Study and Part Exchange with CU Boulder 2017
This year the iGEM team CU Boulder works with artificial compartments which consist of shell proteins containing a photoswitch amino acid. These compartments are supposed to break up into separate shell proteins releasing the protein captured inside the compartment. This could potentially act as next-generation drug delivery systems, biosensors, or as a solution to sequester diffuse and harmful environmental toxins. The iGEM team CU Boulder 2016 submitted the BioBrick containing the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (aaRS) for the photoswitch amino acid. This year’s team helped us to realize our photoswitching project by sending us their aaRS and a small amount of the amino acid AzeF. In return, we transformed their parts EutS ( BBa_K2129001 ) and EutC-tagged FusionRed in E.coli DH5α and performed localization studies by fluorescence microscopy with our confocal laser scan microscope.
Figure 2: 3D-Animation of the fluorescence signal of E.coli cells transformed with EutC-tagged FusionRed from CU Boulder. The fluorescence is present in the whole cell.
Figure 3: 3D-Animation of the fluorescence signal of three E.coli cells cotransformed with shell protein EutS and EutC-tagged FusionRed from CU Boulder. The fluorescence is concentrated in the EutS-compartments.
As you can see above the parts work perfectly. The cells only containing FusionRed have a bright fluorescence in the cytoplasm (Figure 2) and the cotransformats show the fluorescence concentrated in the EutS compartments (Figure 3). We send CU Boulder the stacked pictures and combined the stacks to 3D-animations.
We are very happy that they provided their aaRS to us to expand our toolkit and we hope that our results of the localization study are helpful for their further work.
