Figure 2: Parts marked in green where removed using primers binding on a ferritin sequence ordered via IDT synthesis and the short ferritin was aquired by PCR.
By removing those structural elements the overall stability of ferritin is reduced and a disassembly at higher pH of around 4 instead of 2 should be the result.  The removal of the E-helix and DE turn in all the 24 subunits should lower the melting temperature off the assembled ferritin from 80 °C to 72,7 °C
Assembly:
Enhanced stability of the binding between the ferritin subunits is another field of research which sets out to enhance the binding strength between the 24 subunits to one another. The method developed by Wang et. al introduces 4 amino acid changes to the binding region between two adjacent subunits. The 4 histidine amino acids that are introduced (Fig. 3 histidine colored in pink) allow for the incorporation of Cu(II) ions into the binding region without severely changing the alignment of the subunits to each other.
Figure 3: 4 amino acid in the binding region between the ferritin subunits where changed to histidines (pink). The histidines can bind copper ions which in  turn enhances binding strength.
Combining both approaches
From combining both approaches a mutant ferritin variant which disassembles at pH values closer to neutral and assembles with high strength when copper ions are added could be developed opening up new areas where the encapsulation of pH-sensitive proteins or molecules is required.
siRNA promoter model
First the most fitting siRNAs for our project has to be calculated. A program will be written which returns a selection of compatible siRNAs for a gene you want to silence. Possible secondary structures should also be considered (Mathews, 1999) because they could prevent the silencing mechanism of siRNAs.
Figure 4: The siRNA with the compatible secondary structure binds to the mRNA and enables its digestion and blocks the translation of the sequence (A). The wrong secondary structure can’t bind and that way the mRNA can be translated and won’t be digested (B).
We assume that the rate of silencing by siRNAs depends in the first place on the promoter region in front of the RNAi gene. By gathering expression rates of the most popular promoters in the iGEM parts registry valuable information for modelling will be acquired. Furthermore additional  factors like secondary structures, diffusion rates and"

Overview
    In the last 4 years, the Measurement Committee has been developing a robust measurement procedure for green fluorescent protein (GFP) though the Interlab study, aiming to improve the measurement tools available to both the iGEM community and the synthetic biology community as a whole. And this year, we are delighted to join the study to know if we can reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD.

    We studied for a time before doing interlab, and spent one-two day preparing experimental materials, such as preparing E. coli DH5α and several culture media. After full preparation, we started the experiment. In the first experiment, our antibiotics failed, causing too much bacteria to colonize the plate.The second time we had a problem with the competent cells, so the bacteria did not grow after the plate was painted.The third time, we reprepared the competent cells and replaced the antibiotics, and the experiment went well.

Figuring out the current status of Synthetic Biology in Korea: Interview with a synthetic biologist
Our team visited one of the few synthetic biologists in South Korea, Professor Jihyun Kim of Yonsei University whose research focuses on the optimization of the system of organisms and the fine-tuning process. We requested an interview with Jihyun Kim because he was a synthetic biologist who met the requirements of well-knowing the reality and status of Synthetic biology in Korea.
Throughout the interview, we discussed the history and the realistic prospect of synthetic biology. We first talked over the birth of synthetic biology and how the actual word “Synthetic biology” was born. We also compared the benefits and disadvantages of utilizing synthetic biology with chemical or physical methods in problem resolution. The biggest difference is the direction of approach and the ability to easily synthesize macromolecules. Unlike small molecules, macromolecules are hard to build in a chemical way, and as the length gets longer the error rate increases exponentially. However, using organisms and designed synthetic biology methods solves the problem and at a considerable cost.
Furthermore, as a synthetic biologist, we pointed out the reality synthetic biology having low recognition to the public in Korea. We thought this atmosphere was formed by Korea’s education environment which only focuses on developing one’s major and directing attention away from other possible interests. To solve this problem, our team conducted an education session for Yeouido high school on introducing the general basis of Synthetic biology. Excessive competition in the academic field also removes the possibility of taking an attempt to a new field of science. We also considered the need for a breakthrough in the synthetic biology field since we reached a plateau resulting from our lack of knowledge of the organisms.
Moreover, the negative image of Genetic engineering displayed by the media also contributes to the avoidance of implementing this new branch of study. The interview led us to set our plans on changing out the recognition of Synthetic biology and Genetic engineering. We also felt the need to take a close look in the discomfort people are indicating about genetic engineering. The negative image imposed on GMOs and genetic engineering also made us acknowledge the current status of Synthetic biology in Korea and hold an open seminar for all undergraduate students.

Renilla Luciferase assay in three plasmids system
January 1, 2014 by Mark
Three recombinant plasmids were generated and transiently transfected into a human bladder cancer cell line T24.
To test the working efficiency of our orthogonal system, we devided the cells into two groups. One has Ack in the culture medium and another does not.
Luciferase assays were performed using luminometer. Since Ack is essential for our system, we speculated that Renilla Luciferase(Rluc), the output gene in the circuits can be selectively expressed in Experiment group with Ack. As shown in Fig. 1, the activity of Renilla Luciferase(RLUC) varied widely between the two groups, and the circuit only demonstrated significant activity in the experimental group as expected. Therefore, our orthogonal system is verified to be in good condition and can work efficiently.
Luciferase assay in two plasmids system
hTERT and hUPII promoters are cancer specific promoter and bladder specific promoter, respectively. By combining the two promoters into the design, we supposed that the constructed circuits have the ability to selectively identify bladder cancer cells, in which telomerase and uroplakins are both expressed.
To test this hypothesis, we used the luciferase reporter gene as the output of the circuit and tested the luciferase activity in HFC, which is short for human fiber epithelial cell, Hela, a cervical carcinoma cell line and 5637, a bladder cancer cell line. Also, we reconstructed our system in two plasmids to test if two plasmids system can perform higher efficiency.
The result (Fig.2) shows that the activity of LUC in 5637 with Ack was about two times as high as that in 5637 without Ack and three times as high as that in Hela, while it could not be measured in HFC. We can learn from this result that this system is perfectly safe for normal cells, with no luciferase being detected in HFC. However, compared with three plasmids system, whose RLUC activity of experimental group is about 7 times as high as that of control group, the working efficiency of our orthogonal system in two pl"

Background
In our project, the editing protocol of a DNA-based file involves the synthesis of a new DNA fragment encoding the new information and the breakage of the old DNA fragment encoding the original information. While the former can be realized easily through the chemical synthesis technique, the latter is not simple until the recent development of CRISPR genome editing method.
Restriction endonuclease can discern special DNA site and cut the particular DNA frag-ments with the endonuclease site, the constraint is that the DNA fragment which needs breakdown must contain the restriction endonuclease recognition site.  But for the DNA information storage system, a DNA fragment may contain arbitrary nucleotide sequences.
Cas9 (CRISPR associated protein 9) is a RNA-guided DNA endonuclease enzyme[2]. S. py-ogenes utilizes Cas9 to discern and cleave foreign DNA in its immunity system[3]. Cas9 binding site recruits Cas9 form sgRNA-Cas9 complex, the DNA recognition site interro-gates dsDNA specifically and inducts sgRNA-Cas9 complex combine with dsDNA so that generate sgRNA-Cas9-dsDNA complex. The combined Cas9 cleaves dsDNA and causes devastating damage to the dsDNA and lead to further hydrolyzation(Alec AK Nielsen & Christopher A Voigt*. Multi-input CRISPR/Cas genetic circuits that interface host regulatory networks).
Since Cas9 could cleave any DNA fragment in theory if there is a right sgRNA to guide the recognition process, it is the right tool for DNA information editing.
Fig.1.guid DNA transcribes sgRNA to guid Cas9[1].
Part Design
To degrade a particular DNA fragment, we need to design a part to express the sgRNA transcript to guide the Cas9 system to cleave the fragment.
nspired by Voigt’s study and the BioBrick parts (BBa_K1723002, BBa_K1723003 and BBa_K1723004) designed by the team of iGEM15_EPFL[4], we designed our sgRNA ex-pressing cassette based on the DNA sequence that needs to be modified.  The"

Constructed dCas9 gene cassette and plasmid backbone with replication origin ColE1 via PCR Rescue. Gel purified dCas9 and ColE1 cassettes. 1 out of 4 dCas9 PCR's were successful, and 2 out of 4 colE1's were successful, all of which were Ashlee's. We attributed this to Emily's lack of cloning experience.
Sam prepared electrocompetent cells for use later on, and began process of primer design. Clay designed the synthetic leader sequence and finalized the program in MATLAB that optimizes GFPs at codon level.Met with Dr. Salis and decided to also optimize a GFP for slow insertion time, based on a model created by Iman Farasat.

Conducted Colony PCR using P. putida KT2440 strain as DNA template to construct two ~1 kb genome overlaps. Plasmid prepared the Lambda Red Recombinase plasmid, DH10B-PKD46, FTV-ptac-LacI-CmR plasmid, and NoHP_15A_Plmra_CmR plasmid containing RFP with a strong, unique promoter.  Stock of NoHP_15A_Pkmra_CmR and FTV_ptac_LacI_CmR for cryogenic storage was also made. Lambda Red Recombinase cassette was amplified using PCR Rescue and gel purified.
All constructs (variant GFPs in vector pFTV checked for enzyme restriction sites, enzymes picked to be used in the cloning process. gblocks designed using format: junk DNA- restriction site- CDS- restriction site- junk DNA. Sam designed rescue primers to be used for amplifying the gblocks. They will be expensive and we don't want to leave any chance of running out of stock once we have them. Primers for rescue PCR redesigned when it was realized that Clay accidentally truncated the GFPs by incorrectly copying the coding sequence of original superfolder GFP from its Ape file.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," of minor improvements to   the gameplay through a short survey, the results of this can be found here . The largest change to our game came after Mrs Andrew’s   asked if she could keep a copy of the game herself. We knew that we could not  afford to give board games out too everyone, so we came up with a new way to   distribute our game at no cost. Our board game BioMech is now online to download   for free on our wiki here , with full printing instructions.  This meant that our original target of making our game accessible to all UK   students was a lot more realistic.
Your browser does not support the video tag.
Production
After testing the game at a couple of science conventions  such as the Big Bang Fair South West and Britain Needs  Scientists , we were give feedback to help us make some minor improvements. After this was complete, we began planning manufacturing the game. The problem with manufacturing the game was that we didn’t have the funds to do it ourselves. However, we were very fortunate in the fact that Dr Mark Ramsdale was willing to give us the necessary funds for us to print 16 copies of the board game, in order for us to distribute these to schools, in a widening participation activity for the university. We then started to look into schools to distribute the board game to, which became extremely difficult as term finished shortly after. Despite the fact that we have the ability to distribute the game at no cost, with the downloadable version of BioMech developed, we wanted to give local schools, schools that have helped us along the way and under-achieving schools physical copies of BioMech. This would act as a thank you to the schools that have helped us on the way, but also provide an accessible resource to schools who may not have access to high-quality, modern teaching resources like our board game.
This new version of the game was played by students from Colyton Grammar School. As part of our initiative  to make BioMech accessible to as many GCSE students as possible  we have began leaving copies of the game at schools free of charge,   in order to benefit the education of synthetic biology for GCSE and   A level students.
The Colyton Grammar School visit occurred on 18/07/16. Four of our team members – Alice, Andy, Joel and Jack – ran a one hour board game session with a class of 26 Year 9 students, falling at the lower end of of our target demographic (14-18). In an attempt to better understand how BioMech had been received, we conducted a survey with the students. The"

Module 2 - Encapsulsation Overview
Freeze Drying
An important consideration when designing the E.ncapsulator was the ability to store the cells for extended periods of time. While biological material can be stored for extended periods of time by dehydration, under such conditions the integrety of both a cell's membrane and intracellular polypeptides can be compromised.
In order to preserve the integrity of our protein of interest during storage of the E.ncapsulator, we decided to incorporate a device for trehalose production within our system. Trehalose is a disaccharide formed from two glucose molecules. Throughout nature, trehalose is associated with resistance to dessication and cold shock, and is naturally produced in E.coli. We hope that by upregulating the trehalose production pathways in E.coli we can increase trehalose concentrations within our cell, thereby conferring some resistance to protein degredation in our system.

Education & Public Awareness: Korea Youth Expo
Elan Vital Korea’s education and public awareness-related human practice efforts – that is, our human practice efforts that are not directly related to our project at hand: using quorum sensing technology for early, efficient detection of MRSA or other antibiotics-resistant bacteria – focus primarily on our outreach at the Korea Youth Expo(http://www.youthexpo.kr/) this May.
EDUCATION & PUBLIC AWARENESS
Threats of Antibiotics-Resistant Bacteria
For this purpose, Elan Vital Korea has set up a synthetic biology research club jointly with YMCA, which participated in the Korea Youth Expoas a program provider.  The selection criteria for the provider was very high, and competition fierce. Ultimately, however, the hard work and preparation has been amply rewarded when the club was selected as one of 100 teams from more than 2,500 schools and community organizations. Korea Youth Expo is as the largest, most significant annual event for the young generation since its inception in 2001.  The annual event is organized by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family of Korea, and run by Korea Youth Work Agency.  This year, Korea Youth Expo was held in Gumi, Korea from 21st to 23rd, May.  For the three days, about 159,600 people visited the event.  We did our best to fully exploit the opportunity and promote the ideas of synthetic biology, bio-safety and bio-ethics. Our activities at the Expo are: (1) preparation meetings, (2) on-booth experiment sessions and DNA-related activities, (3) information seminar on synthetic biology, (4) on-booth discussions and talks on synthetic biology, and (5) survey.
1. Preparation Meetings
We held more than a dozen preparation meetings.

DLUT_China,2018,Team:DLUT China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Here is plasmid dlut2, which is responsible for lethal systems.
SRNA in plasmid 1 is an inhibitory element of lysis2 in plasmid 2, which inhibits lysis2 expression. SRNA in plasmid 2 is an inhibiting element of lysis1 in plasmid 1, which inhibits lysis1 expression. When one of the plasmids is lost, the lytic protein of the other plasmids will not be inhibited, that is, the bacteria will express the lytic protein and cause the bacteria to lyse, thus killing the bacteria that lose the plasmids, so as to prevent the loss of plasmids.
Due to the high concentration of uric acid in the intestines of hyperuricemia patients, we use uric acid as the response signal of the lethal system. When the uric acid concentration exceeds the threshold, HucR is inhibited by uric acid, and Phuco is in the open state. Subsequent genes can be transcribed and translated normally, but since lysis1 is inhibited by sRNA, the bacteria will not be cracked. When the uric acid concentration was lower than the threshold value, HucR inhibited Phuco, and Phuco was turned off. Subsequent genes could not be transcribed and translated, so that sRNA inhibiting lysis2 could not be expressed, while lysis2 could be normally expressed, resulting in death of bacteria. Due to the high concentration of uric acid in the intestinal tract of uric acid patients, the death rate of bacteria in the patient is not high. However, when the bacteria are lost to the external environment, the uric acid concentration in the external environment is lower than the threshold value, which activates the lethal system of the bacteria, leading to the death of bacteria cracking and reaching the purpose and effect of in vitro death.
System 2:
Figure 4 Above is plasmid dlut3, mainly used to express uric acid oxidase; Here is plasmid dlut4, responsible for lethal systems.
SRNA in plasmid 1 is an inhibitory element of lysis2 in plasmid 2, which inhibits lysis2 expression. SRNA in plasmid 2 is an inhibiting element of lysis1 in plasmid 1, which inhibits lysis1 expression. In other words, the plasmid loss lethal mechanism of the system is the same as that of system 1.

From the 24th to the 26th of July 2018, the first ever iGEM EurAsian Meetup took place in Shenzhen, Peoples’ Republic of China. We collaborated with our high-school buddy team BGIC-Global to organize this important meetup. 24 teams from all over Asia and Europe joined us in Shenzhen, with a live stream available for those who could not be there in person. We focused on teams getting to know each other, raising each others projects to a higher level trough practice and feedback sessions and creating a better understanding of each other by presenting a bioethicial viewpoint from both continents. We hope to have contributed in a significant way to intercontinental scientific and cultural exchange in the iGEM community by establishing meaningful collaborations between teams from Europe and Asia.
1. First Day
We kicked off the meetup with a strong focus on science and plenty of opportunities to get to know each other. After inspiring welcoming words from Dr. Doris Yang, vice-dean of BGI College, Dr. Yue (Chantal) Shen and Dr. Ying Gu gave an interesting talk on their work as Chief and Senior R&D Director at the Synthesis and Gene Editing Platform of the China National Gene Bank. We introduced the buddy system; playing matchmaker and pairing  teams up based on their project contents and specific needs. They met each other in a short break and then combined their shared knowledge and skills to compete in the collaboration quiz. With everyone a group of new friends richer, we went into the after-iGEM presentation by Ms. Hong Chen, who explained to us all opportunities for continuing iGEM after October. Then we set out to practice for the Giant Jamboree with the project presentations. Each team had prepared a 10 minute version of their final presentation, which they presented to half of the group"
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Technology#_-_-_TEXT.html," as the speed and reliability of the generation one sensing platform.  The modular design of FREDsense’s technology will allow the company to adapt quickly and easily to changes in the regulatory landscape in the oil sands market as well as expand into different markets. This will allow FREDsense to expand the breadth of its detection products without investing significant resources into research and development.
Regulatory Hurdles
Biotechnology products in Canada are regulated by three federal agencies: Health Canada for foods, Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) for seeds and livestock feed, and Environment Canada for new substances intended for environmental release. Our product thus falls under regulation set out by the latter. This regulation falls under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (jointly administered by Environment Canada and Health Canada).  Environmental Technology Verification is also required for our technology to be used in this industry.  Risk is assessed based on relative toxicity as well as relative amount of exposure to the environment. Specific products are assessed on a one-to-one basis through a dialogue with Environment Canada and Health Canada.
Safety Approval from CEPA
With respect to safety, we need to make our organism approved according to the “New Substances Notification Regulations (Organisms)"", SOR/2005-248, which is a part of the Canadian Environmental Protection Agency (CEPA) act. Due to our organism being an innocuous, ubiquitous, microbe that is indigenous to soil, we anticipate that performing the experiments required for approval will eventually lead to permission to mass produce this organism. In spite of this, to obtain agency approval we are required to perform extensive tests on our organism and have adequate protocols to prevent accidental release of our organism.
The most important characterizations that we need to disclose include:
Methodology to identify FREDsense microorganism: describe the organism such that it can be accurately identified in the incidence of escape.  This includes genus, species, strain features, and the genetic changes we induced to enable reporting of our sensor. The necessity for these characterizations are already in line with our need for further technological development of our micro-organism sensor, and we hope to have this complete by July 2014.
Impact and toxicology characterization: environmental impact and toxicological studies are necessary to discover if our strain could impact the local ecosystem, or be a danger to terrestrial and aquatic organisms. To perform these studies we will perform standard toxicology experiments in which it is cultured in the presence of model test organisms. We will also co-culture the strain with indigenous aquatic and soil micro-organisms to determine if gene transfer occurs from our strain and if so, at what rate. With regards to the"

We then wanted to determine whether the isolated strains were capable of degrading or metabolizing indigo. As denim is made of cotton, it could be possible that the microbes use cellulose as a carbon source rather than indigo. Cellulases are already a popular enzymatic substitute used to fade blue jeans, but we wished to find microbes capable of degrading indigo itself. To do this, we cultured our strains on petri dishes containing indigo as the only carbon source. Only two of our strains were able to grow: Pantoea agglomerans P1 and Streptomyces S2 figure 2. However, as the indigo we used was not sufficiently visible in the plates, we were unable to observe indigo digestion due to color change of the media, and bacterial growth itself was the only evidence of ""indigo degradation"" using this method.
As we were not satisfied with the results of the plate assay, we redid the indigo digestion assay in liquid minimal media containing indigo with all of our isolated strains figure 2. We observed three strains capable of indigo degradation: Pantoea agglomerans P1 and Streptomyces coelicolor S4 strains that grew on the agar-indigo plates, as well as strain Streptomyces fumigatiscleroticus S3. These results offered further proof that we had successfully isolated microbes capable of indigo digestion.

Salmonella selection: methods
Using λ red recombination method to create mutations
The first step to knock out the genes of S. typhimurium VNP20009 was to introduce pkd46 into the bacteria so that the three genes, γ, β, and exo can be expressed. Gam inhibits the host RecBCD exonuclease v so that BET and EXO can gain access to DNA ends and to promote recombination. We then designed the PCR primers which provide the homology to the targeted gene(s). Primers were 60bp in length and were used to amplify a Kanamycin cassette from pKD4 with flanking DNA to the gene targeted for deletion. For the forward primer (RF1), select 40bp from ATG backwards, then add 20bp from vector backbone (CATATGAATATCCTCCTTA). For the reverse primer (RR1), select 24bp from the last nucleotide (stop codon) of gene inwards and 16bp after stop codon (downstream of gene). Reverse complement this sequence, then add 20bp of reverse-complemented vector backbone sequence (GTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTCC). In order to incorporate the linear DNA into the chromosome of salmonella, we electroporate the PCR product into the Salmonella harboring pKD46. With the help of the red recombinase, the linear DNA can incorporate into the chromosome. Finally we lose pKD46 by incubating the plate at 43°C since pKD46 contains a temperature sensitive replicon.

Tumor implantation
The next resulted strain will be assayed of its ability to target tumors and the ratio of its number in tumors to that in normal tissues. B16F10 melanoma cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum by routine culture methods. For tumor implantation, 6-8 week female C57BL/6 mice were implanted subcutaneously (S.C.) on the mid-right side with 2×105 B16F10 cells in 0.1ML PBS. Normal tissues primarily infected by Salmonella include spleen and liver. Because of the size and accessibility of the liver, we generally use this organ as an indicator of the highest-level CFU in normal tissues.

Fatih_Turkey,2011,Team:Fatih Turkey#Anti LPS_-_-_TEXT.html,"). Our  interest in determining the crystal structure of LALF arose from its potential  in designing molecules that would have therapeutic properties in humans. It has  been proposed that LALF has sequence similarity with ct-lactalbumin, a protein  that binds LPS in vitro (Aketagawa et al., 1986).
 
     LALF recognizes the lipid A portion of  individual soluble LPS molecules (Warren et al., 1992), which are obtained  below the critical micellar concentration. The simplest molecules that bind  lipid A with high affinity are the polymyxin family of antibiotics; these are  positively charged amphipathic cyclic oligopeptides linked to a single fatty  acid (Morrison and Jacobs, 1976).

Endotoxin-neutralizing  protein, a recombinant peptide that is derived from Limulus  antilipopolysaccharide  factor and targets lipid A, could block the effects of lipopolysaccharide on  protein tyrosine phosphorylation, actin organization, and movement of 14C-bovine serum  albumin across bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cell monolayers.  endotoxin-neutralizing protein crossprotected against lipopolysaccharide  derived from diverse gram-negative bacteria. LALF is a 11.8-kDa protein  isolated from the amebocyte, the single blood cell type found in the horseshoe crab  (13).

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#TestDuke#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the feasibility of Solution, we gave two talks during the summer, one at the termly Corpus Christi College Biochemistry talks and another to a group of alumni from the Oxford Biochemistry department. Two important questions arose from these talks:
Have you considered whether the proteins you planning on secreting are immunogenic?
If you are to kill all of the pathogenic bacteria in the urinary tract, will that make fungal infections more likely?
Our Solution
Project Viability
Will Our Idea Work?
Ethics
To find out the public opinion on our project, we sent out a questionnaire to over 150 people, asking: 'If your doctor recommended a treatment for an infection, which involved the use of bacteria that had been engineered to treat the infection, would you use it?'. We also asked this question to a number of medical professionals during our visits to hospitals and clinics.
Whilst the majority of feedback was very positive, we did encounter some valuable criticism, as shown in the graph below. Most medical professionals we spoke to had positive responses, though one nurse did have certain reservations about our idea.
This proportion of negative feedback, although small, highlighted to us that our dialogue with the public needed to be improved. We believe that, through improving people's understanding of our project, we can convince pessimists that genetic engineering is now a force for good. This also led us onto holding talks to student groups, which you can find in the Increasing Awareness section below.
Nevertheless, this is very encouraging data for our project, and again highlights the importance of gaining support from doctors, because without their backing, this project is likely never to become as common a treatment as antibiotics.
The UTI Clinic
Delivery Method
Now that we had focused our project towards treatment of CAUTIs, we needed a suitable catheter design. We needed some method by which we could expose the catheter, and bladder, to our anti-microbial proteins, and in a safe manner.
First, we considered the idea of having our bacteria implanted within the patient, in the confines of the catheter. It was of paramount importance that we make sure the bacteria would be safely contained, and not be able to escape into the bladder to cause further infection.
Our team member Ria Dinsdale made the suggestion of using sol-gel as a possible method of containment. Despite being a very convincing idea, we found that it would be too difficult to design under the time restraints of the summer.
However, we subseqently found an alternative containment method,                             which we resurrected from the Oxford iGEM 2014 project 'DCMation'. Our predecessors' project"

DESCRIPTION
One hundred years ago, there was a young boy who was seeking a unique rose for his beloved girl. It was a freezing winter night, and all roses had died. After a long time searching in the withered rose bush, the young boy was desperate. Touched by his true love, a nightingale, who heard and understood his wish, sang all night under the cold moonlight. Just before dawn, a rose stained with the blood of the nightingale, bloomed, bright and fragrant.
The writer Oscar Wilde, created a red rose for true love out of the nightingale’s song under moonlight.[1] To Wilde, the unique rose stained with blood of the nightingale is the symbol of love and true art. To us UCAS-China iGEM team, the touching story should be passed down to our generation and explained in a scientific and creative way using the tools of synthetic biology. Furthermore, as Wilde conveyed in the story, the barrier and combination of art and science still remain worthy of discussion, so we also explored in depth the relationship of art and science in the Human Practices section .
.
Our project combines the four elements - music (the song of the nightingale), light (the moonlight), color (the stained rose) and odor (the rose fragrance). In our project every iGEMer is able to create his/her own rose with unique soul, together to form our rose forest in the junction of art and science!
DESIGN
In our project,  E. coli needed light and sound as inputs to produce color and odor as outputs. The process was mainly divided into three parts:"

The cultures were allowed to grow another three days (supplemented with tyrosine and ampicillin) to see if pigment would form, but we were unable to detect any melanin. The 1OD samples were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE to check for melA overexpression (Figure 3). The MelA tyrosinase is ~54 kDa in size. A faint band of approximately 54 kDa appears in the TON lane of culture 3. This indicated that we were successful in expressing the MelA tyrosinase from the pJET plasmid. Before the Jamboree, we will attempt another overexpression of MelA from the pSB1C3 plasmid.

 Biological Pigment Ink - Proof of Concept
When we were investigating what our proof of concept should be, we talked to the business liaison at the University of Lethbridge Greg Vilk, and he proposed the ""simple showcase"". He explained that in order to show that our project can work as intended, we need only to prove the concept in the easiest way (for more information concerning our interview with Greg Vilk, click here ). For our proof of concept, we intend make an ink with pigments extracted from an alternate source and put them into fountain pens. We bought common supplement tablets (Lutein tablets, which contain lutein and zeaxanthin and cranberry extract tablets, which contain anthocyanin). We attempted an extraction of the pigments using either acetone or water (Figure 4). Both solvents were able to extract pigment, but they resulted in different shades and intensities of colour. (Figure 4 and 5). Guar gum was added to a final concentration of 0.5% to increase the viscosity of the ink and help it bind to surfaces. The guar gum thickened the water based inks, but precipitated in the acetone based inks (Figure 2).

Valencia_Biocampus,2014,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," whose  binding energy makes them more standard also implies more stable promoters. Strong promoter sequences experience a decrease in synthesis rates when subjected to an increase of promoter energy. We use these results and the energy matrix derived in [3] to create an application that  is able to compute promoter sequences for a given relative (to the maximum) expression rate and associated standard and stable rate. The physical parameters behind are  the promoter strength (using the data of Anderson’ promoters) and the binding energy and the tool create a sequence of a constitutive promoter with the appropriated trade-off between strength and energy, therefore, with the appropriated trade-off between stability & standardization (ST$^2$)and rate of expression. We define the ST$^2$ index as $$ F_{st2} = (F - 0.012)/0.51 $$ with $$F = \frac{R'}{N_{NS}} e^{-\frac{\Delta\epsilon}{k_BT }}, $$ where $F_{sty}$ has been scaled to run from 1 to 0. We have used a fitting formula for the rate of expression relative to the maximum rate [3] as a function of the binding energy $\Delta\epsilon$,  $$ r_T = 2.29 + 0.27 \frac{\Delta\epsilon}{kT}. $$  With this approach, we can infer the ST$^2$ level and the promoter sequence for a given expression rate. We show below our app in javascript.

Comparison with wet-lab data
Our wet-lab results show that Biobrick 5 is the most standard one. Our model predicts that systems with less modules or factors will be more stable and standard. Biobrick 5 has a tetracycline depending promoter, whose limitating step is the binding of tetracycline to TetR. In this scenario, the intracellular concentration of aTc and the binding to the TetR repressor do not depend on the strain, so there is only one factor in which the strain could have an important effect: the TetR intracellular concentration, which has a constitutive expression. Analyzing the other Biobricks, we found that the strains with less expression of the constit"

XJTU-China,2018,Team:XJTU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," order to improve our projects, we have several interviews with experts in Microbiology, Medicine and Food, to collect information about diabetes, sweeteners, advantage of D-psicose as well as market and possible commercialization of D-psicose.
Part I
Diabetes and possible positive effects of D-psicose on diabetes
Prof.Jiankang Liu, Prof.Jiangang Long
Center for Mitochondria Biology and Medicine in Xi’an Jiaotong University
Prof. Liu and Prof. Long are specialists in mitochondria biology and nutrition regulation on aging and metabolic syndrome. We had an interview with them to obtain their professional opinions on nutrition-disorder related diseases and our D-psicose.
Keypoints
At present, diabetes is a complex disease, which is difficult to recover just using a single food treatment such as D-psicose-containing food.
Our project to enhance activity of key enzyme for D-psicose production by directed evolution and biosensor system has great potential for diabetes treatment.
They suggested that we need to know more about the toxicity and safety of D-psicose. Can it be used as a medicine instead of just as a sweetener? What’s the detailed mechanisms of D-psicose on diabetes and obesity, which are nutrition-disorder related diseases? How about the market and cost for this rare sugar?
Let us find the answers in the following human practice!
Dr. Hui Guo
Director of endocrinology department in First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University
We had a deep interview with Dr Guo, who is a doctor for diabetes treatment, to learn about the possibility of D-psicose as a drug for the treatment of diabetes.
Keypoints
D-psicose is suitable for the treatment of obesity and almost all types of diabetes (multi-site functions), which is very advantageous as a potential drug.
Safety of D-psicose is the major concern, and a series of clinical trials is needed before commercialization.
Diet control is very important to control blood sugar level and its intakes. A reasonable diet pyramid should be paid attention to for the diabetics.

To discuss details on our iGEM Goes Green collaboration with teams around the world, a skype call is always a great option. We were contacted by the iGEM Team Peshawar and also by the CCA iGEM Team via E-mail. They showed great interest in our initiative, as their project also concerns the environment. So, we had a skype meeting with the very first iGEM Team from Pakistan and with CCA iGEM from the US. After a shortfirst introduction on our teams and the project ideas, we talked about the tree planting project and also about the opportunities to save energy and avoid plastic waste offered in the GoGreenGuide. It was very nice to chat with them, answer some questions and to receive some further input.
Postcard collaboration
The iGEM Team from Düsseldorf-Cologne offered a postcard collaboration this year. We liked this idea very much and designed a special postcard for iGEM goes green (on recycled paper) to spread the word!
Let's plant a tree!
As a symbolic act of sustainability, we were encouraging all iGEM Teams to plant a tree as a compensation for the green house gas emissions produced due to our flight to Boston and back. So far, iGEM Peshawar, the Team from Southern Denmark and CCA`s iGEM Team ensured us to plant a tree. Our own team planted a tree (Quercus macrocarpa) in the Forest Park Tharandt near Dresden.

- tRNA synthetase specific for tyrosine and UAG codon in E. coli → Y-RS This is the wild type tyrosyl synthetase derived from Methanococcus janaschii to be used as an orthogonal tRNA synthetase in E. coli. It can be used in combination with the cognate tRNA BBa_K2020042 to incorporate tyrosine in response to an amber stop codon. Incorporation of ncAA with amber codon supression: Photo-cleavable non-canonical amino acids offer the opportunity to control protein function on a non-invasive basis. Working with non-canonical amino acids requires an additional, orthogonal pair of a tRNA and a cognate synthetase i.e. which does not crossreact with the endogenous tRNA/synthetase pairs. The tRNA's anticodon contains was mutated to an amber stop anticodon. Hence, it is possible to incorporate an amino acid at a chosen position in a protein via amber codon suppression. While working with amber codon supression, the Methanococcus wild type tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is present even in minimal media. Assembly in a synthetase plasmid for incorporation of (n)cAA: Most synthetases are used in low copy plasmids (e.g. pACYC). The tRNA and the synthetase have to be assembled in a low copy plasmid, each one with its own promoter and only one terminator. Recognition between tRNA and (n)cAA-synthetases derived from Mj: The Methanococcus janaschii wild type tyrosyl tRNA consists of two arms: Firstly, the acceptor-minihelix, where the ncAA will be attached to the 3' end and secondly, the anticodon containg arm. Synthetases interact mainly with the acceptor minihelix of the tRNA. Due to the lack of a recognizing element within the anticodon-containing section, a mutation of an anticodon base has a comparatively small effect on the aminoacylation efficiency and may explain why a variety of ncAA can be incorporated with this tRNA. Example measurement proving incorporation of amino acids: The wild type Methanococcus janaschii tRNA/synthetase pair for incorporation of tyrosine at an amber termination codon (the pair containing the tRNA mentioned above) is co-transformed with"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Description Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," constructed using these methods adapt the native cellular biosensing processes discussed previously, such as protein or RNA binding, and use these interactions to induce transcription of a reporter gene, such as a fluorescent protein. These sensors may be expressed as living whole-cell sensors, but are also increasingly being expressed in cell-free protein synthesis systems. However, thus far, the costs of these systems has been prohibitive to wide-spread use in synthetic biology (Smith et al., 2017).
Why are Biosensors Useful?
One main advantage of synthetic biology based biosensors is their cost-effectiveness. After the research stages, production of the biosensor relies only on the maintenance of a population of cells expressing an engineered system, which is a relatively cheap process in comparison to other traditional methods such as immunoassays or mass spectrometry. Synthetic biology biosensors can be designed to have no dependence on additional equipment, which not only adds to their cost-effectiveness, but also enables onsite diagnostics (Bhatia & Chugh, 2013). Synthetic biology approaches also enable the introduction of more complex behaviour into biosensor designs, such as logic gates which allow for signal generation in response to a variety of simultaneous triggers (Chappel & Freemont, 2011). One specific example of a biosensor is an arsenic biosensor, developed by Aleksic et al. (2007). This sensor was able to generate pH changes in response to the presence of arsenic in drinking water. In this system, ArsR, an arsenic responsive transcription factor, represses the pArs promoter in the absence of arsenic. When arsenic is present and bound to ArsR, the protein no longer binds and represses the promoter, enabling the transcription of downstream genes. In this example, the downstream gene is urease, which generates a detectable pH change. Therefore, the presence of arsenic can be detected by the monitoring of pH.
What problems do Biosensor Developers Face?
Our project focuses on the challenges of biosensor development: If synthetic biology biosensors are so much better than the alternatives, which are often expensive and not capable of onsite diagnosis, why isn’t their use more widespread? attempt to answer this question, we consulted various stakeholders in biosensor development: both in and outside the field of synthetic biology, from the early research stage to end-users. We skyped, emailed, attended conferences, detailed here (link to integrated HP) and even performed our own experiments (link to Biotech stuff). It was determined the problems faced by biosensor developers are in 5 main areas, detailed below. We spent the summer addressing these"

All data can be seen under Raw data
Stability assay
To determine the stability of our pSB1C3-K343006 plasmid, a stability experiment was carried out according to protocol [ SA1.1 ]. E.coli MG1655/pSB1C3-K343006 was grown in LB media without chloramphenicol, whereby no selection pressure is exerted on the bacteria. Dilutions of the culture was spreaded onto LA plates and LA plates with 35µg/mL chloramphenicol, respectively, and the colony forming units (CFU) was determined for each plate. The CFU for the LA plates represents the total amount of bacteria in the culture, and the CFU of LA plates with chloramphenicol corresponds to the amount of plasmid carrying bacteria. The percentage of the total amount of bacteria carrying the plasmid was plotted in a semi-logarithmic graph as a function of number of generations.
Figure 8: Stability assay of E. coli strain MG1655-pSB1C3-K343006 showing that almost all cells have shed their plasmids within 20 generations, however some cells kept the plasmids for up to 40 generations.All data can be seen under Raw data
As seen in the graph, almost all of the bacteria had lost the plasmid after 20 generations, suggesting that the plasmid is only stable within the cell for a few generations (<20). This is presumably due to the strain brought upon the bacteria by the plasmid. Thereby when the bacteria are carrying a high-copy plasmid like pSB1C3-K343006 it is plausible that the bacteria will quickly lose the plasmid when no longer exposed to a selection pressure.
Growth assay
The purpose of this assay is to see if our transformants deviate from the wild type in growth rate. In the growth measurement assay we have measured OD at 550 nm every hour for 12 hours and at hour 24. In the experimental setup we used, no lag phase was observed in any of the measurements. The graph below shows the growth of our wild type E. coli strain MG1655 and the MG1655/pSB1C3-K343006, respectively.

WE ARE PLANNING A BIOSENSOR FOR LOW CONCENTRATION SUBSTANCES THAT IS BASED ON A CLEVER GATE CONSTRUCT, COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BACTERIA AND SIGNAL FOCUSING – THIS IS WHERE THE AZOBENZENE COMES INTO PLAY.
Azobenzene is a photo-switchable molecule – when in dark the molecule is in trans isomer but when the molecule is exposed to short wavelengths of light it switches to cis isomer. This switch to cis isomer causes the azobenzene molecules to “stick” to one another. We plan on attaching the azobenzene molecules to the LPS of our E.coli and by that allowing the bacteria to group together and form a visible green aggregate. The transition to cis isomer happens when the molecules are exposed to UV light (which is harmful to DNA), but we have found that substitution of all four ortho positions with methoxy groups in an amidoazobenzene makes photoswitching possible using green light (530-560 nm).
The series of organic reactions are almost done! The next step is to attach the azobenzene to the bacteria and test the aggregate formation under a microscope (you can see updates in our Facebook page).
Faris, our chemist is creating azobenzene molecules, in a series of cuttingedge organic reactions, for a unique application in our biological system. - This is the first time ever that this molecule has been synthesized and it is being done in our lab! Faris was the first person to come up with the method of attaching the bacteria to each other using the azobenzene molecule.

Seres: Inhabitants of the Land of Silk
From our first contact with processing silk, our group became enamored with the look and feel of our silk, and the different forms it could take. We began to get involved with not just the scientific value, but the aesthetic of our silk products, and we knew there must be some application to it outside our laboratory.
Also from the onset of our project, we knew we wanted to share our fascination with silk to the outside community, and explore what potential uses our project could have. We dreamed big: we wanted our project to reach world of biomedical devices, optics and fashion. But we were also interested in what potential others saw in our project, and after reaching out to the community, our human practices was born.
Titled ""Seres: Inhabitants of the Land of Silk,"" our project is a collaboration with the UCLA Art | Sci Center dedicated to bridge the gap between art and science through an open exhibition. On display is work from artist Jason Fahrion, who grows silkworms and creates mosaics out of their naturally fluorescent coccoons, as well as our own iGEM wall, where we lay out an interactive web-like diagram breaking down how we process our silk into different materials like fibers, gels and dust, with samples for guests to see and feel and experience the silk the same way we get to in our lab. Also along the walls are other forms of silk art, including a glass display of live silkworms feeding on mulberry leaves, Jason's mosaics and a display of the historical uses of silkworms and their silk. Through this, we hope to have the community explore with us the art and beauty behind our science, and the science behind what we see as art.
The exhibition is open to the pubic, and here is a look inside ""Seres: Inhabitants of the Land of Silk.""

Ethical Approval:
Professor Rotimi introduced the concept of seeking ethical approval to trial SMITe, with the concern that coupling it with an antibiotic could promote the risks of resistance.
However, we considered further reaching complications of ethical approval and whether SMITe as a novel concept has more benefits to offer than risks.
How could you conduct ethically acceptable trials, not knowing what this structure might do? This issue is of paramount importance in trialing all drug candidates, so we respond to this question by intending to follow safety and toxicity testing protocols and working from the ground up in terms of in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials. We feel it could offer a possible low risk therapy for individuals who have tried all else and have life or limb threatening wounds.
Is the concept really new? We know already that not many biological wound dressings are in use but spider silk use in wounds dates back centuries, as it was observed to be non-immunogenic.  As a treatment platform however, our SMITe structure has many benefits to offer over the silk itself, including the futuristic possibility of constituting a personalised medication.
Could it be possible that in the future we could all attend a doctor's surgery, have our wound ""read & imaged"" in terms of it's microbiology and landscape, and a personalised SMITe dressing synthesised there and then!
This is based on the thought that if spider silk can be coupled with s.aureus combat proteins...why not others?
Could SMITe be applicable in a clinical setting? With the caveat of passing safety testing and toxicity trials- why not?
Is it acceptable in principle to patients to have a dressing of this nature? If maggots are an acceptable option, we think this is more benign, as possibly preferable if it is successful.
Could it be cost effective? As with any new, novel concept in therapeutics, recouping expenses is a necessity. However, with the added benefits of avoiding protracted inpatient stays for surgical debridement and dressings if it were to be effective, an appropriate but higher price than conventional dressings might turn out to be cost saving. Additionally, any new treatment able to provide an alternative to repeated antibiotics is an important weapon against this global threat and is therefore worth it's weight in gold!

The plasmids for quorum sensing experiments concerning the Lux system are made and operational to be used for experiments. We have three different plasmids:
Lux promoter folowed by GFP gene
Lux promoter followed by cisRNA and then by GFP
Lux promoter controlling the expression of taRNA and cisRNA. The cisRNA coding gene is followed by GFP.
The third plasmid corresponds to a riboregulating system. The second plasmid allowed us to validate the crucial role of taRNA in this riboregulating system.
On the modeling point of view, we only tried to fit the data coming from experiments done with plasmid one (with no riboregulating system) and plasmid three (with an effective riboregulating system). They were the only one to show an answer to a change of input that was not on the noise level.
The experimental setting was to inject different concentration of the signaling molecule AHL at the same time point into different bacterial colonies. The factor that we want to observe is the strength of the activation of the Lux promoter. The read-out is made by the fluorescence. The data was"

Recombination Module
Overview / Rationale
The final project in our module which activates after the delay produced by the Time Control module is the Recombination module. The purpose of this module is to create recombinase proteins which will cleave the plasmid at specific sites and separate the origin of replication from the gene of interest. The recombinase we chose to use in our project was Cre recombinase.
Cre recombinase does not destroy the entire plasmid and allows the cell to live after the gene sequence is removed. This could be advantageous in eukaryotic organisms where the death of healthy cells is not favorable and only the unwanted gene portion needs to be removed.
Cre recombinase is simple to use when two loxP sites are flanked around the sequence to be excised without the addition of other guided DNA/mRNA. It has been experimented with in mammalian organisms and extensively in mice. Similar recombinases such as Dre can be further added to splice other inserted gene sequences. The Dre recombinase recognizes its own specific sites so there will not be cross recombination between the two recombinases.
While Cre recombinase itself can only recombine about 55% of the plasmids to be in the recombined state due to the fact that it also catalyzes the reverse reaction back to the original state, our model shows that under when the population size is in equilibrium, the amount of the gene of interest is diluted after generations of cell replication and cell death.
Diagram 1. Cre recombinase targets lox mutant sites which will then recombine gene A, while Dre recombinase targets rox site which will recombine gene B
The function of the Cre-lox & Dre-rox is to knock out the gene of interest from the plasmid. Cre is a site-specific         DNA recombinase derived from the P1 bacteriophage while Dre derives from P1-like transducing phage D6 isolated from         Salmonella"

Conclusion
Concluding, we reflected our project with the different roles to make sure we did not miss anything. The workshop made us aware of the future challenge considering our project. Due to the reflection we gained insights in which things were beyond the scope of the project and we identified things we could still integrate in our project to make our project more relevant and responsible. Thinking from these four different perspectives was really effective. We were able to reflect the project on different levels, even though the team composition was balanced more towards the experts and system integrators.
Summary
The goal of the workshop had two sides. For iGEM, this workshop will be a design evaluation/reflection exercise. For the CEE it is important to receive feedback on the Engineering Roles; possibly determining more engineering roles and match specific skills with the roles.
To conclude, we reflected on our project with the different roles to make sure we did not miss anything. The workshop made us aware of the future challenges considering our project. Due to the reflection we gained insights in which aspects were beyond the scope of the project and we identified aspects that we could still integrate in our project to make our project more relevant and responsible.

But over time and with continued work, we believe it has the potential to be a more ethical and sustainable alternative to our current system of production.
The production of milk and cheese using milk from factory-farmed animals has a host of environmental and ethical problems.  The conclusion of the 400-page UN report ""Livestock’s Long Shadow"" has this to say:
…the livestock sector is a major stressor on many ecosystems and on the planet as whole. Globally it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases and one of the leading causal factors in the loss of biodiversity…
While our team is still working on a comparison of the expected impact on climate change per gram of cheese produced using traditional methods versus yeast-based production, it will likely be relatively simple to contain the carbon dioxide released from large bioreactors, while doing the same for the methane produced by grazing cattle poses a unique and difficult challenge. At first glance, the required food source for yeast is potentially less favorable than that preferred by cows, since yeast’s preferred diet of sugars makes it compete with humans for arable land capable of supporting sugar-producing plants, whereas ungulates are able to digest foods that grow on land less suited for traditional crops. In reality, both bioreactors and livestock are often fed with various industrial byproducts not fit for human consumption, which complicates the comparison and makes it difficult to ascertain how bioreactors compare to cows in their effect on biodiversity and on the global food supply. A more thorough analysis is part of our effort, and we welcome anyone who wishes to collaborate or critique.
Concerns about GMOs
Using genetic engineering to challenge our current system of factory farming makes this an interesting ethical quandary for many of those who oppose GMOs and champion the ethical treatment of animals. There are three important points that those who have concerns about GMOs should consider:
Real Vegan Cheese will not contain any GMOs. The genetically engineered yeast is only used to produce milk-protein. The yeast itself stays behind while only the milk-protein becomes part of the cheese.
The yeast will be contained in bioreactors, not grown freely in the environment.  Additionally, the strains of yeast will be engineered to prevent them from growing outside of the intended bioreactors. This will prevent environmental contamination and contamination of the products of nearby yeast farmers (brewers and bakers).
This method of production has been used for more than three decades, safely, successfully, and at large scale to produce anything from vanillin (vanilla flavor) to life-saving drugs such as insulin and"

At the beginning of the game, players can run the oscillation waves by dropping signaling molecules on the cells that have constructions related to quorum sensing. Running this simulation, the players will learn about ideas of oscillator.
But as you know, this game does not realize ‘clock’. If it is clock, it has to overcome two problems; it need to move in one direction and it must not have autonomic oscillation because the number of a clock hand must be one.
In order to make multicellular analogue clock, we made effort developing from this simple oscillation. If you want to know more detail, please enjoy our Multicellular Analogue Clock page!
The game is also implemented with an action game. In the action game, you can assign cells which emit signaling molecules to kill bad bacterias.
The action game is designed so that you not only enjoy the game but also learn how the clock works.

BactWars - a new hope for antimicrobial resistance and global epidemics
Many ideas, one goal: fighting bacteria with bacteria
In today’s world, antimicrobial resistance is one of the most serious issues that humanity has to face. At the same time the most vulnerable people have to face epidemics due to lack of medication access and harsh conditions. In this context, we decided to develop a biological tool able to neutralize antibiotic resistance genes.
We designed and engineered a conjugative plasmid that will be able to propagate within bacteria and neutralize targeted genes to re-sensitize bacteria or kill them. To this end, a plasmid featuring high efficiency of transfer and broad host specificity has been equipped with a CRISPR Cas9 system and one or more guide RNAs. Upon expression in recipient cells, the customized CRISPR Cas9 system will selectively inactivate the targeted organisms by introducing double-strand breaks into its genome. This ways we can handle bacterial pathogens that are responsible for serious infectious diseases and epidemics.
The combination of inactive Cas9 (dCas9) and conjugative plasmid for the transcriptional control of target genes has already been described (ref. doi: 10.1021/sb500036q). Relying on this publication, we want to push this forward and check for possible field applications. We plan to first demonstrate that the system works between different gram negative species and secondly, to build a fully equipped conjugative plasmid armed with several guide RNAs, an efficient bio containment system for preventing its dissemination in nature, and a tracking device for monitoring its dissemination in a bacterial population."
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#humanPracticeC_-_-_TEXT.html," This is really a great way of communication, for we do not have to say too much to put our achieves across to those who really want to know our work, which really works. Great contributions have been given through github and we get a lot of advices and opinions as well.
Community
To better promote synthesis and the spirit of IGEM, we decided to establish a community together with IGEM USTC team. For the community, we have set regular classes and lectures for both synthesis biology and IGEM. We also open our laboratory to our community members and teach them basic skills of biology experiment(as in the right picture), like PCR. Of course, this is the main field we will update our progress on in the future.

Looking at Groningen’s results, it would be more appropriate to say that the population of  cells that is transformed with plasmid containing BBa_K607036 ( BBa_I0500 - BBa_E0840 ) showed gradual response to increasing arabinose concentration.
Different genetic context could be responsible for the different response of the PBAD promoter.
Due to lack of manpower, unfortunately, we could not produce 3-D graphs for cells with pSB1C3 backbone as controls. Assuming that Groningen 2011 result was valid, we can speculate  that difference of the PBAD promoter response could have resulted from the different backbone that we have used to characterize the promoter. In fact, Cambridge 2011,  who also observed all-or-none response ( Experience page. ) used pSB3K3 as backbone for their constructs. Without proper  controls, it is hard to make a conclusion.

This DNA part will encode for an RNA riboswitch senstive to theophylline. The RBS is not exposed in the absence of theophylline. When theophylline is present, it binds to the riboswitch and causes a conformational change which leads to the exposure of the RBS and consequently translation of the adjoining gene. In this case, the gene which will be expressed is CheZ, which is a protein fundamental to bacterial movement. This theophylline riboswitch (type1) CheZ fusion BioBrick activates the expression of the CheZ gene in a theophylline-dependent fashion. It is composed of a theophylline-sensitive riboswitch clone 8.1 (Topp and Gallivan JACS 2007; BBa_K249026 and BBa_K411001) that is detached from its associated translation unit (coding region) and fused to a CheZ gene which has a N-fusion prefix and lacks a stop codon (although a TAG stop codon is provided by the RFC 25 suffix). The riboswitch regulated N-terminal part can be fused to a reporter or other CDS.
CheZ is the chief regulator of the molecular events that lead the counter clockwise rotation of the flagella motor during the chemotaxis signal transduction pathway of E.coli. This counter clockwise flagella motor rotation results in bacterial swimming (instead of tumbling) in the presence of a chemoattractant (in this case, theophylline).

This DNA part will encode for an RNA riboswitch senstive to theophylline. When no theophylline is present, the RBS within the riboswitch sequence is not exposed to translation machinery. When theophylline is present, it binds to the riboswitch and causes a conformational change which results in the RBS being exposed. This allows for the translation of the adjoining gene. In this case, the gene which will be expressed is CheZ - a fundamental protein in the signalling cascade of bacterial chemotaxis.

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2010,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#result_-_-_TEXT.html," mixed with 10% FBS, the Ca2+ concentration in this medium is about 2mM, which is not negligible in our experiment. In order to make clear whether the Ca2+ in the medium could activate the MEF-Jet circuit or not, we need to eliminate all dissolved Ca2+ cation and then measure the activity of luciferase.
Method: EGTA(ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid) has a high affinity for calcium so we use it as a kind of calcium chelator to eliminate the Ca2+ in the medium. In our experiment, EGTA was added into medium 8h after transfection with MEF-Jet. The experimental groups was added EGTA while the control ones not. Dual-Luciferase assay was conducted 24h after transfection.
Result: After treated with EGTA, the expression activity of luciferase shows slightly increase with the increase of the concentration of Ionomycin (shown in figure below column marked A, B and C). However, the increase of expression level is not as high as we have expected because column a, who is supposed to have no luciferase expression showed high level fluorescence.
Conclusion: To explain the result, we need to look carefully into the mechanism of MEF2 enhancer. As is explained in the project page, MEF2 enhancer who recruits series of transcription factors regulates the activity of transcription mainly by epgenetically process (MEF2 recruits HDACs to down regulate transcription and p300 HAT to up regulate it). However, in our experiments, we use pcDNA as our vector, which will not be integrated into the cell chromosome and the system it contains will not be modified by nucleosome. Therefore, the transcription activity has less relationship with the stimuli of ionomycin. Moreover, as a synthetic core promoter, JeT promoter has relatively high level of transcription activity, that result in the luciferase expression when there is no calcium (column a, with EGTA added and no ionomycin introduced).
This problem will be solved if we use viral vectors instead of pcDNA, however, viral transfection and cell culture methods takes much more time than our current method and we did not have time to finish these experiments before the deadline when wiki freezes.
3. Could ChR2 and MEF-JeT work together as expected?

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," photovoltaic cell of the detector gets a lens placed on it that will direct all light into each cell of the detector. This means we need a matrix, or “array”, of lenses that are only a few micrometers small.  These ‘microlens arrays’ already exist, and have been shown to be a good technique to focus more light onto photovoltaic cells, including the detector of a microscope (Jutteau, Paire, Proise, Lombez, & Guillemoles, 2015) . We will also use this technique. However, we will not use the conventional, chemically produced microlenses, since they are very costly and their production is difficult and bad for the environment (Nam et al., 2013) . Therefore, we aim to produce our own, biological microlenses that will be much greener and environmentally friendly compared to the conventional microlenses. Furthermore, we will also apply our biological microlenses in applications, other than microscopy, where collecting light is important. One of these applications in which we will apply our biological lenses are solar cells, more information can be found on the practices page .
So how do we aim to produce these biological lenses using synthetic biology? The approach is the same as for the biological lasers: we transform E. coli with the silicatein gene. This gene allows the cell to cover itself in glass, resulting in a glass sphere of only 1-2 µm small. We will test the optical properties of this glass sphere as well as its functionality as a microlens. Since the shape of lenses is of high importance, we will also research ways to manipulate the size and shape of the cells, enabling us to produce different shapes of microlenses. Also, since our biological microlens contains a core of live bacteria, we will look into ways to sterilize the lens. This way, our product will not harm the environment in any way. Our parts, experiments and results can be found in the Experiments section
Figure 6: By transforming E. coli with a gene for the enzyme silicatein, the bacterium is able to coat itself with polysilicate, a kind of biological glass. This turns the bacterium in a glass sphere of 1-2 µm that can function as a microlens.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Team#collab_-_-_TEXT.html," media.Due to time constraints the lb experiment was repeated 6 times and 5 times for the m9 media with a water calibration being done each time and then the result averaged, errors were taken as the standard deviation of the measurements.Using the apparatus we had available we found the thermal conductivity of lb and M9 to be similar to that of water.The conductivity of water at room temperature is 598.4 $\frac{mW}{Km}\text{ }$(mili watt per metre kelvin). We found the conductivity to be (605 $\pm$ 20) $\frac{mW}{Km}\text{ }$ and (570 $\pm$ 30) $\frac{mW}{Km}\text{ }$ for LB and m9 respectively.
These values were fairly reliable to what we experienced during the test. The lb media took the same time to cool down to equilibrium as the water control test and thus the conductivities should be the same. The m9 sample took longer than water to cool down which correlated with the fact the conductivity was lower.

To avoid these risks, several kill switch mechanisms should be implemented into the final device. This could be performed by implementation of a kill switch activated by exposure to light in the energy converting unit. This would of course mean, that the energy converting unit’s container would need to block all sunlight. A task that could easily be carried out by adding Carbon Black to the required areas of the container. The energy storing unit, which requires light to function, could then have a kill switch which makes it dependent on the presence of the energy converting unit. This could be accomplished by having harmless molecules, not naturally found in nature but required for the survival of the energy converting unit, circulating in the system. A similar effect could be accomplished by making the bacteria in the energy converting and storing units codependent on each other for their survival. The implementation of such kill switch mechanisms would tremendously improve the biosafety of the device by opposing hazards related to any kind of physical breakage.

Parts Submitted to the Registry
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts on the Registry than on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
When should you put parts into the Registry?
As soon as possible! We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better recall you will have of all details surrounding your parts. Remember you don't need to send us the DNA to create an entry for a part on the Registry. However, you must send us the sample/DNA before the Jamboree. Only parts for which you have sent us samples/DNA are eligible for awards and medal requirements.
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer."

We incorporated feedback from the Lethbridge EMS and Fire department to directly influence our design strategy.
The University of Lethbridge iGEM team was approached by our local Fire and EMS department regarding a problem related to safety and cleaning standards in ambulances. Ambulances are the point of contact between sick patients and the hospital, and they have the potential to be reservoirs of pathogens. The incidence of multiple antibiotic resistant pathogens is on the rise which has led to an ongoing reassessment of cleaning standards in order to best prevent transmission. After every patient, only visible bodily fluids are cleaned, and deeper cleans of the ambulance occur once a month.  However, it is unknown whether reservoirs of potentially virulent pathogens exist that are not visible to the naked eye, or whether current cleaning products are doing what they claim. With the current cleaning method it is possible that pathogens are being spread to hospitals, or other places in the community.
Our team consulted current literature in order to determine the best approach for our study. We found no studies in Canada, and from the global studies we were able to pinpoint sample locations and sampling techniques. All of the studies used cell culturing as their method of sample analysis, and found consistent results for pathogens identified.
In order to design something that would be practical and beneficial for the EMS to implement, and assess the real world applications and implications of our project, we met with first responders and participated in ride alongs. Before and after the ride alongs we surveyed first responder’s to get a better understanding of what areas they felt would be the dirtiest in the ambulance. With this new information, we developed a novel approach to assess the vehicle microbiome and monitor cleaning processes, the first of its kind in Canada.

Evry,2016,Team:Evry#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," and a MSc in microbiology, I signed to join the thrilling army of mSSBers, discovering, let’s say, the motivating, cosmopolitan, environment of Evry and the associated bunch of brilliant new friends.  As for my role in the team, I was mainly present at the beginning of the project to coordinate the mess, to launch the administrative part, and to trigger brainstorming sessions at the pub. Then most of my tasks consisted in investigating on how Maria felt on late Friday nights. I also, c’est vrai, enjoyed the organization of The European Experience, and I took part in our search for sponsors.
On a more personal point of view, talking about passions: I have been working in science mediation for more than three years now. Because, you know, you can’t entirely know the science when blablabla… And now I will be back to Brest and to my first love (the ocean), to try to get myself a PhD by applying metabolic engineering to a marine extremophilic microbe.

Hi, I am Taman ! I made an Erasmus before entering my Master and I wanted to taste international vibes once again. I am curious about everything so when I heard “international project” and “whatever your field of study, you can come”, I joined straight away.
I like to understand scientific concepts but I am more interested on how it interacts with society. And as synthetic biology is new to me, I have learnt a lot!
My role in the team is to develop the Human practices section and to coordinate the European Experience event.

Deactivated State
In the first state, cI434 levels are high and cI levels are low. This leads to high transcription from pR and low transcription from pRM, which, in this particular circuit, results in GFP production. The switch can be flipped by increasing cI levels.
Activated State
In the second state, cI levels are high and cI434 levels are low. This leads to high transcription from pR and low transcription from pRM, and therefore RFP is produced. Empirical evidence shows the switch will spontaneously decay back to the deactivated state. This is probably due to the high basal transcription levels of pR.
Our Design: Locking Switch
For our switch, we desired a simple circuit with a stable on state. The parts we used are ptrp, cI434, pRM, trpR, and cI. As in the Peking switch, cI activates pRM and cI434 represses pRM. We cloned two additional parts for our switch: ptrp and trpR. ptrp is the well-known trp promoter and operator sequence. trpR is the corresponding repressor which is induced by tryptophan. In our system, we will assume there are constantly high levels of tryptophan so that trpR will always act as a repressor.
Deactivated State
When deactivated, cI434 levels are high, trpR levels are low, and cI levels are low. This results in high transcription from ptrp, low transcription from pRM, and thus low output signal. The switch can be flipped by reducing transcription from ptrp.
Activated State
In the active state, cI434 levels are low, trpR levels are high, and cI levels are high. This results in low transcription from ptrp, high transcription from pRM, and thus high output signal. Since trpR is a strong repressor for ptrp, we expect state 2 to be stable.
mRFP1
For our output signal, we decided to use mRFP1. mRFP1 is a red fluorescent protein based on DsRed. Natural DsRed requires tetramerization in order to fluoresce. mRFP1 contains 33 mutations that, one, allow it to function as a monomer and, two, allow it to fold more quickly. It has many attractive qualities: the color is visible in normal lighting; no special supplements are necessary"

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Model#flagellin_-_-_TEXT.html,"ani, 1974), it must be slower in nucleation as well. But by how much? To calculate the $k_n$ of E. coli from that of Salmonella, we must find the underlying mechanistic consistency between elongation and nucleation. The theory of Kashchiev (2015) revealed the mechanism underlying protein polymerization and guided us in this transferring process. It viewed nucleation as a “harder” kind of elongation. Before the seed is formed, the structure of the subnuclei is highly unstable, and once the nucleation is complete, the elongation based on the formed seed is much easier. Based on the equations it proposed, we derived the corresponding $k_n$ of E. coli from the data we already had from Wakabayashi et al. (1969) and Kondoh and Hotani (1974).
Although we derived the above parameters strictly from literature, they are still only rough estimates. Due to time constraints, we were not able to conduct experiments to measure them, but in the future such measurements will provide more accurate estimations of these parameters. Also, note that the solution of our equations varies continuously with the parameters, so small deviations from the actual values will not affect the general characteristics of our results.
Numerical Simulation
We are interested in how we can adjust the parameters $C_s$ (which is determined by the concentration of yeasts) and $C_{m0}$ (which is the initial concentration of monomers) to achieve the best possible results. Here, we say that the result is good if a high percentage of display sites on the yeasts have nucleated into seeds. We define an index $\theta = \frac{C_{ns}}{C_s}$ to measure the performance of the system.
To find the parameters that maximize $\theta$, we did a parametric sweep in the range specified in Table 2. (See Parameter Estimation section for derivation of the search range.) For each combination of parameters, we ran a numerical simulation of the ODEs in a time range of 10 hours, which is about the maximum acceptable reaction time given by our teammates in wet lab. We plotted the resulting $\theta$ in the following graph.
Figure 1 Parametric sweep to find the best $C_{m0}$ and $C_s$ to maximize $\theta$.
See Parameter Estimation section for derivation of the search range
We can see that $\theta$ barely changes when $C_s$ changes, which is reasonable since $C_s << C_{m0}$. $\theta$ increases almost linearly"

Because we just wanted to test our primers in this PCR, we used Taq polymerase, because although it doesn’t proofread, it is remarkably cheaper than Pfu. On the Fermentas homepage we found that the annealing temperature for Taq is Tm-5 , which in this case means 40˚C. However, Taq polymerase is not very effective at temperatures under 50˚C so we designed the gradient to lies between 40 and 55˚C. The PCR machine chose the following temperatures:

        We have found that in China, 69.35%  of the respondents believe that they suffer from water pollution and 14.52% of  them think their hometown is seriously polluted. But in U.K., surprisingly, 64%  of the people believe that they do not suffer from any kind of water pollution.  This interesting phenomenon appears in London (which we initially thought the  water was serious polluted by industry long times ago), all of the respondents  from London think that the water, for example in Thames, was clean and clear.

Use 2009 Minnesota igem team as a trial, I list out all the materials we need in our database but detect that there are some details we can not cover in our database. Try to tackle with this problem with Chen Liao.
What’s more, I apply for some financial aid or fund for my trip to MIT and fortunately I get it from my own department: School of Computer Science and Technology! Thanks to the support of my department, I can get a chance to America, to MIT, so I have to express my appreciation again! Though it is just founded before long and doesn’t have much finance at present, my school gives great supports to students and aids them to expand the horizon and improve their abilities in comprehensive fields. With a lot of young but full of research background teachers and professors, I think my school will have a bright future!

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Hybrid_-_-_TEXT.html," set of points scattered in space.       A simple first-order approach would be to determine                         the closest grid point to any agent and simply increment a counter belonging to                         that grid point. This results in a histogram, which can be used directly to                         represent the agent density. However, the resulting density is a blocky,                         nonsmooth function which poorly represents the underlying agent distribution.                         The effect of a single agent is artificially confined to a single grid point,                         while in reality an agent’s influence could reach much further than a single                         grid point. The shape of a histogram is also very dependent on the bin size,                         which in this case corresponds to the grid spacing so it cannot be independently                         tuned. To decouple grid spacing and agent density and achieve a smoother density                         function, we made use of a more sophisticated technique called kernel density                         estimation (KDE).
KDE is used in statistics to estimate the probability density of a set discrete                         data derived from a random process. The basic idea consists of defining a                         kernel function that represents the density of a single data point, then                         centering kernel functions on every data point and summing them all up to                         achieve a smooth overall density function, as demonstrated in the Figure 6.
Figure 6
Kernel density estimation. Click to enlarge.
This                         kernel function can be anything as long is it continuous, symmetric and                         integrates to 1, since it represents one data point or one agent in our case.                         Some of the most common kernel functions include Gaussian kernels, triangular                         kernels and Epanechnikov kernels (14), which are shown in Figure 5.

Confirming the sub-cellular localisation of acyltransferases in plant chloroplasts
AIM:
To determine if our synthetic chloroplast transit peptide would direct the putative acyl trasnferases to the plant chloroplast. The aim of this experiment is to confirm that our constructs localise the acyl transferase to the plant chloroplast.  In order for the enzymes that we have chosen to acylate starch, the enzymes need to reach the chloroplast of a cell as this is where starch is produced.
METHOD:
We transformed our binary vector constructs (see results “Making constructs to express putative acyl-transferases in plant chloroplasts” for the details of these constructs) containing the acyltransfeases with an N-terminal transit peptides and  C-terminal fluorescent reporters into Agrobacterium tumefaciens by electroporation (see Protocols - here ). Colonies were checked by PCR before liquid cultures were grown from individual colonies for infiltration of plant leaves (see Protocols - here ). Finally, infiltrated leaves were examined by confocal microscopy to determine the subcellular localisation of the recombinant protein.
RESULTS:
Colonies of A. tumefaciens were screened by PCR to confirm the presence of the binary construct (Figure 1).
