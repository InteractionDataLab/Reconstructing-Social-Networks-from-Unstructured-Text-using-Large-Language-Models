UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

Extract a specific DNA band from an agarose electrophoresis gel.
Materials
QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, 28706)
Scale
Scalpel
Heating block
Water bath
UV light box, equipped with blue diodes (long wavelength)
Procedure
According to the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit's manual
Using a UV light, excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
Weigh the gel slice in an Eppendorf tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg ~ 100 μl).
Incubate at 50°C for 10 minutes (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). To help dissolve the gel, mix by vortexing the tube every 2 to 3 minutes during the incubation.
After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose).
Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mix.
To bind DNA, pipet the sample onto the QIAquick column and spin in a microfuge for 1 min.
(Optional): Add 0.5 mL of Buffer QG to QIAquick column and spin again.
To wash the column, add 0.75 mL of Buffer PE to QIAquick column and spin.
Transfer QIAquick column to a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube or to a provided 2ml collection tube. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g).
Place QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 50 μl of Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or H2O to the centre of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 minute at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g). Alternatively, for increased DNA concentration, add 30μl elution buffer, let stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 minute.

Building With Biology Event
Stony Brook iGEM collaborated with The Maritime Explorium to plan a Building With Biology Event. This event was designed to educate children aged 6-13 on synthetic biology through hands on activities and conversations with iGEM team members and other scientists. The events included teaching the children about DNA and cellular functions, the influence of synthetic biology in things that they already see every day, like food, and about BioBricks and how they're used. Activities were aimed not just to educate the attendees, but to alleviate any fears about synthetic biology and genetic engineering that the public had. We also spoke to some of the older attendees about research since some of them were interested in it but didn't know how to get involved.
New York Hall of Science Forum
Team members ran a forum centered around the ethics of genetic engineering, specifically applied to mosquitos. We facilitated discussion between scientists and the public on the impact genetic engineering could have and its presence in the world today. We also participated in a mixer with attendees to address any questions they had about genetic engineering. We also presented on our project and the implications it could have in the future.
DNA Learning Center
iGEM team members went to the DNA Learning Center at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to present about iGEM, what BioBricks are, how they're made, and what purpose they'd have, as well as our projects and why we're doing them. We also spoke about iGEM as a research opportunity, since the majority of the audience were incoming high school freshmen who were interested in genetic engineering and research on biological systems. We also spoke to the assistant director of the learning center about helping her out with a class that the lab plans to hold on synthetic biology in the future and making ourselves available if she needed us.
Port Jefferson Maker's Faire
The team represented iGEM at The Maker's Faire, an event that allows the local youth to explore science and robotics and meet innovators in the field. We were able to set up a table and talk to people about what iGEM and synthetic biology are all about. We also held demonstrations of elephant toothpaste using yeast, and afterwards, explaining that yeast's uses aren't limited to beer, bread and bubbles, but can also be used for vaccine preservation and cancer detection as well.

Conclusions
The aim of the Fim switch part was to make a processor module which can be visually inspected for functionality.  The Fim switch has been shown to expresses the eforRed chromoprotein under normal (uninduced) conditions which allows the user to both determine that the strain is alive and has maintained the Fim switch plasmid.  Following induction, the Fim promoter flips direction and begins expressing RhlI which synthesises the C4-AHL quorum sensing molecule.  This has been shown to successfully induce expression of sfGFP in the reporter strain ( BBa_K2205015 ).
Despite several attempts we were unable to produce a Fim switch testing construct where fimE expression could be controlled using the E. coli arabinose inducible promoter.  Though transformations did yield some colonies when trying to make this part, none were red in colour.  This possibly indicates that the arabinose inducible promoter (even when grown on 0.5% w/v glucose) is still too active.  The design for this construct has been submitted ( BBa_K2205006 ).
Future Work
Since there is some leaky expression of the fimE gene (even without a promoter) to fine tune the Fim switch the lac operator could be inserted upstream of the fimE RBS to repress unwanted expression.  The part could then be used following the addition of IPTG.  An alternative method would be to clone a transcriptional terminator upstream of the fimE RBS to prevent leaky expression from elsewhere in the plasmid.

Overview
Oxidation damage, aging and relative diseases are highly related to human health. Antioxidants are currently effective treatments. However, detection approaches to antioxidant are quite limited, especially in living-cells. Traditional methods largely focused on direct redox reaction which may have non-proper relation to living systems. Living cells are integrated with multiple natural anti-oxidant systems, including anti-oxidant enzyme system, reductive system, post-damage repair system, etc. All these make it sophisticated to evaluate real effects from exogenous antioxidant. To date, substantial efforts have been devoted to developing alternative strategies that can overcome the disadvantages and difficulties of online antioxidant detection in living cells .There is still no ideal result.                             One promising and challenging method for accomplishing this purpose is to construct a ""living antioxidant detection device"" via synthetic biology method. Yeast was used as host cell as it can present a simple and accurate measuring platform for us. Furthermore, we constructed multiple functional gene circuits to implement ROS regulating, endogenous redox reaction testing, and feedback regulation, etc. These results together demonstrate the excellent potential of this project in detecting antioxidant easily, accurately, fast and economically.
Ancient times, searching for anti-aging ways and secret of life's aging attract have been                         attracting countless passionate people.
Since 19th century, people have gradually realized the significance of antioxidants in solving                         the anti-aging puzzle and launched tireless exploration.
Chemical methods (1990s)
With the development of analytical methods and detection methods (such as L-band electron spin                         resonance (ESR), various probes, magnetic resonance imaging spin trapping and so                         on)，researchers have more confidence and ability to detect antioxidants. Besides, driven by the                         public's eagerness for health and beauty, many chemical detection methods emerged around the                         20th century.

UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"As a result of this paradigm, we uncovered a critical lag in the development of commercially available liquid biopsy tests. One of the reasons was that scientists and clinicians did not have a centralized methodology for determining biomarkers of interest for specific diseases. Instead, labs would independently identify these markers and then publish papers to communicate their results. Our team believed that because our idea approached cancer diagnostics from a completely new angle and with the development of an uncommon diagnostic metric, it would be important to create a modular biomarker discovery tool that can analyze any existing methylome data and can also integrate existing datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas.
Expansion of our workflow to integrate a digital health platform
In addition to addressing a core issue in cancer diagnostics, our team’s exploration of the patient care journey led us to identify another significant economic burden on our healthcare system: doctors are unable to ascertain if a treatment has been effective or not long enough because of poor doctor-patient communication. To address this issue, our team developed a functional prototype of a digital health platform.
Development of novel use cases
Although clinicians cautioned us that using promoter methylation as a diagnostic indicator could impact the overall accuracy of our test, implementation of novel signal amplification strategies helped address many of these concerns. In addition to implementing our idea as a early screening tool, our interactions with industry professionals and social innovators led us to the realize the value of hypermethylation’s continuous nature. As such, we were able to develop a novel use case centered around post-therapy response.
IHP Flowchart
Expert Interviews
UCSD Health System
We were fortunate enough to be active in the clinical immersion process. Although the names of the patients are covered for confidentiality purposes, we were able to gain an in-depth perspective of a cancer patient’s journey throughout the diagnostics journey. We understood that patient normally goes through the following stages: prognosis, diagnosis, verification through companion diagnostics, treatment, and post-therapeutic monitoring. The most common method of identifying cancer would be to take a tissue biopsy, and there were a number of issues here for patients: namely the invasiveness and the price point. They also talked about the significant emotional cost that a patient and their family face during this journey. A secondary concern was that a long turnaround time may impede treatment. After talking to several clinicians, they also mentioned that tissue biopsies are not always the best option, as they can spread cancers in certain instances or they might cause further complications. In addition, often times, the first biopsy may result in inconclusive diagnosis, and attempting a second biopsy may present risks.

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"PCR). EP-PCR involves the addition of Mn2+, which increases the error rate of Taq DNA polymerase. This creates random mutations within the region defined by the primers, the number of which can be controlled by the number of doublings.
For shorter sequences (<100bp), chemical synthesis of the sequences is preferred. However, in our case, we were unable to use this for two reasons: firstly, amilCP, at 669bp, is too large to be chemically synthesised. Secondly, we were looking for random mutations rather than targeted mutations, as it was unknown what mutations would be needed to create different colour mutants.
A high throughput method is also needed to screen the large number of mutants produced by EP-PCR.  In our case, this involved scoring the colonies that had been transformed with the EP-PCR products based on colour. Mutants that appeared to be dark blue in colour, as well as other coloured mutants, such as purple and pink, were then selected for sequencing.
The concentration of Mn2+ plays a large role in the mutation rate. 0.1mM MnCl2 was the optimum concentration for the EP-PCR, as it resulted in roughly half the colonies remaining blue after being transformed, while the other half were white or other colours. It was found that the use of concentrations above 0.6mM MnCl2 resulted in a marked decrease in the amount of product (Figure 1). This was likely because at such concentrations the Mn2+ had decreased the fidelity of Taq to the point that it was unable to continue amplifying along the entire sequence.
Figure 1. Increasing concentrations of MnCl2 decreases the amount of amilCP product. Products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel in 1X TAE at 100V for 1h, and post stained in Gel Green for 1h.
                                                                       
Results: Number of Mutants
Following transformation, the colours of the colonies on the plates were scored and counted to assess the EP-PCR efficiency. Using 0.1mM of Mn2+, the majority of colonies (55%) were white, indicating that the amilCP coding region had experienced loss of function mutations. Subsequent sequencing indicated that these were most deletions resulting in frameshifts. A large proportion of colonies (34%) were scored as ‘blue’, indicating that they were of a similar shade to the wild type. A small number of mutants appeared to be darker blue or purple/pink (1.5% and 1."

Wiki"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," is a TED-like forum jointly set up by CAS Computer Network Information Center and CAS Science Communication Bureau, inviting elites to share new ideas and discoveries. Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Social Media
Because the geographic location of our exhibition is not good enough, there are still a lot of people without access to our projects and synthetic biology. So we need to use internet if we want them be promoted to much more people. To increase the coverage of our propaganda, we cooperated with Biosns. By means of their channel, our information has been reported by over 30 media including 6 listed companys. Among them, Tencent just has Chinese news coverage up to 89.73% and users up to over 1 billion, the number of which is about summation of user number of top three Chinese operators.
Life Science Community
During the process of promoting our projects and synthetic biology, we realized that those people working on biological research are the ones really affecting on development of synthetic biology. Therefore, we hope to discuss with some large biological firms about drug resistance and synthetic biology. We have visited more than 10 biological firms this year, introducing synthetic biology. Finally, we raised interest of 5 firms and got their supports on technology and lab supplies. By the way, Biosns has showed amazing support to us. Using their mail system, we deliver messages about our projects, synthetic biology exhibition and the 10th anniversary of iGEM, to their 500 thousand users. The uninterrupted delivery repeated every 30 seconds until the user read the mail. So we can know from the background data that how many people really know our information.

In Attendance: Patrick, Robert, Tom, Duke, Ryan
After a roughly a week's break from official activities the team met to discuss strategies and tactics.
A few hands have been taking up the lab tech training from Tom and Duke throughout the lazy summer days, while doing so they revisited the basic procedural steps of ligation, gel-phoresis, transformation, as well as the tasks of mixing and pouring media, basic chemical preparation, as well as safety and hygeine in the lab. Tom has also been introducing us to the concepts behind workflow and how to divide and stage the various processes towards a greater project concept.
Miles suggested that he will be working towards several ideas in hardware project construction from a PCR unit to a DNA synthesizer. We discussed in depth Patrick's idea for the creation of a cellular automaton. He broke down the previous tactics in DNA computing where everything is synthesized then re-sequenced for the answer, then posited the creation of an Artificial Neural Network type approach in utilizing various signaling proteins to reach consensus and establishing some way to create back propagation of error.
We've decided to restrict lab nights to Monday and Tuesday from 7-10pm, with a floater strategy meeting on Thursday nights so we can stimulate thought with a change of environment. With that in mind we are back tonight"

Optimization of transformation in small liquid volume
We manipulated various conditions in the original transformation protocol, but it was also useful to streamline transformation in small liquid volumes, as that may more closely approximate the transformation apparatus in our final device. Competent B. subtilis are prepped the same way, but transformation took place in aliquots of 100 μL liquid medium. The results were quantified by either plating and counting the number of colonies that grew on selective media, or by taking absorbance measurements against a standard.
Figure 18: Colony growth of transformed B. subtilis at 30°C and 37°C for different xylose concentrations. B. subtilis SCK6 pAX01-comK cells transformed with linearized plasmid DNA and incubated at 30°C and 37°C with different amounts of xylose, followed by growth on selective media. Colony counts were higher for all concentrations of xylose when grown at 37°C. The conditions resulting in highest growth were an incubation temperature of 37°C and a xylose concentration of 2%.
Figure 19: Absorbance readings of small volume B. subtilus in liquid volume for different xylose concentrations. B. subtilis SCK6 pAX01-comK cells in small liquid volume transformed with linearized plasmid DNA and incubated at 37°C with different amounts of xylose, followed by growth and addition of selection marker (antibiotic). All transformation occurred in liquid. The negative control comprised of untransformed cells (killed by antibiotic), while for positive control, antibiotic was not added to untransformed cells. There was a slight increase as xylose concentration increased.

21 July - 27 July
 
BioBricking the genes NisT, NisI, NisP and the combined genes NisF,  NisE and NisG gave problems with illegal restriction sites.
The illegal restrictionsite in NisI could be removed using the reverse primer as listed above. This primer contains a mutation needed to remove the illegal restriction site.
The other parts gave more problems, as these all contained multiple restriction sites. Therefore, it was decided to use Gibson assembly with primers containing mutations to remove the restriction site. By using Gibson assembly, the genes could also be constructed in pSB1C3 in one go. The primersequences can be found at the third table at the bottom of this page.
 
 
 
 
28 July - 3 August
 
The CP promoters in pSB1C3, that were isolated in the week of 14 - 20 July, were tested on their insert size. For this, a PCR was done on the plasmid using the primers VF2 and VR .  The insert size corresponded to the expected size.
 
A touchdown PCR was done on the genes of the nisin operon and the  sfGFP(Bs) gene. In this PCR the annealing temperature dropped from 55 °C to  45 °C, lowering the temperature with 1 °C each cycle. This  unfortunately resulted in a PCR program of just 10 cycles, instead of the intended 30. The remaining steps of the program were finished the next morning. Only the genes NisA, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs) were amplified this way, see figure 1. Therefore, the PCR           was repeated, this time with a complete cycle. No additional genes were amplified this way.
 
 
Figure 1: Amplification of PNisI with RBS, NisA and sfGFP(Bs), with an added prefix and suffix.
 
 
Another attempt was made for amplification of the remaining genes. This time, the most ideal annealing temperature for each gene was used by using a gradient PCR and placing the tubes at the optimal temperature. This still did not amplify the remaining genes. Also, a PCR with a general annealing temperature of 50 °C was done. This also did not amplify the remaining genes.
 
The genes that were amplified in the first PCR (NisA, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs)) were purified using the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit from Thermo Scientific. The purified products were digested with the enzymes"

Research: Formaldehyde in cars
Concentrating On the Safety, Leading Our Design
Before we started our project ""formaldehyde terminator"", we aimed at detecting the existence of formaldehyde in the houses, but as time went by, we realized that high formaldehyde level is a more serious problem in cars. ""Although we can tell whether the level of formaldehyde is high or not, we have almost no methods to eliminate formaldehyde in cars quickly."" So we improved our design by adding Street Cleaner System, so we could not only detect formaldehyde but also remove it continuously.
Introduction
As we know, formaldehyde exists not only in factories and some extreme environment but also in our daily life, but at the same time we often ignore the formaldehyde in some basic area around us, we aim nat finding what we used to ignore, and finally we have done the research of detecting formaldehyde in cars. In this program, we use formaldehyde kits to help both teachers and our classmates to detect formaldehyde level in their cars. 34 cars have been tested and finally almost one third of these cars’ air-formaldehyde condition is excessive. Besides these, we have also done some other analysis about different factors’ influence on formaldehyde level.
You can download the detail information from here .
Analysis
After we have collected series of data, we did a lot of analysis. For the reason that our data are influenced by different factors, we set groups of two-variables analysis (other factors are ignored when analyzing one group). Here are our data:
Table 1.1 The rate of excessive cars and compliance cars
Figure1.1 The rate of excessive cars and compliance cars
The cars which have excessive level of formaldehyde are about one third to all cars tested.
Figure1.2 Time and cars Red line stands for Cordon - It is the content of formaldehyde higher than 0.1mg/m3 that is excessive.
Using years is related to level of formaldehyde in cars closely, through the graph we can find that there exists a clear boundary between the excessive group and the normal group, new cars are of high possibility to have excessive level of formaldehyde while old cars may remain normal. (For the reason that quantity of our data is limited and unknown factors may also influence the research, we can only get the rough conclusion)

Characterization of the ""portable"" attTn7
For preliminary characterization of the ""portable"" attTn7, we attempted to demonstrate transposition into the plasmid-borne target. The miniTn7BB-Gm transposon was transferred into E. coli DH5α bearing pSB1C3-attTn7 by tetraparental mating using the helper plasmid pTNS2 to provide the Tn7 transposition functions. Transconjugants bearing transposon insertions were selected on LB plates supplemented with gentamycin and chloramphenicol. To identify clones bearing the transposon insertion at the plasmid-borne target,  transconjugant colonies were pooled, plasmid DNA was extracted from the pool and used to transform E. coli. Transformants were selected on LB plates containing chloramphenicol and scored for gentamycin resistance (Figure 8). 97 out of 100 colonies had become simultaneously resistant to both antibiotics, strongly suggesting that the miniTn7BB-Gm was inserted in the chloramphenicol resistance plasmid, and transferred along with its target. Restriction analysis confirmed that indeed this was the case, and that the transposon was inserted within the attTn7 target site at the pSB1C3-attTn7 plasmid (Figure 9).
Figure 8. Patches of E. coli transformed with plasmid DNA from pooled colonies obtained after insertion of pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Gm into the genome of E.coli DH5α bearing pSC1C3-attTn7. Open squares indicate patches showing sensitivity to gentamycin , that is, not bearing the miniTn7 transposon insertion.
Figure 9. Agarose gel of restriction analysis products of eight different samples of pSB1C3-attTn7 with miniTn7BB-Gm module inserted within it. Whether the insertion occurs site-specifically in the insertion site of the portable attTn7 is checked by the presence of 2497bp and 1485bp DNA fragments. These restriction products can be easily find in the first six digestion products. The next two looks to be right too, but impurities in their minipreps may make the digestions difficult to understand. We can also see a partial digestion in the second lane.

Northeastern_Boston,2015,Team:Northeastern Boston#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," 7          doses were available throughout the Ebola Outbreak despite infection          rates in the thousands. Ultimately, it represents an absence of rapid antibody production capabilities.
A proposed solution was the tobacco plant. A relatively          well-understood and engineered organism, it was the method for making          ZMapp. Producers agrobacterium containing the          DNA for the therapeutic antibody into the plant leaves by vacuum infiltration. The plants grow and the antibody is          purified from the plant cell lysate. In theory, this is a quick and          inexpensive method for rapidly producing lots of antibody, dependent upon          arable land rather than high-sterility CHO vats. [ 2 ] In practice, it is          not.
Some Solutions
It might one day be possible to make drugs entirely without cells.          Protein-producing gels or other systems could produce drugs economically          in vitro avoiding the inherent biological complexity and metabolic needs          of living organisms. [ 3, 4 ]
It might, alternatively, be possible to inject the mRNA of a desired          antibody directly, thereby offloading the antibody production to the          patient rather than delivering a bolus of externally produced antibody.          Moderna, for example, has developed synthetic mRNA that codes for          polypeptides while avoiding immune-surveillance (and therefore          elimination). It’s currently unclear how this mRNA will be targeted to          delivery into B cells, and for how long the B cells will continue to          produce antibodies. This approach, offloading manufacturing of antibodies          to the patient, has been extensively researched in the context of AIDS.          [ 5 , 6 , 7 ]
In might be possible to design synthetic bacteria (like Synlogic) for          the gut that produce Nanobodies (small enough to be produced in bacteria          and lacking complex di-sulfide bonds). These pathogen targeting          nanobodies might prove capable of reaching the circulatory system after          being turned on by an exogenous transcription factor, however, these          nanobodies might still face the complication of improper glycosylation          and immune clearance. [ 8 ]
Despite the volume of researchers working on futuristic solutions,          recombinant antibodies are known to work. They are less theoretical and          more a problem of logistics. And logistically, antibodies from Chinese          hamster ovary cells or tobacco plants never materialized during the 2014          Ebola Outbreak. So the question becomes: can microalgae produce properly          folded antibodies at a high enough concentration and at a cheap enough          cost to warrant their use as a widescale antibody production platform? Given the need and potential benefits, we"

Design Level
You should choose what level you focus on. Generally, there are four levels: parts level, device level, system level and abstract level respectively. The former three levels should be designated before design for a certain database should be selected to link. They are aimed at real application by using practical materials. The last level is rather general and mathematical. It doesn’t link to certain database while providing topology information only.
Parts Level:
Since, the function of parts can only display when they are in device with other kinds of parts. Thus, this level is to serve the device level that details about parts could be retrieved while designing a device. Details about kinetic laws and kinetic parameters these parts play in biochemical reactions are needed.
Device Level:
Devices are composed by basic parts and fabricated in a special manner. The function may vary be inserting different parts of same kind like promoter to the same place in device. This way is actually means to change the kinetic parameters in order to change the response of the device. Both static and dynamic transfer functions are needed to describe each device in order to be inserted or replaced in the software for simulation and design purpose.
System Level:
Systems are usually composed by devices while details of parts are not emphasized. The system level is an extension of device level, but focusing on much complicated ones even the entire cell, organism and ecosystem.
Abstract (mathematical) Level:
Topology is crucial for a network even if the kinetic laws are not that clear. Here, we do not care what concrete parts we use but rather mathematical and graphic form. It is universally significant and instructive for design process.
Design Type (Sub Level)
After you choose what design level you focus, there are four types of sublevels to select. We define these sublevels because the users are unnecessary to run the every design step that we give prior for an entire design process but some certain functions. Given these information, users could quickly start their design without wasting additional running time. Though our software runs relevant functions according to your input, it will be helpful and clear for the users to know what sublevels fit their need to complete their design efficiently.

Oxford
The team at Oxford has been working on a method of cell-free detection of Chargas disease. Specifically, they are testing for the presence of cruzipain, which is known to cleave and release the peptide hirudin from the transmembrane OmpA precursor. To measure cruzipain activity, they are using the Spytag/Spycatcher system. First, they must attach Spytag, a short peptide, onto the OmpA protein. We have assisted the team by running a CG simulation of OmpA bilayer insertion and simulation with SpyTag/SpyCatcher. This simulation, performed on the supercomputer cluster at McMaster University, provided insight into protein conformations and system stability after the OmpA+Spytag fusion protein was inserted into a model membrane.
Collaboration on this project has involved sharing of information on the proteins involved. Below are the 3D images of the two proteins involved in the simulation, OmpA and SpyTag. Furthermore, communication has been required to create the most realistic bond between OmpA and Spytag on a computer. After discussing this issue, we reached the consensus that the optimal route would be to create a harmonic artificial potential between the two proteins.
Below, we have attached the molecular dynamics simulations we ran of their chimeric protein. We showed which residues may be potentially unstable in both the Spytag and SpyCatcher proteins. The root-mean squared fluctuations (RMSF) is proportional to protein stability, and is unique to SHARCNET supercomputer clusters in Ontario, Canada. With this, we were able to offer atomistic resolution.
Oxford provided us with the code for reaction kinetics, which we implemented heavily in our modelling section."

Introduction
CMV (Cytomegalovirus) promoter is a constitutive mammalian promoter.
For this promoter's characterization we assembled it with GFP reporter ( BBa_K648013 ) and hGH polyA terminator ( BBa_K404108 ). The Pcmv-GFP was then transfected into HEK293FT cells and in vivo green fluorescence signal was observed under confocal microscope. The positive control was pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) that contains CMV promoter and EGFP reporter. The negative control was the same as the experimental construct, but minus the promoter. The detailed protocols employed for our characterization work can be accessed via the link.
Characterization Procedure
1. Build:
-       CMV promoter characterization construct: CMV promoter – Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) – hGH polyadenylation sequence (hGH pA) - pSB1C3 (BBa_K1119006 – BBa_K648013 – BBa_K404108 – pSB1C3)
-       Negative control construct: GFP – hGH pA - pSB1C3 (BBa_K648013 – BBa_K404108 – pSB1C3)
2.    Culture HEK293FT cell line (see below)
3.    Transfect CMV promoter characterization (CMV – GFP – hGH pA – pSB1C3), negative control (GFP – hGH pA – pSB1C3) and positive control (pEGFP-N1) plasmids in HEK293FT cell line. *We cloned CMV promoter out from pEGFP-N1 (Addgene) that contains CMV promoter and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). We used this plasmid as our positive control"
IIT_Delhi,2015,Team:IIT Delhi#project_-_-_TEXT.html,"changer at the outlet of the tank. It’s a cross flow type heat exchanger, with which we did some slight innovations to increase the efficiency of the condensation process. Cold water flows through the exchanger pipes and steam flows on the outside. We here filled the outside of the pipe portion of the exchanger with metal ball bearings. These ball bearings, through conduction, cool down to acquire the temperature(similar to) of the flow pipes and hence increase the surface area available to the vapor for condensation, speeding up the condensation process. The remaining exhaust, congaing NOx, Sox and some amount of water vapor now passes over the silica gel tank at the outlet of this desooter tank.
Studies showed that NOx and SOx, in the presence of water vapor, react over Alumina-silica gel(SiO2.Al203) to lead to an oxidation reduction reaction forming NO and H2SO4. This was a remarkable discovery as the NRFA bacteria we are working with, effectively reduce NO into harmless forms, and hence we needed NO as the output from this tank. Thus, the NO rich gas from this tank is passed into the next tank containing NRFA bacteria for further action. H2SO4 produced is extracted and used for industrial purposes.
Click here to view the 3D model
Prototype Results:
Tests were carried out on the prototype, taking in exhaust from a diesel burner and passing it through the system. The desooter tank worked even better than expected, collecting soot out from the exhaust (which was weighed after each run). NOx sensors placed at the edge of the silica gel tube confirmed that the gel was catalysing the reaction that we intended to do, converting NO2 to NO.
FUTURE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT AND TARGETS TO BE ACHIEVED:
To optimize the design of the desooter tank and the entire contraption, to increase efficiency and reduce the cost of the process.   To ultimately make the process so cheap and efficient that it can replace SCR in big engines, industries and power plants.  Use the soot (obtained as dissolved in water) to make ink to ultimately make the process self-sustainable and bring down the processing cost to negligible amounts by accounting for commercial selling of this ink obtained. This will also further reduce environmental repercussions as soot now is converted into a useful product, rather than being dumped into the environment  To work on developing and optimizing the desooter tank design to reduce power consumption in the blower, as well as the heat exchanger.
Hence, through optimization, we aim to finally"

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment"

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Project#2D Biosensor_-_-_TEXT.html," detect living cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with our measurement device WatsOn. Therefore sensor chips based on K131026 were prepared and the right chip was induced with 0.2 µL of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture while the left chip was not induced (Detection of 3-oxo-C12 HSL with K131026, displayed below). On the induced chip, a clear fluorescence signal was visible in response to P. aeruginosa. The fluorescence signal emerged outward from the induction point and showed a significant difference to the non-induced chip. The results clearly demonstrate the ability of our sensor chip technology and our measurement device WatsOn to detect P. aeruginosa!
Outlook
We are committed to improve our sensor chip platform. The current technique of using a simple agarose chip is not sufficient to collect all microorganisms from the sampled surface. Therefore, the aim is to improve the sampling chip by using a different, more adhesive material.
Furthermore, diffusion in the sensor chips will be reduced to limit the spread of the fluorescence signal. Currently, the fluorescence spot grows beyond the point of induction and makes it difficult to differentitate between multiple points of induction. By introducing diffusion barriers into our chips, the growth of the fluorescence spots might be reduced, thus enabling the detection of multiple sources of fluorescence lying close together.
Additionally, the application of our sensor chips in combination with our WatsOn device is currently being evaluated for the detection of signals other than fluorescence. Detecting bio- and chemiluminescence has been identified and will be investigated as an area of potential future application.

gene knockout
In order to amplify the intensity of the signal, we need to knock out some genes in yeast, including ste2, sst2 and far1 which exist in the endogenous mating pheromone response pathways in yeast and respond to the mating signal and transduction of downstream signal.
Gene
Function
ste2
The GPCR of yeast pheromone receptor is Ste2 protein, which is an important factor during yeasts mating.
sst2
Sst2 protein is a phosphatase catalyzing GTP and producing GDP which will inhibit the release of Gγ、β subunits. Gene knockout of sst2 can improve the pheromone GPSTP.
far1
α factor is an active factor of the yeast pheromone GPSTP, which can cause the yeast cell cycle arresting in the G1 phase through Far1 protein, resulting in that cell growth is inhibited.
Gene knockout can be achieved by homologous recombination.
homologous recombination
By analyzing ste2, sst2 and far1 gene sequences from the NCBI, we ensured the appropriate homologous area in the upstream and the downstream of these genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. In order to knock out these genes effectively, we selected different lengths of homologous arms, 50bp, 200bp and 500bp. According to our experiment result, we found that 200bp and 500bp homologous arms worked more efficiently.
Fig.1 Homologous combination knock-out strategy
We designed 3 pairs of primers whose templates were the upstream homologous arm, the marker and the downstream homologous arm respectively. The markers were Histone synthesis gene, Uracil synthesis gene and Tryptophan synthesis gene, abbreviated as his, ura and trp. Initially, we got 3 fragments by PCR and they had their own overlapping areas with corresponding to each homologous arms.
Secondly, the recombination fragment obtained from OE-PCR was transformed to the CEN.PK2-1C which has been already"

Peter Behnisch is Chief Commercial Officer of the Dutch company BioDetection Systems b.v. (BDS). This company is specialized in bio-based screening technologies for safety, quality and bioactivity assessment.
Insights
Chemical analysis most often used, but very costly and often irrelevant results.
Water authorities are already familiar with bioassays. SIMONI and Daphnia-dependent assays are currently used methods. Since these techniques mostly rely on organism behaviour, they are not always reliable and measurements can be disturbed due to polluted water.
There are no national or European policies yet, although water authorities in the Netherlands are stimulated to approaching the problem.
There is a purification obligation in horticulture.
Ensuring the low-costs and high speed of DeTaXion, will make it a very beneficial and applicable system.
Applied
Confirmation that DeTaXion could ease chemical analysis and could be used as a precheck for chemical analysis.
Potential applications of DeTaXion would involve local measurements, such as:
Method for the detection of the health of the neighborhood
A quality check of water purification at the source.
Efficiency of pharmaceutical uptake of patients
Method to confirm predictions and national measurements

Maarten Nederlof is involved in water purification by sewage plants and Marlies Kampschreur is responsible for the innovation at Aa and Maas. Water Authority Aa and Maas is responsible for water quality and water purification for their district.
Insights
Identifying the impact and setting a concentration limit of compounds or mixtures of compounds is rather difficult.
Pilots on techniques with a higher yield of water purification are being done. It is important that these techniques are as cheap as possible.
Germany and Switzerland already have such high yield techniques. In the Netherlands a pilot is held.
There is an increase in bioassays being developed and used. Water authorities are testing whether these can be meaningful to determining the effect of compound mixtures in water on organisms, rather than the existing compounds. SIMONI counts as golden standard. a follow up on the compounds with an effect is still needed.
The disposal of waste from illegal drug laboratories led to shutting down sewage treatment companies.
Applied
Considering the designing of an end product that can track down illegal drug laboratories.

A Survey on the Cognition of Synthetic Biology
As an emerging discipline, synthetic biology needs to be in the public eye. We have designed a survey of public awareness in synthetic biology, analyzing the status quo of the public's understanding of synthetic biology.
Survey Report
1. Background
The synthetic biology occurs in China a decade ago. In China, it doesn't have a high popularity. Most people are not very familiar with it, except for some professionals. However, for biological, genetic or other technologies, most people have learn about it in the middle school and high school .Most Chinese people are more familiar with the biological and genetic technology. China has less religious people. The Chinese traditional religion such as Taoism and Buddhism does not object to the creation and transformation of life. So the country is not very opposed to the genetic transformation of life. In China, we have a lot of genetically modified food. In recent years, the media has been constantly reported on the dangers of genetically modified food. As a result, most of the Chinese people began to hold a skeptical attitude to genetically modified food. But there is no obvious opposition to the technology in China.
2. Brief Introduction of the Survey
The main purpose of this survey is to know about the public's understanding and agreement of synthetic biology. The questionnaires has 19 questions in total. We put the questionnaire on a website to collect the answers. (http://www.sojump.com/jq/5554293.aspx).There are 137 questionnaires that were collected. The main object that we investigate are the friend and classmates of our group members. The time of the investigation was from 2015/8/12 to 2015/8/16. The analysis is conducted by Excel and SPSS.

From the table, we can see that the object of our investigation is mostly undergraduates. Because the most people that we investigated are the friends or classmates of our group members, the undergraduate students that we investigate should be mostly belong to our school (Nanjing Agricultural University). Our school is an agricultural university and biology is one of the strengths of our school. So they should know more about the biological and frontier science.

I. Collaborations
Collaborating with other teams has made the whole iGEM experience more intriguing. Team UCAS and team SDSZ_China have enlightened us experimenting and attending the Giant Jamboree,while team CIEI-BJ gives us an opportunity of having a better experimenting environment.<.p>
II. Contacting with iGEM Head Quarter (iGEM HQ)
Contacting with iGEM HQ has solved our problem of kit distribution and changing members. Every email sent by the iGEM HQ has given us hints to what should we do. Without their helps, we will miss uncountable deadlines and innumerable connections with the iGEM society, which are so important for new teams such as us.
III. Families and friends
Helps from relatives and friends play another important role in our project.
Professor Yeguang Chen and his post-graduated student Xuanhao Xu (Zhongxiu Hu’s tutors during her 2015 Science Talent Project) have given valuable advices due to the experiment results as well as inspiring the team with fantastic ideas for free.
The post-graduated student Tianyue An at the Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has also given generous helps with improved protocols.
Haohuan Wang (a relative of Yuanyi Xu) who is specialized in computer science had given valuable suggestions and directions of javascripts designs.
IV. Financial support
In order to keep our research project going on, Ms. Natalie Jonk from Walacea (a crowdfunding website) has helped us to achieve the funding goal and given us useful information of how to make people attention to your work. (See more information on the page of Human Pratice)
The application Qing Song Chou (A Chinese crowd funding platform) also helped us to get financial supports not only from parents and friends, but also supports from warm-hearted strangers.

A Survey about Synthetic Biology
As we are explaining and showing what synthetic biology is to the public, we also want to know how much the public knows about synthetic biology and what are their opinions and comments of synthetic biology issues. Thus, we made a questionnaire especially focusing on what people think of synthetic biology. Here are the English and Chinese versions of our questionnaire:
File:IGEM questionnaire By ZJU-China-EN.pdf
File:IGEM questionnaire By ZJU-China-ZH-CN.pdf
We handed out the questionnaires on the first half-day of the Science Fair, and totally 69 valid questionnaire were received. Among these respondents, 38 were female, and 31 were male. 58 out of 69 attendants had bachelor degrees (or undergraduate students) or above. Excluding students, they came from different industries, such as finance, IT, government, and chemical engineering.
Results are made into charts below. The first three questions focus on the projects that we delivered at our booth, so valuable results start from the fourth question.
Some interesting things can be observed in the results. We re-defined the choices of question 4 into three categories. Choice #1 is in the “Yes” category, which shows that the respondents have accurate and systematic views on synthetic biology. Choices #2, #3, and #4 are in the “Partly” category, which shows that the respondents have rather limited knowledge about synthetic biology. Choice #5 is in the “None” category, which shows that the respondents know nothing at all.

Since the experiment did not give any clear results we did the experiment again with new lysates, one with colicin Fy and one negative control. At first it seemed as if the colicin Fy killed most of them but at a closer look we saw two types of colonies on some of the plates, probably contamination. When plating out the lysates that should be sterile, some bacteria still grew, but they grew much more in the controls. If the contaminated plates are ignored the colicin Fy seems specific, but more experiments need to be done to be sure. Due to lack of time this was not possible.

Figure 7: Controls of the lysate to see if they were contaminated or not, to the left is the control lysate while the bacteriocin is to the right.
As seen in fig. 7 the control lysate is much more contaminated than the bacteriocin, this explains why the control plates in all cases have more bacteria on the plates plated with 300 µl of lysate added compared with all the others. Different types of colonies can also be seen on most of them.
In conclusion there are some indications that colicin Fy is specific but more tests need to be done.

USTC-Software,2017,Team:USTC-Software#implementation_-_-_TEXT.html," The initial data is actually a snapshot of iGEM, containing most information of the bricks. However certain fields, such as group name or parameters, are missing in it, so we complement it by crawling iGEM's web pages. Such behaviour is ""lazy"", which means it will not be invoked before deploying, but before a specific brick's data is accessed for the first time. Fetched data will be cached in the database, and be updated per 10 days to keep updated.
About Data Organizing
The initial data will be imported into a separate database (by default it is named igem). Biohub will link to it by creating virtual tables using MySQL's database view technology. Using database views may lower the speed of querying, but it provides more flexibility for data upgrading. If newer initial is available, we can upgrade the database simply by reloading igem database, rather than dropping and recreating the tables in production environment. Also it can prevent data redundancy. If multiple instances with different database configuration are deployed on the same machine, only one copy of initial data needs to exist in the database, saving the space of disks.
About Bricks Ranking
Before ranking, we have to filter the initial data, since there exists many apparently useless bricks on iGEM. Such process will occur before deploying. We simply drop those bricks without DNA sequence, and dumped the filtered data into a new table (by default it is named igem.parts_filtered). At the same time we will pre-process some fields, such as extracting subparts information from edit cache, and pre-calculating some components of the ranking weight. You may refer to updateparts.py to see this process.
Then we will rank the bricks for the first time, using multiple statistical methods. You may refer to refreshweight.py to see such process. At this stage, the bricks are completely ranked by initial data, without any factors from Forum.
After the server starts up, we will recalculate the ranking weights every 30 minutes. The reason for not evaluating them in real time is that the task may update the whole table and become time-consuming. From now on, Biohub will gradually correct the deviation in bricks ranking.
About Optimizing ABACUS
ABACUS is a plugin inherited from last year's project. It consumes great amount of memory during executing, and causes the prossibility to break down the main server.

    Collaboration on the Three Plus Net
     3+net is a new concept of the environment track, which was jointly proposed by East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST) and many universities in China. The purpose is to provide guidance and reference for the igem team and bioremediation field. 3+net separately elaborated from the three perspectives of application, biosecurity and society, and explored the relationship among the three. In order to provide more feasible suggestions for others, it is better to turn laboratory results into technologies with social value.      Base on the collaboration with the team ECUST，we focus on Biosafety plus. In scientific methods, we cite some simple methods, such as designing suicide switches, knocking out resistance genes, genome integration, visualization of genetically engineered bacteria, hardware design, network monitoring, and so on. We summarize the current common suicide switches for different types of environmental conditions. Details can be found on our Safty page.

The plotter would receive instruction from a software that can translate computer images into instructions. E. coli would respond to the laser light. The red laser light would trigger the expression of beta-agarase enzyme which can degrade the agar polymer that cell rest on. This would produce “bacterial lithography”, where the E. coli exposed to red laser light would dissolved that agar and form a picture.
For Calgary 2007’s project to work, they needed a precise control of the gene of interest. To have such control, they decided to use the riboregulator system to prevent accidental expression of gene of interest.

Schematic representation of Caltech 2007’s project design regulation
Abstract: Caltech 2007 wanted to engineer viruses to selectively kill or modify specific subpopulation of target cells, based on their RNA or protein expression profiles. To prove the concept, they decided to use bacteriophage λ and E. coli. Caltech 2007 tried to engineer a bacteriophage λ to target and lyse specific subpopulations of E. coli. In their design, the developmental genes of the virus essential for virus infection and survival are regulated by cis-repressing RNA (lock). Only the target E.coli contain the trans-activating RNA (key) to activate the expression of the virus developmental genes. Once the genes are activated, the target cells will go through the lysis process. Meanwhile, non-target cells won’t be affected by the virus because the non-target cells lack the key to activate the expression of the virus developmental genes.

The major differences between the results and our theoretical values was the later maximum GFP concentration and the difference between the measured maximum and the theoretical maximum for 9×10-9moles/dm-3 of miRNA. In order to delay the peak in GFP concentration the rate of RNA decay had to be decreased. We also introduced a term for GFP degradation, to account for the peak in fluorescence. We then tried to fit the data by changing the parameters with these ideas in mind. The new values for these parameters were:

○ Introduction
Normally, bacteria cannot survive in extremely acidic and alkaline environment. So before producing acid or alkali, the bacteria should be able to tolerate acidic or alkaline environment. Two devices are applied to achieve it.
The first is alkali-resistance device, consisting of Nha protein family.
Nha is a family containing a number of bacterial sodium-proton anti-porters. These are integral membrane proteins that catalyze the exchange of proton for sodium in a manner highly dependent on the pH. To resist different pH, we select two genes, NhaA and NhaB, from this family.
NhaA is the archetypal Na+/H+ antiporter and the only member of the family that is required by E.coli for survival under alkaline stress[1,2]. It is a membrane protein consisting of 388 residues[3]. NhaA excretes Na+ from the cytoplasm using the energy from the cotransport of protons down their electrochemical gradient into the cell, with a characteristic electrogenic stoichiometry of two protons to one Na+ (Fig.1)[4,5]. Like many other Na+/H+ antiporters, NhaA  is regulated by pH. It is essentially inactive below pH 7.0, and the Na+ efflux rate increases by three orders of magnitude between pH 6.5 and 8.5[6].
Fig.1 The mechanism of NhaA
Fig.2 The mechanism of NhaB
The NhaB gene encodes Na+/H+ antiporter catalyzing the exchange of 3 H+ per 2 Na+(Fig.2)[7]. NhaB has a high affinity for sodium. In the absence of NhaA, NhaB confers a certain tolerance to Na+ which decreases with increasing pH. Essential for regulation of intracellular pH under alkaline conditions, NhaB is crucial when the level of NhaA activity is limiting, when NhaA is not sufficiently induced, and/or when"

Algorithm Overview
TTEC is the first published software to predict terminator efficiency. It takes DNA sequences as input and returns the terminator efficiency value.
To calculate the efficiency of terminator efficiency, there are three steps.
1. Use RNA folding algorithm to predict the secondary structure of terminator and and recognize A tail, stemloop and T tail.
2. From the secondary structure, we calculate the free energy of stem loop, and generate a score by considering stem loop free energy and T tail
3. From the score, we predict the terminator efficiency based on the score-terminator equation.
About Scoring Systems
Three scoring systems mentioned above were all created by researchers to predict rho-independent transcription terminators. If the score of a sequence is good, it is more likely to be a terminator sequence. The score of terminator consists of two parts, corresponding to stemloop and T tail. Here we made a table to show the similarity and difference of these three scoring systems.
From the table we can see that Elena A Lesnik Scoring System is totally energy based. To calculate free energy we need many thermal parameters. Carleton L Kingsford Scoring System is simple and convenient to use because it doesn’t need to use such many thermal parameters. Thus we use it to help us cut the terminator into three parts.
To know more about the scoring systems, please click each secondary menu on the right.
Kingsford Scoring System
In 2007, Carleton L Kingsford et al. described TransTermHP, a new computational software to rapidly and accurately detect Rho-independent transcription terminators.

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Application scenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," herds. From 2005 till 2007, fifteen Q fever abortions were diagnosed. Q fever had, however, spread through the Netherlands more transiently, as antibody screening showed that C. burnetii antibodies were detected on 57% of the 344 farms. [3] .
From 2007 onward, the first human cases of Q fever were reported in the province of Noord-Brabant, taking place after visits to dairy goat farms where spontaneous abortions had occurred. The epidemic became apparent after general practitioners reported on the occurrence of pneumonia within patients not responding to standard antibiotics. The outbreak in 2007 marked the beginning of a course of other outbreaks of Q fever throughout the province of Noord-Brabant (Figure 1). At the moment, still eight of these companies remain infected [4] .
Figure 1: Between 2007 and 2010, the Netherlands was hit with the largest outbreak of Q fever ever recorded with 4,026 human cases notified. Most of these cases were reported in Noord-Brabant, the Dutch province in which our university is located. This image was adapted from RIVM.
We have talked to Dr. Roest , a veterinary microbiologist who is strongly involved in research to Q fever and Anja Garritsen , a scientist working at InnatOss, one of the biggest research institutes in the field of Q fever in the world, to get a better insight into the important aspects around Q fever. Besides that we spoke to Jeanette van der Ven , owner of a goat’s farm near Eindhoven and one of the board members of the ZLTO (association for entrepreneurs in the green sector), to get inspiration and feedback from people who were really involved in this problem. Additionally we spoke to René van den Brom , a researcher working for the national institute that focusses on animal well-being, who did his thesis about Q fever. He told us about the problems he faced in his research and showed us his results.
Current Approach
Transmission
The extreme infectivity of Coxiella burnetii stems from its ability to shift from a Small Cell Variant to a Large Cell Variant. In the former state, C. burnetii is metabolically inactive and extremely resistant within the environment. When the Small Cell Variant enters a cell through phagocytosis, it will shift to its active large cell form which is metabolically active (Figure 2). This metabolically active form will replicate in the Coxiella Containing Vacuole (CCV). Eventually, the metabolically active large variants will undergo sporogenic differentiation to produce"

These results show that expression of CymA and NapC is successful. Interestingly NapC predominates in the soluble fraction and CymA appears in the membrane fraction. This is an unexpected result as both proteins are intermembrane proteins. We hope to inspect this fact closer to determine its significance in our system.

On September 11th, Prof. Lin Zhanglin from Tsinghua University gave the professors and students of College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering an impressive lecture about the research progress and prospect of synthetic biology. Professor Lin Zhanglin is one of the lead scientists of 973 Project. Design and application of synthetic biology parts is part of his research directions. His research papers are mainly published in Nature, PNAS, JBC, Biotechniques, JB and Methods in Molecular Biology.
Figure 1 Prof Fang Baishan Made The Initial Speech
In the lecture, Professor LIN introduced the history of synthetic biology and stated his expectation. Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field of study. Professors from different subjects had a heated debate about the topic. Prof. Huang Rongbin exchanged his opinion on how to define synthesis biology. Then Associate Prof. Wu Lina proposed a discussion on the difference between the synthesis biology and the metabolic engineering. The dialogues between the professors also gave us many beneficial inspirations.
Figure 2 Prof Lin Zhanglin Gave A Lecture
Prof. Lin had a symposium with 2015 Amoy iGEMers after the lecture. First, the representatives of the 2015 Amoy iGEMers gave a presentation on the project this year. We gave a brief introduction of our experiments and human practices. Prof. Lin listened carefully and gave many beneficial suggestions, such as how to make the expression more authentic and professional, how to leave judges an impression on your project and how to improve our project. Everyone learned a lot through the conversation. Then we asked Prof. Lin about the future of the synthesis biology in China. The Chinese scientists have many achievements in synthesis biology till now, but we still have a long way to go. Whatever, we all believed that synthesis biology will improve human life and enhance the human welfare.

The gel showed that the his-tag was present in only 1 of our proteins. The other 3 had lumio present but not at the correct number of kDa (~2.5) this means maybe our his-tag is present just not as part of our chormoprotein. Because we started the large liquid cultures from different colonies it is unclear whether or not our large scale protein extraction will work today.

Here is the gel we ran of the luminous of the 4 chromoprotein-CBD-His-tag proteins. Order from left to right: benchmark ladder, CP, PP, TP, VP. The dark band in the 4th column is TP and at around 2.6 kDA which is where we would expect our chromoproteins to be. This shows that TP was correctly Gibsoned with the his-tag. The other 3 it is unclear if the colony picked was not a good colony and representative of the Gibson product or if they just did not work.

We ran a lumio gel of the 4 cultures that has his-tags that were present yesterday (BB, VV, LO, SO) and saw the correct bands for each of these proteins. This is exciting because it means our his-tag is present in the chromoprotein but we still have yet to see color on the plates or in culture so we will check for color again on Monday

Here is the gel we ran of the 4 lumio tests. From left to right: Benchmark Ladder, LO, SO, BB, VV. The right two bands are around 2.6 kDA and the left two chromoprotein bands are around 2.5 kDA which is where we would expect. This gel adds another form of verification to our chromoprotein + his-tag being correctly Gibsoned.
●
We then performed a large scale protein extraction on CP, PP, TP, VP CBD and His-tag liquid cultures. The elutions showed color in PP, TP, and VP which means the his-tag worked properly because the proteins were bound to the nickel column with the his-tag and then eluted off. CP did not elute or show color in any of the washes or elutions so we may have to re do this protein extraction

These 4 chromoproteins were then placed into TBE buffer over the weekend for dialysis. The three elutions for each protein"

Abstract
In order to mitigate the biosecurity risks associated with the potential dual use of gene synthesis, the U.S. Government published a draft version of a “Screening Framework Guidance for Synthetic Double-Stranded DNA Providers"" in late 2009. This document outlines a minimal DNA sequence screening protocol that gene synthesis companies are encouraged to use prior to fulfilling an order. The protocol relies on the “Best Match” method developed in response to the limitations of other screening protocols previously proposed by trade organizations. The objective of the “Best Match” method is to identify sequences which are uniquely related to Select Agents or Toxins. The GenoTHREAT software is being developed in accordance with the Government guidance and, to our knowledge, is the first implementation of the sequence screening procedure outlined in the guidance. Although software characterization has elucidated both strengths and limitations, GenoTHREAT appears to be a viable tool for sequence screening.
The iGEM competition has developed a tool-box of standardized parts for use by synthetic biologists. Without screening software, dangerous sequences could find their way into this tool-box. If such sequences were used to engineer organisms with novel capabilities, the repercussions could be significant. As part of our project, we have screened the iGEM standard registry of parts. GenoTHREAT did not identify any potentially dangerous sequences currently unknown to iGEM officials. However, this does not preclude the potential addition of dangerous sequences to a synthetic biology registry. The emphasis placed on safety and security by both iGEM and the synthetic biology community only reinforces the clear need for more cost effective and accurate screening methods. The deeper understanding of screening technology provided by our results could therefore play an integral role in both the future of the competition and the field.

NUS_Singapore,2017,Team:NUS Singapore#Model P_-_-_TEXT.html," and antitoxin expressions. In the genetic circuit, the toxin E2, is controlled by a constitutive promoter while the antitoxin IM2 is controlled under the temperature promoter. It is important to balance the expression of these molecules because 1. If there is more toxin than antitoxin, the probiotic will die in all stages; and, 2. If there is an excess of antitoxin expression, it places unnecessary metabolic stress on the probiotic host. To examine this issue, we modelled antitoxin IM2 production across different temperature promoter strengths. Assuming 1:1 binding, we can observe that low temperature promoter strengths do not produce enough antitoxin IM2 to keep the probiotic alive in all stages. On the other extreme, a very high promoter strength produces an excess of antitoxin IM2 and places unnecessary stress on the probiotic. Therefore, using modelling, we conclude that an ideal promoter strength is one which allows for the production of antitoxin IM2 to be slightly greater than that of E2 toxin production (See Figure 8). If the lab realises that the probiotic keeps on dying because of the strong toxin, we can propose increasing the promoter strength of the temperature promoter accordingly.
Automated Circuit
Genetic Circuit
Simulate the circuit for a total duration of 50 hours at timestep = 300s with timing states implemented.
To create the genetic circuit, we first translate the logic table proposed earlier to Verilog code. We then enter the Verilog code in the CAD software, Cello, which will then generate genetic circuits that fit the logic table. The genetic circuit generated by Cello is shown in Figure 10. We the then transfer the genetic circuit generated from cello and transfer it to the dynamic modelling software AdvanceSyn Studio. From AdvanceSyn we can generate the functional model, apply sensitivity analysis, apply combinatorial analysis and implement timing states.
Figure 10 The Automated Circuit generated by Cello CAD.
Figure 11 The Automated Circuit displayed in AdvanceSyn Studio
Functional Model
The functional model generated from Cello and modelled in AdvanceSyn fits the timing diagram most accordingly. The only changes made to generate the functional model required increasing the binding affinity of the temperature promoter. It should be noted that in the Automated Circuit functional model, the repression of antitoxin IM2 is significantly slower compared to the Simple Circuit Functional model. The reason there is a delay in killing is due to propagation delay. In the Automated Circuit, propagation delay occurs because of the complexity of the circuit. With each added part"

Because the PCR didn't work we found the products from the iGEM kit from 2014 and made PCR again.
This time the  PCR worked and the products were gel purified and we then measured the concentration with nanodrop:
lacP promoter (BBa_R0010) = 20,1 ng/µL
GFP coding seq. (BBa_E0840) = 27,9 ng/µL
Saturday 5/7
PCR was preformed on LVA less GFP with tet promoter using primers yellow#8 and yellow#9. The PCR was purified using the gel purification SOP.
A digest was done on PCR products #11 and #12 in an attempt to ligate these. Ligation was done in 30 mins at RT whereupon the ligase was inactivated at 65 °C for 10 mins. Purification of the ligation product was done, diverging from the SOP and resulting in an unusable amount of product.

Sunday 6/7
The lacP promoter (BBa_R0010)and GFP coding seq. (BBa_E0840) have been ligated but the concentration was low and therefore we made PCR on the product.
The PCR product was run on gel. The band was hard to separate from other bands around the same length (1400bp). We cut the right length out and purified it. Nanodrop was measured to 53,3 ng/µL
PCR1 (consisting of template 2:2P, primers yellow#5 and yellow#6) and PCR2 (consisting of template 2:2P and primers yellow#5 and yellow#7) has both been cut with SpeI. PCR3 (consisting of template 2:24D and primers yellow#8 and yellow#9) has been cut with Xbai. PCR1 and PCR3 was attempted ligated (for 30 min) and so was PCR2 and PCR3. These ligations did not show any bands around the expected length (1700 bp) during gel purification. Two new ligations (of the same), with higher concentrations of digested PCR products, are reacting overnight.

Part No.:BBa_K2230017
Type:Composite Part(device)
Cloning :
sRBS-NucA was amplified from Mature Nuclease NucA from Staphylococcus aureus (BBa_K1159105) using a primer with strong RBS sequence (B0034) and assembled with Pcar-RSB-PhlF-T-Pr-sRBS-GFP-sRBS-lysis/pSB1C3
Function :
Suicide genes of lysis and nuclease (NucA) were driven under the PhlF-repressed promoter (Pr). And the expression of the repressor (PhlF) would be induced upon glucose by a glucose responsive promoter (Pcar). That is, the bacteria can be killed by the suicide genes in the absence of (or running out of) glucose.
 
Gene Cloning

Experiment & Result
Functional assay for glucose responsive suicide circuit
The bacteria carrying the indicated vector were cultured in LB media supplemented with 34 μg/ml of chloramphenicol (Cm) at 37°C overnight. The next day, OD600 was measured and adjusted to 2.5 in M9 minimal media with various concentrations of glucose. The bacteria then were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C. 100 μl of the bacterial culture was put into one well of a black-walled, clear-bottom 96-well microplates (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). OD600 was measured using BioTek Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Reader System. Further,  the culture media were taken out and diluted 106 times following by spreading onto LB Cm agar plate at 37°C overnight. The third day, the numbers of colonies were counted and bacterial viability was calculated.
Result
As you can see in Fig 2., the OD value in response to the decreasing concentration of glucose was gradually reduced to 1.89 much less than average 2.71 in control group without suicide gene expression, implying that the suicide proteins killed the cells in the loss of glucose in the environment. Moreover, when the bacteria were grown in M9 media with 0.5mM glucose for 4 hours, the survival rate was decreased to 34"

Approach
Originally, it was intended to implement bacterial nanowires from G. sulfurreducens into E. coli. Through research, it was found that the Bielefeld iGEM team from 2013 had come to the conclusion, that this task was too comprehensive to undertake in the limited time of an iGEM project. However, a different approach was deviced, as postdoc Oona Snoeyenbos-West suggested us to use G. sulfurreducens as the model organism for our MFC.
It was then decided to work on optimisation of the G. sulfurre"

Procedure
The following illustration gives a general overview to our approach of lab work.
lab procedures
Both parts and vectors had to be worked on separately until they are available as digested fragments with XbaI/SpeI overhangs. Then parts could be ligated into the shipping plasmid pSB1C3 to submit them to the Parts Registry. To assemble our parts into the desired constructs ligation in correct order in the pRS plasmids were necessary. The final step is the transformation of all three plasmids into yeast strains.

About Zhejiang University
Located in the historical and picturesque city of Hangzhou, Zhejiang University(ZJU) is a prestigious institution of higher education in China with a long history. Qiushi Academy, the predecessor of Zhejiang University, was founded in 1897 and was one of the earliest modern academies of higher learning established in China. During World War II, Zhejiang University suffered from disasters but insisted on the school spirits “Seeking the Truth”, and been praised as one of the Four most Prominent Universities in the Republic China. In its 115-year history, Zhejiang University has always been committed to cultivating talent with excellence, advancing science and technology, serving for social development, and promoting culture, with the spirit best manifested in the university motto “Seeking the Truth and Pioneering New Trails”.
Today, Zhejiang University is one of the top universities in China with distinctive features and a national as well as international impact. Research at ZJU spans 12 academic disciplines, covering philosophy, economics, law, education, literature, history, art, science, engineering, agriculture, medicine, management and etc. The elective system of ZJU is very flexible，so students can enroll whatever the courses they are interested in. That is why we could build such a team with various majors but have no difficulty in understanding each other.
Zhejiang University Anthem
The vast sea contains all streams, all rivers;
Great learning connects Heaven and Earth.
Metaphysical is Tao; instrumental is Tool.
Rites tell people apart; Music gets them together.
To know their relations would make us ever brighter.
There’s a national university standing by River Qiantang,
Whose eternal philosophy is seeking truth from facts.
Progressive education can produce those able to govern;
Never say you"
NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," a whole day with knowledge. Then you have to consider the characteristics of your target population. In this case, most parents are new to science (they might fail to answer the kids' questions) and kids love to learn new things through cute comics, attractive videos and tangible models. To ensure the knowledge to be taught smoothly, you need to prepare many things. We prepared posters, comics, videos and models. You will see how they worked with us in the next section.
Our Work
Posters & Comic
To make people know what synthetic biology is, we introduced basic conceptions and future applications. We collected materials and wrote articles, and our teachers corrected it for us. We put the articles on the posters and some members stayed beside the poster to explain the articles to the audience. Middle school students and adults were attracted to it and learned a lot from our explanation. (Poster 2 is one of the posters showing the articles)
Now that iGEM is an important part to provide surprising new ideas for synthetic biology, we decided to introduce projects finished by other teams. We learned many previous programs closely and discussed a lot to choose the most representative and attractive ones from home and abroad. Finally we agreed to choose SYSU 2013, TJU 2015, UT Austin 2004 and Utah 2012. The ideas were surprisingly attractive for our audience! All kinds of people, including pupils, middle school students and adults, were curious about the details. (The examples were put on Poster 3)
As for our own project, we thought it might be difficult for kids to understand. So we composed a comic to explain our ideas. Taking their height into account, we put the picture on the lower part of the poster so they can see the detail clearly. (That's what Poster 4 did) Thanks to it, many kids were able to understand our ideas!
Videos & models

To attract the audience, we found some videos to show the knowledge. Our video had a large audience and some of us had to stay beside the projector and answer the questions, helping them to understand the video.
Considering that the abstract concepts are difficult to understand for kids, we brought some tangible models to show ""chassis"", ""parts"", ""devices"", etc. The models also got lots of attention. Some young kids had great fun playing with the models. We pointed out the similarity between the models and 'device', 'parts', 'system' and'"

With regards to SP2, we tried multiple times to perform our sequential restriction digest of the pET-RFP backbone with HindIII-Hf and NotI-Hf, and ran into multiple roadblocks. After various troubleshooting techniques, we were finally successful upon using a DNA isolation protocol in between the two digestion steps. Following this, we excised the pET29B backbone from a low melting-point agarose gel, and ligated with our SP2 part that had been digested with HindIII-HF and NotI. We also managed to create our first batch of PHB using the PHB synthesis biobrick (PhaCAB: Part:BBa_K934001 ) that we transformed into DH5α in Week 11. The PHB was extracted with chloroform and poured into a sheet (Figure 3). These protocols can be found here .
Figure 3:PHB sheet in a small petri dish. The PHB was produced by E.coli DH5ɑ cells that had been transformed with Part:BBa_K934001 (PhaCAB) and lysed with chloroform to extract the plastic.
Week 14 (July 31 - August 4, 2017)
Work on cloning in our SP2 part was continued this week, using the same DNA isolation protocol as before in between the HindIII and NotI phases of our sequential digest of the pET29B vector. Using this technique, we successfully digested, ligated and transformed pET29B-SP2 into DH5α. 11 Colonies grew and these will be screened next week.
Lalit performed an SDS-PAGE in an attempt to qualify phasin production in our cells transformed with Phasin-HlyA Tag. Results were inconclusive because there were too many other bands around the same size as phasin, and the SDS-PAGE will be repeated at a later date.
Jacob transformed DH5α with a PhaCAB biobrick from Imperial College ( Part:BBa_K1149052 ) that he will compare to the part from Tokyo Tech ( Part:BBa_K934001 ) that has been used in previous weeks.
Week 15 (August 8 - August 11, 2017)
All of the pET29B-SP2 colonies from Week 14 were digested and screened; however, none contained our insert, indicating that the ligation/transformation had failed. We re-digested our SP2 gBlock with NotI-HF and HindIII-HF and"

- DpnI- digested Fusion-PCR product (1 µL in PCR-tube for 1h at 37 °C)
- ran 0,7 % agarose gel --> negative result
- gel picture:
- possible reasons: not enough DNA in PCRPCR cleanup was done and not gel extraction, wrong PCR protocol
- PCR with Q5-Q8 was done again (see above for protocol)
- no test gel but preperative gel and gel extraction with Promega protocol
- dCas9-A fragment: 2,8 ng/µL, dCas9-B fragment: 3,3 ng/µL
- not enough DNA again for PCR, tomorrow run PCR with 50 µL reaction tomorrow!
2. pSB4A5:
DpnI-digestion:
- 1 µl added to the PCR mix and incubated 1 h at 37 °C
- SLiCE reaction of pSB4A5 with IAAM-MS2 + IAAH-PP7:
because of to low DNA concentration we needed to increase the concentration by drying the DNA
- for this reaction we take:
2,8 µl backbone (50 ng, 3395 bp, 18 ng/µl)
+ 32,2 µl IAAM-MS2 (1:10 ratio, 2188 bp, 10 ng/µl)
+ 26,4 µl IAAH-PP7 (1:10 ratio, 1790 bp, 10 ng/µl)
all in one eppi + 38,6 µl ddwater to get 100 µl
to the 100 µl we added:
+ 1/10 of original volume (100µl) 3 M Sodium acetate, pH 5,2 --> 10 µl
+ 2 x original volume 100% ethanol (needs to be cooled down for 20 min at -20°C) --> 200 µl

SCAU-China,2016,Team:SCAU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," to astaxanthin biosynthesis in rice endosperm bioreactor. Learning about this, in the future, we might increase the production of astaxanthin by enhancing the expression of CrtI and BHY.However,we noticed a weired pehnomenon that the expression level of BKT showed a negetive correlation with astaxanthin content.This is possibly caused by deletion of BHY.BHY catalyzes the product of Zeaxanthin,which is substrate of BKT.So when substrate is always not enough,there might be an ineffective compensatory increase in expression of BKT,which affect our data.
2. Foreign genes and endogenous genes
To synthesize astaxanthin in rice endosperm bioreactor, we have transduced four foreign genes, thus, we want to know the interplay between foreign genes and endogenous genes, or will their expression influence each other. Especially, we focus on the genes' transcription network. The input signals usually change transcription factor activities on a sub-second timescale. Binding of the active transcription factor to its DNA sites often reaches equilibrium in seconds. Transcription and translation of the target gene takes minutes, and the accumulation of the protein can take minutes to hours.
The production of the protein encoded by gene Y is balanced by two process, protein degradation (its specific destruction by specialized in the cell) and dilution (the reduction in concentration due to the increase of cell volume during growth). The degradation rate is
, and the dilution rate is
, giving a total degradation/dilution rate of
The change in concentration of protein Y is due to the difference between its production and degradation/dilution, as described by a dynamic equation:
At steady state, protein Y reaches a constant concentration
. The steady-state concentration can be found by solving for
. This shows that the steady-state concentration is the ratio of the production and degradation/dilution rates:
If we take away the input signal, so that production of protein Y stops and there will be an exponential decay of Y concentration:
Similarly, when an unstimulated cell with Y=0 is provided with a signal, protein Y begins to accumulate. If an unstimulated gene becomes suddenly stimulated by a strong signal Sx, the dynamic equation approach to steady state:
T1/2 is defined as the time to reach halfway between the initial and final levels in a dynamic process:
T1/2 =log (2)/α
The concentration of Y rises from zero and gradually converges on the steady-state.

Protein Expression and Function Test
The cytoplasmic expression, periplasmic translocation and surface display of PbrR-MBP were verified by SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting. The specific band in western blotting for his-tag fused MBP of about 12 kD confirmed that the MBP was expressed as expected (Fig 12). Considerable amount of MBP expressed in cytosol can also be indicated from the result of SDS-PAGE. Overexpression band in SDS-PAGE result and specific band in the western blotting in size of expected molecular weight also indicated that the fusion proteins were translocated into periplasm and displayed on the surface as expected (Fig 13). Therefore, the bioabsorbent of lead employs same pathways to serve the decontamination goal as mecury bioabsorbent: to express MBP in the cytosol, in the periplasm and on the surface. Their expression was under the regulation of T7 promoter, driven by constitutively expressed T7 polymerase.
Fig 12. The specific band in western blot for his-tag fused MBP of about 12 kD confirmed that the MBP is expressed as expected. Considerable amount of MBP expressed in cytosol can be indicated from the result of SDS-PAGE.
Fig 13. There are overexpression band in SDS-PAGE result and specific band in the western result at the expected molecular weight, which indicate that the fusion proteins are translocated into periplasm as expected.
Besides, we conducted 3D structure modeling to overview them and their localization (Fig 14).
Fig 14. Overview of various localization of MBP engineered from PbrR.
After verifying that the PbrR-MBP could be expressed and translocated as expected, the function test was carried out with ICP-AES, using the method described at MBP Expression Page. The result was similar to that of mercury MBP. The lead binding capacity of MBP with different localization was indicated in Fig 15. The surface displayed MBP appeared to have highest binding capacity while the pyramiding of MBP expression did not function as expected.

Remember, our ProteinGAN has never seen a protein sequence. This is the network’s interpretation of how an DNA helicase should look. Right of the bat, we saw that it successfully learnt that a protein sequence should start with Methionine - and that alone was outstanding, as it learned some rules of nature already!
The networks have also captured that enzymes can have different sequence lengths - as GAN generates all of the outputs of the same length by default, some of the generated examples had a variable number of 0's attached after sequence of amino acids. For example, these two sequences have different lengths:

NCTU_Formosa,2014,Team:NCTU Formosa#project_-_-_TEXT.html," the evolution of pesticides. But the pesticides are not only fatal to the insects but also harmful to the human body. People found this problem after several decades. The toxin of the pesticides will remain in creatures through the food chain and enter the human body eventually.
Fig.1-2-1 Human health and environmental cost from pesticides in the United States is estimated at $9.6 billion.
Damage to Human Body
Pesticides includes herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and rodenticides, which will kill weeds, insects, fungus, rodents and others. In our project, we refer to insecticides as pesticides. The use of toxic pesticides to manage insect problems has become a common practice around the world. However, pesticides cause serious human health hazards, ranging from short-term impacts such as headaches and nausea to chronic impacts like cancer and reproductive harm. There are also many researches revealing that exposure to pesticides will disrupt the endocrine system, the reproductive system and embryonic development.
Damage to the Environment
Pesticides pollute the environment such as threatening biodiversity and weakening the natural systems. Pesticides have led to abnormally high mortality of America's honeybees. The population of bees has dropped by 29 % to 36 % each year since 2006. To our amazement, approximately 1/3 of the food we eat depends on bees for pollination!
Some scientists believe that amphibians and bats have become more susceptible to deadly diseases because their immune systems are weakened by pesticides. Pesticides also contaminate waterways and endangered fish and birds, causing ecological damage.
Biological Control Method
Since most chemical control methods are poisonous to the environment, humans began to look for alternative solutions. One of the   best known example is bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which can efficiently kill insects with its crystal proteins. However, recent researches have shown that more and more insects have been resistant to this kind of protein.
Chemical control methods have caused fatal environmental damage and insects have grown resistant to both the chemicals substances and Bt. It is, however, not too late to improve this situation. We can create an agricultural revolution with our new method!
Fig.1-2-2  Comparison of both solutions.
Pheromone trap is currently the most novel method to resolve insect damage problems. What's more, pheromone is a pollution-free substance that is produced by the insects, meaning that insects cannot resist it.  That's why we take biological synthesis of pheromone in E.coli to solve the problem.
