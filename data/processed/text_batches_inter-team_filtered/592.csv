Friday, 10/14
Made LB-chlor plates because we were out. Theresa and I (as in AL) will probably need them next week.
Used GG assembly BSA1-HF reactions for full S and C and transformed in T7, plated on LB-chlor plates. Forgot to put in SOC before the 1 hr incubation period, did that after 30 min of incubation. Yikes. I kept the transformation tubes after plating in case transformation wasnt successful.
Because our elastin mRNA circularization method has failed multiple times, Charlie designed primers so that we could demonstrate circularization in collagen. We used CN with the ""CN For circularization"" primers (Ta = 59.6) to get the coding sequence for collagen (coiled coil homotrimerization domain and the bacterial collagen domain) and circularize it. We use elastin (e15) with the ""partial backbone"" primers in order to replicate only the elastin backbone of the plasmid in order to have a backbone for Gibson assembly.

Transformation from yesterday didnt work! I replated the transformations for full S and full C again on different plates, and kept the old 10/14 plates in the 37C incubator still.
Used the GG Assembly reaction tubes to run another 2 set of transformations for full S and full C. I used NEB 5 alpha cells. In case the T7 transformations wouldn't work (because of that SOC incubation flaw), I wanted to make sure we would get colonies by tomorrow.
Began cross-linking experiment for collagen

These equations were then simulated using a series of linked functions on MatLab and the results are displayed below:
Summary:
As you can see from the above graph, the native bacterium M. extorquens DM4 will not be able to degrade a large volume of DCM. It will therefore not be a suitable to dispose of chlorinated waste efficiently. There are several reasons for this, including:
The degradation of DCM is a stress response for M. extorquens DM4. Therefore, when metabolising DCM, it is also up-regulating stress response molecules such as repair enzymes, which is an additional strain on cellular metabolism.
M. extorquens DM4 has a doubling rate of 8-9 hours, so it takes 2 weeks to grow up a colony. Additionally, they proved very difficult to grow in the lab, both on standard growth agars and specialised nutrient agars.
M. extorquens DM4 are not yet well-understood bacteria, particularly with respect to their metabolism.
However, using synthetic biology, we can dramatically increase the amount of chlorinated solvents that certain bacteria can degrade. This is because:
We will use E. coli and P. putida in order to break down DCM. The advantage is that these are extremely well-characterised bacteria that are easy to grow in the lab.
We are expressing microcompartments in both E. coli and P. putida, which prevent toxic intermediates of DCM metabolism from damaging the cells. This is necessary because unlike M. extorquens DM4, E. coli and P. putida have not evolved for the degradation of DCM and toxic intermediates released during its metabolism
We will upregulate and express formaldehyde dehydrogenase in P. putida and E. coli, respectively. This will help the cells deal with formaldehyde, which is a genotoxic intermediate produced in the degradation of DCM.
This model proves the power of computer modelling and shows the importance of using synthetic biology to solve global problems. The exact amount of DCM that could be degraded depends largely on input conditions, such as the number of beads. While more beads in the system allow more rapid DCM removal, a very large system can provide challenging to construct and monitor. (What do we mean by beads?)

UT-Tokyo,2014,Team:UT-Tokyo#Counter#Project#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," is obviously weak. Reactions like this are well affected by fluctuations due to the reactants's limited copy numbers. So, we need to take this fluctuations into our modeling which is derived from stochastic methods. We also introduce delay effect.
First we explain about the Gillespie algorithm which is often used in stochastic simulations. In the Gillespie algorithm, we treated not the concentration of molecules but the number of them. Reactions are also viewed as discrete, essentially instantaneous physical events. What we have to determine when using the Gillespie algorithm is (A) when the next reaction is going to occur and (B) which type of the reaction it will be. Looking more closely at the Gillespie algorithm by the next set of reaction formulas:
equation (19):
<img src = ""
"" height=""48px"" class = ""math"" />
Let n1, n2, and n3 denote the respective copy number of the components X1, X2, and X3. Notice that they are all integer. First we have to determine how easily each reactions could happen. It depends on the number of components copied. In stochastic simulations, we often determine the parameter called stochastic rate constant, which is often written as ""c. We assume that each possible combinations of reactant molecules have the same probability c per unit time to react. In other words, c× dt gives the probability that a particular combination of reactant molecules will react in a short time interval [t,t+dt). We call the stochastic rate constant of a reaction j, cj. Considering the all combinations of reactant molecules, the probability that the reaction 0 occur in [t,t+dt) is c× n1× n2. We now define the propensity function as the function of which product with dt gives the probability that a particular reaction will occur in the next infinitesimal time dt, which is often written as ""a. Later on, the propensity function of a reaction j is aj. Following the equation:
equation (20):
<img src = ""
"" height=""15px"" class = ""math"" />
Notice that cj is invariant parameter, but aj changes as the state changes. In the same way, a1 = c1× n3.
First we answer the question (A) when is the next reaction going to occur? Now, to simplify the situation we assume the situation that only the reaction 0 occurs. Set the time as 0, and define P(t) as the probability that the reaction 0 doesn't occur in [0,t). Then from the definition of a,we obtain the equation; P(t+dt)"

iGEM WLC aims to detect E. coli in water while our team’s goal is to detect the EDCs in water. Because we both focus on water quality, we’ve planned to achieve multiple detection integrations that have the ability to detect various pollution, like a Swiss Knife with many functions! However, it would be very struggling for them to build up a detecting equipment and a 3D model because of a lack of an engineering expert in their team. Fortunately, our team has suggested some software resources that may be useful for them, which have given them an orientation to demonstrate their brilliant work. For the 3D modelling, we had gone through the software composition and made our own model. Based on experience, we could also associate them to learn the original model construction method.

Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.

Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," Pellets collected after overnight co-cultures of Arsenic detector ( BBa_K2205022 ) + processor ( BBa_K2205012 ) + sfGFP reporter ( BBa_K2205015 ) in ratio 1:1:13, with different concentrations of Arsenic (0ppb, 10ppb, 50ppb, 100ppb).
The preliminary qualitative assay above shows that there is no significant difference among the samples when inoculated with Arsenic in different concentrations and the controls (no Arsenic). Optimisation of the Arsenic detection into the Sensynova framework is required.
Conclusions and Future Work
The results demonstrate that further characterisation needs to be conducted in order to optimise the Arsenic detector variant in the Sensynova platform. However, due to time constraints, we adapted the IPTG framework modelling results to the preliminary experiments conducted for the framework customised as the Arsenic biosensor. In order for future characterisation of this part, the model should be modified in order to guide in vivo efforts accordingly.

Rationale and Aim
The Sensynova multicellular biosensor platform has been developed to overcome the limitations identified by our team that hamper the success in biosensor development. One of these limits regards the lack of modularity and reusability of the various components. Our platform design, based on the expression of three main modules (Detector, Processor and Output) by three E.coli strains in co-culture, allows the switch of possible variances for each module and the production of multiple customised biosensors. This section of the project is based on testing the modularity of the system by implementing the biosensor"

However, it's obviously not enough to just stay here. We must acquire all the rational values of the parameters mentioned above to possibly make any meaningful prediction with this model, which is almost the trickiest part of most biological models.
Extracting parameters
Extracting parameters from experiment
We did an experiment to explore the growth pattern of E. Coli and C.C. individually. Tracking the OD values of those bacteria enables us to know their relative concentration during growth. Without interference, the growth curves are generally ""S""-shaped except for a few points deviating from the trend, as shown in Fig. 3.
Fig. 3
After removing 3 of those points, we fit the data points with logistic function, as shown in Fig. 4.
$$     y=\frac{a}{1+be^{-kx}}
$$
Fig. 4 Left: Logistic fit of C.C. Right: Logistic fit of E. Coli
The function fits well with the data points, indicating the assumptions are, in a sense, rational. Furthermore, comparing the fitting function with the theoretical function, we got 4 constraint equations which incorporates 6 undetermined parameters.
Apparently, more experiments are needed to settle down each of the 6 parameters, but conceiving a method to experimentally quantify the amount of plasmids in cells goes beyond the best of our knowledge. However, we are still able to move forward by intuitively set $K=1.5$, $k=0.05$ and $d_3=0.02$. By doing this, all the parameters in the model are determined, as shown in Fig. 5.

To this point, the whole model is formally established, can't waiting to make predictions.

After we set the initial condition to be
$n_1=0.03$, $n_2=0.07$;

From Fig. 6, we can safely say that the model's debut is really not bad. It got reasonable results. As time went by, $n_2$ and $n_3$ rise at first, but went down and faded away at the end, cannot competing with the soar of $n_3$ because"

XJTU-China,2018,Team:XJTU-China#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html,"0.1 OD600 E. coli cultures
Step 1: Starting Sample Preparation
Measure the OD600 of the cell cultures and dilute to the linear detection range of the plate reader, e.g. to 0.05 – 0.5 OD600 range.
Dilute the overnight culture to OD600 = 0.1 in 1mL of LB + Cam media. Do this in triplicate for each culture.
Check the OD600 and make sure it is 0.1.
Step 2: Dilution Series Instructions
For each Starting Sample (total for all 12 showed in italics in paraenthesis):
We need 3 LB Agar + Cam plates (36 total).
Prepare three 2.0 mL tubes (36 total) with 1900 ºL of LB + Cam media for Dilutions 1, 2, and 3 (see figure below).
Prepare two 1.5 mL tubes (24 total) with 900 ºL of LB + Cam media for Dilutions 4 and 5 (see figure below)..
Label each tube according to the figure below (Dilution 1, etc.) for each Starting Sample.
Pipet 100 ºL of Starting Culture into Dilution 1. Discard tip. Do NOT pipette up and down. Vortex tube for 5-10 secs.
Repeat Step 5 for each dilution through to Dilution 5 as shown below.
Aseptically spead plate 100 ºL on LB + Cam plates for Dilutions 3, 4, and 5.
Incubate at 37°C overnight and count colonies after 18-20 hours of growth.
Step 3: CFU/mL/OD Calculation Instructions
Based on the assumption that 1 bacterial cell gives rise to 1 colony, colony forming units (CFU) per 1mL of an OD600 = 0.1 culture can be calculated as follows:
Count the colonies on each plate with fewer than 300 colonies.
Multiple the colony count by the Final Dilution Factor on each plate.

Figure 37. Gel shift assay of TALE A+K coil and the intended [A] and non intended [B] target sites. Thirteen of the lanes contain varying concentrations of the intended [A] target site and four of the lanes contain varying concentrations of the non intended [B] target site. No contamination is observed in the negative controls and the controls with only the target sites. The gel was 1.3% agarose and was run at 50 V for 40 minutes.
In addition, we started cloning the EHEC target sequence into a vector that already contains the target sequence for TALE B.
Week 26: October 21 - October 25
Repeated gel shift assay with TALEA+K coil ( BBa_K1189029 ) on a FAM labeled [A] on polyacrylamide gel. This time a 70:1 acrylamide to bisacrylamide ratio was used to make the native gel. Gels of varying percentages were made: in the 3.75% gel, no shift was observed; in the 5.5% gel, no clear distinct shifted band was observed.
After the unsuccessful gel shift assays with native gels, we attempted to run our samples on agarose gel instead. FAM labeled DNA of [A] was run on a 1.3% agarose gel with increasing dilutions (Figure 38). Unfortunately the DNA did not run on the gel, therefore a new method for testing the binding of the TALEs to the DNA was developed.
Figure 38. This gel shows FAM labeled [A] TALE A target site DNA of increasing dilutions. The ratios on the top show the dilution factors of a 50mM DNA solution. The gel was 1.3% agarose and was run at 50 V for an 40 minutes.
We did a colony PCR of our construct of combined EHEC target sequence and [B] TALE B target sequence (Figure 39).

For Tmp1, the possible transmembrane helix is from amino acid 18 to 36. For Sec2, the possible transmembrane helix is from amino acid 12 to 28. Furthermore, the orientation of transmembrane for Tmp1 and Sec2 is predicted to be from bifidobacterium to extracellular environment (Figure 3).

Model
In addition, the hydrophobic domains in Tmp1 and Sec2 were analyzed with the TMHMM. Theoretically, all signal peptides should have highly hydrophobic domains. Therefore, presence of the hydrophobic domain of proteins is another important feature of signal peptides. The results from the analysis show that both Tmp1 and Sec2 have hydrophobic domains (Figure 4).

In summary, Tmp1 and Sec2 have multiple features as signal peptides that should have the ability to deliver apoptin across the cell membrane.

1.2 Prediction of protein structures:
The protein structures of Tmp1-TAT-Linker-apoptin and Sec2-TAT-Linker-apoptin were constructed and simulated by the Phyre2 web portal and Hyperchem 8.0 for Molecular Dynamic Simulation. The Tmp1 and Sec2 domains are well separated from apoptin domain, which indicates that apoptin should not interference the function of Tmp1 and Sec2 as signal peptides.

We assume that a part of human’s tissue can be considered as a miniature ecosystem, and tumor cells, normal somatic cells and bifidobacteria are three different species in such ecosystem. While normal somatic cells of the tissue can be viewed as the original species of the ecosystem, tumor cells can be treated as an invasive species. Based on the Lotka-Volterra Model, we can apply an ecology model to analyze the competition relation between tumor cells and somatic cells, and show the curve of population change with time.

But this was just the DNA-part. What is expected to happens on a protein level? The construct constantly produces Tet-repressor that binds to thet Tet-Operator and repressed the promoter activity of the autotransporter gene. As soon as the inducer anhydrotetracycline (aTc) is added to the culture, it binds to the Tet-repressor that can't bind any more to the Tet-operator and thus the expression of the autotransporter can be regulated. Although the TetR-system is known to be a tight promoter system there is always a certain background expression with most promoters. If the protein expression of the autotransporter is induced using aTc the autotransporter is transcribed and translated. Due to the bacterial signal peptide the protein is secreted into the bacterial periplasm (the space between the two bacterial membranes of gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli). When present in the bacteria periplasm the autotransporter diffused to the outer membrane and inserts into the membrane. After the integration into the outer membrane the protein cargo is transportet through the beta-barrel of the autotransporter and is pre sented on the bacterial surface. We are sure that this BioBrick will be a valuable contribution to the Parts Registry as it allows future teams to display small protein domains on the surface of gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli.

For the testing of our autotransporter constructs we transformed all three autotransporter constructs together with a secreted NanoLuc luciferase, which served as a control, into E. coli JK321 [30] . Transformed cells were grown in LB-medium supplemented with chloramphenicol (pSB1C3-vector) at 30°C and 180 RPM. In the morning a stationary over night culture was used to inoculate 50 mL fresh medium with 1 mL of culture. The cultures were grown to OD550 = 0.5 and then the induction of the protein production was started using aTc: ""non"" = non-induced; ""low"" = 25 ng/mL aTc; ""high"" = 200 ng"

Tec-Monterrey,2010,Team:Tec-Monterrey#Geneticframe_-_-_TEXT.html,"  Figure 7 (Mathee, 1990) shows the amino acid sequence alignment of Mor and C proteins.
Figure 7
In that image we can see the similarity between these two proteins, but we can also notice that the helix-turn-helix motifs are quite different. It is hypothesized that these domains are the ones that recognize and interact with the DNA sequence. According to Kumaraswami (2004) and Jiang (2008) two domains can be observed on each of the proteins a Helix-Turn-Helix (HTH) domain and a dimerization domain, which suggests that the proteins can only activate their promoters when in dimers.
The final bio-bricks were: Mor ( BBa_K427002 ) and C ( BBa_K427001 )
The Promoters
The first family of activators that we used was the Mor-Pm family. Pm promoter is the middle promoter of the Mu bacteriophage, where it initiates the transcription of C protein. The second family had four promoters: Plys, Pi, Pp and Pmom. We chose Pmom for our sensitivity tuners because out of the four promoters it is the most characterized in literature. It is normally activated by the C protein.
The activation of these promoters requires the holoenzyme σ70, which normally binds to the -35 and -10 consensus sequences. These promoters have the -10 but do not have the -35 sequences. Instead, they have another sequence approximately at -51 where the activator protein binds. Once the protein is located there, the holoenzyme σ70 recognizes the promoter and transcription begins.
The final bio-bricks were: Pm ( BBa_K427003 ), Pmom ( BBa_K427004 )
The Sensitivity Tuners
These devices were designed with two purposes in mind: increase the PoPS output of the pBad promoter (any promoter would work) and change its almost linear production into an almost Boolean one. These parts have the following structure: activator protein, transcriptional stop and phage promoter. The sensitivity tuners can be used to achieve both purposes on any construction, they just have to be inserted between the desired promoter and the desired coding sequence.
In our project we used three sensitivity tuners: one made by Cambridge in previous iGEM competitions; this one is built with phiR73 delta activator ( BBa_I746352 ), a bidirectional transcriptional terminator ( BBa_B0014 ) and Po phage promoter ( BBa_I746361 ). The other two were built by us using the Mor and C families."

Such data are redundant for our database since they are not necessary elements needed to construct reaction network. Only the useful data is retained.
Relationship with SBML
SBML(The Systems Biology Markup Language) is a machine-readable language in XML fashion. It's oriented towards describing systems where biological entities are involved in, and modified by, processes that occur over time. As a widely used model exchange standard, SBML is chosen to be the output of our auto-modeling module.
Generally speaking, MoDeL needs not to be conformed to any constraints set by SBML. However, since SBML is a widely used standard, it is better for MoDeL to share common concepts and components with SBML as many as possible. For example, MoDeL still uses rules, function definitions and unit definitions in SBML. By doing so, it will be easier for software tools to change formats between MoDeL and SBML.

Catabolite Repression Phenomenon
There is a unique phenomenon of E.coli activity called “Catabolite Repression”. Catabolite repression is a type of positive control of transcription, since a regulatory protein affects an increase (upregulation) in the rate of transcription of an operon. The process was discovered in E. coli and was originally referred to as the glucose effect because it was found that glucose repressed the synthesis of certain inducible enzymes, even though the inducer of the pathway was present in the environment.
Glucose is known to repress a large number of inducible enzymes in many differents bacteria. Glucose represses the induction of inducible operons by inhibiting the synthesis of cyclic AMP (cAMP), a nucleotide that is required for the initiation of transcription of a large number of inducible enzyme systems.
The role of cyclic a cAMP is complicated. cAMP is required to activate an allosteric protein called CAP (catabolite activator protein) which binds to the promoter CAP site and stimulates the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter for the initiation of transcription. In the presence of glucose, cAMP levels are low, and transcription does not occur. In the absence of glucose, cAMP levels are high, CAP is activated by cAMP, and transcription occurs (in the presence of lactose).

St_Andrews,2010,Team:St Andrews#project#ethics#community_-_-_TEXT.html," point we will be unable to generate a Free Software like community around synthetic biology. The reason for this Stallman suggests is that genetic code is akin to a compiled binary, a program ready for execution on the computer hardware which is optimized for machines to understand and not humans. Stallman asserts that until individuals are able to easily modify and redistribute changes to organisms there is little hope for a Free Software like community. The argument proposed here is quite valid, the Free Software community has its roots in academia where in the 1960s hackers from various US institutions improved and redistributed each others software and this notion of sharing and cooperation served as the basis of a community. If synthetic biology wishes to generate an identically styled community to the Free Software community then there is the required prerequisite of being able to easily modify and redistribute artificial organisms. At present this is a difficult task which requires expensive equipment and supplies. Does this therefore sound the death knell of a potential synthtetic biology community? It certainly dimishes the possibility of any Free Software style community it does not however disallow the existence of alternative styles of open communities.

Human Practices
As we focused our work on the manufacturing of a wound bandage with a potential application on humans, we had to think about a responsible design of our product. For this, we got in contact with various experts from outside of our team.
So we kept in touch with diagnost-x Berlin for questions about which properties our hydrogel should have to make it suitable to use on open wounds. We also learned how we could not just avoid unwanted side effects but also how we could be able to support wound healing with our ChiTUcare. Furthermore, we obtained the help of the leading scientist in the field of chitosan, Prof. Dr. Moerschbacher, for our project. He helped us out multiple times and prevented us to run in a few dead-ends with our approaches. Through those two expert trade-offs, we were able to evaluate risks and problems and change our approach before facing problems.
As a part of Human Practices, we also concentrated on education commitments. We started CloneCademy as an online learning platform for synthetic biology, which gives the iGEM community the opportunity to teach people about their projects. Additionally, we held presentations in schools to provide pupils with information about synthetic biology in general and iGEM in particular. Of course, we promoted CloneCademy there as well.
Webseminar with Berlin diagnost-x
The production of a bandage which is designated for medical use becomes even more challenging, if the producer do not have the medical expertise to provide the necessary information about the properties the bandage should have. As this was the case for us, we were very grateful for the cooperation with diagnost-x Berlin.  Together, we organized a web seminar in which we were able to ask students from the iGEM team Berlin about our bandage’s setup and composition if it is applied on open wounds and discussed potential risks that might come along with certain setups. Within this short time, they managed to provide us with many valuable information which brought us a step further to our bandage.  In addition, they confirmed the safety of the fluorophore we employed in our project even if applied on open wounds . Also, the students from the iGEM team Berlin, amongst which are many medical students, confirmed that the peptide linker, due to its shortness, should not have harmful effects on the skin either. One question we discussed in the seminar was"

More research is required in the chance of survival of the micro-organisms before we would advise this type of sterilization. In the meantime UV-sterilization provides a good solution to sterilize the biolenses. For all experiments we have done with our biolenses outside the ML-1 zones, we have used UV-sterilization.
Experts' Opinions
Summary
It is important for us to understand the context of the industries in which our technologies could potentially operate. For that purpose, we decided to meet and discuss with different experts from our field of research, including physicists, experts in the field of imaging techniques or safety.
Our goal was to better understand the physics behind our project to improve among other things our models. Furthermore, to specify the desires of companies and the public, we have interacted with these stakeholders. Finally, we wanted to know what the opinion of safety experts is about our Risk Assessment Tool.
Our conversations helped us improving our project significantly. For example, physicists have helped us to understand the whispering gallery modes and because uniformity was important for many potential applications with microlenses, we decided to alter the cell shape to spherical.
Pierre-Emmanuel Monet and Emma Verver - Nikon
Date: 19-09-2016
In order to find out more on possible applications of our biological lenses and their market value, we went to Nikon, one of the biggest companies in optics and optical systems. We were welcomed at the European headquarters of Nikon in Amsterdam by Pierre-Emmanuel Monet, European Product Specialist, and Emma Verver, Key Account Manager, where we had a good talk on the possible applications of our microlenses.
Mr. Monet pointed out that one of the main advantages of our biological microlenses over conventional microlenses is their way of production. Since our microlenses are produced under physiological conditions, whereas the conventional microlenses undergo an environmentally unfriendly treatment during their production, they are a lot ‘greener’ than conventional microlenses. Currently, it is extremely important for big companies such as Nikon to invest in and use ecological materials:
“It is currently very important for us to use ecological materials that do not harm the environment, and we invest in this. Biological microlenses fit this ideal and are therefore very relevant”
If our microlenses are able to reach the specifics of conventional lenses, it would definitely be an interesting solution to make the field of optics a little greener. However, we did learn that there are only very small margins in which microlenses can differ from each other."

ImageID assembly orders for each construct have been used to      extract the type information for each subpart with that construct.      This innovative approach helped us to reveal 400 possible brick      combinations present within the 3x384 well plates distributed by      iGEM in Spring 2010
Four different graphs were constructed based on graphical modeling      theory where relations of atomic parts, devices and systems and      the functional combinations that can build new constructs are presented      for the iGEMs parts registry database. Three graphs are composed      of iGEM devices and one graph is based on Biobricks.
Each graph comprises a set of vertices or nodes and a set of      edges. In the set of nodes each node represents a device, while      in the set of edges each edge represents the input-output combination      of the nodes.
We arrange a survey to analyze user needs and response, According      to our survey results, 244 participants are completed our survey      between 10 to 22.10.2010, 57% of the participant had scientific      degrees from B.Sc to Professor and 18% had graduate degrees. 18%      of participants are enrolled in their teams as either Instructors      or Advisors.INSA-Lyon, Lethbridge, WashU are dedicated as collaborators      with more than 60% team participation.

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

ChR1
Channelrhodopsin-1, or ChR1, is a light-gated ion channel. Responding to light of approximately 560 nm (yellow light), ChR1 is a non-specific cation channel, allowing the influx of ions such as calcium into cells. Unfortunately, ChR1 contained two internal PstI cutsites, which needed to be mutated out before it could be put into a biobrick backbone.

In the study, the transaminase for the initial step should exist in clone fss6. Three aminotransferase capable of converting tyrosine into p-HPP have been identified in E. coli (Pittard 1987). We propose that tyrosine is first catabolized by aminotransferases of E. coli host, then, the produced p-HPP is converted to HGA by the introduced HPPD gene products. Lastly, the accumulation and polymerization of HGA results in the formation of melanin."" - Characterization of a Deep-Sea Sediment Metagenomic Clone that Produces Water-Soluble Melaninin Escherichia coli p. 130
Andreas: I find this part quite interesting and will look more into it. Since melanins are very small molecules, I’m not sure about using CPP as a shuttle into the cells, but since you say that melanin is produced by melanocytes, secreted and then enters the keratocytes, our bacterial melanin might be able to enter the keratocytes the same way.

Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the expression of the three caffein genes CaDXMT1, CaMXMT1 and CaXMT1 in selective SC-U 2% galactose expression medium), based on the 200 ml yeast cultures from 21.09., each containing one of the three genes CaXMT1, CaMXMT1 and CaDXMT1 for having enough crude extract for further analysis.
Operational sequence:
3x 1.5 l selective SC-U 2% medium were produced and 167 ml 20% galactose were added each to gain 2% galactose.
The OD600nm of the over night cultures grown in selective SC-U 2% glucose medium was measured:
CaDXMT1: 6
CaMXMT1: 6.5
CaXMT1: 7

Legal and ethical aspects
Our project aims to improve several areas by introducing a biological aspect. Often, using bacteria as a medicine can be very controversial depending on the country. Even if people can ask ethical questions about the use of our communicating bacteria, it is surmountable. Let's take an example of an application that could pose a problem:
In the same way as a probiotic, our communication system would be useful for regulating the human intestinal microbiome and preventing the spread of infectious, pathogenic bacteria.
The idea would be to integrate our system into a bacteria which is already present in the body. However, it will be ""a genetically modified organism"". Thus, GMOs raise ethical issues about  health and the environment.
Indeed, since the seasonal cycle in the human microbiome does not necessarily generate a total suppression of all the enzymes, the new genetically modified bacterium could never completely die and thus remain permanently in the human gut.
Then, from an environmental point of view, there is the question of genetically modified bacterium that humans can reject and that could be harmful to the outside world. The current European and national laws allow to limit the damage thanks to a legal framework. For example, the European law, in the directive number 2001/18 / EC of the 03/12/2001, concerning the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment, that states the principle of precaution.
Also, our ""new bacteria"" created in capsule form will have to comply with marketing authorization laws as well as the principles of therapeutic necessity. Our genetically modified bacterium, is concerned by the drug definition of the French law. That requires to respect the  step for marketing authorizations, according to the article L5111-1 , 1st and 2nd paragraphs,  of the French code of the public health.
In any case, our system can be adapted without worries to a legal and ethical probiotic. It will also be more interesting than other existing probiotics because it will prevent an infection even before being confronted in a sensitive way and in long-term. An indispensable tool for travellers visiting a foreign country.
In general, our project would contribute to the improvement of the quality of life, health capital, and well-being capital. In addition, the PEPTalk tends to adapt to different areas of application, and this, in compliance with ethical and legal laws.

We compiled a searchable Outreach Database that can be used to find all the outreach projects from gold medal teams from the past two years. It is a long-term resource that can be used by teachers who want to find synthetic biology education activities for students. It includes educational material developed by past iGEM teams that can be a valuable resource for teaching in the classroom. Learn more about our outreach database.

Summary and Next Steps
Based on our conversations with science teachers and the science coordinators from our two local school districts, we realized there is a need for general STEM and biology resources, not just synthetic biology. While our main goal is to educate on and start a dialogue about synthetic biology, we attend an institution with extensive STEM resources and with a wide variety of people who are interested in outreach. During the past year, we have been fortunate to collaborate with professors and students from our school who enjoy outreach, as well as people from the School of Education. However, most of the those associated with the College work independently, and currently, the infrastructure does not exist to adequately address the needs of teachers in our area. Hence the need for a platform with a general STEM focus and not just a more narrow focus on synthetic biology Although our PI, Dr. Saha, will continue to advise us in our outreach efforts, we also are working to involve other collaborators and undergraduate students in this organization.
We are currently in the process of establishing a recognized student organization to help conduct STEM outreach with local teachers and school districts. In order to help increase interest in not only synthetic biology, but STEM subjects in general, we want to create a sustainable, organized platform for helping teachers to work with college students, so they can have easier access to people who are knowledgeable about science but also closer in age to the high school students. These college students will be a resource for teachers who want people to visit their classrooms and lead activities. Additionally, having an interdisciplinary group of students who are interested in doing STEM outreach will help ensure that we have a larger reach in the future and can continue to address teachers’ needs continuously throughout the year"

Technique standard and Database Circuit+ Clotho application: Circuit List and TTEC Synthetic biology laboratory management Human practice
Motivation
Synthetic biology is now meeting its golden age. Under the spirit of give, get and share, many standards have been set up and several websites have been put online. It is the ideas of standardized and modulated, which was borrowed from electronic engineering, that allow synthetic biology to prosper. For example, Registry of Standard Biological Parts ( http://parts.igem.org/ ) based on standard parts, together with iGEM, promotes synthetic biology a lot among undergraduate students. However, we find that not every part has high quality, for the standard cannot support some level of DNA in synthetic biology and therefore many complicated parts are marked as “composite part” and there was no standard and database for genetic circuit. We can see from IT industry that, new, proper standards can always strengthen the industry and in every step of development of IT, there is a classical standard with it. To make the language of synthetic biology more precise, to coordinate with the original idea of synthetic biology that we can see the behavior of genes just like the relations in circuit, we proposed two technique standards about logical gene module and genetic circuit. Inspired by the idea of Registry of Standard Biological Parts, we also give a solution to record and share standard genetic circuits online, that is Circuit+.
Actions
So, here’s our actions
Technique standard and Database
We proposed two technique standards this year (RFC 101 and RFC 97) to give accurate definitions of logical gene module and genetic circuits. The standard of genetic circuits is very powerful and works as the theoretical base of the software. The standard of logical gene module deals problem of regulation relations and you can see it in LGD (Logical Genetic Diagram). We designed a database carefully to record the circuits we find in a stand format And many software share the same central database.
Circuit+
We develop Circuit+ as our weapon to promote the idea and standard. So, it works like Registry of Standard Biological Parts. It is website of circuits’ information and behind it is the well-built database. And you can find many ways to browse and find a certain circuit"

Results
Fig.1    Gel electrophoresis on standard restriction digests of BBa_K759001
Restriction digests were separated on a 0.8% agarose gel. Lane 1; NEB 1 kb size standards ladder, Lane 2; uncut plasmid, Lanes 3-6; plasmid cut with either EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI or PstI respectively, Lane 7; plasmid cut with EcoRI+PstI, Lane 8; plasmid cut with XbaI+SpeI.
Fig.2     Fragment sizes resulted from standard restriction digests on BBa_K759001
Assembly of the sequencing data was performed manually using the CLUSTAL OMEGA multiple alignment program. The resulting sequence (query) was then compared against the original sequence for BBa_K759001 (subject) (sequence of 4493 bp, as taken from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts), using BLAST Pairwise sequence alignment viewer:
Based on the sequencining data, a PstI restriction map of the pSB1C3-BBa_K759001 construct was drawn using SnapGene Viewer:
Conclusions
Both restriction digest and sequencing data show that biobrick BBa_K759001 contains 6 additional PstI sites (CTGCA^G) within the coding region of Antigen 43. Data suggests that the theoretical removal of the 6 additional sites from the coding region of Ag43 within BBa_K759001 is not confirmed by sequencing; therefore the construct is not standardized.
Based on the availability of the sequencing data and the results mentioned above, pSB1C3- BBa_K759001 has been chosen as the subject for removal of the PstI sites to ensure that an Ag43 BioBrick is created that meets Assembly Standard 10 requirements (see the RFC10 compatible version of this Biobrick created by 2014 iGEM Aberdeen team: Bba_K1352000)

Introduction
Precise and high-throughput biological part characterization is at the very core of Catalytic Activity Sequencing (CAT-Seq) system. It is the next generation activity measurement system capable of simultaneous recording of large libraries of catalytic biomolecules or regulatory parts. The system output is simple, yet extremely useful - every unique biomolecule sequence receives a parameter, which denotes the activity of that biological part.
CAT-Seq is best explained with an example - we strongly suggest to read the design section first!
Catalytic Biomolecule activity measurement
CAT-Seq provides a way to simultaneously measure the activities of billions of catalytic biomolecules in a single experiment by recording the activity information for each unique biomolecule into its coding DNA sequence. This is achieved by quickly encapsulating single biomolecule templates in separate droplets together with special Substrate Nucleotides. The substrate nucleotides have a substrate attached to them, and they act as a target for the catalytic biomolecule. The catalytic biomolecule can then turn the Substrate Nucleotide into the Product Nucleotide. During the DNA amplification in each droplet, this activity is recorded, and by quantifying the number of product nucleotides we can assess the activity of each individual biomolecule simultaneously.
Regulatory part activity measurement
CAT-Seq can also be effortlessly adjusted to measure the activities and cross-interactions of numerous transcriptional or translational regulatory parts instead. The amount of product nucleotide depends not only on the catalytic biomolecule activity, but also on the amount of the biomolecule.
If we would take a library, wherein all of the constructs have the exact catalytic biomolecule sequence, yet unique regulatory sequences, we would have different amounts of catalytic biomolecule depending on the regulatory sequence in each droplet. Moreover, the amount of product nucle"

We landed at the airport and went straight to the Tech Museum. Romie and Anja were there to greet us!!! There we set up the multitaction and went over how we are going to do user studies Saturday and Sunday. RIght after, Lauren and I went back to the hotel and passed out.
8/8/2015: Day 45
First day of testing!!!!!  I was exhausted after a full day of testing. It was really cool to see how people interacted with the prototype. I found that most people were very interested and excited to play with our exhibit.  It was also cool to see Romie and Anja set up a mobile wetlab, and to also see how kids interacted with the wet lab component as well.
8/9/2015: Day 46
Final day of testing. We decided to move our user study location to a more central part of the museum. This was a good idea because we got a lot more people that fit the age demographic we were concentrating our learning goals on. We also asked post-interaction questions to see how much the kids learned from briefly interacting with the prototype. Later, Romie and Anja let us explore the Tech Museum. It was so much fun wandering around and playing with some of the coolest exhibits! I’m sad that this is my last day in San Jose, but I really enjoyed doing these user studies!!!

6/1/2015: Day 1
Today was the official start of summer research and work in the HCI Lab. We spent the first half of the day in general orientation, then started work in our teams. Rachel, Vivien, and I are the three Wellesley members of the Wellesley - The Tech Museum of Innovation team for iGEM 2015. Our afternoon was split between getting acquainted with the technical environment and getting acquainted with the iGEM contest and synthetic biology. We got the Cornerstone SDK software, and looked at examples of code and documentation to become familiar with its capabilities. We also looked at previous years’ iGEM teams, specifically the Wellesley ones. This years project is a continuation of sort of the 2012 Wellesley iGEM project SynFlo, so we paid particular attention to that. We’re just starting off, but it seems like a good start!

BioBrick Transformation
Last Thursday, the primers VF2 and VR arrived. These primers allow a confirmation of a succesful transformation of most BioBrick parts by means of PCR. The resulting fragment length depends on the specific BioBrick DNA.
Using VF2 and VR, a colony PCR are was conducted with all colonies that were obtained with chemical competent cells so far. Two colonies with the yeast ADH1 promoter (No. 1 and 2, see left photo) and three colonies with a GFP generator (No. 3-5, see left photo) were identified as positive. Thus, all colonies are positive, but the transformation efficiency is too low, since the result was only one or zero colonies per transformation attempt.
Electroporation should give higher efficiencies. An attempt with a new BioBrick ( ADH1 terminator ) resulted in 69 colonies! Ten of them were analysed using PCR. The resulting fragment should have a length of 461 bp, but from the eigth positive colonies fragments between 650-750 bp were obtained (see right photo). This is probably due to a mutation which might result in a different binding location for one of the primers. Another explanation might be that the denoted length is wrong. Since this BioBrick is not important for our project, it will be disregarded.

N= Negative control

The transformation efficiency of the electroportation was significant higher than of the chemical competent cells. Therefore, an own stock of electric competent cells was made.

Add 600 µl of 10% arabinose to the culture to cause the induction of the λ-Red genes. Incubate for 15 minutes at 30°C.
Chill the culture in a water-ice bath. Transfer to a 50 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 4600 x g for 7 minutes in a centrifuge cooled to 4°C.
Add 30 ml of ice-cold water to the pellet. Swirl gently to resuspend the cells. Centrifuge again as described in step 5.
Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of cold ddH2O. Transfer it using a 1000 µl tip to a pre-chilled sterile EP tube. Centrifuge down at 10.000 x g for 4 seconds in a chilled tabletop centrifuge. (Note, due to speed-up time, doing a quickspin up to 10.000 x g and then letting it slow down is usually good enough) Carefully pipette out the supernatant.
Repeat step 7.
Resuspend cells in 200 µl of chilled ddH2O. Keep on ice until ready to transform.
Transformation
Using a 1-mm transformation culture, electroporate 100 ng of pTargetTet plasmid and 400 ng of linear donor DNA in 50 µl of competent cells (Note: when using an ssDNA oligo instead of dsDNA linear donor DNA, transform 100 ng of the plasmid with 100 ng of oligo). Recover the cells at 30°C for 1 hour in SOC medium then plate on LB-Tet-Kan plates. Incubate the plate at 30°C overnight. (Note: it often takes up to 48 hours for colony to show up).
Screen transformant by colony PCR to identify correct clones.
Plasmid curing
To cure the plasmids, resuspend a colony in 2 ml of LB-Kan to which 10 µl of IPTG 0,1 M are added (Final concentration: 0,5 mM) and the culture is grown overnight at 30 °C. In the morning, the colonies are plated on LB plates and incubated at 37°C O/N to cure them of the pCas plasmid.

This puts us in the “new application” category.  It is the hope that this ends up being more effective/faster/cheaper/specific, etc.  We want to sell this project to the judges (both for iGEM and entrepreneurial).  We need to find a current project so we have a specific, concrete example of an awesome application. This is key to market ourselves. We need to show that we have helped solve a problem because PUF was better than any other option available.  1st step in the entrepreneurship project is to look at patents and trademarks for already existing methods of translational repression.  We need to have a specific need and market to satisfy. Specific examples are key! Data is also good.  Do the simple key wetlab parts of this project, and continually research applications during the summer.  Resveratrol/Piceatannol  Korean lab under Prof. Chul-Ho Yun is willing to share mutant strains with us, and the first author of the paper, Donghyun Kim, is a post-doc in the Kemper lab on campus. Cara is in communication with both the lab and the author  ChemSketch is being used to draw derivatives of piceatannol and then calculate the logP value of that compound to find the solubility. Then use the Molecular operating environment software to model docking of these more soluble compounds into the insulin receptor. Then would turn at least one of the mutant strains (BM3) from the Korean lab into a biobrick.  Resources: The school of Chemical sciences is being contacted about using their software, and the Hergenrother, Spies, Nair, and Cobb labs are also being contacted. 1-2 other iGEMmers will work with Cara on this project.  Recommendations: In vitro production of piceatannol is expensive and time consuming (purify enzyme, etc). But if we pursue a fermentation, we can produce large amounts of piceatannol, which is a very good application and great for our entrepreneurship competition. We could even produce our own reseveratrol to feed into the piceatannol fermentation. Potential problem: can we secrete piceatannol?  Discussion  The PUF project is technique based and the piceatannol project is application based. It’s great that we have both of them and they should be pursued in tandem. "

Aug 27
One of each type of petri dish as was set up last week was taken out of the incubator, and the copper pieces in them were weighed.
The liquid media in the petri dishes that did not contain any bacteria was tinted a slight blue, most likely due to cupric ions that had diffused through the solid media into the liquid media solution.  More cells were also grown for our next set of experiments.
Aug 29
A new set of experiments was set up today. The cells that were set to grow two days prior were isolated via the centrifuge, then resuspended in 10 mL of fresh AFM. The components of the solid media were also prepared for
Eighteen petri dishes were labelled. The following hybrid petri dish setups were prepared in triplicate, with two pieces of pre-massed copper submerged in a thin layer of solid media in each dish:
Hybrid dish with 1 mL of OD 1.648 bacteria + 3 mL of liquid AFM (4 mL of liquid media total)
Hybrid dish with 1 mL of OD 1.648 bacteria + 2 mL of liquid AFM (3 mL of liquid media total)
Hybrid dish with 1 mL of OD 1.648 bacteria + 1 mL of liquid AFM (2 mL of liquid media total)
Hybrid dish with 4 mL of liquid AFM only
Hybrid dish with 3 mL of liquid AFM only
Hybrid dish with 2 mL of liquid AFM only
A 'C' was painted on pennies and thrown into a flask containing 100 mL of liquid media and 100 microliters of OD 25.2 bacteria for etching.
The more heavily stained flasks from last week were filled with acid for cleaning and set on the shaker overnight to clean.

The Next vivo Connection
Rapid Cell-free Systems
The guiding vision behind our project is to be able to provide an easy-to-purify cell-free system in order to bring the benefits of synthetic biology to the masses. To achieve this, we have provided methods to easily purify all of the necessary transcriptional and translational components. This includes essential proteins and RNAs, with a strong emphasis on transfer RNAs (tRNAs). In addition, because the Next vivo system lacks genomic DNA it cannot replicate or regenerate energy. It is essentially a simple protein production machine that translates a transcribed messenger RNA (mRNA). Because of these characteristics, Next vivo is highly amenable to genetic recoding.
For a more comprehensive look at our system, check out our design page.
NEXT VIVO DESIGN
Genetic Recoding
The conversion from and RNA message to a protein is mediated by a set of evolutionarily conserved tRNAs that make up what we know as the ""Universeal Genetic Code."" Genetic recoding then, is a process by which the conventionally understood relationships between codon-anticodon and tRNA-amino acid are altered. For example, the amber stop codon (UAG) can be reassigned to instead incorporate a standard or non-standard amino acid into a growing peptide. [1]
Accordingy, it follows that modifying the relationship between codon and amino acid incorporation is equivalent to the creation of a novel genetic code.
Genetic Recoding vs. Codon Reassignment
There is some discussion surrounding the use of the term “Genetic Recoding” and “Codon Reassignment.” Becuase our system falls in between two proposed definitions, we have chosen to refer to the practice as “Genetic Recoding” in the context of our project and will refer to it accordingly.
You can read more about the distinction at the link below:
The Distinction Between Recoding and Codon Reassignment
Disrupting this relationship has numerous benefits including the expanding the available codon space to allow for the incorporation of non-standard amino acids into a system and biocontainment by designing orthogonal genes that are fundamentally incompatible with ordinary organisms. Read more about Biocontainment on our Design Page
BIOCONTAINMENT
Methods for Genetic Recoding
As with all problems in biology, there is more than one way to achieve a goal. In the case of genetic recoding however, the constant involved is the manipulation of the tRNA.
Recoding can be accomplished via:

Rice,2016,Team:Rice#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," the regression model of each promoter, we created a second model to describe the violacein biosynthetic pathway. The pathway (Fig. 2) involves five enzyme-catalyzed reactions and one non-enzymatic reaction (Lee et al, 2013).
Figure 2. Violacein synthetic pathway. The purple arrows highlight the five enzymatic and one non-enzymatic steps of violacein production from two molecules of tryptophan. The five enzymes are indicated by bolding (VioA, VioB, etc.).
The model was developed as three major parts. A pseudocode of this model is provided here.
Define ODE System
Calculate the production and degradation rate of each molecule in the pathway from the concentration of reagents and parameters.
Obtain the rate of change of each molecule based on the production and degradation rates.
Solve the System of Nonlinear Equations at Steady State
Solve the system of nonlinear equations at steady state starting at an initial guess X0.
Use the result as a new initial guess; repeat the numerical method to solve the system of equations again.
Calculate the relative error of each chemical in the new result.
If the maximum error is smaller than 0.0001%, output violacein concentration at steady state as the final result.
Optimize Parameters to Fit Experimental Data
Set the initial guess of the parameters.
Load the data from literature, which include the choice of promoter for each gene and the corresponding violacein yield determined experimentally.
For each promoter selection scenario, pass the promoter types and the temporary parameters to the steady-state model.
Obtain the violacein yield predicted by the steady-state model for each promoter selection scenario.
Compute the residual sum of squares (RSS) of between the predicted violacein yields and the violacein yields given by experiment.
Determine the optimal parameters by minimizing the RSS (least square method).
Using the principles of mass action kinetics, we derived the system of ODE equations in the model. The equations involves 17 parameters (Table 2). Five parameters (kA, kB, kC, kD and kE) are related to the production rates of the five enzymes, which depend only the strength of the promoter type. Another parameter, kd, is the degradation coefficient of all molecules due to the growth of E.coli. The value of this parameter is fixed  and shown in Table1. In addition to these known parameters, the equations include 11 undetermined parameters related to the reaction rates at specific steps in the violacein synthetic pathway. As described in the"
Toronto,2014,Team:Toronto#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," to insert into the spacer insertion site of our CRISPR plasmids.
Summary of the two plasmids:
Target plasmid: constitutively active RFP (red colonies), Chloramphenicol resistance
CRISPR plasmid: Cas9 (controlled by various promoters), crRNA array containing spacer targeting a sequence in RFP, tracrRNA, Ampicillin resistance.
Before starting our assay, it is necessary to transform the target plasmid (RFP) into the wildtype (MG1655) strain of E. coli. This allows us to obtain a strain of cells known to carry the target plasmid.
For target plasmids that do not exhibit a visible phenotype like red fluorescence, the CFU of cells that retained the target plasmid even after successful transformation of the CRISPR plasmid can be determined by plating on both antibiotics (eg Choramphenicol and Ampicillin). This value can then be divided by the CFU of a plate with only the CRISPR plasmid antibioc resistance (eg Ampicillin only) and subtracted from one to determine the rate of CRISPR activity.
In our assay, these target-carrying cells are transformed with our CRISPR plasmid and plated on agar plates containing Ampicillin (the antibiotic marker for the CRISPR plasmid). Colonies growing on the Ampicillin plates result from cells that were successfully transformed with our CRISPR plasmid. Since all of these cells were known to carry the target RFP plasmid at the start of the assay, we can reasonably conclude that any colonies that are no longer red after being successfully transformed with the CRISPR plasmid had lost the target RFP plasmid due to cleavage by the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The percentage efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be determined by dividing the CFU of non-red colonies by the total CFU on the Ampicillin plate.
In the case of inducible promoters, the assay can be repeated with and without the inducer present in the medium, to determine the ""on"" and ""off"" rates of CRISPR activity.
Note: Our CRISPR activity assay requires the CRISPR/Cas9 system and the protospacer it targets to be on two different plasmids. However this is not intended to be the actual configuration of our plasmid-loss system. We envision our final product to be a plasmid on which the CRISPR/Cas9 system, controlled by"

That was thanks to the contents of the crates he carried. A faded, yellow biohazard sticker hinted at the many re-uses the crates had seen. Funny how that yellow sticker didn’t frighten him anymore, he remarked. It wasn’t before long that he and his men had loaded all the crates on the boat and they set out to where the oil tanker hit rock bottom.
A unit had been there before them. The oil drifted on the water, a huge and sticky darkness. Around the oil tanker barriers had been placed to keep the oil from spreading. Their job required them to come close to those barriers, so they steered their red ship towards them. Once arrived, he climbed on them and unscrewed the screen inside the barrier.  That used screen he would pass to a colleague, while another handed him a fresh screen from one of the crates. He always thought they smelled unpleasant. They also had to wear gloves and protective clothing, in order to remain from touching the array on top of the screen. That array was full of genetically modified bacteria, or “oil munchers” as he and his unit preferred to call them. “They eat oil and poop oxygen. It’s like reverse greenhouse effect!” His friend Bob always said. He doubted Bob was completely correct in that, but it was a neat way of explaining it. The oil munchers ate the oil for about 12 hours and then they died, so the screen was useless after that time.
It was his unit’s job to extract the ‘empty’ screens and put in the new ones. Then they would transport the empty screens to the lab, where those people in white coats would wash the dead munchers off and fill them up with new ones. It wasn’t what his younger self expected to do as a fireman.
De barriers with oil muncher screens did a good job cleaning away most of the oil, but it didn’t get rid of everything. He was reminded of that on the way back to shore. The red boat encountered an smaller oil slick. Nothing to be done once the oil somehow passes the barriers: it was forbidden to release lose oil munchers into the sea. They had to be stuck on those screens, otherwise they’d risk disrupting the environmental balance. Well, that wasn’t completely true. Some claimed bacterial waste and huge amounts of mutated living munchers were the cause of disappearing fish kinds. He himself believed that partly true, but at the same time he believed that whatever trouble the munchers caused, it wasn’t as severe as the consequences of an untreated oil spill.

Laws and Guidelines to be Considered in Denmark
The scope of this part of the paper is to draw attention to some of the laws and guidelines, which we have to consider in Denmark, when we are dealing with genetically modified microorganisms (GMM's). Our project is defined as a 'contained use' project, which means that the organisms we are handling are contained from the environment at large. The following laws are based on the ”Bekendtgørelsen om Genteknologi og Arbejdsmiljø” (eng. The Order on Gene-technology and Working Environment) of 2008, which follows the rules laid down by the European Union in 1990 in the ”Directive on the Contained Use of Genetically Modified Micro-organisms”.
Risk-assessment
One of the first, and indeed one of the weightiest points in the directive on GMM safety, is to ensure the public health and the preservation of the environment.
To that end [to avoid adverse effects on human health and the environment which might arise from the contained use of GMM’s], the user shall carry out an assessment of the contained uses as regards the risks to human health and the environment that those contained uses may pose, using as a minimum the elements of assessment and the procedure set out in Annex III,  Sections A and B. [1]
It is required of us to make a thorough risk-assessment, so that we may judge if our use of GMM's poses a threat towards the well-being or safety of human beings, animals, plants, or the environment. To help perform this assessment, the UN has laid down a minimum standard of elements required to make an adequate assessment of the potential harm of an accident resulting in the release of the GMM's into the environment. The following is a list of the minimum elements required:
Assessment factors
1.    Assessment of potential harmful effects, defined as
a)    Disease in humans, animals or plants
b)    Harmful effects resulting from inability to cure disease

Warsaw,2014,Team:Warsaw#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," Hospital and potential applications of lanthanides, as we thinking of our long term goals from the beginning - we want  our project Celulare  to have real application and meet people needs.   Together with  members of Collegium Invisibile we prepared workshops introducing idea of Future Lanthan Hospital and simultaneously fascinating young people with synthetic biology and showing idea of startups. We also prepared workshops on advanced visualization in oncology (molecular imaging, MRI) to show applications on lanthanides in medicine and collaboration on the boundaries of science.

Offtopicarium
As we have discovered that Offtopicarium gives unique opportunity to present our project to people from different fields: scientists, entrepreneurs, people involved in startups, who like to discuss, create and solve problems and are not afraid of unconventional and ""off-topic"" ideas, we wanted to contribute to this event by being active participants and by preparing supporting materials(see Figure 2). Important to say is that one of our members  has coorganized the event this year with a view to mutually spread ideas between iGEM Team and Offtopicarium community (for more information on Offtopicarium see article in  Scientia Crastina).
Figure 2. Event cover  - supporting materials prepared by the member of IGEM Warsaw Team 2014.
Offtopicarium has been launched to spread ideas among people with passion, so we prepared comprehensive presentation of ideas related to our project in three talks. First talk titled ""Synthetic life - beyond biology and chemistry"" briefly summarized the recent discoveries and development in biological chemistry which are connected to the idea of synthetic life such as new synthetic analogues of DNA, extended genetic code and so called bioorthogonal chemistry which allow us to introduce chemical modifications to proteins, nucleic acids and other biomolecules in vivo. Second  talk “Serious games in Education – was related to  computer game connected with Celulare  - game that would teach synthetic biology. It was also a story on ventures with starting up a small game-design company. The last talk, titled “How to make healthcare more open? How to allocate resources in healthcare? - are those mirror questions?”  presented Future Lanthan Hospital Model in the context of open health. This was a talk on the possibilities and  problems encountered in spreading  ideas in context of society awareness, medical environemnent and lack of economical and law analysis.

Gene Network Modeling
In this part of modeling work, we mainly center on constructing some crucial circuits in our regulating network, including the light responding upstreams and downstream movement control mechanisms, as well as some middle wares.
The aim of these construction work is to know about the how the messaging delivering system work as a whole, how does the different signals effect each other in the final output level.
Introduction
We've constructed several modeling skeleton in Matlab Simbiology Package, they are:
DgrA/DgrB Circuit in regulating the flagellum movement
HfiA/HfsJ Circuit in regulating the genesis of composing substances holdfast.
The DNA Inverse Circuit which may change the direction in which promoter works.
Light Sensors including Blue, Red and Green.
Networks
DNA Inverse Enzyme
Introduction
In this model, our aim is to verify that according to use of a recombinase, we can control the relative expressing level of two different kind of Protein.
This is a small picture illustrating its basic condition:
Equations
$ \frac{d(repressor)}{dt} = \frac{K_{repressor} - Vm_{rep} \cdot DNA^n_{rep}}{Kp_{rep}+DNA^n_{rep}} - K_{bind}\cdot lac\cdot repressor$
$ \frac{d(DNA)}{dt} = -\frac{Vm_{rep}\cdot DNA^n_{rep}}{Kp_{rep}+DNA^n_{rep}}$
$ \frac{d([repressor-DNA])}{dt} = \frac{Vm_{rep}\cdot DNA^n_{rep}}{Kp_{rep}+DNA^n_{rep}}$
$ \frac{d([lac-repressor])}{dt} = K_{bind}\cdot lac\cdot repressor$
$ \frac{d(recombinase)}{dt} = K_{recom}\cdot DNA$
$ \frac{d(PromoterDir1)}{dt} = -\frac{Vm_{cata}\cdot PromoterDir1}{Km_{cata}+PromoterDir1}$

Meetings
February 12th
Meeting with a gastroenterologist MD Vaidotas Urbonas. We presented our project and received many crucial comments. Firstly, we found out that similar principles were already used for other diseases‘ treatments with limited success. In 2012 E. coli synthesizing interleukin-10 was created. It has a strong anti-inflammatory effect and was used for inflammatory bowel disease treatment. We learned that E. coli concentration in the small intestine is not very high, bacteria move down because of the peristalsis. Therefore, the given dose of probiotics must be high enough. If modified bacteria got into the internal medium, it could provoke the immune response. But same goes for bacteria of natural microflora (Lactobacillus sp. etc.) and such events are very rare, occurring mostly with coexisting immunosuppression. Most likely"
Johns_Hopkins,2011,Team:Johns Hopkins#Notebook#YTExperiments_-_-_TEXT.html,":
Bands were observed for ARD1 UTR, PRY1 Promoter and STM1 UTR. However, STM1 UTR, with 270bps ran below the band at 250bp. This indicates, that STM1 UTR was a false positive. HHO1 Promoter, RPL24A UTR and TDH3 Promoter show no bands.
Round 2:
PCR conducted on:
FCY2 Promoter
Gal1/10 Promoter
HHo1 Promoter
RPS8B Promoter
Results:  No bands were observed for any of the four promoters. PCR reaction might not have worked due to suboptimal annealing temperature, or self dimerization of the primers.
07/15/11
Purpose:  Do PCR to test operating conditions for Biobrick overhang additions to promoters and UTRs. Run PCR on gel to test for successful reaction. Teach procedure to Josh, Sunny and Daniel.
Procedure: See Procedure for 07/13/11.
Round 1:
PCR conducted on:
BAP2 Promoter
BAP2 UTR
RPS2 Promoter
Results: Bands were observed for all three PCR reactions. The fourth band is the same PCR product as the third band. BAP2 Promoter ran above the other three bands at 840bp. The other two products ran to the same position because they are of the same size at 540bp.
Round 2:
PCR conducted on:
KRE9 UTR
PRY1 UTR
RPS2 UTR
TDH3 UTR
Results: Bands were observed for three of the four PCR reactions. KRE9 UTR (261bp) did not run a band at all. The other three products ran to the same position because they are of nearly the same size at a range of 140-205bp, as such, the results were inconclusive. We will run another gel with smaller molecular weight ladder on PRY1, RPS2 and TDH3 UTR PCR products to determine whether the PCR worked or not.
07/25/11
Purpose: Run PCRs and gels on the successful promotors and UTRs from 07/14 in order to do gel extraction.
Procedure: See procedure for 07/14/11.

Biomimicry from Termites
Termites mainly feed on dead plant material and wood. The cellulose present in plant fiber has the potential to be a rich energy source, but it remains difficult to convert to sugars. Wood is mainly composed of 38-50% cellulose, 17-32% hemicellulose, and 15-30% lignin [1]. Similar to biofuel production, lignin acts as a significant obstacle to wood digestion.
Despite the challenges, termites have developed specialized digestive systems that help them process their woody food. A termite’s gut is essentially one of nature’s most efficient bioreactors, converting 95% of cellulose into simple sugars within 24 hours [2]. The picture below shows how termites ingest wood particles, break down the plant cell walls, and produce sugar [2].
Figure 1: US DOE. June 2007. Biofuels: Bringing Biological Solutions to Energy Challenges, US Department of Energy Office of Science.
Initially, researchers thought that the bacteria in the termites’ guts were what allowed them to digest the plant matter. However, although the bacteria aid in converting cellulose to sugars, most of the lignin degradation (which allows the cellulose to be digested) is actually done by the termite itself in combination with microorganisms called protists. By experimentally comparing the effects of diets containing varying degrees of lignin complexity and by looking at gene expression in the termite R"

Human Practice - SB 5.0 Meeting
The Synthetic Biology 5.0
Conference better known as SB 5.0 was conducted at Stanford University and was a huge success.  For the iGEM Team Panama were the brothers and Ernesto and Natasha. They had the opportunity of being in the scientific environment of the highest level and able to meet legends in the field of molecular biology as: Hamilton Smith and Dan Gibson J. Craig Venter Institute and the former president of BioBrick Foundation Drew Endy and Andrew Hessel. To exchange ideas, laughter and a passion for synthetic biology with other iGEMers as Max Song (iGEM Brown-Stanford), Alyssa Henning (iGEM Cornell and now at GinkoBioWorks, Congrats Alyssa!!!), Tom Richard and Michael Speer from ( PennState), Suguru Asai and Laury Vanagas (iGEM Hokkaido Japan) and many other good young scientists.
The conference was a barrage of presentations of the highest scientific level and the workshops were very useful to start using the tools of design and construction of parts, devices and biological systems that evolution by natural selection never saw coming.
Motivated by this experience and that of iGEM, in Panama we are starting a revolution based on the premise that knowledge is good and more knowledge is better by also called for a multidisciplinary approach.
Because of this we as a team captured the attention of the authorities of our University to start a lab group working on synthetic biology that works throughout the year not only in the iGEM competition period that collides with both Latin American agenda.

The support provided by the JFZ also includes events and workshops.                 As we love assembling biobricks we came up with the idea to build a 2.7 m high DNA helix with ZomeTool, a construction set for engineering science and mathematics. Together with the JFZ, we invited students, children, and families to our event to help us. While building the DNA model, we answered questions about biochemistry and synthetic biology in general. Especially parents were stunned about the examples where genetically engineered products already affect their daily life. Children were fascinated by the possibility to see the DNA in general and to learn how nature can be assembled with simple geometric structures. This way we could realize the project and show them how versatile and multidimensional science can be.

As a cooperation is based on mutuality, we also invited a group of interested young students from Nagold to our institute. The JFZ has a special program to train STEM ambassadors. Therefore we showed them around in our institute, in our lab and let them perform some chemical experiments.

While working on our project, we realized that we developed and optimized some chemical and biochemical methods. We wanted to share our acquired knowledge and looked for a platform to share our experience and tips in a much more accessible way than a dull lab protocol. Therefore, we initiated an educational YouTube collaboration. This collaboration consists of 6 teams from 4 different continents. We expanded our initial idea to create an international platform to share lab methods and experiences with the possibility to make videos to promote, explain and educate iGEM in context of synthetic biology linked to the individual projects. Our channel reaches out to students who are not aware of iGEM yet and holds a high potential to inspire and educate future iGEM teams in a multicultural and exhilarant way.
You can find videos about synthetic biology in general, laboratory safety, CRISPR/Cas systems and many tutorials such as our tutorial on how to harvest spores from Streptomyces colonies.

Education and sharing experiences are not only crucial for the broad public but also within the iGEM community. Hence, we were happy to join the European iGEM Meetup in Delft. Especially the new team members were delighted about the possibility to meet iGEM"

Here are some questions you might consider:
Who is your user?    What and where in the design cycle are the needs in synthetic biology?    During your wet lab experience, how did you feel? Were you ever overwhelmed? How might you mediate that?    What other domains and tools do you think you can refer to for your projects?    Where there gestures? Sketches? Interfaces that came to mind when you were trying to deal with the experiment protocol?    How could you frame synbio as a ""good"" thing?

This week we got a break from struggling with zMol and zSpace to go to BU and learn about their project. I had to try to understand biology to learn what their project was about, so that was an interesting learning experience. We had fun with them by having lunch and going bowling. While at Boston University, I did the Sifteo Cube study  with Consuelo which I thought was the best part about my trip to BU. I really liked learning about her project and some of the other uses for Sifteo Cubes. Wednesday and Thursday we returned to working on zMol and double bonding at Wellesley. We're still struggling with understanding the old zMol spaghetti code. We got Kevin, one of the previous developers of zMol to come help explain the code to us and his thought process during their development. We've experimented with double bonding enough to get bonds to change colors but it's very glitchy and crashes a lot. We're starting to understand more things, bit by bit.

We've struggled with double bonding for several days with a bit of success, but there are still many glitches. We spent a few days just getting everything in working order to present our project to BU. We were joined this week by our intern, Yoav. We're getting into more of a rhythm with our work this week. We're supposed to start thinking about our 3D representation of the periodic table of elements so we spent some time drawing up designs for the program. We're hoping to make it easy and intuitive to use. We'd like"

The best way ever to preserve lithic relics
an innovative biochemical method to resolve erosion.
View Our Works
The inscriptions on Precipice are one of the most common and fundamental forms of traditional Chinese relics. Due to having been carved in open areas plus the exposure to sunshine and raindrops, which is often the case for most of them,the Inscriptions are weathered readily. Currently, there are quite a few methods to resolve this phenomenon but some of them are not used properly which occasionally cause the damage for the Inscriptions. Our research project aims at using microorganism method, which is to put a plasmid with the ability to convert bio-oriented oxaloacetic acid to oxalate acid into the cell of E.coil, inducing the cell and the product will react with one component of the Inscriptions-- calcium carbonate-- to generate nearly insoluble calcium oxalate monohydrate to adhere to the Inscriptions for protection. Another E.coil with the ablility to secrete lipase has also been constructed; we aim to add this cell when we are cleansing the Inscriptions to resolve the oil substances on the surface of them. By constructing these products, we are able to protect the relics either from human errors as cleaning and protecting or from natural damnification.

Project's background
       The area near Qiantang River has a profound history of wealth. Hangzhou, in the heart of this area, situated many astonishing lithic cultural relics. Most of them were made during The Ten Kingdoms (A.D. 891-A.D. 979) and Song Dynasty (A.D. 960- A.D. 1279). Not only do those lithic relics represent the cutting edge of stone carving technology in contemporary time, but"
Lanzhou,2017,Team:Lanzhou#Questionnaire_-_-_TEXT.html," more highly-recognized by students with a bachelor degree or a higher one, and they may give out a more reasonable comment.
What's your attitude to transgenic research project？
As the diagram and bar chart directly shown, over two thirds of the people who major in Biology with a Bachelor or higher degree, while about one third of them hold a neutral view, only a tiny percent of 5 object to researches concerning transgenic program. On the other hand, the circumstances are completely different. When it comes to non-Biology major students, the supporting rate is nearly 30 percent, while most of them still stay neutral and the lower educational degree they got, the bigger proportion of those who are hold a opposite idea will be taken up.
Do you think transgenic technology will be very promising in future？
As the results indicated, more than 55% of Biology major respondents stay in positive over this new technology. In contrast, nearly half of the respondents who are non-Biology major maintain neutral. Besides, about 36 percent of those with a relatively low educational level don’t speak highly of the development transgenic technology in the long run.
Do you know that there are intrinsic transgenic phenomena in the nature？
As results vividly exhibited, about one third of respondents who are non-Biology major have no idea about natural transgenic phenomenon, which is not related to respondents’ educational levels. Besides, little do they learn about neither three of them. Among respondents whose majors are Biology, and over 80 percent of them have learnt about natural transgenic system mediated by Agrobacterium, thus the proportion of those who know little about natural transgenic phenomenon is rather low.
3. Others
What possible risks do you think the transgenic products could have？
Results collected from respondents vividly reveal that the part which the public worry most about is the potentially unpredictable and uncontrollable irreversible risk transgenic products might harbor. While the fear of the possibility that these products might do harm to biodiversity takes the second place. In comparison, the worry of the probability that they might enter the market randomly occupied the smallest percentage.
Conclusion
In general, young people are paying more attentions to the current situation, and provide more supports to it. Respondents with a degree of Bachelor or higher are more familiar about transgenic technology than those with a lower degree, meanwhile attitudes toward this novel technology are becoming more objective, and more people hold a positive mind of this novel technology.
As for those undergraduates and students who are Biology major, they are much more familiar with the technology than those were not. Additionally, they were optimistic of its development and offered much"
