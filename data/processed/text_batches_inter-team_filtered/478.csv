Since these extracted ssDNA were able to form large structures that could not pass through PAGE.(Fig. 20b), we moved on to look for any successfully assembled NDC and NDC-AS under transmission electron micrpscopy.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
5 μl of NDC and NDC-AS samples was first adsorbed onto glow-discharged 400 mesh copper grids (Ted Pella, Inc.) for 1 minute followed by staining with 2% uranyl acetate for 1 minute. Stained samples were washed twice by distilled water to remove excess uranyl acetate. Stained NDC and NDC-AS samples on the grid were visualized using a Philips CM 100 Transmission Electron Microscope with 100 kV operating voltage.

Darwinian evolution for microbial cell factory:
in vivo evolution engineering towards tryptophan-overproduction superbug
Darwinian evolution shows great power in creating incredible biological function in amazing speed.Inspired by this, our team aimed at creating novel fast and irrational microbial cell factory by simulating natural Darwinian evolution process. With tryptophan as target product, a novel tryptophan biosensor utilizing translating ribosome mechanism was firstly developed as the foundation for tryptophan productivity and selection pressure switch module. We further constructed this tryptophan overproduction selection gene circuit coupling with in vivo mutation machine (mutator gene of mutD). By fine-tuning the selection conditions, our selection circuit showed good tryptophan dependent growth property, which provides the foundation for further evolution.As a preliminary result of this project, we successfully evolved an ancestor with zero productivity to a high-tryptophan producer only after several rounds of evolution.

Tsinghua,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#fluid model#regulation of killing ability_-_-_TEXT.html," amount of LacI (More details why we detect RFP intensity but not OD600 directly in the model can be seen at Fluid Model ), so it can indicate the killing effect of the warrior. This means in our model that the warrior cannot actually kill another warrior, but can activate the RFP expression of another warrior. And more RFP inside bacteria means the bacteria is killed more by warrior in other side.
    In conclusion, we can say that killing ability of warrior I is larger than that of warrior II when they are co-cultured together, RFP inside warrior II increase faster (indicating speed of accumulating strength, more details will be shown below) or increase to a higher steady state level. (indicating maximal killing effect.). (The initial amounts of two warriors are same.)
III Gene circuit of warrior in the model
Note: Here for simplicity, we hypothesize that this gene circuit is orthogonal.
IV ODE parameters and its resource
Note: This is part of fluid model to help us solve this specific problem. Detailed explanation can be seen at Fluid Model. Subscript 1 indicate warrior I, subscript 2 indicate warrior II. AHL1 is C4HSL and AHL2 is 3OC6HSL.

5. AHL2 (Produced by warrior II) molecule concentration inside environment (molecule/medium)
6. Amount of RFP inside the cell (a.u/cell)
7. Amount of AHLI1 inside warrior I (molecule/cell)
8. Amount of AHLI2 inside warrior II (molecule/cell)：
V Original Parameter set of the model
VI Results of model
Note:
1. Since we have assumed that the increasing rate and carrying capacity of two warriors are same, so in the model, the amount of two warriors are same at all the time.
2. In the following description, we will show how to regulate killing ability of warriors by showing how to regulate killing abilities of two warriors to the same level!
3.Killing effect means the real time effect of one warrior on the other, but killing ability is a global property that partly describe how killing effect of one warrior change as time.

We would like to start by saying that many people helped throughout this project, many of whom are not mentioned in the Wiki (but we had to at the end of the day for political reasons). Any attempt of acknowledging them (them=other team members) falls short of reality...
It is impossible to express the amount of gratitute that really all the people that were involved in the realization of the project deserve. Your counsel, moral support, financing, help in many different ways were fundamental for the realization of the project... Eternal thanks.

Duke iGEM 2017 Characterization: pSB1C3 Is Not Efficient in Gibson Assembly
At Duke iGEM, we often experiment with using genes in different vectors to achieve optimal metabolic engineering and then we put the genes into pSB1C3 afterwards. In order to do this, we use Gibson assembly and put homology arms on each end of a G-block along with pSB1C3 homology upstream. Last year we designed our G-blocks like this:
Like this, we first put the gene into pSMART via Gibson Assembly because it was better for our experiments and then afterwards we used restriction digest in order to put the gene into pSB1C3.
Our Gibson assemblies had a very low success rate of 6.15% (Figure 1), while the rest of the colonies that grew were empty pSMART vector that had self-ligated. Sequencing the empty vector, we found that there was actually some pSB1C3 between the 5’ and 3’ ends of pSMART.
Figure 1: pSB1C3 has a low Gibson assembly success rate of 6.15%.
The Biobrick prefix and suffix have homology to one another, which greatly reduces the efficacy of Gibson Assembly (n=65). Colony PCR was run on random colonies after transformations of Gibson assemblies to confirm whether the gene insert was present.
Upon closer examination, there are actually 9 base pairs that are homologous between the Biobrick prefix and suffix (Figure 2).  We realized that this micro-homology was cutting out the rest of the G-block during Gibson assembly and creating empty vector like this:
Figure 2: The Biobrick prefix and suffix have 9bp of homology.
Using this construct, the only insert we found was the 9bp of pSB1C3"

Biosearch:A Portable Synthetic Biology Research Tool
With Biosearch, users can find and check the information that they need much more quickly and conveniently, free from the constraints of the network conditions and location restrictions. Researchers can build their biobrick framework anywhere, anytime.
At the same time, in Biosearch, on the 'more' page, there is a 'learn!' part. In this part, there are 'Synthetic biology', 'Assembly' and 'Parts'.In 'Synthetic biology', the part shows the user 'What is Synthetic Biology' and 'Why Synthetic Biology base on standard parts'. This part is very useful for the freshman. Users can quickly introduce synthetic biology to the novice and people interested in it.
With the app store 25 billions downloads have been reached, a new era is coming. As a mobile phone has many applications just like PC, some applications even have more mobile phone users than PC users. The direction of software development has been shifted to mobile devices, and software development on the mobile devices is irreversible change. And we take partregistry to the Apple device (the most widely used smartphone). When other basic disciplines'development still depends on paper documents or network data, synthetic biology has come to the forefront of the time.
From now on, synthetic biology is no longer a discipline limited in laboratory , researchers can take it walking in every corner of the world, to show the world the charm of synthetic biology.

Economic Potential Analysis
An economic rationale analysis for investing in the use of micro-organisms for                 the production of artificial bone implants
Because our research contributes to the base of fundamental knowledge, it could                 be used as preliminary research for many applications. A brief look into the                 future potential, from an economic perspective, could possibly offer the                 rationale for a deeper research into the application. As we will see, there are                 many opportunities and challenges that pop up and need to be addressed, even in                 this early stage of the project. The main goal of this potential analysis is to construct a                 bridge between the pure scientific research and the commercial environment,                 resulting in a marketable product. In this analysis, we mainly focus on the use                 of Spot E.Shape principles to discover novel ways of producing artificial bone                 replacements . A similar analysis can be made for each of the other                 applications of the project. For more details on the other applications, please go to the application page.

A deeper understanding of the market and industry dynamics in the bone-implant                 industry
Nowadays, elderly people are more active than ever before. They cycle, play                         tennis, go swimming, travel, etc. Besides, they do not want to give up on those                         activities because of their age. Nevertheless, the risk of accidents with                         possibly serious health consequences and broken limbs grows with age.                         Approximately 1% of all falls of elderly people result in a hip fracture with an                         acute mortality of 3%-5%. (2)
The ageing population and active life-style trends are two major driving forces                 for the demand of orthopaedic devices. Apart from that, the medical world is                 confronted with an increasing number of obesity and osteoporosis patients. These                 factors result in an enhanced growth of the orthopaedic industry. Medical device                 companies respond by continuously looking for new ways of treating fractured                 bones in order to reduce the curing time and to obtain a more performant device.
A closer look into the industry dynamics reveals that the industry is highly                 regulated and very dynamic where most of the industry players are                 well-established small and medium-size enterprises (SME’s). A start-up company                 often needs a significant better product to gain some market share in the                 medical"

Synthetic Life
Alex: Hi my name’s Alex Grigg, and this is my teammate Dev Vyas. And we would like to welcome you to the first episode of Synthetic Ethics. So Dev, I’m sure your familiar with synthetic biology, but what about our listeners who still don’t quite get what synthetic biology is?
Dev: Well synthetic biology is an emerging science with vast potential and opportunity. It can be described as the combination of science and engineering. What synthetic biologists do is create new organic systems operating within living organisms. It even has the potential to create life from scratch.
Alex: I’m going to stop you right there, because today we are discussing the ethics of synthetic life, a topic which draws some of the most excitement, and controversy to our field. So, if I were to tell you that a colossal achievement that has been compared to other scientific milestones such as the sequencing of the human genome, and the cloning of the sheep Dolly happened just a few months ago, what would you think I was talking about?
Dev: Does it have anything to do with Bald Bearded scientists?
Alex: Good guess Dev! Although I think every scientific milestone can be somehow attributed to the Bald and Bearded. The particular accomplishment to which I’m referring is the creation of synthia, the first synthetic, self-replicating life.
Dev: That’s right, in 2008 a team of scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute headed up by Drs. Craig Venter, our bald and bearded scientist, Hamilton Smith, and Clyde Hutchison were able to create a small bacterial genome, and by May 2010 it was announced that they had successfully used a synthetic genome of the bacterium mycroplasma mycocides to create a bacteria that could sustain, and replicate itself.
Alex: Alright, lets take a step back and talk about how such an achievement was attained. It all started with the chemical synthesis of DNA fragments of 1078 base pairs. These casset"

The kinetics of blue protein accumulation in the Amberless cells were relatively slow compared to GFP, with first visible signs at Day 2. We plan to determine the kinetics more thoroughly in an future experiment. Additionally, higher temperatures of incubation were less conducive to protein production; room temperature to 30C was the optimal temperature. The cells were removed from the each plate at Day 5 and lysed for Western blotting.
Figure 7. The aeBlue-3S construct has an N-terminal FLAG-tag that can be detected by Western blot using an anti-FLAG antibody. Lane A has twice the cell lysate concentration of lane B. The band at approximately 30kDa is near the expected molecular weight of the complete aeBlue product (28kDa), meaning that Amberless cells, but not DH5-alpha cells, express the complete protein.
Figure 7 shows that the Amberless cells only produce the full aeBlue-3S protein. Any truncated products would appear at 7, 13, and 20 kDa depending on the stop codon. DH5-alpha do not produce any protein, or a possible alternative is that truncated products degrade quickly in the cell and do not appear in the gel. These data strongly indicate that the supP tRNA enables protein expression through UAG stop codons only in Amberless cells and serve as a proof of concept for our Codon Security strategy.
Results Part 2 - Amberless Hell Cell
In parallel with demonstrating the Codon Security concept, we worked on applying it to radiation resistance genes to create the Amberless Hell Cell chassis. The goal of this part of the project was to confer resistances to Amberless Cells so that they could survive in harsh environments encountered in UAV or space applications. At the same time, we wanted to prove that applying Codon Security, we could ensure that using these ""super-strains"" of Amberless in the environment would not pose a risk of horizontal gene transfer into other bacteria.
We first isolated 5 radiation resistance genes by PCR from D. radiodurans genomic DNA: uvsE [3], uracil glycosylase 1 , uracil glycosylase 2 [4], MntH , and DpsMP1 . Of these, the last two were previous Stanford-Brown 2012 biobricks that we re-isolated for sequence fidelity. The uvsE and MntH were chosen for initial testing.

CheZ is the chief regulator of the molecular events that lead the counter clockwise rotation of the flagella motor during the Chemotaxis signal transduction pathway of E.coli. This counter clockwise flagella motor rotation results in bacterial swimming (instead of tumbling) in the presence of a chemoattractant (in this case atrazine).

This BioBrick represents a C-terminal fusion part. The part contains a standard suffix and a “assembly standard 25” prefix (Freiburg Fusions/ RFC 25). This version of the mRFP reporter (BBa_E1010) has the standard BioBrick suffix and prefix. The standard Biobrick prefix, however, is followed by another restriction site – specific for NgoMIV (which forms the Freiburg fusion prefix). The part lacks an ATG start codon (provided by N-terminal part). It can therefore be fused to any gene in a modular fashion via the modular construction strategy of protein fusion developed by the Freiburg 2007 team.

Technical advances and dropping prices in the field of gene synthesis brings several deadly germs into the range of small research projects or even private persons as for example Spanish Flu (Influenza H1N1) with a 13.5 kbp * or even the Ebola virus with a 19 kbp genome * .  In 2006, the “Guardian” journalist James Randson ordered a 78 bp DNA oligonucleotide coding for the capsid of the smallpox Orthopoxvirus variola with the intention to alert the public. 10
In the United States, smallpox are listed as schedule 5 pathogens in the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act of 2001 and are illegal to keep or use without first notifying the civil authorities.
On the other hand, it is questionable if these prohibitions or perhaps the size of the smallpox genome of ~200 kb * are sufficient to prevent de novo synthesis in the future efficiently. His intention was to focus the public's attention to the possibility that one of the most severe plagues in the history of mankind could be synthesized and released to the environment, either intentionally or by mistake. This would be a tragic setback since the smallpox's eradication was celebrated in 1979 by the World Health Organization as one of the greatest victories in the history of medicine 33 .
In order to prevent the unauthorized synthesis of gene sequences encoding hazardous biological agents, efforts to implement sequence analysis algorithms into the operating procedure of all organizations and companies capable of synthesizing gene sequences are being undertaken.
This barrier should be implemented not on a voluntary basis but as a legally binding regulation. It should be enforced by the government on a national level, but effort should also be made to find solutions for an international progress on this issue.
As a first step, the development of search algorithms as Craic's BlackWatch 22 Several countries around the globe are technically capable to develop biological weapons or to support terroristic groups in doing so. When this physical capability meets an ideological attitude that is based on contempt for other concepts of society, it cannot be ruled out that biological warfare is taken into consideration.
Synthetic Biology vs. Nuclear Research - Consideration in terms of security policy
When considering the history of research, the dual-use character of technical innovations has always been present, only the reaction of society to it differs from case to case. As an example, scientific discoveries in the field of nuclear physics where treated as classified information having"

Yale
During the iGEM competition we cooperate with the iGEM team of Yale . In our project we try to shift the minimum growth temperature from 7°C to 0°C or even lower. If we can achieve this, additional expression of antifreeze proteins might drive the minimum temperature down even further. Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) facilitate survival at subzero temperatures by binding small ice crystals and inhibiting their growth or interact with cell membranes to protect them from cold damage. This year, the iGEM team of Yale also incorporates AFPs in their project. For this reason a cooperation was brought to life between the iGEM teams of Yale and Amsterdam. IGEM team Yale sent us three different AFPs: RiAFP, TmAFP, ZeAFP (see our project description ), which we can incorporate in our project. Unfortunately, due to logistics, we had no time to use the Yale's AFPs. However, we encourage future teams that would like to use our CryoBricks to also use AFPs.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Technology#_-_-_TEXT.html," commercially available for full-scale up at the time of application.
Technological verification: our product will be validated using either existing data (obtained within the last five years by a reputable third party) or data obtained by a third party source through the ETV program. This data would need to substantiate the performance claim that we would be trying to make about our technology.
Submission of application: A formal application including the verification data would be submitted for a fee of $1500. At this stage, we would sign a contract with EVT for them to assess our product.
Review of application: the data submitted is reviewed, and if found sufficient to substantiate the claims, is approved.  If this occurs, an award is issued, allowing the technology to be used for 3 years before a re-application is necessary.
When we have the biosensor working as a consistently performing prototype,  accurately predicting the levels of chemicals that it can sense in solution, both in the lab and the field, we will go through the EVT certification. Being EVT certified will instill confidence in us by end-users and investors which will aid in the success of our company.
Costs for the process
Initial application fee: $1500
Verification fee paid to third party entity: $10000-20000 depending on the nature of the tests required.
Renewal Fee: $2000/3 years
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Certification
In order to bring our product into the US market, which we hope to do by year five, we need to secure EPA certification. This is the required approval in the United States for biotechnology products. This can be an extremely extensive process, costing up to $300,000. As such, we will need to wait until we have established sales before we begin this process. It is still important to consider this early however, as it is a requirement for entry into US markets.
Conclusion
Through the development of a versatile sensing platform, we hope to be able to meet a critical market need for more rapid and reliable monitoring of toxins in the oil and gas sector. With a solid proof of concept in place, we hope to be able to bring this first generation product to market, as well as several future generation products. As we research to develop and optimize the product we will perform the necessary steps to meet the requirements of regulation for safety and standards.

We modified the leucyl tRNA synthetase enzyme to accept only the protected form of leucine and not the normal form. Unlike PEA methods, this protecting group is cleaved after the protected leucine is taken up by the enzyme. This means leucine maintains its normal structure when it is added to the protein chain.
Imagine walking through an airport metal detector. Before the security officers allow you to pass, you must relinquish all metal possessions, a temporary change. After you pass through the detector in your altered state, your possessions are returned, and you are in the same state as you were before you passed through the detector. But, an alteration had to be made before you could pass through the detector.
We are making alterations to leucine to allow it to pass through a detector that we created within the cell. This allows us to control the leucine supply to the cell. By controlling the nutrient supply of a cell, we control the longevity period of the strain. We can continue to feed the cell protected leucine until it has finished its job, then we can withhold protected leucine. The strain will die and will not proliferate into the ecosystem.
We consulted with industry experts to determine feasible applications for Leu-Lock. We personally interviewed over ten biocontainment and biosafety experts and toured potential client sites, including Rivanna Waste Treatment in Charlottesville, VA. We determined that the best application for our project is within short-term open environment GEO applications. This includes bioremediation efforts, such as cleaning up oil spills. We plan to market as an optimized chemical reagent kit that allows scientists to implement our containment mechanism in the GEO of their choice with ease. Synthetic translational control promises new potential for once unusable GEO applications. Incorporating the best aspects of previous biocontainment methods, we provide a novel, efficient, and robust mechanism for safe, responsible GEO use."

Abstract
We built a mathematical model for the dynamics in a lytic infection process for the production of a specific protein on the basis of chemical reaction networks. We aim to optimize the protein expression as a function of the multiplicity of infection (MOI).
Defining parameters
It was considered a simple chemical reaction network with a quasi-steady state approximation for the interaction between the baculovirus and the sf9. This led to a first approximation in the rate constant in the infection process. More will be discussed below. The parameters that will be used in the development of the model are the following:
CU
Non-infected Cell concentration.
C1
Infected Cell concentration.
V
Baculovirus concentration.
CP
Complex concentration (Non-infected Cell+Virus).
N
Effective baculovirus production rate.
d
Dead rate due to infection.
P
Natural saturation population.
r
Natural Malthusian parameter for the Sf9.
k1
Rate constant for the complex formation.
k-1
Rate constant for the complex degradation.
k2
Rate constant for the infection process.
K
Quasi-steady-state rate constant in the infection.
ΦV
Average virus production per infected cell.
ΦP
Average protein production per infected cell.
ΤIV
Time lapse between the infection of the cell and the beginning of the virus production.
ΤIP
Time lapse between the infection of the cell and the beginning of the protein production.
ΤD
Time lapse between the infection of the cell and cell's death.
Chemical Reaction Network Modeling
We consider as a first approach that only one virion is required for the infection process of a Sf9cell. An uninfected cell.CU interacts with virions V to create a complex CP. Some of them will be infected due to this interaction, i.e. the virion will cross the membrane and begin the infection process, the rest will stay in this complex form or will dissolve:
(1)
The Sf9 cells will continue to replicate naturally as long as it doesn't get infected. After the infection, the corresponding malthusian parameter will decrease  dramatically and, in fact, can be neglected after the infection: Combining both processes, we obtain the following rates for the CU and the complex CP"

Since the real estate on our desktop CNC milled microfluidic chips are limited, this protocol has divided into two chips which, when run in tandem, accomplish these specific serial dilutions. The first chip in the system consists of three consecutive mixers, design with flow rates intended to handle the three 1:20 dilutions. The other chip will run the two 1:10 dilutions and the output selection mechanism.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," shared by everyone. That openness to non scientists, now called “amateurs” (motivated but uninitiated people) allow us, in my opinion, to link DIY perspectives with critical discourses, such as that from ETC Group. Regarding decision making, local practices, and the aims of science, DIY is obviously open to the democratic perspective defended by ETC Group. More deeply, some of their concerns are claimed by DIYists as aims. In that way, the DIYbio.org website  presented themselves as “an organization dedicated to making biology an accessible pursuit for citizen scientists, amateur biologists, and DIY biological engineers who value openness and safety. This will require mechanisms for amateurs to increase their knowledge and skills, access to a community of experts, the development of a code of ethics, responsible oversight, and leadership on issues that are unique to doing biology outside of traditional professional settings”.
As such, biology is then conceived and made as a set of social practices, open to both scientist and non scientist in order to answer to very different goals than traditional science: for example scientific skills, ethical reflexion, and new ways to cooperate are now integrated with the actual science goals.
This description doesn't have to lead us to consider that there are two worlds in synthetic biology, something like “Venter Institute versus DIY practices”. The portrait of the field of synthetic biology is much more complex : big companies, little start -ups, universities, institutional or associative organizations, movements, groups like DIYbio, etc. Everyone is pursuing both different and similar goals and a lot of ideas, discourses, practices and people are circulating in all spheres. We can view the IGEM competition as one such place (along with so many others) where people and practices from these different worlds can meet. The huge advantage of such an event is that it allows us to observe something like a cross section, or an extract of the whole picture permitting us to get stakes and debates clearer.
D. To finish with... A case study
But, events like IGEM are not only offering us a certain visibility, they are creating something and something more than the individual student projects.
As we mentioned with respect to opensource strategies in standardization, the IGEM competition is stimulating new practices, new “science spacetime”, for students : choosing their own subject, building their own team, dedicating their holidays to that program. In a certain way, IGEM is promoting something close to DIY practices : science is not only about courses and classes, it also seen as an innovative project, even if everything is done in a rush and hardly finished.

Because we share a language and a geographic area, we considered it important, that as Latin countries we participated in a collaboration that allows in the short and long term to obtain benefits for the different teams.
We’ve worked in generating a document that contains the most relevant information of our projects, along with a section in which that reports the main problems we have had to get to iGEM. The idea is to disseminate this document widely through our networks in order to let know other countries not only how Synthetic Biology can bring great benefits to society, but also the great complications that we must go through to reach the Giant Jamboree to present our ideas and projects.

As the protocol stayed E. coli HT115 was used in the presence of plasmid L440, which confers resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline. When transforming this BioBrick in pSB1C3, the bacteria is resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. Due to the risk of using multiresistant bacteria in research and to optimize BSLA expression, they asked us to determine the influence of multiple antibiotic resistance in the expression of BSLA.
In order to achieve this, the received strain was cultivated in luria broth with 1) chloramphenicol, 2) chloramphenicol and ampicillin, 3"

We went to Norwich to participate a very inspiring conference on synthetic biology in plants. The two days were packed with lectures and panel discussions from scientists from our Plants Department, Norwich (JIC and other institutes as well) and from some commercial companies. The Open Plant initiative aims to promote sharing of knowledge, working materials - physical as well as DNA sequences which would pave the way towards bigger inventions in science and industry much the same way standardised basic parts do in engineering.
During all the lunch and tea breaks as well as evenings we worked very hard on all our sequences, were chasing all the amazing scientists to discuss our project and get advice. It was amazingly productive and we thank a lot to all the people moving our project further, especially Dr Nicola Patron, Dr Tom Knight, Dr Steven Burgess and Ms Kher Xing Chan (Cindy)!

Some had too high AT content and repeats to be synthesised (primers surprisingly :D ) but we will try to amplify them from the chloroplast genome. Our plasmid design had at least 10 major changes of direction and was evolving quicker than some of us were able to track! But planning is important, right?
Some of us have spent the afternoon learning biolistics - transforming our cells with fluorescent proteins
PLASMID DESIGN UPDATE VOL.2:
MARKERS
First we have abandoned the idea of marking our genes with luciferase as that would not give us quick and easily detectable response. Fluorescent proteins should be more reliable although there are troubles with expressing them in Chlamydomonas chloroplasts - well, something for us to troubleshoot with trying our 18 possible FPs!
SAFETY - CAS9 REGULATION AND WAYS OF EXPRESSION
We are very concerned with safety as our design may resemble a gene drive, we want to make sure we are definitely not making one. We were considering Lac regulatable promoters, light regulated ones and also Nac2. Nac2 is still a system we consider to try - we could switch off the expression"

We also received plant parts from Valencia-UPV,  which we tested in the plant chassis, Nicotiana tabacum, in a transient assay. We recorded the result using confocal microscopy.  We also sent them the ‘MoClo Flipper Constructs’ made by the NRP-UEA iGEM 2014 team, allowing them to easily convert their GoldenGate parts to standardised BioBricks. The Valencia-UPV team helped us by testing our plant-expression constructs in their laboratory.

Manchester-Graz have developed an expression system designed to regulate single and multi-gene pathways for an intestine expression. They helped us to model butyrate production in the gut. We exchanged parts to conduct reciprocal testing experiments but have so far not been successful in collecting data.

For C0061, the restriction failed. The size of the linearized vector is about 10kb confirming differences in the Registry of Standard Parts annotation and the BioBrick.
The sequence data from June 11, 2013 was analyzed by sequence alignments. J23100+B0032 and J23105+B0032 did not contain the promoters. J23112+B0032, C0078+B0015, C0070+B0015, C0060+B0015 was sequence verified. Unfortunately the sequencing failed for K091117 and P1002.
Friday, June 14, 2013
Investigators: Laura, Kerstin, Oliver
Since cloning of the constructs J23100+B0015 and J23106+B0015 failed previously and gel extraction of the promoters is difficult due to their small fragment sizes, we tried a copy & paste cloning approach:
The promoters J23100 and J23106 were PCR amplified using resuspended DNA from the distribution kit as a template. The inducible promoters R0062, R0071 and K091117 were PCR amplified using plasmid DNA (miniprep) as a template. The endonuclease digest on June 13, 2013  was repeated from scratch. This time the digest was successful and the fragments were extracted. The vectors were dephoshorylated.
Week 5: June 16 - June 22, 2013
This week was dominated by a lot of cloning. We equipped our constitutive and inducible promoters with ribosome binding sites, terminators, an ampicillin resistance gene and a lactonase (not all of them got each of these elements). Additionally, we separated the ampicillin resistance gene from its native promoter in order to make its expression inducible. Although cloning was mostly successful, we were struggling to amplify and purified the luxR brick (C0062), which cost us a lot of time and effort. Unfortunately, it also wasn’t rewarded with success in the end.
Another important step was to adapt our cloning strategy towards new chromoproteins which we received from iGEM team Uppsala. These allow us to evaluate our cultivation experiments solely with own equipment, rather than having to find a cell sorter with suitable excitement lasers for all fluorescent proteins.

Once the desired layout was achieved, Matlab generates a skeleton code upon saving which can then be used to assign the various functions to the various handles. Attached is the code as well as the GUIDE layout structure that was used to generate the interactive graph. Three additional functions were added to the code. The first function, “plotter”, was used to generate the actual graph. This function requires three inputs, the total duration of time (in days), the total enzyme concentration as well as the ALA concentration. The second and third functions were required to model the actual concentration changes as a function of time and were provided by team Macquarie.
The two “edit text” handles were then programmed to allow the user to enter their desired enzyme and ALA concentrations. The slider was also programmed to extend or reduce the time duration (X-axis) of the plot. Lastly one of the “static text” handles was programmed to inform the user of the position of the slider, namely a value between 1 and 16 days. A zooming toolbar was also added to the GUI to allow the user to zoom into sections of the plot.
Running the code starts the newly programmed GUI with which the user can now change the various variables and see the effect it has on the concentrations. Figure 2 is a few screenshots of the GUI in action. Due to the nature of Macquarie`s experiments the graph was crucial to make an accurate conclusion about their results. We also helped them to solve coding problems on MatLab.

Collaboration with Heidelberg University
Team Heidelberg was the second runner up during the finals in the 2015 iGEM competition. In our project we needed to design an aptamer that would specifically bind to a target site of a protein present in the Photosystem II (PSII) complex of the thylakoid membrane. Normally the only way to developget target specific aptamers is through the process of SELEX (Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment). However, SELEX would not indicate to us clearly what the target protein is, and overall is a very challenging and time consuming process. Fortunately for us, Team Heidelberg-2015 developed a software tool known as MAWS (Making Aptamers Without SELEX) which requires a PDB (Protein Data Bank) input file to generate an aptamer that binds specifically to a target site.
We decided to use this software"

For all iGEMers and researchers out there, you all know that there are times when during experiments you have some free time but not much or you just need a good pick me up, well these activities are perfect for you. They bring the team together, keep you alert and can make you laugh so hard that any stress of failed cloning or unexpected breakdowns become a thing of the past.
Ninja's
Contrary to the name of this game, you do not need to dress up in black or as turtles and throw shurikens, instead you just need to be swift, fluid and tactical. For this game you need to ideally have a large group of people but more than 3 is fine too. The aim of the game is to be the last man or woman standing.
How to
If the video demonstration is not clear enough, here is a written version of the rules. There are actually quite a different set of rules for this game but we like to keep things fast, fun and unexpected by using this set of rules (i.e. we made up bits)
1) Get into a circle and everyone put your hands to the centre and have your finger tips pretty much touching.
2) Wiggle your fingers and say ""EEEERRRRRRRRRRR Ninjas!"", on the word of ""Ninjas"", everyone jumps back from the circle and gets into a ninja-like stance. What kind of stance you get into will probably depend on what films you watch.
3) One person then starts, they pick one person who is immediately to their left or right and in one fluid motion moves to hit their hand. In the meanwhile, the person who has been targetted is also allowed to move in one fluid continual movement.
4) If the person targetted has their hand hit they are out, and the next person in their direction continues the game. If the person evades being hit, then they move, they are also allowed to choose whichever direction to move in and hence you you target.
5) This game continues till only 2 people are left. These two then stop and get back to back and on the count of three jump away and make a VERY cool ninja pose. The coolest/hardest pose is the person who starts first. The winner is the last one remaining.
Rules
1) Only hitting the person's hand counts, that means no arms! However, it does not matter whether it is the"

Introduction
In this section you will find out what is Catalytic Activity Sequencing (CAT-Seq). Firstly, the CAT-Seq is introduced in brief to give a quick overview of how the system works and what are the different parts it consists of. Next, every step of the system is described and illustrated in detail. Finally, we show how we have applied this design in order to build the proof of concept of CAT-Seq.
It should be noted that only the final form of the system design is described here. Yet, the design of a new method is a highly dynamic process which requires an immense amount of theoretical and practical iterations that closely follow the main principles of engineering. Therefore, in order to see the CAT-Seq system engineering story - how it began, how early designs have looked, how and why did the system design change during the whole project year and what influenced those changes - please head to the Human Practices section!
CAT-Seq allows to rapidly record the information about billions catalytic biomolecule activities in parallel. Each measured activity is then simultaneously written into DNA sequence encoding the particular biomolecule. After the recording, both the biomolecule sequence and it’s activity can be read using nanopore sequencing.
Currently, droplet microfluidics offer an efficient and high-throughput way to parallelise high number of reactions. As each molecule is encapsulated in a unique water droplet, various physically separated reactions can be carried out at the same time. Yet, what is missing, is a way to record the activity information in each droplet, so that after the droplets are collected together and broken, the sequence and function relationship is not lost. In other words, the main goal of CAT-Seq is to connect catalytic biomolecule’s phenotype to genotype in ultra-high throughput manner.
During the theoretical design phase it became apparent that recording such"

Team Düsseldorf Cologne (postcard exchange)
We collaborated with Team Düsseldorf Cologne and other teams worldwide to create and distribute our postcard making our sophorolipid research more accessible to the public. We created the graphics and composed the text for our postcard design. Team Düsseldorf Cologne generously provided for the cost of printing and distributing many copies of our postcard. Our postcard was mixed into the distribution of all participating iGEM teams’ postcards that was mailed to each of the 28 participating teams.
The front side of the postcard is shown below.
The text on the reverse side of our postcard reads:
Sophorolipids are non-toxic, biodegradable alternatives to current petrochemical-derived surfactants. Their anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-microbial activities may enable therapeutic use. The difficulty of systematically changing their structures to find structure-property relationships and the challenge of producing homogeneous molecules rather than mixtures of different products have barred their previous use in therapeutics. Our project aims to produce uniform sophorolipid products with control over the fatty acid structure. With genetic engineering, we can selectively repress active domains of the MFE-2 enzyme. This could enable the yeast to make uniform sophorolipids with desired fatty acid structures while limiting metabolic stress on the yeast. We will then investigate purified sophorolipids to define structure-biological property relationships. Ultimately, we aim to identify potent new sophorolipid therapeutic agents.
Team Franconia (Biological themed card game)
We collaborated with Team Franconia to design a sophorolipid card for their educational card game. Working from a template file provided by Team Franconia, we provided an image showing the sophorolipid structure and the explanatory text for the caption. Team Franconia will print our card as part of the game that their team will bring to the Giant Jamboree in Boston. Our sophorolipid card is shown below."

After I watched X-man, Heroes, Fantastic Four , glowing rabbits and stuff like that, I am impressed by science of genetics and molecular biology. Now, I am last year student in Molecular Biology and Genetics Deparment in ITU. Moreover, I do double major in Chemistry. I met iGEM and synthetic biology two years ago. After doing couple researches and reading articles , I had thought that it has a potential to human life better. My searches interests are Omics Sciences, Bio- and Nano- technology, System Biology, Cancer and of course Synthetic biology. I want to pursue my carrer in academic way (at least I want to take PhD.) Besides all, in my free time I would like to watch movies, hang out with friends, smoke waterpipe, walking the Istiklal Street."

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,", encouragingly, of those who wouldn't take the advice of their doctor, our treatment was favourite with just under half saying they would prefer the designed bacteria (48%), compared to 40% who would prefer antibiotics.
We had very similar feedback when we spoke to patients. During a visit to the Bedford Ward at the John Radcliffe Hospital, we spoke with one of the catheterised patients there called Mavis. She admitted to having had UTIs in the past, but said she had not contracted a UTI since having a catheter fitted. We found that patients like Mavis could end up using the same catheter for up to 10 weeks. This enforced the importance of being able to keep our bacteria alive for a sustained period of time. When we asked her about treating infection with bacteria, she said she would be happy to, if it had been recommended to her by a doctor. She said, in her view, it is not dissimilar to using antibiotics.
Return to nurses
During this visit we were able to talk to Laura Evans again, this time to ask questions specifically about our project.
Our project involves designing a catheter that prevents the formation of a biofilm on its surface. What do you think of this idea?
A catheter like that would be useful, but it depends on how long your catheter would work for. Patients can have a single catheter fitted for 3 months or longer. Catheters are also removed for other reasons, for example if they become blocked. Catheter blockage is a common issue for patients suffering from UTIs.
Both Laura’s and Mavis’ response regarding how long a catheter remains in place inspired us to research how we could keep our Solution bacteria alive, the results of which can be found in design. Jan Harris, Churchill Hospital, raised the issue that our solution does not tackle intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) and community UTIs. Jan made the point that UTIs are not just contracted through catheterisation, and it is important for us to also consider community based UTIs. IBCs and community UTIs are complex issues to solve but we have explored the potential of commensal bacteria as a treatment approach (See Commensal Bacteria ).
Feedback from doctors
""Years from now we will treat most infections with bacteria and not antibiotics.""

- This equation gives the % bound by activator as a function of activator concentration. - after Hill equation modification, the system behaves like a switch - In addition, we also need to model the diffusion of blood and GFP in the bacteria culture
Cell –free mechanism: - for hospital use, the blood must be processed through a cell-free system to give an accurate test result, as well as the bacteria to reduce the risk if they leak from the container ( after the cell-free process, the bacteria are not able to reproduce) - separate certain organelles from whole cells for further analysis of specific parts of cells - in the process, a tissue sample is first homogenised to break the cell membranes and mix up the cell contents - homogenization is intensive blending of mutually related substances or groups of mutually related substances to form a constant of different insoluble phases - homogenate is then subjected to repeated centrifugations - each time removing the pellet and increasing the centrifugal force - Separation is based on size and density, with larger and denser particles pelleting at lower centrifugal forces. In the separating order in actual application: Whole cells and nuclei; Mitochondria, lysosomes and peroxisomes; Microsomes (vesicles of disrupted endoplasmic reticulum); ribosomes and cytosol.
Filter/semi-permeable membrane for the blood cells: RBC: 7~8.5μm neutrophil: 10~12μm eosinophil: 10~15μm basophil: 10~12μm monocyte: 14~20μm lymphocyte: small: 6~8μm, medium9~12μm, large: 13~20μm taurocholic acid molecule roughly 0.4nm - therefore, if the hole diameter of the filter is set to be at about 2~5nm, all the blood cells can be filtered
Human practices (with help of LSE BIOS): A. why biosensors ? - possible to construct - has a potential market
- B. human practices 1. bio-safety - cell-free system to stop the bacteria from reproducing if there is a leakage of the sensor device - (unpredictable) mutation must be carefully prevented during the engineering part 2. bio-security - the access to DNA sequences and other genetic information must be controlled - “garage biologist” -"

Week 7
7.06.15
Goal: Test LDR with fresh dilution of coelenterazine & new Arduino Mega, determine if purification is necessary to elicit signal, and test fluorescence of the beads that were introduced into the supernatant of the spun down Luciferase (from 7/1).
Tested luminescence in the well of a TECAN plate.
Added coelenterazine in various concentrations to estimate approximate concentration needed.
Compared readings from purified proteins and culture by adding coelenterazine and measuring in TECAN machine.
The LDR was still not sensitive enough to read the luminescence from the culture.
Could see with the naked eye that the culture was giving off light, the LDR just couldn’t detect it.
Couldn’t make conclusions about concentration of coelenterazine or necessity of purification because we were not getting enough signal to quantify it.
7.08.15
Goal: Restreak TOP10 cells that contain fluorescent proteins
Restreaked cells with flourescent proteins.
Did an IPTG restart designed to induce the fluorescence of the cell in TOP10
7.09.15
Goal: Complete IPTG restart & quantify fluorescence of the cultures and purified proteins.
Did not complete the IPTG restart because the cultures did not grow properly overnight. Had an OD of 0.304, needed an OD of at least 0.6.
Yesterday's plate also did not grow properly. Only GFP had strong growth.
Started six new 5 mL Luciferase overnight cultures.

Tuebingen,2017,Team:Tuebingen#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," happy to join the European iGEM Meetup in Delft. Especially the new team members were delighted about the possibility to meet iGEM teams from all around Europe, to take a trip to a new country and to get in touch with the iGEM atmosphere. This event was a great platform for exchanging collaboration ideas, to see how other teams work and how to communicate ideas in front of other experts.
Figure 5: Michael, Lukas, Mirjam, Vic und Madeleine at the European iGEM Meetup in Delft.
Furthermore in summer, we invited the new iGEM team Stuttgart to Tübingen. Since this team is participating in the iGEM competition for the first time in 2017, we invited them to share experiences about iGEM in general, team organization, cooperation with the university and lab equipment. Most members of the team Stuttgart have an engineering background while they are less experienced in lab work. Since we have a lot of experience in the wet lab but are not that experienced in biotechnology, a fusion of our teams would be a perfect complementation. We are excited to see what will happen in the future.

The pSB4K5 was then run on a gel at 110 V for 30 minutes, together with a DNA ladder (Benchtop 1kb DNA ladder) and uncut pSB4K5. In order to make the bands visible on the gel, Blue/orange loading dye was added to the uncut and cut pSB4K5 samples. We looked at the gel using a UV lamp, and cut out the band of the cut pSB4K5 at approximately 1700 kb. Gel purification was then done with a yield of 2.08 ng/µl.
The restricted CsgEFG was column purified using the Wizard SV, gel and PCR clean-up system following protocol with a yield of 1.32 ng/µl.
28/07/2015
Plasmid isolation for CsgA_GFP and I13521 (RFP) in triplicate with the goal to restrict RFP for ligation and confirm the insert for CsgA_GFP. 5 mL of the bacterial cultures were used.
The restrictions of I13521 and CsgA_GFP have been performed EcoRI-HF and SpeI-HF.The restriction has been incubated for 1 hour at 37°C in PCR with final heat shock.
The CsgA has been put on the gel on the left side, RFP on the right. A size of 2400 bp indicates failure of ligation of CsgA with GFP. RFP was confirmed and cut out of the gel.
The DNA constructs made on 22/07/2015 (3.1-6.3) were purified out of the gel. The next step is ligation in a ratio of 3:1 insert:vector. During the ligation, different samples are ligated. The CsgEFG_pSB4K5 and the constructs described in the table above.
Ligation has been incubated for 3 hours at 16°C and the final heat shock, the samples were hold for 6 minutes at 62°C. The improvement in the protocol is the fact that molar ratios are used instead of mass ratios!
Another step performed was the transformation into CaCl2 competent cells. Before the protocol could be followed, the cells were thawed for 20 minutes on ice. After the thawing, 8 µl of"

Perform a research like this, we have to decide what is our subject? HSiTAIWAN propose Newspaper first, and we thought that magazine and iGEM wiki can also be included. Thus, we choose 3 types of media as our material.
Newspaper: We choose the top 3 most frequently read Newspaper in Taiwan. According to report in Newlens(https://www.thenewslens.com/article/20673), Liberty Times Net(自由時報), AppleDaily(蘋果日報) and United Daily News(聯合報) account for 46.6%, 46.6% and 29.3% market share. We go to the Newspaper website, copy and paste the past 6 months gene-tech related news to a file. The item “illustration or infographics” will be include newspaper.
Magazine: We choose Science American(科學人), Common Health Magazine(康健雜誌), Newton(牛頓) and Business Weekly(商業週刊) as our subjects. Science American and Newton are two prestigious magazines in Taiwan. Common Health Magazine is famous for reporting health-related information. Business Weekly is the second popular magazine in Taiwan.
iGEM wiki: We analysis best iGEM wiki and nominated for best wiki from 2011 to 2015. There are 31 websites in total. We choose the “project”, “project overview”, “at a glance”, “project description”, “at a glance” or “overview” parts to analysis.
Research Approach
In examining the reporting practices, social scientists apply sufficiency and understandability to make the research a qualitative one[1][2].
Sufficiency is the most important part of science communication, no statement can be made without sufficient information, and only by presenting adequate information to the audience is the audience able to make rational decision and choice. On the other hand, article with low sufficiency of information is not what scientists, journalist and those engaged in science communication hope to compose. Science news often focus on latest research, and put less attention on presenting"

This shell encloses RuBisCo, the shell associated protein (CsoS2), and the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CsoS3). In the proteobacteria Halothiobacillus neapolitanus, these genes are clustered into the cso operon.

For the Calvin cycle to proceed, energy in the form of ATP and electrons carried by NADPH are required. The photosystems are complexes in photosynthesising organisms that can supply this by photophosphorylation. To engineer E. coli to do photosynthesis, 13 genes is needed for the assembly of chlorophyll a and 17 genes for the assembly of photosystem II, which needs to be heterogeneously expressed. An alternative process in which a diverse array of phototrophic bacteria and archaea harvest energy from light, is through a retinal-containing protein called proteorhodopsin that catalyses the light-activated proton efflux across the cell membrane, and thereby drive ATP synthesis.

a. We reviewed our team goals and possible directions concerning liver cells.
b. When we discussed about using plants and moss to remediate lands, Kobe pointed out that he thinks that a more practical way for remediation will be by using yeast (Spray them). Spraying can work in forests where we can't grow any plants (too dark and competitive). Moreover he mentioned that choosing the right yeast could be an interesting path (With the right kill switch).

The fourth sequence BBa_K1763007 is our honeybee silk sequence with a T7 promoter upstream for effective protein expression in bacterial strains containing t7 polymerase.
The fifth sequence, BBa_K1763015 is our honeybee silk sequence+sfGFP with a T7 promoter and RBS upstream that can be used in bacterial strains that contain T7 polymerase.
Protein Expression
We have just finished our first round of honey bee silk expression from BBa_K1763001
Here is our first attempt at protein expression along with the gel.
Fig. 1 Expected size of product is 40.0 kDA
Unfortunately the purified protein that we see on the gel (should be in next to last lane on the right) doesn't seem to be the right size.
We will try again using a T7 promoter and a slightly modified protein expression and purification protocol.
Here is our most recent attempt at expressing honeybee silk protein and the SDS PAGE results. We see a band at the expected size of 40 kDA!
What we are working on now
We are currently optimizing our honeybee silk expression protocol. We are getting a band at the right size (40 kDa) on our SDS PAGE gels, but there is a fair amount of contamination. See example below (The purified product is in lane 7).
Fig. 1 Expected size of product is 40 kDa (lane 6 and 7)). Lane 8 is BSA protein positive control, and lane 1 is Biorad dual color ladder. From lane 1-8 S1,F2,F3,S2,Final product 8/7, Final Product 7/29,BSA positive control, (see table)
We are optimizing out cell lysis and purification protocol in the hopes of getting higher yield and a more pure protein product.
In terms of producing fibers, we have ""purified"" honeybee product dissolved in SDS ready to go. We are waiting on the protein concentrators to arrive so that we can have a concentrated enough dope for spinning into fibers.
We hope that the protein concentration will also help to get rid of some of the contaminating proteins that are under the 30 kDa cutoff.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi. We simplify this process as the graph shows below.
As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where"

AP-2
Activating protein 2 (AP-2) is a family of transcription factors being closely related (AP-2alpha, -beta and –gamma).  AP-2 proteins are activated through homo or heterodimerisation and bind to GC-rich motives in their target genes [24] . The genes both positively and negatively regulated by AP-2 are manifold.  These genes are mainly involved in developmental processes. Mutation of AP-2-beta can lead to the Char syndrome [25] . AP-2 transcription factors regulate also genes playing an important role in cell proliferation and apoptosis [24] . In this context AP-2alpha is thought to act in a tumor suppressive manner in breast tissues [24] .
[TOP]
CREB
CAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) is a transcription factor which binds to cAMP response elements (consensus sequence 5'- TGACGTCA -3' [26] ) occurring in many promoter sequences. CREB is activated by MAP kinase cascade but also through the cAMP signalling pathway. Homodimerisation leads finally to an activated complex and binding to DNA occurs via a leucine zipper domain (s. Picture).  Many genes are regulated by CREB including the neurotrophin Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, c-fos and some neuropeptides. CREB is thought to be involved in processes like long-term memory [27] and drug addiction [28] .  CREB plays also an important role in cell survival [29] .
[TOP]
NF-Y
Nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), also called core binding factor (CBF) is a transcription factor which binds to the consensus sequence CCAAT [31] occurring in about 25% of eukaryotic genes [30] . NF-Y is involved in the transcription regulation of several genes including HSP70, albumin, FGF-4, α-collagen, β-actin and several others [31] . NF-Y is a heterotrimeric complex and is evolutionary extremely conserved. It was also shown that NF-Y plays a major role in cellular senescence [30] .

Vitamin D receptor
Vitamin D receptor (VDR), also known as calcitriol receptor, is a transcription factor belonging to the family of steroid receptors and to the super family of nuclear receptors. The VDR has a very high affinity towards calcitriol (1α,25(OH)2-cholecalciferol)"

Hello! I’m Sterling Strmel, a senior International Affairs major. I joined iGEM, because I was interested in the importance that iGEM places on human-centered design and in the potential for collaborations between synthetic biology and the social sciences. I was also excited about the chance to work with students from other disciplines and explore a new field that I didn’t know much about! Something random about me is that I know German, French and even a little bit of ASL (American Sign Language).

Human Practices Team Member - Business
I’m a junior Information Systems major. I joined iGEM because I'm passionate about science and I wanted to challenge the status quo of what's expected from business students at FSU. I believe that disruptive technologies like synthetic biology are the future of new growth in global economies with the potential of a huge societal impact. Fun fact...my favorite food is Sushi and sport is football!

Incubate the whole flask for 10 min on ice. Collect the cells by centrifugation for 10 min at 4°C and 5,000 rpm. Re-suspend the cell in 80 mL of ice-cold TB buffer and incubate them for 10 min on ice. Collect the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 5,000 rpm.
Re-suspend the cells in 20 mL of ice-cold TB buffer. Add DMSO to a final concentration of 7% (1.4 mL) by gently shaking the falcon tube.
Transfer 0.2 mL aliquots into labelled Eppendorf reaction tubes and freeze the cells in liquid nitrogen. Store the cells at -80°C. The volume of the pre-culture strongly depends on the E. coli strain. Using DH5α, it is recommended to use 4 mL pre-culture and inoculate at 8 a.m. Nex day around 10 a.m. this strain should have reached an OD600 between 0.5 and 0.6. If you use the strain XL1-Blue, you will need less cells and it is sufficient to inoculate the SOB medium around lunchtime.
Test transformation of the new competent E. coli cells

LINK Anton V. Bryksin and Ichiro Matsumura. (2010) Overlap extension PCR cloning: a simple and reliable way to create recombinant plasmids. BioTechniques, Vol. 48, No. 6, pp. 463–465
Because this method is standard over all of our parts, we can use it for high throughput cloning. For example, if we had 96 parts in our standard, we can fill a 96 well PCR plate and run this program, digest with Dpn1, then transform all of these parts. This would about 3-4 hours, with the main amount of time being the PCR reaction. So in the case of chimeric protein design, if we wanted to screen a number of cloned structures configurations to find one that folded the way we wanted it to, we could use this method to rapidly clone and test a series of trials.
We can liken this to crystallography, which can be done at high throughput by robots.
An RFC is in the process of being submitted for this standard.
Standard Cloning
The other method of cloning made use of the cut sites found in our insert and a few restriction enzymes. Early on we noted the BioBrick standard caused a very problematic frame-shifts within the scar when ligating 2 or more parts. We tried to circumvent the problem by adding 1 or 2 nucleotides onto our DNA sequence to fix the frame but found this to be tedious due to the fact that this varied based on the part we wanted to ligate.
Therefore we started doing research into other assembly standards to see if any of them alleviated the problem. We judged the merits and flaws of each one (a list of the assembly standards considered can be found here ). What we searched for was a standard that would avoid frame-shifts and nonsense mutations when doing protein fusion, avoid N-terminal destabilization signals and dam methylation sites and preserve most of the restriction enzymes from the original BBa standard.
Considering these reasons, we chose to switch our prefixes and suffixes to Tom Knight’s BBa 2 standard that allowed seamless in-frame ligations between multiple sequences of successive DNA. This change resulted in only 1 restriction enzyme (Xba1 to Nhe1) that differed from original BBa standard therefore providing the flexibility we needed to simultaneously work with both standards. For ligation, we used T4 ligase. A pictorial representation of the BBa 2 standard can be seen below:
