WET LAB
Transformation of competent cells with Bristol 2010 - BBa_K381001.
Electrophoresis to BBa_K672000 – RENBO (sent to the registry) + RENBO (Ligation Product).
During this procedure we couldn’t get a good picture of the dna in the transiluminator because there wasn’t enough dna in the samples. We are going to redo this procedure.
Experiment Design
We designed the experiments we  are going to do with the three BioBricks used (Bristol 2010 - BBa_K381001, GaTech 2010 – BBa_K410000, UTP-Panama 2011 – BBa_K672000).
We chose 4 temperatures:
• 5-10°C
• 10-20°C
• 20-30°C
• 37°C
These temperatures were selected so we could evaluate the response to cold shock in various ranges of our BioBricks. Since the lab equipments we had available couldn’t reach temperatures between 11-20°C this temperature was not used during the experience. Finally, the lab equipment allowed us to make the experiments in: 37°C, 23°C and 8°C.
We also chose 3 different Growth Media:
• Saline Solution
• Liquid LB
• Minimal Media
These growth medias where selected to evaluate the response of our BioBricks in different metabolic pathways. According to the characterization made by Team Edinburgh 2009, the Pyear promoter (BBa_K216005) used by Bristol 2010, works best in minimal media and complex media with a nitrate concentration of 40mM. Using this reference, we added 40mM of KNO3 to every growth media in the different"

Healthy Recipes
   This year, we organized a collaboration project names ""Share your Healthy recipes."" We uploaded the following prompt on iGEM collaboration page and e-mailed more than sixty iGEM teams:
Greetings, iGEM-ers!
Do you enjoy cooking? Have you ever noticed the similarity between cooking and experimenting—tea spoons to pipettes, seasoning to buffers, and recipes to protocols? For those who enjoy both cooking and experimenting, you should keep your eyes open to this collaboration project.
This year, our team is working to create a probiotics based solution to diabetes. In doing so, we are teaching the male elderlies who can cook how to cook diabetes-friendly, healthy recipes. We are going to create a handbook that contains healthy recipes to give out to these elderlies. Granted, we wanted to collect recipes from iGEM teams all around the world, ranging from Asian cuisines to American dishes to any tasty food that you want to share! Our team will create and upload cooking videos for some of the best recipes.
If you want to participate, please send a one paragraph recipe with ingredients and instructions as well as the photo of the final products. The menu can vary from anything such as soup to probiotics yogurt recipe!
   As a response, many iGEM teams from all around the world shared their country's unique recipes that are both delicious and healthy. Namely, ICT-Mumbai and VIT Vellore from India, Nawi-GRAZ from Austria, TecCEM from Mexico, and Lambert GA from Atlanta generously donated their detailed recipes and photos. We gathered these recipes in a handbook titles ""iGEM protocols... for diabetes friendly recipes"" that showcase detailed methods and materials for some scrumptious meals. You can access to the recipe from the following pdf file:

Mike the Microbe
   We collaborated with Team US AFRL CarrollHS  by participating in a project named Mike the Microbe. According to Team US AFRL CarrollHS, this project is one of the various forms of “Flat Stanley.” ”Flat Stanley” is Jeff Brown’s book, that one can connect with others by sending a paper ""Flat Stanley"" (microbe) across the world. “Mike the Microbe” is Team US AFRL’s own version"

This week we also planned our experiments for PHB extraction. We plan to make a 5 g/L PHB-co-HV suspension in water to be sonicated. The granule size of PHB-co-HV sample we received from PolyFerm was too large for our purposes because we expect our secreted PHB to be in the 20-60 nm range (Rahman, Linton, Hatch, Sims & Miller, 2013). To make a representative mixture from which we would extract the PHB, we plan to dilute the sonicated PHB-co-HV suspension with synthetic feces supernatant to make a 3.5 g/L mixture, which is within the range of concentrations we might expect to be secreted (Rahman, Linton, Hatch, Sims & Miller, 2013)). We want to test 8 different conditions:

The HKUST iGEM team 2013 is composed of 15 dedicated undergraduate students. Come and know more about them!
Derek
Derek
Derek is a first year student from Biochemistry undergraduate. He is interested in doing research and want to explore his strength on it.
Funny random things:
ohh did I use the wrong pipette?
Raul
Raul
Don't let Raul's severe-looking appearences and intimidating silence deceive you: he is the nicest guy on earth! As soon as he gets to know you, he will start taking care of you as if you were a little brother/sister! His great passions are biology, chemistry and all  that has to do with those fields (don't get him started on synthetic biology!!). His bright future defenitely lies within the walls of a lab!
Funny random things:
HE IS A PRO AT TERRIBLE KNOCK-KNOCK JOKES!!! (Don't ever let him tell you one; if you are a normal person, you'll probably remain traumatized for the rest of your life).
Astrid
Astrid
Astrid is currently in her 2nd year in HKUST, and studying Biochemistry and Cell Biology starting from this year. Astrid works in sub group 2 and mostly does the inoculation, which might be too many times until she got a new nickname, ""Inoculation girl""! Great, is it? For now, Astrid still has no clear plan at all after leaving UST, however she absolutely wants to go for further study or find something to do.
Funny random things:
** Astrid's sub group conversation. **
How to do the gel photo?
- Take your phone out.
- Unlock your phone.
- Choose the camera function button.

Thermo-regulator
We thought it’s hard to assembled 6 fragments for Gibson assembly. So we tried to do it in three steps, that is assembling seg 1, seg 2, seg 3 first, then the seg 4 and seg 5, finally the plasmid would be assembled.
We didn’t get positive results, although the PCR identification before transformation is positive.
InterLab
8.2
Qikai Qinstartedtoadd Ribo J intothethree InterLab devices.
Jinyang Liang transformed BBa_I0270 and BBa_R0040 into E. coli K-12 DH5-alpha.
8.3
Qikai Qin transformed the three devices with Ribo J into E. coli K-12 DH5-alpha. The first step is ligation of Ribo J and BBa_I13504, then the promoter was ligated in the front.
8.5
The sequencing results showed that only one device (BBa_J23117 + Ribo J + BBa_I13504) was correct.
Dry Lab Overview
(Theory Part) With the ftnA’s stochastic model established, Weiyan Chen calculated its intrinsic noise from which we found ftnA’s expression amount was stable. It means that the heating effect can be really stable in a long time interval and supported our temperature distribution model well.
(Device Part) “Captor” was under producing!
Week 17 (August10–August16)
Wet Lab Overview
Xihan Zhang, Qikai Qin, Weiyan Chen and Renjie Shang participated in summit hosted by PKU iGEM in Beijing.
We visited Changqian Cao in Beijing, and we are told that it’s better to choose ftnA because the chassis is E.coli. We additionally discussed the project schedule and finally decided to abandon the other circuits.
We decided to have a collaboration with NYU_Shanghai.
Mag-receiver
Qingdian Mu did parallel experiments as follows.
We changed the project before PCR identifications were completed down.
Pqe80l was proved worked well. This week Jie Lian and Renjie Shang incubated bacteria with 7.125mM ferrous sulfate. However the unexpected positive results were observed in most of the control groups. We started to suspect the mag-attraction test. Jie Lian concentrated the ferritin purification product with Amicon Ultra-15ml (Millipore) and went on with Native-page and Prussian blue staining. No positive result.

We Ran enzyme efficiency experiment with the same specifications as on 28-06-2010 but omitting BsaI-HF from the experiment because BsaI, BbsI and BfuAI appear to be the best of the enzymes.  Also we ran the experiment with 10 Units of each enzyme not 20 Units.
Miniprepped liquid cultures of ccdB Bbs A/B' # 15 and 20 and of ccdB BsaB/A'#6, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 5 (which did grow on both Kan/Chlor and Chlor plates, so it is a positive control for the incorrect plasmid) grown 29-06-2010 .  The concentrations of the minipreps were between 200 and 400ng/mu;L and the curves did not show contamination.   Digested approximately 500ng of minipreps with EcoRI and PstI with the following recipe:

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html," to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some"

Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#testing#project#hprac#1_-_-_TEXT.html," interactions with environmental groups, public officials in water quality management, and industrial groups, we encountered several important questions that were not built into existing CEA framework. Assessing the suitability of a synthetic biology-based device extends far beyond practical environmental risk assessment, into regulatory and economic concerns. The Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues (PCSBI) released a report in December 2010 regarding important considerations for the ethics of synthetic biology projects, not all of which are encompassed by the CEA framework. In addition, as we approach field-deployability, the economics of the device become essential to assessing its viability as a solution to real-world water monitoring needs. These ideas are further explored in the remainder of this section.

Sequences are under arabinose promoter.  These BioBricks aimed at first to study the orientation of CpxR's homodimerization by observing the IFP signal measured from the four strains under stress. We discovered that only the orientations with both parts of the split are at the C terminal of the CpxR lead to an IFP signal when cells are stressed.

2. When the disadvantages sugar brings all disappear, our project opens the gate of  sugar indulgence.   
 
3. If our project succeeds and is released to the public, the quantity demanded of sugar may increases uncontrollably, which will cause sugarcane-farmer exploitations.

Visit to Chung Mei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
Introduction
Chung Mei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has a long history in medical production and marketing. Established in 1926, Chung Mei provides several medical drugs for patients or sub-healthy people. Ｍore specifically, its services includes a wide range of over-the-counter medicines and consumer healthcare products.
Motivation
During our last time’s meet-up with Doctor Chu in (FIRDI), we discussed our design of modeling with him . However, the main research in FIRDI is about upstream technology and he is not proficient in the design of products, so he suggested that we may get what we need from medicine producers. With contacts and preparations, we successfully paid a visit to the CEO Lin and the manager in Chung Mei.
Highlights
We should choose the lactobacillus which is low colonization rate, thus we do not need to add suicide circuit to our lactobacillus. 
It is important that choosing the good food additions for lactobacillus.
We need to make sure that our product is acid proof but will melt in our  intestine.
Conclusion
After having discussion with the CHUNG  MEI’s CEO Mr. Lin, we thought that is too hard to model our product. Therefore, we will not temporally take modeling into consideration. Furthermore, they also gave us some useful ideas. we can choose the low colonization rate lactobacillus and every kind of bacterium likes different parts of intestine, so we have to focus on whether our lactobacillus grow up at the front part of the intestine. To sum up, we can sure that our lactobacillus can absorb the maximum amount of sugar.
Market Analysis
 
Since there are also many products used to lose weight, we search it on the internet and use the table to compare the differences between the medicine(Only two kinds of medicine, orlistat and lorcaserin, were allowed by government to use to lose weight in Taiwan now)and goods(Here, we choose the chitin and liposuction).

iGEM, Efficiency, Environment and Enjoyment
During the entire iGEM project, we adhered to the four elements,        iGEM, efficiency, environment and enjoyment. When the project is drawing to a close,         we tease out our project management experience according          to them and put it online as reference for more people.
iGEM
Since our project is for participating in iGEM,          we always emphasized the leading position of iGEM in our project.           We set up study group specifically for iGEM project. Independent of the working group,            they worked on synthetic biology. Although some of their results turned out to be useless,             they played a critical role in every phase of our project, such as the decision of our final project,              the optimization of functions of the software and teaching other team members               not majoring in biology some biological knowledge. A group focusing on the subject guarantees                that the whole project runs smoothly on track. The experience above applies to project of any subject.                 Just replace “iGEM” with your own word.
Efficiency
In any project, efficiency is always a significant factor.          During our project, we took regular and necessary methods,           such as wholesome team management system (team leader, team manager,            group supervisor) and explicit regulations. In addition,             we managed our team in an innovative way—electronic platform.              All work plans are put on electronic notebook shared by all team members.               We also built a platform for team members to report their working achievements periodically.                Last but not least, we established a GitLab ourselves accessible to all team members,                 which avoided the detriment of environment caused by paper-based platform                  (this will be mentioned again later).
Environment
Environmental protection is one of the most compelling problems nowadays.   We kept thinking about this while proceeding the project. As mentioned above"
Tokyo_Tech,2015,Team:Tokyo Tech#Experiment#Overview of fim inversion system_-_-_TEXT.html," fim switch(wild-type)
Fig. 3-3-2-2. The overview of the fim switch(wild-type)
We designed the fim switch(wild-type). The sequence of our fim switch(wild-type) is derived from that of a wild-type.  The fim switch(wild-type) has a sigma 70 promoter which functions constitutively.  We submitted two parts, one in the [ON] state ( BBa_K1632004 ) and the other in [OFF] state ( BBa_K1632005 ).
We confirmed the inversion of our fim switch(wild-type) by FimB and by FimE.  Considering the experimental results, fimB(wild-type) inverts the fim switch(wild-type) in both [ON] state to [OFF] state and  [OFF] state to [ON] state with approximately equal probability.  Similarly FimE(wild-type) inverts the fim switch(wild-type) predominantly in [ON] state to [OFF] state. In order to confirm inversion more precisely, we also show the percentage of [ON] state with induction by arabinose and without induction. Also we show inversion in the level of DNA sequencing.
In summary, establishing a tripartite relationship between the fim switch and FimB/FimE is an unprecedented achievement in iGEM.
2.1.1. Result of the FimB/FimE assay on the fim switch(wild-type)
Fig.3-3-2-3. New plasmids we constructed to confirm the function of fim switch
The fim switch is inverted by two recombinases, FimB(wild-type) ( BBa_K1632010 ) and FimE(wild-type) ( BBa_K1632011 ). These proteins have distinct activities. FimB inverts the fim switch in both [ON] state to [OFF] state and [OFF] state to [ON] state direction with approximately equal probability. On the other hand, FimE inverts the fim switch predominantly in [ON] state to [OFF] state (McClain, 1991).
In order to assay the function of FimB(wild-type) and FimE(wild-type) for fim switch(wild-type), we added a GFP coding sequence on the downstream of the fim switch.The fim switch[default ON](wild-type)_gfp ( BBa_K1632007 ) emitts fluorescence when expressed, while the fim switch [default OFF](wild-type)_gfp( BB"

Professor Medvedik had transformed our UV+pSB1C3 ligations over the weekend on chlor 50ug/mL and 150ug/mL plates. They both grew colonies. I picked six colonies from the 150ug/mL plate and restreaked them onto another plate and let them grow overnight.   I also took those six colonies and put them in 200uL of water, vortexed that, and then took out 20uL of each into PCR tubes. 2.5uL of iGem VF2 and 2.5uL of iGem VR 10mM primers were used. As a control, one of the pSB1A3 plasmids with an approximately 1Kb insert that the De Novo team made was also used with these primers. The PCR was run using PCR program #500. 5uL of each of these were run on a gel with a Versa ladder. See ""Gel of UV+pSB1C3 using sequencing primers""  I inoculated colonies 1 and 3 of HSP+pACYC184 in 5mL LB so we can do a midi prep on them tomorrow. 7.4uL of 34mg/mL stock concentration chlor was used to give a 50ug/mL concentration. It was put in the shaker at 3PM and left overnight.     6/26/14:  Glycerol stocks of 500uL 60% glycerol and 500uL of the HSP+pACYC184 colony (one for colony #1 and one for colony #3) were made and put in the -80 freezer.  A gel was run of the digest from Monday of GFP+pBR322 and UV+pACYC184 cut with XhoI and KpnI. The results again appeared to show that the two plasmids had been mixed up.

It is thought that the lack of uniformity of the coating won't give the expected results in matters of biocompatibility and conductivity.

Figure 28: Scanning electron microscopy of PEDOT:PSS-coated membrane
PEDOT:Cl and PEDOT:Ts coating
The color of the alumina oxide membranes changed radically from light grey to black with green shades for PEDOT:Cl and blue shades for PEDOT:Ts , suggesting the deposit of the polymers on the membranes, as expected. Scanning electron microscopy reveals a uniform thickening of the membrane's surface, suggesting a uniform PEDOT:Cl coating of the membrane. We expect better results from the PEDOT:Cl-coated and PEDOT:Ts-coated membranes than PEDOT:PSS-coated ones.

Conductivity
The membranes used in our system should possess good electric conductive capabilities for nerve influx conduction. The goal here is to evaluate the conductivity of the membranes .
Figure 32: Hand-made PDMS well chip
The conductivity of the membranes was measured on a self-made device . It consists of a culture well made of PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane), with a membrane filter at its bottom and a platinum wire linking the conductive membrane filter with the exterior.
Platinum wire
As in the end we were going to measure the conductivity of the system biofilm+membrane+platinum wire, we wanted to simplify the measurements and neglect the impact of the platinum wire . Function generator was set on sine. The physical quantities measured here are Eg, the generator's tension amplitude and Ep, the voltage difference between the two extremities of a platinum wire. the quantity calculated here is 20*log(Ep/Eg) for different frequencies.
Results
Figure 33: Conductivity of a platinum wire for different frequencies
Interpretation
Voltage difference calculated is extremely low, indicating a very good conductivity for the platinum wires, so its resistance (in low frequencies) could be neglected at first glance when it would be used in PDMS well chips. Resistance increases in higher frequencies, because of the skin-effect in metals"
TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,". aureus. However, both teams relied on cell lysis to free the                         lysostaphin. For our application, this approach is not suitable as releasing bacterial cell                         lysate into the wound will only act as food for the bacteria causing the infection.                         Moreover, cell lysis does not offer a solution for sustained release of lysostaphin. The                         solution to this problem is to make lysostaphin secretable. This will allow sustained release                         of the active enzyme and ensures that the lysostaphin reaching the wound is of high purity.
Enabling secretion
Different strategies for secretion of recombinantly expressed proteins exist (13) .                     To minimize the burden on our modified E. coli bacteria that are already expressing MpIBP adhesin,                     secretion of lysostaphin should use the same type I secretion system. To achieve this,                      the C-terminal HlyA signal peptide must be fused to lysostaphin. In designing the construct encoding for such a fusion protein,                      we first codon optimized the HIT-Harbin 2012 truncated lysostaphin construct and fused it to HlyA via a thrombin linker.                      Secretion of lysostaphin circumvents the use of cell lysis, improving the biokiller device developed by HIT-Harbin 2012 .                     The thrombin linker was chosen with other iGEM projects in mind, as it can be readily cleaved by the thrombin enzyme. For protein detection and                      purification purposes, we added a His-tag C-terminal to the HlyA domain.
After assembly of this construct, protein expression and functional experiments in collaboration with the PAMM foundation,                      the regional center for infectious diseases and pathology of South East Brabant in the Netherlands, were performed. To prove the functionality and secretion of the lysostaphin in collaboration with PAMM, we                      devised a number of experiments. First, cell lysate was tested on S. aureus to show the functionality of lysostaphin. This                     experiment was followed by testing the of the medium, to see whether lysostaphin is being secreted by the cells. Finally, as ultimate                     test of the secretion and functionality of the lysostaphin, co-cultures were grown with S. aureus and our induced bacteria. All                      these experiments were performed with Streptococcus agalactiae as a negative control, a Gram positive bacteria similar to S. aureus, but not                      susceptible to lysostaphin. The HlyA domain itself is also used as a control, to eliminate"

Project Overview
In synthetic biology, while safety is often one of the largest concerns to the field as a whole, there is a lack of standardized designs that can easily be added to a construct without affecting its function. Our project seeks to remedy this situation by  creating a standardized safety switch which allows synthetic biologists to easily and effectively knock out a specific gene of interest when it is no longer required.
Our project could potentially have potential uses in both single and multicellular organisms, and for different applications - including but not limited to bioremediation, therapeutics and biosensors.
Our construct consists of three modules:
A Sensing module to receive and amplify a signal
A Time Control module to give the Sensing module time to amplify the signal before knocking out the gene of interest
A Recombination module to produce a recombinase which will separate the gene of interest from the origin of replication
Fig. 1 Domilox Design Overview
The first module in our construct is the Sensing module. The purpose of this module is to respond to the concentration of AHL in the cell and amplify the amount of AHL as a signal for further modules of the construct by using a positive feedback loop which amplifies an initial concentration of AHL and allows for quorum sensing because AHL can diffuse through the cell membrane into other cells.
The second module in our construct is the Time Control module. The purpose of this module is to produce a time delay in responding to the AHL signal inside the cell and to control the translation of two repressors downstream the sensing promoter in order to turn on the expression of Cre recombinase, which is necessary for the recombination reactions in the Recombination module. In transducing the signal through the Time Control module instead of directly passing it to the Recombination module, we seek to allow the Sensing module sufficient time to amplify the AHL signal with its positive feedback loop which would allow for more effective quorum sensing when the AHL diffuses into surrounding cells.
The final module in our construct"
Rice,2016,Team:Rice#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," to predict the effects of the selection of promoters on the final production of violacein, we decided to find a way to characterize promoters first. To simplify the computation, we used the promoter strength as a single standard to characterize the promoters. Moreover, we assumed the degradation rate of proteins only depends on the growth rate of E.coli. Then,  every enzyme has the same degradation rate. The bacteriophage T7 promoter has  been widely used for protein expression and purification (Jones et al., 2013),  so we used data of five mutant T7 promoters to create a proof-of-concept model.  If this model was functional, we could implement the same modeling technique to the promoters we were working with.The five mutant T7 promoters have distinct  promoter strength over time after induction. The experimental data from the   literature are shown in the figure below (Jones et al., 2013).
The first step of our model is to describe the rate of change of enzymes based on promoter strength. Here we assumed that the enzyme production rate is directly proportional to strength of the promoter. Therefore, we were able to use a mass-action kinetics equation of promoters to describe the enzyme concentration. The equation is shown below:
In this equation, Ai is the concentration of enzyme i, ki­ is the production rate of each  enzyme i, kd is the degradation rate of all enzymes, and t is time. By solving this equation, we derived the equation of enzyme concentration against time.
Since we assumed that the promoter strength is proportional to the promoter concentration, we would use the equation to fit our data using least squares method (Fig. 1).
Figure 1. Linear regressions fitted to normalized fluorescence vs time. The circles represent data from Jones et al., 2013. The solid lines are our regression lines. The colors indicate with which promoters the circles and lines correspond.
In general, the regression lines are able to capture the change of strength of each enzyme over time. In this way, the parameters are determined. The table below lists the parameter values.
Table 1. Parameters realted to promoter strength and degradation of molecules. In the table, ki­ (i = 1,2,3,4,5) are the production rate coefficients of promoter I (i = 1,2,3,4,5), and kd is the degradation rate coefficient of all promoters.
2. Modeling the Steady-state Violacein Yield
After we finished the regression model of each promoter, we created a second model to describe the violacein biosynthetic pathway. The pathway (Fig. 2"

Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.

Stanford-Brown,2015,Team:Stanford-Brown#bioHYDRA_-_-_TEXT.html," and undergoing colony PCR, we found that certain colonies seem to contain our part, which was confirmed by sequencing. Below is some data showing differential absorption between our control (aeBlue-) and our two samples which contain the insert (aeBlue+), using a spectrophotometer.
Pic 5. Absorption spectra of our transformed spores (aeBlue+) and wild type spores (aeBlue-).
While absorbance at 597 nm (characteristic to aeBlue ) does not show, there is a higher overall absorbance despite having the same spore concentration. Further testing is being done to determine the cause of this absorbance.
We also undertook a cellulose binding assay using scanning electron microscopy. We used four samples:
1. Wild type spores without a PBS wash
2. Spores with our contstruct without a PBS wash
3. Wild type spores with a PBS wash
4. Spores with our contstruct with a PBS wash
All spore samples were diluted to the same concentration of 10^9 spores/ml
Here are our results:
Fig. 6 a. Wild type spores without a PBS wash (35 cells). b. Wild type spores with a PBS wash (10 cells). c. Spores with our construct without a PBS wash (463 cells). d. Spores with our construct with a PBS wash(93 cells). e. Graphical representation of cells remaining on each sample.
We can see that there is not only a net difference between washing and not washing the cellulose. But even more importantly, we can see that our construct yields a greater amount of spores adhering to the cellulose. These pictures were taken as representative of each sample, and thus these preliminary cell counts are accurate enough to show a statistical difference between cells that contain our construct and cells that do not. A PBS wash should get rid of all cells on the cellulose, but we can see that our CIPA+ spores are able to remain on the cellulose despite this wash, whereas the wild type CIPA- spores are almost fully washed out. This shows that our construct works.
Future Goals : From our work and the work done by Chen et al. , we know that synthetic HYDRAs function and can produce a large amount of force (10MJ/cm^3) [1]. Next steps would include building a biological HYDRA. While we have started to characterize our part, further tests would need to be done. We would need to evaluate why the spores do not show a distinct blue color from its aeBlue domain. Then, to better"

Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the isolation of pSB1C3 plasmids containing our three expression cartridges [Tef2PROM-CaXMT1-Adh1TER], [Tef1PROM-CaMXMT1-Adh1TER] and [Tef2PROM-CaDXMT1-Adh1TER]. After the isolation of these plasmids, we will perform a preparative digest with suitable enzymes, to generate the ""caffeine synthesis device"".
Operational sequence:
The plasmid isolation was done as previously described. Elution was carried out by using 40µl of elution buffer heated up to 37°C and incubating for 1 minute before the final centrifugation.
Afterwards, the concentration was determined with NanoDrop:
pSB1C3_[Tef2PROM-CaXMT1-Adh1TER]:  222,6 ng/µl
pSB1C3_[Tef1PROM-CaMXMT1-Adh1TER]: 180,3 ng/µl

Oxford,2014,Team:Oxford#topsecretPEpage_-_-_TEXT.html," possibility of 'garbage biology' (DIY home synthetic biology) may become a more popular, widespread hobby in the future - increased accessibility would make regulations which are in place far more difficult to enforce in practice.
15th August 2014 - Round 2
For the second focus group, we decided to produce a brief informative presentation giving an overview of synthetic biology, its pros and cons, and an outline of our project and aims. Also included were some 'mythbusters' directed at addressing the misconceptions we came across during the first focus group.
We hoped that comparison of the results from the group with the benefit of this information would help us to establish which concerns are legitimate and which are alleviated by greater understanding and communication.
With this group, the focus of discussion shifted from the potential problems with biotechnology, to ways in which these could be addressed.
Conclusions
With both groups, there appeared to be a very wide range in the level of understanding of synthetic biology. This is supported by the results of our survey, which also suggest a correlation between age and level of understanding (with younger generations tending to have increased knowledge). Further, it appears that many of the views of those in the focus group were based on media accounts of developments in the field - again, this is consistent with the feedback from our survey. Public concerns regarding synthetic biology arise from a combination of lack of understanding and legitimate worries.
- Listening to Public Concerns
All members of the group agreed that scientists should. Some members also expressed skepticism as to the claims of synthetic biology, and suspected that the potential benefits of the technology had been 'overhyped' in many areas, creating unrealistic hopes. It is important
- Valuing Public Support
It was agreed that it is crucially important for scientists to recognise the importance of securing and maintaining public support and legitimacy. For this reason, scientific development must seek to earn public trust by not advancing too far ahead of public attitudes, and ensuring that potential applications of new technology offer clearly explained social benefits.
- Accessibility of Information
Many of the group felt that there remains a deficit of accessible, reliable, and impartial information. Independent sources of information are particularly significant: some members also expressed skepticism as to the claims of synthetic biology, and suspected that the potential benefits of the technology had been 'overhyped' in many areas, creating unrealistic hopes. Similarly, it was recognised that information concerning the risks of synthetic biology frequently comes from biased sources which may have a motive to overstate the dangers and seek to create excessive public anxiety.

Finding the optimal backbone:insert for ligation
We wanted to find the optimal backbone to insert ratio for ligation. Previously we had successfully used 100 ng of backbone, and a ratio of 1 to 8. We decided to try the following ratios:
1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:8, 1:10, 1:16
We ran out of cut CB Bottom backbone, so we needed to digest some more. We performed a miniprep on cultures that grew up overnight, using min-elute columns. Our final concentration of CB Bottom Plasmid was 50 ng/ul and 54 ng/ul.
We followed our usual protocol for digestion, and then performed a PCR purification, once again using a min-elute column to maximize our yield. However, the resulting product only had a concentration of ~5 ng/ul and a purity of ~1.6. We got similarly low yields yesterday, and are unsure where things are going wrong, since we have performed the same procedure in the past with success. Even if the plasmids weren't cutting, they should be present in the PCR purification product, so the low yields are puzzling. We decided to try a midi-prep tomorrow, so see if having more CB Bottom plasmids would help.
We grew up the following 100 mL cultures for midi-prep tomorrow: CB Bottom, Zif268.

Search for a better weak promoter
We have searched for a better weak promoter than the one we have now and compared their sequences to the present weak promoter in the kan-ZFB-wp construct, sequences were not similar enough to change the weak promoter through MAGE
To change the promoter would be a big process, so we are thinking of using a negative selection of TolC using colicin and then creating a higher TolC production standard to begin with which would allow the KS and KN growth curves separate more

BBa_K1963000 (Hfq from E. coli K-12)
Hfq is an RNA binding protein. It can bind to a range of RNA sequences but is often used in conjunction with an RNA hairpin formed by the E. coli micC sequence.
BBa_K1963001 (Hfq from Serratia marcescens DB10/DB11)
An RNA binding protein from the Hfq family.
BBa_K1963002 (A template for expression of sRNA fusions to the E. coli micC hairpin)
This is a multi-sequence system for small RNA (sRNA) production in an E. coli host or with co-expression of E. coli Hfq in an alternative host. The system has the proD strong promoter, followed by the micC hairpin, followed by the strong terminator sequence T1/TE. Phosphorylated primers should be used to insert the reverse/complement target sequence of your choice between the promoter and the hairpin sequence. The sRNA should be placed between C-193 and T-194.
BBa_K1963003 (A template for expression of sRNA fusions to the Serratia chiA hairpin)
This is a multi-sequence system for small RNA (sRNA) production with co-expression of S. marcescens Hfq BBa_K1963001 . The system has the proD strong promoter, followed by a chiA hairpin sequence from the 3'-end of the S. marcescens chiA gene encoding a chitinase, followed by the strong terminator sequence T1/TE. The use of an S. marcescens chiA hairpin/Hfq pairing should provide very high specificity in chosen chassis organisms. Phosphorylated primers should be used to insert the reverse/complement target sequence of your choice between the promoter and the hairpin sequence. The sRNA should be placed betweeen C-193 and G-194.

We went on the Kat Orman's morning show, alongside Monty Python's Michael Palin, and spoke about the increasing threat that antibiotic resistance poses, and what we're doing to combat it. We were asked questions about why we chose this area to pursue, whether our project was likely to be lincensed, and about the basics of synthetic biology.
Mabel and Helen in the studio with Kat Orman!
We answered this by using the analogy of computer hardware: if your computer hard drive is broken, you can buy a new model from the shop without worrying about whether it will fit or not, and it's the same with stretches of DNA sequence that you can stick together. We were also asked about our outreach and the efforts we were making to change the mindset of a society that demands to be prescribed antibiotics.
Finally, Kat ended by asking if we thought we could change the world with our project. After a little nervous laughter, we gave our answer: hopefully! Our section begins 1hr 6mins into the 3 hour show. Click here to have a listen!
UNIQ Workshop
Duke discusses the central dogma with UNIQ Summer School
We met with 40 prospective Oxford students to teach them about Synthetic Biology. The students had in interest in Biochemistry but knew nothing about iGEM.
We hammered home the key message of Synthetic Biology - that we achieve more progress by expanding a registry of standardised biological parts - through a 15 minute introductory presentation on BioBricks.
We then split them into groups and gave each one a mentor from our iGEM team. We worked through questions to test their understanding in a tutorial style and asked them to explain the constructs of previous iGEM teams. They finished by presenting their findings to each other.
UTC Oxfordshire
A couple of us gave a presentation on antibiotic resistance to a class of GCSE students from UTC Oxfordshire (a local school specialising in science) at the Natural History Museum in Oxford, The Pitt Rivers Museum.
Our talk covered the discovery of antibiotics, the advantages of them (including their use in laboratory work), how they work, and how bacteria can evolve to gain resistance to them, as well as concepts such as horizontal gene transfer and the consequences of antibiotic resistance on our everyday lives. It also covered our project outline, and pros and cons of Solution, showing how it should help combat antibiotic resistance.
At the end, we held a discussion between the students and our team about antibiotic resistance, and their perception of the concern. We also asked how they would feel about using our engineered bacteria, and"

Summer School for High School Students
In order to promote iGEM project in a larger group, we conducted several welfare activities for high school students. We gave a public lecture in Shaoxing No.1 Middle School of Zhejiang Province. The theme of the lecture was about today's research of life sciences and the development of synthetic biology. We focused on the analysis of some well-designed projects, such as the Coilsweeper, which was presented by ETH_Zurich in 2014 iGEM Conference. Besides, we introduced a ""summer course"" for students in Zhixin High School, Guangzhou, Guangdong. Our activities were very successful as most of the students expressed their better understanding to iGEM. Meanwhile, some of the students gave their great thanks to us and decided to keep in touch with us in the future.
2015 iGEM Conference Hosted by National Chiao Tung University
NCTU-Formosa had successfully operated a conference last year and they did a better job this year! 2015 International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference was a great success and we are in great honor to be invited.
This year, SYSU_CHINA has presented in NCTU conference. We've prepared a and a poster to introduce our project. Our project named Micro-Timer has really attracted many attenders' eyes, which excited us a lot. It's a solid approval for our project. And the project of the host also left us a deep impression. It's a bold design to use E.coli as probes and the special design had really borden our horizon.
NCTU conference also provided us with a platform to communicate with other schools and teams. Thanks to the conference, we've found some drawbacks in our project when we communicated with other teams, and now we've tried to get rid of them. Besides, we've successfully established cooperative relationships with ZJU, SJTU & THU respectively. NCTU conference is a great communication platform for iGEM teams in Asian Pacific Region. We sincerely hope NCTU conference can attract more teams and become better and better.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportFullIntroduction_-_-_TEXT.html," : from medicine to life science. In the United States of America during the 70's, that movement came with a polarization of the ethical concerns : some specialized sectors of ethics were rising (bioethics, business ethics, environmental ethics, etc), showing that the point is now both about building a system of ethical references and a rational procedure of decision-making. It enlightens the pragmatical concern at work in that new ethical perspective.
Legitimacy seems quite hard to attain : the one who detains scientific knowledge is no longer the only one who “can” and “must” express the social ins and outs about a scientific discovery or progress. There is a dissociation between modes of legitimacy of bioethical discourse and forms of “traditional” scientific gratitude. We can notice that new participants of the debate are “uninitiated” persons or a “mixed group”, expressing themselves in new structures (institutional or not), new moment of expression, and new recommendations. Temporality, form and dynamics of discourses are now numerous, hybrid and unrivaled. Exteriority from the scientific field is now a criterion of legitimacy, regarding the fact that internal motivations of the speakers are not involved in the moral imperative expressed.
These new expressions of “good practices in science” lead us to a new problem : it reveals a new and complex prescriptive dimension to the bioethical discourses. Actually, the pragmatical objective of that ethical reflexion is to prescribe. It makes use of an imperative, a “good practices manual” as tools, expressing its genealogy and cultural history : universalism of moral principles from the modern philosophy.
Both elements, one from the historical construction of bioethics and the other from that philosophical tradition, are intention. Plurality of discourses about good practices in science is becoming a productive polyphony, both considered as complex and as new wealth of our democratic societies. That polyphony seemed quite contradictory to the quest of unity and simplicity of moral principle, built on the idea that a moral imperative has to be one, simple and necessary to be operational and, above all, to be valid.
How are we to deal with both, quite contradictory dynamics in the bioethical perspective? How are we to build normative principles in order to guide and to control practices? Every disciplinary paradigm, every social actor, every regard seem legitimate to express in their own way but are still trying to fulfill a unique moral imperative. Bioethics has the interest to embody that tension between a polyphony of legitimate discourses and and a moral imperative quest, between the multiple and the unique, the hybrid and"

Here, we innovatively used Circos to demonstrate our survey.(as in the right picture) Circos is somehow like pie chart yet it can present multi information as all the statistics are proportional and clear on the graph.
In the graph, there are three circles. The inner circle stands for their knowledge of synthetic biology, and middle circle stands for their interests of iGame. Deeper the color is, the more they know of synthetic biology or the more they are interested in iGame. For example, light pink means they know little about synthetic biology and deep green means they are very interested of the coming tutor games. The outer circle, however, stands for their major;light green for biology major and light orange for other majors. As the graph shows, synthetic biology is still new to them as the majority have little idea of it, for which is what we will continue our project in the future. However, we are delighted to see that their interests of tutor game are fairly strong.
Referring to the possible game types, adventure and strategy games are students’ favorite, while some of them prefer stimulation and action games. In our program, we tried our best to listen to their voice and develop a game which is both educational and appealing.
Communication
We’d like to share what we have achieved with the world, so we did and will do a great deal to communicate with others and learn. For example, we collaborate closely with USTC wet team to learn what biology majors think of iGame and improve. Several seminars have been hold to make sure our program can really help the promotion of both synthesis biology and our tutor game. In addition, further transnational communication is not absent, like we had a deep talk with Dr. Joy Yueyue Zhang*(*BIOS Centre, London School of Economics and Politics Science) on how our program can change the development of both IGEM and make biology a better subject.
Yet we do not stop here. We have sent emails to other teams for further communications and asked for their opions on how we can improve iGame. What is more, all our codes are shared on github [1] (in the right picture). With fixes and new features putting forward every day,any one in any corner of the world can learn and keep update of our work, not just from the surface, but from codes and essense of our work. This is really a great way of communication, for we do not have to say too much to put our achieves across to those who really want to know"

Comparing the financial data from other general toxin monitoring companies, it is clear that to be competitively priced we must be able to match or beat the pricing of the Microtox® system. Due to the high prohibitive cost of this monitoring technology, and the results of our manufacturing analysis , it would seem reasonable to select price points for our technology that are just below the cost of MicroTox® for the per unit cost of the cartridges, while selling our detection system at a much lower cost than our competitors. This will ensure that we can remain competitive, maintain high profitability (over 10x production cost for both the cartridges and the detector system), and expand new market avenues to private companies as well as small groups where price point would have a more dramatic effect on the amount of sales made. All of these key factors will highly influence our selling activities which are detailed below.
Financial Market Assessment - Can Our Technology Be Profitable?
The monitoring market is dominated by government regulation, oil sands mining companies and their respective consultant service companies are likely to use the products and technology dictated by government bodies.  Therefore, it is possible to capture a large portion of this market by gaining government support.  Regulation will be the key component in seeing success in this market place.  Our initial market therefore looks at the government mandated monitoring sites.  An overview of this market and its profitability follows:
General toxin sensing for oil and gas applications represents a $50 Million market opportunity. The potential market profitability based solely on this government framework:
Figure 12: Financial calculation.
Assuming that we can capture 30% of the target market, our company may reach a potential annual revenue of $2,250,000, factoring in the one-time sale of our detector unit. The market is expected to grow in the next three years (projected to 2015), due to an increase in the number of sampling sites for water monitoring according to the Joint Canada|Alberta Implementation Plan.
As identified in our financial assessment, in order for our company to be profitable we require 20,000 cartridge units sold at a cost of $100 per cartridge or 1,200 units of the detector at a price of $5,000. Provided that we capture 30% of the sensing market (150 operation sites with 100 samplings per year = $750,000 revenue from detector systems and $1,500,000 from cartridges) who fulfill the government of Alberta’s mandated water monitoring, this will take approximately 1 year of"

Their system has the following proposed working mechanism: sgRNA Kan*, induced by IPTG, is a construct with a mutated kanamycin gene attached to sgRNA, while ABE-dCas9, induced by arabinose, is capable of editing and correcting the mutation on Kan* to restore the plasmid’s antibiotic (kanamycin) resistance.
The editor system is only supposed to work when both IPTG and Arabinose are present, as both SgRNA and dCas9 must be induced. SgRNA provides a guide sequence to direct dCas9 to target its plasmid, to perform adenine editing on sgRNA Kan*. To demonstrate this, we plated the cells from each condition into 2 types of agar plates with different antibiotics composition, one with kanamycin+gentamycin+chloramphenicol, and the other with gentamycin+chloramphenicol.
Results of our characterisation experiment
Top row: Agar plates with gentamycin+chloramphenicol (control)
Bottom row: kanamycin+gentamycin+chloramphenicol
Left to right: No inducer, IPTG only, Arabinose only, IPTG + Arabinose
We verified that their system works as proposed. As shown in the picture above, only the system induced by both inducers had colonies growing on the agar plate with kanamycin+gentamycin+chloramphenicol, while no colonies were observed for the other 3 induction conditions.
As our labs lack the necessary equipment to conduct RT-qPCR, we were unable to study the level of mRNA expression of our constructs. Fortunately for us, Team NTU is well-versed in this technique, having provided assistance to many teams previously. We gratefully accepted their offer to help and passed them several of our dye-synthesizing constructs for RT-qPCR analysis and characterization.
The RT-qPCR results showed that mRNA transcribes were produced from our constructs. Moreover, we also gained further insights into the design of our plasmids and how we can improve on them.

Overview
In soil environment, heavy metal pollution is the most common, which directly affects the health and safety of soil, and can be harmful to human body when serious. To solve the soil problem of heavy metal pollution, our team constructed a combination of heavy metal plants to repair soil. The environment of the soil is complex and changeable, and the control is weak. The influence of the treatment of heavy metal in soil and the influence of the growth condition and the external environment. Therefore, we will analyze the factors influencing the phosphorous bacteria in soil, and use the response surface optimization method to explore the optimal  combination, optimal conditions and optimal results.
Design
Mainly through software Design-Expert to realize optimization. The Box-Behnken experiment not only has a better effect. And the number of trials required is limited. Therefore, we adopt Box-Behnken experiment to optimize the adsorption process of heavy metal lead soil for PSB. Select the adsorption efficiency as the response value. The temperature, water and pH were selected as the influencing factors. The influence factors of PSB adsorption process are further discussed and studied. Get the best solution.
RSM design of plant growth
In this paper, the factors that affect the lead pollution in soil are studied and discussed in order to obtain the best solution. The influence factors of single factor test design were determined and the adsorption efficiency of lead in soil was selected. The following is a comparison of the actual value and the predicted value. It can be seen from the figure. The result is a good prediction of the actual soil conditions.
Results
In order to improve the fixed efficiency of lead pollution, the response surface design method was adopted to optimize the fixed efficiency of soil. Firstly, the influences of several major factors in the environment, namely temperature, moisture content and pH. The three factors influencing single factor test were determined, and the optimal value of the interval was determined. The temperature, water and pH were selected as the influencing factors. Then the test scheme of the design of the"

In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

Baker and Thomas A. Burnham proved the existence of market segment of GMO according to consumer responses [21], etc.
     However, among economists, their personal attitudes towards GMO vary. As long as their essays gave out policy advices somewhere in the article, their own attitudes towards GMOs can be exposed. Although the economic essay should always speak with a neutral tone on the paper, the economists are not necessarily so in their own homes. Some advices are given under the subconscious assumption that GMOs can be perfectly innocuous, others are given under the subconscious assumption that GMOs cannot. If you read the lines quite carefully, you find their real personal sentiments towards this perhaps not so new technology. (For further probing of this skeptic attitude, please read the article in the section of Humanities and Ethics: Ethics: One Psychological Origin of the Synthetic Biology Ethics)
     And after reading some of their account and advices of the GMO market, I found to my astonishment that those accounts and advices given regarding the GMO market are fundamentally flawed in that they all suggest a basic personal taste or distaste towards GMOs. What I’m implying is NOT that economists shouldn’t have a personal taste, but that this personal taste can and in some cases have already, biased their account of the GMO market condition.
     A government needs to take a stand, but an independent researcher is not speaking for any government so he or she doesn’t need to. In this report, I only want to give a description of the four types of markets that GMOs could end up in with as much objectivity as I could manage, and explain why some policies given regarding to GMO markets are fundamentally biased.
     Many scholars have described GMO as a failing market. For example, Donat, Kim JoDene asserted that the current GMO market was in its failure state, and brought up three reasons that might have caused the failure [20]. I heartily agreed with him at the beginning because the essay was so well researched and I learned a lot from it. But after sifting through various surveys done by different parties to look into consumers’ attitudes of GMOs across the globe, I had to think differently on one issue: for why should the refusal of Zimbabwe to accept GMOs and the reluctance of EU to release restrictions on GMOs be called ``market failure"

TUST_China,2017,Team:TUST China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,", it's quite a good experience to communicate with middle school students and to teach them what we've obtained in taking iGEM competition.
Consulting BC Company
We inquired about LEE'S PHARM and collected data related on Hemicelluose Dressing-- Veloderm. Owing to its unique nano-scale three-dimensional network structure, BC has a high-water retention, high mechanical strength, and outstanding biocompatibility, which enable it to serve as a natural scaffold material for the regeneration of a wide variety of tissues. For most wound-repairing materials, important characteristics are their ability to lock exudate during the dressing process, as well as their removal from wound surface after recovery. BC’s potential lies in the unique properties (such as the high mechanical strength) of the never-dried BC membrane; on the other hand, its high liquid absorbency, biocompatibility and hygienic nature perfectly cater to the specific demands for skin tissue repairing. Thus, considering the properties of BC as well as its clinical performance, the commercialization of BC for wound caring is very promising.
Outreach
Since we almost finished our project, we would like to know the manufacture view of our work and the production of some BC products. Therefore, we visited Shandong Nameide Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Their product is a bacterial cellulite wound dressing named Nanuomei.
The company's R & D manager received us and took us to visit the production workshop. She introduced us their mode of producing, which is quite different from the way in our laboratory. For example, in the lab we used the conical flask to produce BC, while BC was produced in a huge metal tray in the factory.
Besides, we introduced our iGEM project to her for advice. She thought our work was very meaningful and had been achieved increasing BC production, but she had doubts about whether it is suitable for the factory because the production methods and the production environment is totally different.
We plan to test the results of our iGEM project in the factory in the future. And we hope that our project can increase the yields of BC and be applied in the industry. From this trip, we have cleared industry demands and we are more confident that our project is useful and meaningful.
Expert Consultation
Q：Why is the application of BC in China rare? The reason why the BC products are low-value.
A: BC has high water retention, high mechanical strength and outstanding biocompatibility. This means BC can be used in medical products and cosmetics. However, these types of products fail to widely appear on the market because of"

The Open House event at DTU is a venue to reach over 2600 participants who visit the university to hear about the study lines and meet students already enrolled at DTU.                  We seized this great opportunity to impact the students even before they decide to enroll in a university program, and of course spread the word about synthetic biology and the cool things we are doing in the iGEM competition.

Spreading the Word of the BioBuilders
We are doing this cool project, we are presenting our project at every event possible and still… we are only really talking to somehow like-minded people.                  The solution seemed very obvious to us. Let us reach the layman; the grandmother in the suburbans, the children in the primary school along with everyone else who do not know how awesome synthetic biology is yet.
The public picked up on our project quickly, resulting in us getting publicity in three Danish newspapers; Ingeniøren (140,000 daily readers), Ballerup Bladet (15,000 daily readers) and Jyllands-Posten (288,000 daily readers). We also did a blog about the experience of being an international student on a Danish iGEM team.

DESCRIPTION
Finding Our Way With the Help From Industry
Throughout the project, we consulted with both minor and major industrial players and saught their input to make Yeastilization more viable. We started out investigating and procuring substrates from waste streams and once we had our idea lined out, we went out to major biotech manufacturing companies to test the feasibility"
SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2010,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#result_-_-_TEXT.html,"ystems), we calculate out the ??CT between gene ARC and GAPDH, as well as ZIF268 and GAPDH, and the average expression level gap between different group. The result is listed below:
For ZIF268, when comparing with the value of ??CT with 0 min’s light and 0 mM Ca2+, we find that the value is dropping when lighting time or Ca2+ concentration is increasing:
When the intracellular Ca2+ concentration increases, the expression level of ZIF268 would increase as well in neuron. But the real-time PCR result is not the same to our expectation. As the intracellular condition between neuron cell and C3H10 cell has many differences, we cannot assure that all necessary factors for the expression of ZIF268 also exist in C3H10. Thus, we cannot conclude that ChR2 could function as it does in neuron cell.
When we detect the quantity of gene ARC, there are some positive results. With the increase of lighting time or Ca2+ concentration, the quantity of ARC increases as well:
This is a powerful evidence to prove that the expression level of ARC is related to the lighting time or Ca2+ concentration. As ARC is regulated by the concentration of Ca2+, this result indicates that when lighted, ChR2 could be permeable for Ca2+, which is what we expect. Besides, from the drafts above, we find that when the concentration of Ca2+ is about 16mM, the expression level of ARC reach to the top. In addition, this experiment also proves that the expression of ARC could also be regulated by Ca2+ in C3H10, just like in neuron cell. So the expression level of ARC could act as index of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration.
Conclusion: ChR2 could be permeable to Ca2+ when lighted and ARC could be a index of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in C3H10, as well as in neuron cells.
II. Supervisor - MEF2-JeT promoter
Back to top ↑
Our supervisor acts as the switch for the genetic circuit via calcium-depedent intracellular signal transduction pathways. At the ends of these pathways lie two most important regulatory parts: MEF2 and CRE enhancer sequence. We then built artificial promoters by ligating MEF2 and CRE binding sequences with another artificial basal promoter JeT.
Idea: In order to test whether MEF2-Jet could function as a good promoter, we set two groups, experimental and control, to verify it. We reconstructed pcDNA3."

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#project-bc_-_-_TEXT.html," enzyme and when no or very little CheA enzyme is phosphorylated, no phosphorylation of the CheY and CheB enzymes occurs. In the end, this increases run, because phosphorylated CheY binds to the flagella motors and induce tumbling. When the bacteria have reached the area with a higher concentration of the chemical in question adaptation sets in.
Because no CheB have been phosphorylated during the reaction period CheR is “allowed” to methylate the MCPs, which increases the auto-phosphorylation of the CheA enzyme. This increase in auto-phosphorylation of CheA results in phosphorylation of CheY that leads to tumbling of the bacteria. In the last phase, relaxation, CheB has again been phosphorylated by CheA and is now able to demethylate the MCPs, returning the bacteria to its normal run/tumble frequency with a 0,1 second tumbling period every 1 second.
One other thing to consider in the model is the distance from the CheY phosphorylation site to the flagella motors that are randomly located on the entire cell body [ 1 ]. Several modelling methods have been proposed and nearly all of them include these considerations [ 1 ]:
""Attractant is assumed to be in excess and binding is assumed to be rapid"". One of the most common receptor types to be modelled is the Tar receptor. This is not unexpected given that a large degree of the experimental literature has focused on the response of E. coli to aspartate which is detected by this receptor. Tar is also one of the most abundant receptors within the cytoplasmic membrane.
In models which have focused on the adaptation and/or the phosphorylation cascade, receptors are commonly modelled as complexes consisting of MCP, CheW and CheA. This is justified by the tight association of CheW and CheA to the MCP receptors.
Descriptions of the motor bias, given the limited detail available on the interactions of both CheY-p and CheY with the cytoplasmic FliM end of flagella motors and that this interaction may be quite complex, it has been a common, simplifying assumption of a number of authors that the fraction of time a motor spends spinning counter-clockwise can be expressed in terms of CheY-p by a Hill function. Such reactions are based on experimental observations.
Description of the model
The model we will be using to predict biochemical behaviour of the system is a simplification of the real system.
The simplified model does not consider the normal metabolism in the cell. It only includes the most important enzymes in the normal E. coli chemotaxis pathway and"

Secondly, H2O2 sensor Yap1, will transfer into cell nuclear to start antioxidant-relative genes transcription once sense the over accumulation of ROS. If the Yap1                         starts working, which indicates ROS level is so high that it is dangerous for our yeast cells.                         So the Yap1-dependent promoters selected from yeast genome will induce the dCas9 system to                         repress the translation process of ndi1 and yno1, maintaining a safe level of ROS                         amount in vivo.
Thirdly, through transforming the roGFP-Orp1 expression vector into host, we can easily know                         how everything going inside the yeast.
Eventually, final test part comes!
The testing antioxidant is added into culture, and the artificial accumulation of ROS will                         decrease through integrated cell reaction. Some dues to direct antioxidant reaction, other may                         be removed by cells natural anti-oxidant system which is activated by testing antioxidant. No                         matter which kind of working way the testing antioxidant is, its antioxidant capacity will be                         reflected by the remaining ROS level, reported through roGFP-Orp1. In a word, higher ROS                         remaining represent lower antioxidant capacity.

This week, I met with Sherine from the wet lab with the following agenda:
Find around 10 new parts, homogeneous or heterogeneous in device composition, to add to the paper results
Describe 3 design scenarios
Incremental device design
Data-driven device design
Rule-driven device design
A lot of the work in the wet lab this year involved making many parts by reusing a large portion and swapping out a piece, a good example of incremental design. We could not come up with concrete examples for data-driven and rule-driven design, so we may need to consult Chris Anderson in the future. To capture the incremental design scenario in Eugene, I am working on a function that will take a device and generate all the variations from swapping parts. For instance, if the device has a promoter, new devices will be generated picking a promoter from the set of all promoters already defined.
I also fixed some bugs in Eugene regarding rule correctness and line numbers in code with comments. I updated the README to include documentation on 'if' statements, as well.

I added the ability to export XML from the compiler in two different formats. The default format, option -xml-default, below, loops through all the properties of each part, while the standardized format, option -xml-sbdtp, will look for specific keywords to generate tags. There is still a lot of discussion of what should be included in the standardized format, so it is currently just a place-holder.

Best composite part: BBa_K2886013
Introduction
BBa_K2886013, composited by BBa_K2886006 and BBa_K2886005 is our best composite parts, which is used to confirm our BiFC system. Actually, our BiFC (bimolecular fluorescence complementation) system consists of two chains encoded by two paired parts: BBa_K2886013 and BBa_K2886012.
Structures and BiFC
BiFC, a technology put forward in 2012, is aimed to visualize the interaction of two proteins. CECFP and nECFP are the C- and N-terminal of ECPF (BBa_E0020), which is a classical part that has been used 87 times till 2017. And we split this fluorescent protein at the site A155 into two parts. If these two parts of BiFC bind with each other, and they will emit fluorescence just as complete ECFP.
Moreover, to realize higher affinity and efficiency of ligand-receptor binding, we alter a few amino acids on the binding surface with the assist of Rosetta.
Test results

Degrading Part
We intend to degrade toxins through E.coli system. When the                                       fluorescence intensity is higher than threshold, our device                                       will sense it and turn on the LED light. In our E.coli system,                                       N564 Fragment and C565 Fragment are expressed by the                                       constitutive promoter. Induced by LED light, N564 Fragment                                       and C565 Fragment will complex with each other. pT7 promoter                                       will be induced by the complex and then expresses ZHD101 and                                       TRI101 which respectively modifies ZEN and DON toxin,                                       modification will reduce their toxicity.
Figure 4 : Schematic diagram of the degrading part
The first part is a kind of photochemical reaction, N564 Fragment                                       and C565 Fragment are activated by light and react with each                                       other.
The reaction process can be described as following:
We can get some differential equations which describes the                                       process:
Simulation
We use Matlab to simulate the process.
Figure 5 : Simulation result
According to our simulation result, after about 36s, the photoactivatable switch will fully open, the complex reaching                                           the maximum number of molecules, 220 molecules.
The following part is a dynamic model, the complex activate                                           pT7 promoter and pT7 expresses ZHD101 and TRI101. The                                           reaction process can be described as following:

Figure 6 : Simulation result
According to our simulation result, after 35 minutes, ZHD101                                       is fully produced and reaches the maximum number of molecules,                                       600 molecules. At the same time, 30 minutes later, TRI101                                       reaches the max, 500 molecules.
Sensitivity analysis
We briefly evaluate the sensitivity of the model by perturbing                                           the value of parameters. Changes of ±10% in β, COM, ξ, d1, d2,                                           sZHD, sTRI and k have different effects on the variable of ZEN                                           and TRI, as they are showed in"

Overview
This year our team designed a questionnaire on biosafety to investigate how well people know about synthetic biology and how acceptable the public is to our projects. Based on our findings, we conducted a series of presentations on synthetic biology for different populations. I hope to increase the public's understanding of synthetic biology through our publicity.
Aim
1.To see the acknowledge of biology and synthetic biology of public.
2.To popularize knowledge about synthetic biology.
3.To change people's perceptions of microbes.
4.To advertise our project to public.
5.To introduce some basic principle and safety in laboratory to public.
Questionnaire
Introduction
Last year we did a questionnaire about biosafety. This is the second year that we participate iGEM. Since this year more students showed their interests about iGEM, our curiosity came out. We want to survey the popularity of iGEM. According to the cognitive of synthetic biology of people and the view for our project, we designed a questionnaire about these two parts. We did online and offline survey and the result was better than our expectation.
Methods
Online: We made an online survey about synthetic biology and our project. By passing it to students in our college or other college and their friends and relatives, we received a lot of feedback from 5~50-year-old people.
Paper questionnaire: We also made paper questionnaire with the same questions as online survey. It’s mainly used to students from middle school. We also passed paper questionnaire to students in our college by handing out in living area in our college.
Sampling survey: After we received the results of questionnaire, we took 20% sample out to figure up the data, which is shown below.

Description of the project
This project consists in modifying a bacterium called Escherichia coli, through synthetic biology, which is based on the creation and modification of organisms that already exist, managing that they have the characteristics that we want. These organisms will sense the high levels of alpha and beta particles, gamma and x-ray emitted, factors that cause a mutation in the DNA of the already said bacterium, which will give a purple coloring and a lemon scent.
To validate that the investigation is necessary and it is supported by different specialists in the area, we made a survey to radiologist’s students, medical technologists, and workers of radiological centers, obtaining an 83% of approval about the need of better dosimeters with trustworthy results.
The sensor and its parts
For this, through a scientific investigation, a sensor was designed, which is based on a biphasic switch, device that can be turned off or on according to the concentration of the input. This switch naturally regulates lambda phage, which in this case, when the pRM promoter is activated, gives a rise to the transcription of the Cl repressor, which in turn will provoke inhibition of the Pr promoter and will not be able to transcribe Cro, LuxR and LuxI. In contrast, if DNA damage is detected with the help of the RecA protein, the Cl repressor is removed and the pRM promoter ceases of being activated, giving a rise to pR (promoter) activation and to the transcription of Cro, LuxR and LuxI. (Plasmid 1)
This circuit is based on the bacteriophage (phage) lambda lysogenic, double-stranded DNA that infects E. coli and was discovered in 1951 by Esther Lederberg. Its cohesive ends of the genetic material, after the infection, causes its genome to be circulated, and if it continues with the lysogenic cycle, it behaves like a plasmid taking advantage of the enzymes of the recombination of the bacterium integrating itself into the genome of the latter.
In the lysogenic cycle, the virus is inserted at a specific point in the genome of the bacterium and replicated when it does so, passing its genes to duplicate E. coli. The virus synthesizes (object) from the Cl repressor, which inhibits the expression of the rest of the genes, where in conditions of cellular"

Simulation
Once all the parameters were defined, we simulated the model for 20,000 seconds using a variable order solver based on the numerical differentiation formulas, ode15s2.
We performed a scan on the initial AHL concentration to analyze the response of the system.
It can be seen that the final response depends on our input signal and we can manipulate its strength and length by modifying the initial AHL concentration.
A scan over the total nickel concentration shows that response is only weakly influenced by it; even though the intensity of the response does vary, the proportion with respect to total nickel does not change. We decided to fix the initial value on 30,000 molecules for the following analysis, but this number will be finally determined by the bacterial tolerance and the sensitivity of our measurement device.
 
Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis using Simbiology2 was performed to  determine the parameters that influenced our model the most3,4. This analysis was possible  because our model was solved using an ODE solver.  The values for the calculated sensitivities  were fully normalized to dedimensionalize them. All of the parameters were  plotted vs. all of the species and the sensitivity at each intersection was  determined. There were two main evaluations, one at t=7700s which is  approximately the time at which the greatest response was observed.
Sensitivity Analysis,  at a time of 7700, at which our model predicts the greatest response.
At that time, the species influenced the most are AHL, cI,  cI:cI, RcnA and Ni-ext. That makes sense for it is at this point of time where  the production of cI, its dimerization followed by the repression of RcnA and  therefore the decrease in Ni-ext, are at the highest levels.
The other analysis at t=74000s which is approximately the  time the system takes to return to a basal state.
Sensitivity Analysis,  at a time of 74000, at which our model predicts a return to the basal state.
At this time the system has returned to the basal state. Here  the species influenced the most are the same; the difference resides in the  magnitude of the influence.
Afterwards the sensitivity of a single specie with  respect to all of the parameters was plotted with respect to time.

There is a distinct reduction in the amount of biofilm growth between untreated and treated samples, with samples treated with 25 µL α-Amylase showing a 40.0% decrease in biofilm formation after 48 hours. While this clearly shows the ability of DspB to inhibit biofilm formation by V. cholerae, we did not see any degradation of the biofilm at treatment T = 48 with one hour of treatment incubation. Further characterization is needed to determine whether AmyA and DspB can degrade the biofilms, and what conditions and concentrations of enzyme would make such degradation possible.

Question 9
Figure 15. Question Analysis for Question 7 and 9
In conclusion, our lectures helped to propage the concepts of SB and iGEM competition to high school students, most of who didn't know about those issues. Some students are willing to participate in the iGEM competition while others are not due to academic and financial shortage. Hence, next step we considered to offer some help to the students with interests, like teaching them how to implement elementary molecular cloning experiments; if it is possible, we would also like to guide students and schools to apply fundings from the Education Commission.
Funding Application
After the lectures, Ms Lee Xuemei, the Science Director of Beijing No.4 High School, exhibited strong interests to Synthetic Biology and international Genetically Engineering Machine (iGEM) competition. On July 26th, Ms Lee came to the lab of Peking iGEM. It was the time PKU-UCSF Workshop taking place, with the company of our advisor Prof. Ouyang Qi, we took Ms Lee to the workshop field and had a serious talk on how to spread ideas of SB and iGEM to high school students.
Figure 19. The Science Director of Beijing No.4 High School Ms Lee came to Peking2012 iGEM team and had a serious to with us. (Ms Lee is on the right-hand side)
Figure 20. A group photo of Ms Lee, our advisor Prof. Ouyang and Peking2012 team members.
Durign our discussion, we have reached an agreement. Unlike most universities, high schools in Beijing, even in whole China, are short of an abundance of financial support, private or public. Thus, we thought that participation in iGEM HS Division in China would better be government-aided. Therefore we decided to write a report together with Ms Lee Xuemei to apply for a specific funding for Beijing high school students to participate in the iGEM competition. The report contains survey of iGEM competition these years, aptitudes and abilities of high school students in Beijing, and a comparison between students in China and the United States. It has been submitted to the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education and is waiting for approval.
Guiding HS students towards future participation"
Cambridge,2010,Team:Cambridge#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," to be addressed for this to happen? We also considered the markets for other domestic products that might arise as a result and made a mock advert for ‘Bactobang’, an improved antibacterial agent to prevent the escape of bioluminescent synthetic organisms should their container become damaged. We also thought about the possibility of bioluminescence in art and fashion and presented our ideas to the rest of the team.
The second group envisaged ‘Bright Foods’ where the plants and animals that we eat might be engineered to have different colours of bioluminescence that would give an easily interpretable indication of nutritional content. The brightness of the luminescence would fade over time giving an indication of the freshness of the foodstuffs. This could also add an additional dimension to the experience of eating – perhaps restaurants would serve food in the dark so customers could fully appreciate the aesthetics of their luminescent meal. Food standards agencies might even insist that all food conforms to bioluminescent regulations such that foods with high levels of salt or saturated fat glowed particular colours to indicate this to customers. Perceptions might change such that people come to expect their food to glow and view dark food as spoiled and unappetizing. Bioluminescent cocktails could also become a fashionable drink in upmarket bars.
Bioluminescence genes escaping
The third group considered how bioluminescence might slowly replace conventional lighting and the issues with intellectual property that this might cause. Initially, artificial bioluminescence could be a novelty – perhaps bioluminescent fish would be a popular pet. As our knowledge of synthetic biology grows, luminescent trees could become a real possibility; the commercial potential in replacing the street lights of the world could lead to strong competition with patents for bioluminescent systems. It could then be difficult to control and police the use of patented genetic systems; if the parts were put into fertile organisms then people might start illegally breeding their own light sources. We also considered containment issues and people’s attitudes towards them. As organisms engineered to be bioluminescent would not pose any considerable threat to public health or the environment, their escape might not be considered a serious issue. The amazement and awe inspired by natural bioluminescence might even  lead to the escape of bioluminescent genes being welcomed by the public of the future – particularly one that had grown accustomed to this form of lighting in their homes and cities.
Applications

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," increasingly alarming problems posed by oil extraction tailings ponds in our province.
“You would really have to have a purpose for doing it [implementing our system in the wastewater treatment process]… whereas with tailings ponds, they need to be dealt with.” --Dorothy Lok
With her advice, we delved deeper into the impacts and characteristics of these ponds, and our findings convinced us that we had finally found our emphasis!
OUR PROJECT
Our project, “Cu Later”, aims at using a system of biological components to sequester and remove metal ions from oil and mining tailings ponds. These ponds contain high amounts of toxic metals (such as copper, nickel and lead) that create significant environmental concerns. When mixed with other chemicals, these metals can form acidic compounds that lower the pH of surrounding waters. They can also pose direct threats to aquatic organisms, causing irreversible damages to their nervous, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems. In one instance, the continuous discharge of 450 kilograms of copper every day into the Britannia Creek (near a former copper mine in British Columbia) exterminated every aquatic species in the creek. In another instance, over 1,600 ducks died in a Syncrude Canada tailings pond in Northern Alberta when they mistook the pond for a freshwater lake.   Upon speaking with a representative from Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), we learned that although there have been regulations in place to limit the production of tailings on the part of energy companies, there is currently no efficient method to treat or extract metals from tailings ponds. Traditional water purification methods, such as distillation, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are theoretically possible but practically inefficient and extremely expensive. Additionally, we learned that the amount of tailings in Alberta has increased drastically over the past decades, from just below 10 gigalitres in 1970 to over 1,400 gigalitres in 2018.
Today, the amount of tailings in Alberta alone is enough to fill 560,000 Olympic-sized pools. With an average depth of five meters, these tailings cover a land area of 280 square kilometers, over one-third the size of the city of Calgary. These statistics are predicted to continue growing in the future, as millions of cubic meters of new tailings are produced every day.
“The big problem in oil sands tailings is the sheer volume, the magnitude of production you’re talking about, it’s millions of cubic meters per day.” --AER Representative
Although the accumulation of toxic tailings is a prevalent challenge in our oil-dependent provincial economy, the environmental concerns they present is"
XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Content6_-_-_TEXT.html," with the members of software team of our university. This tunnel is not only a main stem but also a famous scenic spots, so that more than 30,000 people per day will pass by and look our doodle. In addition, the doodle is a quite novel approach to introduce synthetic biology and we believe that no team did it before.
We also held a garden party with software team where introduced iGEM and synthetic biology to 200 students of senior high school from the whole Fujian Province. Go to page…to see more
In the wet lab, we helped them to structure their plasmids, such as teaching how to ligate and digest.
Fifth
We've also had a really good communication with the iGEM team of Peking University. From August 11th to August 19th ,one of our team members went to Peking University to get a deep cooperation with them. Firstly we introduced our own project in this year and exchanged the opinions .They gave us some good suggestions in experiments and models. What’s more, they gave us one BioBrick of sfGFP (pSB1A3-RBS-sfgfp-TT), which gave a great help to our structure. This sfGFP allowed our circuit to generate a brighter fluorescence and made it easier to observe in the microfluidics.
Sixth
We had a short meeting with 4 members of NJU iGEM team visiting us on June24th, 2013. We welcomed all other visitors as well. During the meeting, we introduced our project this year to these visitors and exchanged some opinions with them. It can improve the connection and collaboration between different iGEM teams in China.
