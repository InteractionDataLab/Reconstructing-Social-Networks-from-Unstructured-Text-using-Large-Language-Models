Rajib Saha: Rajib is a PhD candidate at Penn State; he worked as a liaison between Penn State and WashU and guided Brandon and gave us feedback on the modeling.
Human Practices Support:
Beyond the support of lab work design, Monsanto, and in particular Jose Prado, project lead of a paper published about how projects go from concept to market, provided human resources and materials including data sets, Power-point slides and presentations to enhance WashU’s iGEM video series.
Financial & Lab Facilities:
Pakrasi Group: Dr. Pakrasi and his research group at Washington University in St. Louis provided material and working space support for both Rebstock and Brauer Group.
Moon Group: Dr. Moon and his research group provided material and working space support for the Brauer group.
Zhang Group: Dr. Zhang and his research group at Washington University in St. Louis provided material support when we were lacking certain chemicals and let us use their temperature controlled growth chamber in which we conducted our light regulation experiments.
Sigma-Aldrich has supported WashU iGEM program since 2012. This year, Tonya Jackson, the Product Manager of Genomics and Research, provided help by not only offering funding for our project, gave us feedback on our presentation, and also provided us a sample of a new prototype media “EnPresso B” to test and enhance growth of our colonies.
Monsanto’s sponsorship continued in 2014 through material and advisorial means. On Wednesday, June 4, our team was invited to visit Monsanto Headquarters and its affiliated facilities. The tour gave team members a terrific impression about industrial-sized biotechnology development procedure and growth capabilities.
WashU iGEM would like to thank Washington University School of Arts & Sciences , Washington University School of Engineering , Washington University Office of Undergraduate Research , Washington University International Center for Advanced Renewable Energy and Sustainability , Sigma-Aldrich and Monsanto for providing funding for stipends and materials. Lastly, we would like to thank SnapGene for their software to aid our plasmid designs.

Then, I tried to co-transformed this light sensor generator (BBa_K19103034) with hybrid promoter 2 and 4, because I have not gotten the sequencing results of P3 and P5. First, I made pSB4K5 vector and I changed the backbone from pSB1C3 to low copy number vector pSB4K5. Then, I did co-transformation of P2+E1010 and P4+E101 with BBa_J23016-YF1-FixJ+B0015 and picked up colony from the plates, then I culture them under dark condition over 24h with control (only contains hybrid promoter with mRFP) and tested fluorescence value and absorbance OD600(Fig. 18). Last, I tried to amplify riboswitch BS-xpt with BBa_K156032 again and sent it to sequence, but the results were still not correct.

Week 15 (28th September-4th October, 2016)
Firstly, I tried to use PCR to rebuild secretion tag prtB by adding a short linker on the C terminal of secretion tag and N terminal of Chitinase A and B. Also, I added a His tag on the C terminal of Chitinase A and B by PCR (annealing temperature are  secretion tag:52℃, ChiA+His: 67℃, ChiB+His: 67℃). Then, I did gel purification for purifying these two part and digestion them with BamHI overnight. And I ligate them for 2.5h, and tried to use PCR amplify whole Chitinase A and B with secretion tag part. But only ChiA-His tag+secretion tag succeeded (Fig.19). After I sent ChiA+secretion tag to sequence, the sequencing result was not correct. Then I tried to use gradient PCR to amplify ChiB with secretion tag again (From 48℃-60℃), but it failed again. Next, I sent BBa_J23016+BS-yxjA-BBa_K516032 PCR product to sequence again, and I got the correct sequencing result this time. Then, I culture BBa_R0010 and BBa_R0040 and purified plasmid (60.5 ng/μL, 54.5"
Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA which were selected using SELEX as well. As for today the concept of functional nucleic acids in nature has only been found for RNA. Nevertheless DNA aptamers and also catalytic DNA were selected in vitro.
Catalytic DNA – DNAzymes
RNA-cleaving DNAzymes
Secondary structure of 7-18 and 10-23 RNA-cleaving DNAzyme with substrate RNA. Cleavage site is indiacted with an arrow.
SELEX revealed a variety of DNA aptamers and catalytic DNA known as DNAzymes (or Deoxribozymes). Breaker and Joyce selected the first DNAzyme, a RNA-cleaving DNA.
Breaker1994
In 1997 Santoro and Joyce describe the 7-18 and 10-23 DNAzyme
Santoro1997
(Fig. 8) which since then have been of special interested in DNAzyme research. Both recognize their substrate RNA by Watson-Crick base pairing and catalyze the attack of a 2’ hydroxyl group that leads to the formation of a 2’,3’-cyclic phosphate and leaves a 5’ hydroxyl RNA terminus.
Santoro1998
Their activity has also been engineered to be dependent on the presence of a small molecule by the addition of an aptamer to its substrate recognition site.
Wanga2002
Wangb2002
To verify the prediction of the software MAWS we fused the calculated aptamers to a DNAzyme with JAWS and thus created a ligand dependent activity. For this we used the HRP-mimicking DNAzyme (Fig. 9) which was described in 1998.
Travascio1998
It folds into a G-quadruplex that forms a complex with hemin and is then able to mimic the activity of a horse raddish peroxidase. Hence it is capable to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water. These ROS then leads to an activation of for example luminol which results in a chemiluminescent signal. In several of our subprojects we exploit this function as an easy readout such as for the AptaBody.
Functional nucleic acids in iGEM
Looking at the history of functional RNA in iGEM naturally occurring self-splicing introns were used by Team Waterloo 2011 to rejoin a split GFP posttranscriptionally. Riboswitches the natural relatives of aptamers have been used in several projects for example"

Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

Genspace,2015,Team:Genspace#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," capture was barely sufficient to reach stationary phase.  However it is noteworthy that the 1nM concentration appears to have reached its plateau of terminal yield after only 11 hours (i.e., even while still in mid-log growth).
Evaluation of the Lsr-based Inverter System
In order to evaluate the LsrR regulatory protein and the pLsrA2 promoter, we devised a logical inverter system.  In the absence of the Lsr-related components, a control system expressed a red fluorescent protein (RFP) in response to increasing levels of the inducer molecule IPTG.  This is accomplished through the conformational effect of IPTG on the LacI regulatory protein which reduces binding to the Lac promoter and increases expression of the RFP.  Hence increasing the amount of IPTG increases the amount of RFP.
In the Lsr-based inverter system, transcription of the LsrR regulatory protein is under control of the Lac promoter and transcription of the RFP is under control of the pLsrA2 promoter (which is inhibited by LsrR).  In the absence of IPTG, LacI binds to the Lac promoter and inhibits LsrR transcription.  This facilitates RNA polymerase binding to the LsrA2 promoter and ultimately increases expression of RFP.  When IPTG is present, the binding of LacI to IPTG results in increased expression of LsrR, which inhibits the pLsrA2 promoter and in turn reduces the expression of RFP.  Hence the inversion effect: increasing the amount of IPTG reduces the amount of RFP.
We constructed three plasmids using the Synbiota Rapid DNA Prototyping (RDP) assembly protocol.  The first plasmid, p1, had an Ampicillin resistance and a medium-copy-number origin of replication.  The p1 plasmid contained a single device:  a constitutive promoter followed by a strong Ribosome Binding Site, followed by the coding sequence for the LacI regulatory protein.  The p1 plasmid was used in both the control system as well as the Lsr-based inverter system under study.

The complexity of the challenge in the antibiotic field made it hard to find the niche in which we could apply and validate our detection method. By meeting with experts and stakeholders, we were able to shape our design to fit everyone's wishes as best possible, and make our design relevant and responsible. The timeline of our integrated human practices process is illustrated to give an impression on how our project evolved over time due to interviews with stakeholders, and those we collaborated with.
For example, we collaborated with farmer Paul Oosthoek and did experiments on his cow’s milk samples. Additionally, we performed experiments with the isolates gained from the experts Dik Mevius and Fimme van der Wal. Also, veterinarians gave us insights in their documents to gain more knowledge about the treatment procedures. Futhermore, multiple stakeholders participated in our project How can iGEM teams best include Relevance and Responsibility in their Design?
In the last section, we summarise the most crucial insights and how stakeholders interactions lead to impressive changes in our experiments and design.

Summary
One of the industries that greatly contributes to the antibiotic resistance problem is the fish farming industry. To achieve high yields and profits, many farmers are now applying intensive farming methods which involves the misuse of antibiotic usage. Our first idea was to solve this problem by engineering a bacterium that can sense the pathogen and swim towards it. After arriving there, a neutralizing agent will either be released or produced and excreted on the spot. Antibiotic resistance shield The overuse of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic resistances. Although this problem has already been popping up in scientific and newspaper articles for over 30 years, its"

Andrew Ng
Andrew Ng is a sophomore majoring in Biomedical Engineering from San Diego, California. His favorite food is the California Burrito, which is a San Diegan delicacy consisting of carne asada, guacamole, cheese, and most importantly French Fries, all wrapped in a warm tortilla. He chose the manatee as his favorite animal because he too dreams of conquering the world one day, and plans to use our saffron producing bug to achieve his goal. As a soundtrack to the conquest, he plans to play Wagner’s “Ride of the Valkyries”. When he is not using iGEM to further his aspirations for world domination, he enjoys playing water polo for Washington University.

We even developed the idea to use a seasonal hand wash containing the purified antibodies from the season's viruses in order to create a world where a handshake would be more than just a form of greeting but also a way to pass on immunity.
RCA sci-fi story ideas: Nuclear winter leaving people without immune systems. Use external immune system to save everybody?
Synthetic life can only use certain amino acids, firewall? Biocomputers where man and machine are converged closer together. Floppy disk baby? Mock news articles (Times, science article, tabloid), comic strips (simplified version of our project), documentary type video?, Terrorist attacks (Text by Chris)
Antibody research:
- Single-domain antibodies such as the nurse shark derived IgNAR and the camelid derived VHH have been used for many purposes and have recently started to gain popularity among the scientific community.
-Contain CD3 loop that gives these Ig's an advantage when looking for cryptic viral epitopes. However, contain ten epitope copies and might still infect. Solved by increasing their mass.
-Both of these Ig's are stable enough to be administered orally. - Orally administered transformed lactobacilli were used to administer anti-TNF Ig.
-Small dimensions of VHHs allow it to be easily tagged. -Lactobacilli have been engineered that produces VHH's at a rate fast enough to prevent infection by p2 bacteriophage. Possibly use lactobacillus for screening and E. coli for secretion? -VHH's and IgNAR's have been effective in detecting poliovirus and inhibiting its replication in vitro, as well as preventing the assembly and secretion of hepatitis B. Possible to use VHH's as intrabodies vs. HIV-1? -N-glycosylation increases stability. -Studies demonstrated that pre-immune libraries can be used for rapid generation of Ig's against a large number of harmful antigens. Troublesome low sensitivity overcome by using phage-displayed instead of purified antibodies.[1]

RDFZ-China,2018,Team:RDFZ-China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," or intentionally. We used two environment factors to monitor the bacteria’s situation: temperature and population density, they are both high and tunable in the fermenter. So, the device will initiate when temperature and density are both low. We used thermal sensitive regulator (NUS iGEM2017) and quorum sensing regulator (MIT iGEM2004)as our sensor, sRNA and tetR family repressor PhlF(Glasgow iGEM2015) as the signal inverter. We add intergrase (Peking iGEM2017) controlled by the thermal sensitive regulator, which will turn the promoter of a lethal gene when temperature rise in the fermenter so that bacteria can survive at the very beginning. Also, we build a model to stimulate the minimum autoinducer required at the beginning of the fermentation[ Modelling ], same as the purpose of integrase. This model is for keeping bacteria alive at the very beginning of fermentation. Together they form a NOR gate which will lead to cell death through genome degradation when temperature and density decrease.
For Therapy
The second device we build is for therapeutic bacteria, the device can carry out noninvasive tracing through ultrasound imaging of the gas vesicle, release the drug (from SHSBNU 2017) controlled by a thermal sensitive regulator at nidus by ultrasound tissue heating, and heat to a higher temperature to release nuclease and kill the bacteria after it finishes its mission.
For Metabolic Stress
We applied capacity monitor [] to quantify the expression burden of all our systems, and to reduce the metabolic stress, we designed another device for fermentation which used a LuxR repressive promoter (Peking iGEM2011) and cold-regulated 5’UTR region (Ionis Paris 2017). This device only involves one transcriptional regulator, which will be less energy consuming.
DIY bio and Biosafey
Back to the growing and glowing synthetic biology community, despite the ones doing it on campus, more and more people are starting it at home, they call themselves Genehacker or DIY biologists. The lack of sufficient training and efficient surveillance will be a time bomb which we do know there will be a monstrous harmful bioproduct will be made someday in the future, and indeed, it will be a significant threat to the current biosafety basis. Recall our memory to iGEM2009, Peking surveyed DIY bio, almost ten years later, we conducted a similar DIY bio-survey again. We tried to order materials for molecular experiments, using the delivery address to our home, the result was quite shocking that"

We cloned the fusion protein (dxCas9-linker-Tn5) coding sequence in front of the T7 promoter site of the pACYCDuet-1 vector in frame with the HIS purification tag. We used two separate restriction ligation cloning steps to assemble the construct. First, we PCR amplified the Tn5 coding sequence from Plasmid #60240 from Addgene containing pTXB1-Tn5 ( Picelli et al. 2014 ), simultaneously integrating the linker with extended primers. The Linker-Tn5 PCR amplicon was cloned into the isolated pACYCDuet-1 plasmid with restriction ligation using KpnI and FseI sites. Next, we PCR amplified the dxCas9 coding sequence from Plasmid #108383 from Addgene containing dxCas9 (3.7) from ( Miller et al. 2018 ). We cloned the dxCas9 amplicon into the isolated pACYCDuet-1-Lin-Tn5 plasmid with restriction ligation using NotI and FseI sites, resulting in a plasmid with  dxCas9-Linker-Tn5 coding sequence with a T7 promoter and terminator and a His-tag. As the protein production might cause undesired cell burden, we used the low copy P15A replication origin to propagate the plasmid in the cells.
3.3 Protein Expression and Purification
Aim: Express and purify the dxCas9-Tn5 fusion protein ( BBa_K2643000 ), as well as the individual proteins that comprise the fusion: Tn5 transposase ( BBa_K2643002 ) and dxCas9 ( BBa_K2643001 ) for in vitro functionality evaluation.
Approach: We followed existing expression and purification protocols for both Tn5 ( BBa_K2643002 ) ( Hennig et al. 2017 ) and dxCas9 ( BBa_K2643001 ) ( Huai et al. 2017 ). However, we developed a new downstream process for our fusion protein ( BBa_K2643000 ). We evaluated three different types of chromatography:
Nickel affinity chromatography: The fusion protein has a HIS-tag (used to purify both Tn5 and dxCas9 individually).
Heparin chromatography: The fusion protein is a DNA-binding protein (used to purify both Tn5 and dxCas9 individually).
MonoQ chromatography: It’s an anion exchange resin. To facilitate the binding of"

With the micro-fluidic device described above, and based on the fact that the length of the G1 phase of budding yeast is more sensitive to starvation, we carried out a series of experiments with various modulation schemes of changing medium. The rich medium used in budding yeast modulation experiments was SC -Ura, the poor medium was a mixture of 1.5% SC -Ura and 98.5% PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, pH = 6.0). After a scheme of 60 min period of poor medium alternating with 90 min period of rich medium three times.

DTU-Denmark,2013,Team:DTU-Denmark#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," GMOs in particular as these might pose a higher risk when released into the environment.
Bioethics: is defined by the WHO as ‘’the study of the ethical and moral implications of biological discoveries, biomedical advances and their applications, as in the fields of genetic engineering and drug research.’’
General public is concerned when hearing about GMOs. The scientific community should spend more time communicating how useful GMOs are in everyday life, using simple examples to help people have a better understanding in what Synthetic Biology means and what can offer to the world.
In Denmark and in our university as well, biosafety is not an issue to be taken lightly. Everything is about researcher’s safety and all lab work is planned with respect to the environment.  Local biosafety groups exist in every building (research group, department) and rules that apply to everyone are mandatory to be followed.
Denmark has followed the international guidelines of the Cartagena Protocol since 2002.
In DTU, we were working in two different laboratories, each in a different department: Systems Biology and Environmental Engineering. Both labs have their own local biosafety group. Lab technicians and PhD students gave us a tour of the lab and provided us with all the information needed to work with the instruments in order to minimize the risk of accidents. It was requested from us to submit a Workplace Risk Assessment form to show that we are aware of all the potential risks that our project held and to make sure that we knew what is considered to be a harmful reagent and how we would treat it. Also, to show that we are organizing our workspace according to the procedure that we want to perform (e.g. use a LAF bench to minimize risk of contamination), and that we always take care of our personal protection by wearing the necessary equipment (gloves, safety glasses when needed) and how to decontaminate biowaste and equipment used, especially in the case of spillage.
The department of Systems Biology has a biosafety board and specific safety rules applying to our department.
DTU has access to a Danish chemical portal called Kemibrug , which provides safety information (safety data sheets) and other information for standard lab tasks. We were introduced to this database early in our project, from reading material and a lecture from Christopher Workman at our BioBrick Workshop in early March.
Prior to this, students working in the lab had relevant training from their bachelor studies and/or master courses.
All this combined, provided us with all the background (knowledge) required to treat all aspects of our project with responsibility and awareness of how important it is to make correct use of"

Maldi-TOF
Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization – Time of flight (MALDI-TOF) is a procedure to analyze large biomolecules by their mass.
Our MALDI-TOF device
Before measurement, the analyte is co-crystallized on a metal plate within a solid matrix. 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) are most commonly used. Desorption of the analyte is taken by a laser beam, commonly with a wavelength of 337 nm. The matrix absorbs the laser light and the upper layer explosively vaporizes, ejecting both, matrix and analyte molecules. In addition to this vaporization, the laser beam also leads to an ionization of the analytes. The mass analysis is performed by the TOF (time of flight)-analysator. The evaporated ions are accelerated in an electric field. Typical acceleration voltages for this are 10-30 kV. The velocity of an ion depends on its mass and the charge. An ion detector converts the incoming ions into an electrical signal. The advantage of this method is the rapid analysis"

Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#article#compare_-_-_TEXT.html," understand why the recent increase in number of participants from Hong Kong and Korea was steady. It is because these two countries already have relatively higher percentage of participation in the competition. Also, in Korea and Hong Kong, the number of new universities being established is lower than that of China. This may explain why the increase in participation from Chinese universities is most rapid.   The ratio for Hong Kong is significantly higher than other countries because Hong Kong is a city. Comparing Hong Kong with other countries might not be conclusive. Of the four East Asian countries that we have researched, Japan has the highest ratio of participation. This also correlates with the fact that the highest number of SynBio Map entry was in Japan. These two indicators suggest that Japan is the leading East Asian country in synthetic biology.
Synthetic Biology Regulation in East Asia
In general, countries/regions in East Asia do not have specific regulations that address bio-safety issues regarding synthetic biology. They instead enforce pre-existing guidelines that were originally formulated for the regulation of genetically engineered and genetically modified organisms. These regulations were developed in the early or mid-2000s. Experts in Korea, Japan, and China argue that new specific regulations for synthetic biology is necessary for the safe development of the field in these countries.
Currently, no countries in this region have proposed initiating the development of such regulations. This may be due to the fact that in 2010, the United States, a leading country in synthetic biology, announced that new regulation or modification of existing regulations that govern synthetic biology is not necessary. The Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues of the United States explained that instead of coming up with stringent regulation, they will “choose a middle course” to maximize the potential benefit of synthetic biology. It instead recommended self-regulation by synthetic biologists (Wadman, 2010).
The following table summarizes the current regulation imposed on synthetic biology activities in East Asian countries and the United States.
Many people and organizations are worried about this loose regulation of synthetic biology. Over 100 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have called for greater international supervision of synthetic biology. They worry that synthesized organisms could have unforeseeable risks for human health and the environment. Friends of the Earth, an environmental organization, even came up with The Principles for the Oversight of Synthetic Biology which outlines how synthetic biology should be regulated (Hoffman, 2012).

Interview with Dr. Jewett
To better understand how certain design aspects would affect both the public’s willingness to use our sensor as well as the quality of the sensor, we interviewed Professor Michael Jewett, Chemical Engineering PhD.
In the initial MetaSense design, we planned on using a GFP output to indicate the presence of lead or chromium. However, when talking to Professor Jewett about this, he suggested that we switch to a colorimetric output for many reasons. One of such was that using a GFP reporter would require the use of a tool that can measure fluorescence - something that few citizens have access to. Thus, MetaSense users would be required to send their paper-based assay to a laboratory in order to receive results, which would take time and resources. Professor Jewett instead suggested that we make use of a colorimetric output to indicate the presence of the specified heavy metal. The reason for this modification is that it will ideally provide a readout in around 2 hours, while also not requiring users to send their sensor into a laboratory.
Additionally, our initial design only called for one plasmid. While talking to Professor Jewett, he suggested that we make use of a two plasmid system. One plasmid would consist of a constitutive promoter, followed by a gene which codes for a repressor protein that is inactivated by either lead or chromium. The other plasmid would contain an operator sequence to which the aforementioned repressor protein could bind, followed by a gene coding for an enzyme that produces a colorimetric output in the presence of a certain substrate. As a result, we would be able to tune the concentrations of these two plasmids to enhance the accuracy that MetaSense provides regarding heavy metal concentration.
Finally, Michael Jewett connected us with a graduate student in his lab, Adam Silverman, who focuses on cell-free sensing - a resource that proved integral to much of our progress this summer. .
Interview with Adam Silverman
In order to better understand cell-free sensing, we interviewed Adam Silverman, a Chemical and Biological Engineering PhD student. During the interview, we went over two cell-free sensing systems that Adam had worked with.

UiOslo_Norway,2018,Team:UiOslo Norway#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"lycospot)Three replicates of assay. Upper left corner ‘crude cell culture’, middle left ‘supernatant’, lower left ‘positive control’ (commercially available enzyme mix), upper right ‘crude diluted’, middle right ‘pellet’, lower right ‘negative control’ (empty pBAD vector). All samples on the left parts of the plates show enzyme activity in all replicates.
Conclusion
With our results we showed that our BioBrick, the endo- 1,3-β-glucanase, has enzymatic activity and is able to cleave 1,3-β-glucan bonds. The activity is comparable to a 100x-1000x dilution of Zymolyase. Combined with either mechanical force or a detergent, we expect to be able to selectively lyse yeast cell walls.
Experiments that did not succeed yet
Affinity chromatography of glucanase using FPLC (Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography) We performed different FPLC (Picture 1-4) with different outcomes. The enzyme was not only found in the expected fractions but also in the flow through.
Picture 1-4: Absorption spectra from the FPLC of glucanase. Dark green ‘conductivity’, black ‘imidazole buffer’, light green ‘absorption at 280 nm’, pink ‘absorption at 260 nm’, blue ‘absorption at 214 nm’. Proteins have an expected absorption at 280 nm.
In Picture 1 the glucanase was in fraction A16-21, however, there is also a lot of glucanase present in the flowthrough. In Picture 2 the glucanase is present in fraction A8-10, but again a lot of glucanase was lost in the previous fraction.
In Picture 3 and 4 all the glucanase was released in the flowthrough. We hypothesize that this is due to the column being broken down by the enzymatic activity of the glucanase.
Although we were not successful cloning the dCas9-beta-lactamase into the submission or expression vector, we went through several different cloning attempts, troubleshooting and optimization strategies.
For cloning we attempted Gibson assembly, 3A assembly and SOE-PCR. We tried to optimize the protocols using different ratios of substrate, incubation times and gradient PCR.
Future plans for the project
Continue trying the clone the dCas9-beta-lactamase in the expression vector for expression and purification

1.1 Survivability in soil
We set up a soil experiment to test how long our E. coli chassis can retain its plasmid in soil. We initially transformed chemically competent E. coli DH5α cells with superfolder GFP. These cells were inoculated on small filter discs (about 0.5 cm diameter), which were placed in autoclaved and non-autoclaved soil. We periodically grew up cultures from these filter discs over the course of seven weeks.
After seven weeks, we were able to recover fluorescent bacteria from sterilised and non-autoclaved soil (Figure 1).

Figure 2: Gel digests of bacteria displaying colony morphology typical of E. coli recovered from non-sterilised and sterilised soil. These bacteria exhibited colony morphologies typical of E. coli. (Data by Imperial College iGEM team 2011).
As is visible from these plates, fluorescence was present in bacteria recovered from both sterile and non-sterile soil. A control plate grown from a filter disc inoculated in non-sterilised soil without fluorescent bacteria showed that there was no contamination with other fluorescent lab bacteria. In order to investigate whether the fluorescence observed was due to the presence of the original sfGFP construct and whether the E. coli-like colonies from the non-sterile sample had retained a plasmid, we extracted plasmid DNA using a miniprep kit and did a digest with EcoRI and PstI and with EcoRI on its own to check for presence of the original insert and size of the unfolded vector, respectively (Figure 2).
The insert is very clearly visible at just below 2 kb. This confirms the presence of superfolder GFP in both cultures. Sequencing of the GFP insert revealed that no mutations had taken place in the superfolder GFP gene contained in the bacteria inoculated in non-sterile and sterile soil. This result was obtained in three separate replicates.
In addition, small colonies appeared on the non-sterile plate that had very different colony morphology. We grew this colony up in LB medium containing selective antibiotic and subsequently performed a separate miniprep. No DNA was yielded in this miniprep. It is therefore likely that the plasmid was not transferred to these bacteria but"

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2018,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," eliminating the risk of spreading ampicillin resistance.
We asked ourselves if our yeast could harm the nature by release of target molecule. We deemed this unlikely since the probability that our S. boulardii will accumulate in nature is expected to be low. The reason for this is the low probability of the yeast having cells to bind to, combined with the low probability of several yeast cells binding to the same cell, or cells in proximity to each other. As a result of this, it is not likely that the FUS1 promoter will be activated by the alpha pheromone sensing system. This means that our yeast would behave as normal, unmodified, S. boulardii (see the section on patient safety ). Consider the possibility that the FUS1 promoter is activated by some other means than by the alpha pheromone system. In this scenario, the amounts of anti-cancer agent released are expected to be low and the resulting concentrations in nature are assumed to be neglectable. The reason for this is the small probability of several yeast cells, expressing anti-cancer agent, accumulating in one place. We therefore consider the risk of our yeast harming nature via release of anti-cancer agent to be small.
In a future prospect, a kill switch could be introduced into our S. boulardii in order to make sure that it will not make any harm to the environment after it has left the body of the patient. One possibility is to combine a temperature sensor with a phosphate sensor, killing the yeast when the low temperature outside of the body is combined with the lower concentrations of phosphate in the wastewater (iGEM NUS Singapore, 2017).
Conclusions
To conclude, we have used the work conducted in the human practices to make impact on our project design, to consider how our project can make a difference in society as well as how we can avoid possible negative effects on patient health and the environment. In additon to the work outlined on this page, we have also reached with our project to society and collaborated with other iGEM teams.

Day 1 was mutiny. Five students had met with a sponsor in the morning and when the two captains returned to the room, the students were milling around, whispering under their breath, and fidgeting. The problem was with motivation towards the project, as some students felt that it wasn’t novel enough. We had found a 1998 paper by Duport et al. that explained how their team developed yeast to produce pregnenolone and progesterone - the things we wanted to make. It turns out though that the paper didn’t lead to anything, the strain has been lost, and it was a good proof of concept for our idea. From the uprising we learned to communicate thoroughly.

Our yeast strain is going to have all the genes to make progesterone, as well as the lactase enzyme so that we can feed it lactose and it break it down to glucose and galactose. We figured out after much deliberation how we could have our friends in developing nations get the accurate dose of progesterone. We learned from our mentor that we could use a technique to measure the weight of an object using a coat hanger, and depending on weight, calculate the amount of lactose inside that container"
Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," to do a lot of preparation. But luckily, with the help of the teachers we managed to plan the day. We did not only present the theoretical background of our project, but also put emphasis on safety aspects related to synthetic biology and the experiments. Hence, we were able to initiate interesting conversations and discussed both, our project idea and the practical work in the lab.
As we prepared some long term experiments, we visited the school again after 2 days and could show the results to them. On that day, they took the chance to ask more specific questions about about Synthetic Biology and our field of study. What looked like an overwhelming organizational challenge turned out to be a great experience with students not much younger than us.
Postcard Project
This year the iGEM Team Düsseldorf started a postcard project. Every participating team was encouraged to design their own, with the purpose to increase the knowledge about synthetic biology in the public. We thought it was a great idea, so we participated. These cards have first been distributed amongst all participating teams and then were distributed in different locations around each team’s hometown.
With our topic we wanted to inform people about synthetic biology and genetic engineering and show that they are present in their daily life, in an easily understandable way.
Here, we want to thank once again the iGEM Team Düsseldorf for this great idea and the invitation to participate.

English translation:
""What does synthetic biology even mean?
The term “genetic engineering” is often mentioned in critical media reports and in this context cheese manufacturers more and more advertise with the promise that their products were made without this allegedly dangerous technology. We, as students of this field, would like to give you a better understanding of synthetic biology with the following example: Nowadays, you can find the declaration “without gene technology” on cheese packages. This does not refer to the actual ingredients of the product, but to the production method, so the cheese itself does not differ from “normal” one. Synthetic biology makes it possible to generate products with the help of genetically engineered microorganisms. In contrast, cheese without genetic engineering is produced with dried calf stomachs, which raises the question if this is more desirable.”

In the meantime they will be working on buoyancy and the ocean model
Monday 16th July
Wet Lab - James and Aurelija continued the reinvigoration of the W3110 cell line today, after culturing it on agar over the weekend. Single colonies picked from minimal agar plates and used to seed 5ml cultures overnight in preparation for day 3 of protocol. We hope this will produce a more competent cell line, capable of more efficient transformation.
Modelling - Joanne, Aurelija and Erin continued their search for software  for the ocean model representation, this  included researching Ferret and Panoply, and lookinng into past iGEM modelling presentations. They are particularly impressed by Columbia 2011. Outcome: We have established the necessity to use Panoply software.

Meeting - Wiki - Rhiannon met with Aurelija and Yeping to discuss the details for the Research page. The Research page is still a work in progress, and while we work on some diagrams to make our project more comprehensive, we want to ensure the text explains our project as clear as possible. Outcome: We have a draft overview for every module that explains each module in context of the others, and how the system works individually. We also hope to include a more detailed explanation of the decision making process.
Meeting - Degradation Module. Rhiannon and Yeping met to discuss the search for the laccase gene for the degradation module. Unfortunately, attempts to get hold of the C208 strain of Rhodococcus ruber has failed, which was our preferred choice of laccase gene. We researched other laccase genes which may have plastic degradation properties, as well as alternative enzymes. Outcome: It was very difficult to find a gene for which the sequence was available. We did find the sequence for one, but we are unsure of its plastic degradation properties.
Wet Lab - James and Aurelija completed their reinvigoration of the W3110 cell line, and Rhiannon transformed a sample of this cell line with a reference plasmid, to determine how successful the reinvigoration was. The transformed cells were placed in overnight culture.

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) in eleven children is an example of accidental misuse [15]. Fortunately, nine out of eleven patients were treated, showing significant improvement, and as such, led relatively normal lives. Contrarily, the remaining two had off target effects of the gene treatment, involving the integration of the vector into the LMO-2 gene, which is linked to T-cell hyperproliferation, causing childhood leukaemia[16].
As such, a question should be asked: are the developers of the technology liable for not exploring potential misuse before release, or is it the users who did not implement the technology without first considering the consequences involved?
We propose that the liability towards the technology designer should be considered on a case by case basis depending on three factors:
Did the designer provide proper literature for their findings, and were the findings tested appropriately before implementation?
Did the designer suggest potential for misuse and knowing such, did they attempt to remove the risks?
Did the designer allow correspondence to discuss the risks of their technology?
Similarly, we propose that the liability towards the user should be considered on a case by case basis depending on three factors:
Did the user consult appropriate literature for their intended application, and did they test the finding appropriately?
Did the user know about potential risks? If so, how did they attempt to remove the risks?
Did the user attempt correspondence with the designer to discuss the risks inherent in the technology?
In addition to these factors, it must be considered whether both the designer and the user followed the biosecurity requirements of both their own nation and organization.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Detectives_-_-_TEXT.html," week we made it through two cycles of digestion, ligation, and transformation of our parts.  The first round of digestion/ligation/transformation lead to 36 samples likely containing our parts. Samples were then sent in for sequencing. The sequencing results again indicated that the correct promoter (Pveg) was present, but the other pieces of our construct beyond that were not present. We made overnights of all remaining (untested) colonies from the successful plates, but the cPCR failed so we did not go on to prepare these. The second batch of digestion/ligation/transformation we did this week failed as there was no growth at all on the plates. We were using the original synthesized products directly in this restriction digest, instead of putting a small amount it into E. coli and letting the E.coli mass produce it. Therefore, at the end of the week all we had to submit to the iGEM registry was 17 constructs that we had in a different vector. They were unable to be properly inserted into the accepted iGEM vector pSB1C3. We still want people to be able to use these parts that we worked really hard designing for our project so we still posted the information about them on our parts page.
Table 1:Indicates the progress made thus far in BioBricking our parts for the iGEM registry.
Week 21: Oct 13 - 17
Aside from working on content for our Wiki, we attempted to demonstrate the interaction between our reporter and repressor genes. We essentially carried out a double transformation of E. coli. Competent cells were made from E. coli colonies that were initially transformed with the reporter gene, producing red colonies. These competent cells were then transformed with the repressor gene. The reporter gene was carried by a chloramphenicol-resistant plasmid vector and the repressor gene was carried by an ampicillin-resistant plasmid vector, allowing for a reliable double-resistance selection.
The results of our double-transformation showed functional evidence for the interaction between our reporter and repressor genes; we observed a repression of the expression of the RFP reporter. Plates with the two antibiotics produced white colonies indicating that both plasmids were successfully transformed and that RFP was not being expressed. Few red colonies were observed at the edges of the lawn. The occurance of red colonies at the edges are most likely satellite colonies, that is colonies without ampicilin resistance (i.e. without the repressor) which survived due to the breakdown of antibiotic by cells with true ampicilin resistance. Our controls consisted of"

Step I.
When all of the schematic work finished, we are firstly going to verify the hypothesis of the apoptosis effect when caspase-3 expressed in yeast. If not, as previous plan B, caspase-8 will be tried in our situation.
Step II.
The kinetic parameter of the light mediation, iron sensing and iron absorption are with worth to detect.
Step III.
Though we would like to see them in only one microorganism clone, according to the original design, iron sensitive absorbing system and optogenetic apoptosis system consists of two engineered plasmids repectively. Four plasmids in total makes it impossible for integration. Further genetically engineering design and operation are necessary, mainly in system simplification.

Discussion
General Discussion
Interestingly, it would appear in figure 1 that the fold-changes in the 0.4g treatment are symmetrically distributed with central tendency. The same cannot be said for the 0g treatment, which shows skew towards positive fold-changes. This discrepancy could be attributed to the sample that was run a second time (in a different batch) in the 0g replicates (table 1). We also believe this to be the main reason for the large difference in (the number of) significantly differentially expressed RNAs for either treatment (0.4g and 0g, respectively). Due to the time pressure of the competition in context of which this study was performed and the large costs of RNAseq, we were not able to redo the experiment. Despite this complication, an interesting observation can be made in the annotations of table S1 . Namely, without regard for significance, it would appear that many of the differentially expressed genes under simulated Martian gravity display similar trends in the 0g treatment. Whether the result of reduced gravity or of the RPM’s movement, in either case this would suggest reproducibility of the experiment, since we expect similar changes to occur in partial and microgravity. A follow-up, using less expensive and time-consuming qPCR, will attempt to confirm the differentially expressed RNAs with a larger sample size.
E. coli is primarily affected on a translational level
As summarized in table 2, a large fraction of significantly differentially expressed RNAs are antisense RNAs. This could imply that E. coli copes with the perceived stress from reduced gravity primarily on a translational level, although changes on transcriptional or genomic level may follow after longer incubation time. Additional support for this conclusion comes from the fact that out of the three mRNAs affected, one is a translation initiation factor.
Stress from reduced gravity
Many of the affected antisense RNAs complement mRNAs related to stress response. For example, a near 16-fold decrease in expression of antisense mgtA was consistently observed among treatments (figure 1, labeled mgtA). This implies an increase in mgtA mRNA activity and thereby increased magnesium transport, which is a common stress response. Other stress related antisense RNAs observed in the 0.4g treatment include cold shock protein, heat shock protein and acid resistance membrane protein.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#TimeControl_-_-_TEXT.html," are able to repress their downstream constitutive promoters separated by double terminators. These promoters         are pcI (BBa_R0051) and pPhlF (BBa_K1725000) respectively. The two pairs of repressors and promoters do not         work in synchrony i.e. when cI expresses, PhlF is repressed and vice versa.
Since the purpose of this time delay is to turn Cre recombinase either on or off dependent on the presence of AHL,         there are two scenarios of activity in Time Module Construct:
In the absence of AHL, only PhlF molecules produce and repress its pPhlF. Then, the expression of downstream             recombinase is rendered.
The second scenario is when sufficient AHL initiates cI protein production. The cI molecules will inhibit PhlF expression         by repressing pcI. This turns on pPhlF, leading to expression of recombinase.
In order to observe the maximum and minimum time for the delay in Cre recombinase expression, ribosomal binding site (RBS)         downstream to pLuxR is adjusted. In iGEM biobricks, multiple strengths of RBS can be sought. We selected         five different ribosomal strengths, ranging from the strongest to the weakest:
1.0 RBS (BBa_B0034)
0.6 RBS (BBa_B0030)
0.3 RBS (BBa_B0032)
0.07 RBS (BBa_B0031)
0.01 RBS (BBa_B0033)
The stronger the RBS strength, the higher the recombinase expression. We expect that transcriptional and translational         delay of repressor coupled with tuning ribosomal strength to the lowest degree will significantly contribute to the         longest delay of Cre expression.
Planned characterization
LuxR cassettes expresses LuxR protein that can form dimers with AHL. This dimer is the inducer for pLuxR.         In order to see the effect of different RBS strength used in our time control construct, we use YFP whose expression         can be quantified by fluorescence level.

Publicity
In order to explain our project and idea in a more interesting and intuitive way, we designed our postcards containing our logo, QR code and brief slogan. We distributed them to those who were interested in our project, and they were also sent to Düsseldorf-Köln to take part in their postcard exchange campaign on behalf on Light Harvester. However, when we continued to carry out our collaboration with other teams, we found postcards far too simple to convey our principle but did better as souvenirs, which motivated us to design our brochures. The brochures, we can see, contained our project description, the theoretical support, our group members, significances of iGEM competition and other important information. In the process, Syngen Tech Co., Ltd, which is an outstanding company in the field of synthetic biology, showed great interest in our project. With the philosophy of serving the country by industries, Syngen Tech Co., Ltd thought it meaningful to carry out comprehensive study on energy crisis and try to find solutions by means of synthetic biology. After seeing our postcards and brochures, and subsequent discussions held between Light Harvester and the company, Syngen Tech Co., Ltd generously decided to give us assistance on material sponsorship. We are very grateful for what Syngen Tech Co., Ltd provided and hope that we can do better in our project and explore more potential of synthetic biology.

FRET ME RUN
As the main principle of our project, FRET is an interesting and useful theory. But it may be a bit obscure for undergraduates, especially those who don’t major in biology. Considering that spreading scientific knowledge to non-scientific people is another aim of iGEM, we came up with an innovation activity called FRET ME, aiming at making the concept of FRET easier to understand.

Wechat
In China, WeChat is a prevailing APP which is similar to Facebook and Snapchat. The articles published on WeChat are accessible to different people in different communities with different backgrounds and different occupations.
We took WeChat as the main tool for online publicity. We gave a simple description of our project and then presented the principles of iGEM and synthetic biology for readers, hoping that through the articles we could receive recognition and support from our mates. And then from the community's comments, we knew about their concerns, which were valuable in our whole design.

BBa_K2082231: (Part of) The Selection
Figure 1: Illustration of the part BBa_K2082231.
What would be a whole library and a very high created variety, if you do not have something to get the parts, which are important for the specific situation? A selection system is a very important aspect of our system for the creation of binding proteins (Evobodies) for a lot of different situations. Perhaps an Evobody against a transcription factor for scientific researches is needed or a fast countermeasure against a new upcoming virus. Therefore, a bacterial two-hybrid system was created to select those Evobodies out of the whole created variety which are interacting with the specific protein.
Our best composite part BBa_K2082231 is one part of these bacterial two-hybrid system.  It contains a SH2 domain fused with the repressor protein cI of the phage 434. Also the whole reporter for the selection system is available on this part. To test the functionality of this part a lot of measurements were accomplished.  At first the expression of the fusion protein SH2-cI was shown, with a SDS-PAGE and a Western blot assay .  The results revealed"

PmrB is a transmembrane protein with iron binding peptide on its extracellular loop. When PmrB binds iron (III) iron, the intracellular domain gains kinase activity and phosphorylates PmrA, which subsequently binds to pmrC promoter and induces expression of chemotaxis CheZ protein. In this part iron binding tag on the extracellular loop was exchanged with a lanthanide binding tag (LBT), to allow PmrA-PmrB two-component system to respond to lanthanide ions.
This part is extraordinarily long for a promoter. It is designed this way because of the ca. 400 bp spacer at 5' end of the part - promoter is only 46 bp long, which would prove almost impossible to amplify through PCR or direct synthesis and ligation with pSB1C3. To counter this, we amplified pmrC with this spacer. This part contains also RBS from Salmonella enterica, just before the start of translation. If you wish to study PmrA-PmrB system more closely, we suggest reading following papers:

BBa_K1459008 - pmrC-GFP-terminator
This is pmrC promoter from Salmonella enterica, with subsequent GFP and BBa_B1006 terminator. This part is one part of PmrA-PmrB detecting system. Upon phosphorylation by PmrB, PmrA binds to pmrC and induces expression of GFP. This part is extraordinary long for a pmrC-GFP. It is designed this way because of the ca. 400"

The week started great, i got my first part ligated, transformed and confirmed by screening.      I was going to CIBio, the research centre to learn hot to use FACS and to help Giacomo with the measurements, but we forgot controls!      My araC-pBAD part and Jason's CysE are ready, so we started collaborating to put the two together and form our first awesome device! Jason took care of it while me and Giacomo tried again with FACS. Unfortunately, the machine was moved and broke during the transport. We were forced to start the characterization with the fluorimeter. After a couple of tries me and Jason were successful in creating the first device!
I selected a couple of possible terminators to test from the registry (B0010 and B0017), and I purified some of these colonies.
I continued with the purification of many overnight cultures and PCR products, in particular LacI from pET–21 plasmid and araC-pBAD from E. coli genome and from the Registry.
Giaco brought a delicious cake!
We designed some primers, tried to extract some parts from registry, such as some standard vectors.
Starting designing the terminator construct: we decided to use the Roberta Lentini’s plasmid RL0024, with the fluorescent proteins Cherry and Venus. This will allow us to calculate terminator’s efficiency as a ratio between the peak intensity of Venus and Cherry, avoiding problems of various variables that could influence raw measure.
To submit it we must mutate two illegal sites, XbaI and PstI, and insert prefix-suffix in the linker between the two proteins (take a look at our final construct).
We also would like to test if the termination efficiency changes with a different promoter/ RNA polymerase; as the chosen vector already contains T7promoter, we decided to replace it with Ptac, thus making our second platform.
To take measurements we’ll use the E. coli strain BL21pLysS, an expression strain with both polymerases.      A familiarizing week also with protocols and various tools.
Week 4 (06/11 – 06/17)
I can now apply a mutagenesis PCR to CysE to obtain M256I CysE. The gel confirms that the PCR worked, which is then ligated into a digested pSB1C3 and transformed again in Nova Blue cells. I’m at the Univesity Olimpics when I have to"

Design
In this section, our aim is synthesize the TlpB protein in our E.coli for to E.coli can penetrate to the stomach mucus layer, which is our pathogenic bacteria, H.pylori, resides.
For enhance the production of our protein TIpB, we aim to assemble our TIpB gene with T7 promoter which is a fast and strong promoter during we design our parts.
For controlling the system, we decided to add a Lac Operator, which is LacI protein can bind, between TIpB gene sequence and promoter. We searched for a expression vector that include Lac Operon and we found that peT45-b has the properties we want and we decided to use that vector.
When we order our genes we added RFC10 prefix site to 3’ end and RFC10 suffix site to the 5’ end of TlpB gene and also we added BamHI and XhoI restriction site sequence on the Pet45-b for cloning.
We planed to cloning TlpB gene that we ordered as described above to the Pet45-b vector with using BamHI and XhoI enzymes.
When this cloning achieved succesfully, there will be a construct that with order T7 Promoter-Lac Operon (LacO)- HisTag-TlpB and also there are LacI constructive promoter and LacI protein sequence ,in front"

Austin_UTexas,2017,Team:Austin UTexas#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," with the student leaders from all teams. This was the main source of communication throughout the weeks ahead.  We collaborated with Rice for our modeling. Eve Sharpee, from the UT Austin team, discussed different ways we could improve our modeling mechanisms on our presentation with Jack Terrell, head of modeling from Rice. He answered our questions and provided guidance in creating the graphics that would be used for modeling in the iGEM Jamboree presentation and wiki page. We have very little experience modeling and using SimBiology, so Rice was very helpful in this regard.
Texas Tech is most familiar with chemical transformations and has less experience with electroporation, so we thought it would be mutually beneficial for our teams if Tech attempted Lactobacillus plantarum electroporation transformations. We provided glycerol stocks of cells, 2mm cuvettes and MRS agar powder in order to make this happen. Rachel Johnson corresponded with Brandon Palomo to offer advice on how to successfully electroporate. Quick recovery of electroporated cells,  adjusting resistance and voltage on the machine and proper concentrations of plasmid and cell stocks were discussed as well as various pieces of advice that UT Austin has primarily learned through experience and routine use of electroporation. In addition to Tech working on new techniques with guidance from UT Austin, this greatly helped UT Austin transform Lactobacillus plantarum. Texas Tech provided assistance to us by attempting to transform Lactobacillus plantarum with a variation of the Speer (1) protocol we had previously worked with as a way to troubleshoot issues encountered during our initial transformation attempts. We felt it would be helpful for another team to work with the protocol and identify if the procedure was too ambiguous or if there was only an issue with how we performed the procedure. Texas Tech was unable to transform using the Speer protocol, leading us to adapt and work with a new protocol that ultimately led to successful transformation of Lactobacillus plantarum with pMSP3535.
Overall, team UT Austin helped successfully facilitate a collaboration between Rice and Texas Tech, through a university-hosted research symposium, which allowed for individual and team presentation critiques and improvements. By providing the necessary materials and protocols for conducting a transformation via electroporation, team UT Austin gave Texas Tech the opportunity to learn and utilize a new technique to broaden possible laboratory skills for future use. Finally, team UT Austin provided guidance and mentorship to second-year team, Texas Tech, by clarifying any questions regarding presentations, wiki development, experimental focus and fulfilling medal requirements .

Carotenoids
Introduction Previous Research Action Plan and Results Reference
Our Action Plan
In our project this year, we aim to incorporate the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in E. coli and produce different coloured pigments. Potential candidates are lycopene (red), beta-carotene (orange), and zeaxanthin (yellow). Since these three compounds are sequential in the biosynthetic pathway, we hope to demonstrate colour changes from red to orange to yellow, by controlling expression of the enzymes involved in conversion.
Our action plan is as follows:
1. Test the activity of K152005 (CrtEBIY) .
2. Test pigment production in E. coli strain MG1655 and its derivative (up-regulation in precursors) .
3. Construct composite biobrick containing CrtE, CrtB and CrtI (i.e. CrtEBI) and test its activity .
4. Transform E. coli with CrtEBI and CrtY. Test if activation of CrtY can cause colour changes in vivo .
5. Characterise our composite biobricks and the colour output .
6. Test compatibility with biobricks from previous iGEM teams and see if we can convert their outputs into pigment production .
Our Action Plan (Updated regularly). Green: completed. Yellow: Work in progress. Blue: Partially completed. Red: Planning.
Test activity of K152005
Close-up of K152005 in TOP10
We wish to test the feasibility of incorporating the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway into E. coli, which does not produce carotenoids naturally. K152005 contains the enzymes for beta-carotene formation, and is a quick way to verify our concept.
We transformed E. coli (TOP10) using K152005 from the 2009 Distribution Plate ( Week 2 ). After"

6) constitutive promoters with binding sites for the transcription factors (as seen in the repressible reporter, for example)
7) mCYC or other minimal promoter
8) mCYC with binding sites for the transcription factors
Note that we recently discovered that Harvard might have some yeast strains that already contain the parts we choose to utilize.

--------------------------------------------------
before 5pm: innoculate yeast cultures of successful transformations from 7/4/08 and later in order to make glycerol stocks and also to run tests tomorrow
--------------------------------------------------
Checked on the plated transformations from the second round- all were successful, and there was no growth of the negative control.
Devised a plan for setting up the plate test:
Make SD-Trp-Ura media with a 2 mM (2000 microM) concentration of methionine.  This will be easily diluted to the various concentrations required (25 uM, 50 uM, 100 uM, 200 uM, 350 uM, 500 uM, and 1000 uM).
M.W. (Met)= 149.2 g/mol
thus, 2 mM solution has .2984 g/L
250 mL Recipe for SD-Trp-Ura with 2mM Met
6.815g SD Dropout media powder
.5g Histidine
1g Leucine
.0746 g Methionine
Test #1:  We have decided to use a 96 well plate reader to measure the fluorescence emitted by our various parts.  For the time being, it appears that this will be sufficient.
The protocol is as follows:
Apparently the doubling time of W303_1a, the strain used for all of the transformations, is 2.8 h.  This was gleaned from the following source: http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1140095.  Other sources appear to range between 95 min and about 3 h, depending upon the media.
We have decided to sweep across different levels of methionine.  For the activators, we will need to invetigate as to whether the presence of raffinose is necessary, especially since this sugar was used in the yeast memory paper by Caroline Ajo-Franklin.
Made cultures of the following parts:

Figure 5: Processor cell SBML model simulated by COPASI. Graph shows production of C4 quorum sensing molecule over time in the absence of C12 quorum sensing molecule.
Figure 6: Processor cell SBML model simulated by COPASI. Graph shows production of C4 quorum sensing molecule over time in the presence of C12 quorum sensing molecule.
Reporter Cell SBML Model
The deterministic SBML model for the reporter cell was tested separately from the other two cell types in COPASI. Figure 7 shows the model schematic. RhlR is produced constitutively. When the C4 quorum sensing molecule is absent, RhlR is unable to activate expression from the pRhl promoter, resulting in no production of sfGFP. When C4 is present, it binds to RhlR, allowing expression from pRhl and production of sfGFP.
Figure 7 Schematic for the reporter cell model. Crossed circle represents a degradation reaction.
Figures 8 and 9 below show simulations by COPASI of the reporter cell with and without the C4 quorum sensing molecule present. As was expected, when C4 is not present, sfGFP has a low value, and when C4 is present sfGFP has a high value.
Figure 8: Reporter cell SBML model simulated by COPASI. Graph shows production of sfGFP over time in the presence of C4 quorum sensing molecule.
Figure 9: Reporter cell SBML model simulated by COPASI. Graph shows production of sfGFP over time in the absence of C4 quorum sensing molecule.
Multicellular Simbiotics Simulation
The three deterministic SBML models described and tested above were used in the Simbiotics tool to simulate the entire multicellular biosensor framework. The cells were tested as three ratios to determine which yielded the highest sfGFP production in the presence of IPTG, compared to in the absence of IPTG (i.e. the optimal signal-to-noise ratio).
Ratio 1 - 200 detectors : 200 processors : 200 reporters
The graph below (figure 10) was created using data generated by the Simbiotics software tool using default values for diffusion of the quorum sensing molecules (C12 and C4), and the inducer IPTG, and default values for membrane permeation by the three molecules. The system was simulated in the presence (blue line) and absence (orange line) of IPTG"

Macquarie Australia
Team Macquarie
How did we help them?
Team Macquarie had constructed a hydrogenase gene capable of converting glucose to hydrogen gas. The plasmid BBa_K2300001 consists of the genes for hydrogenase enzyme (Hyd1), ferredoxin, ferredoxin-NADPH-reductase (FNR) and maturation enzyme (HydEF and HydG). Their expression levels are co-regulated under the pLac promoter.
This year, our team helped Team Macquarie to evaluate each of the gene expression levels using RT-PCR.
The results of RT-PCR are shown below:
Formula: 2^-(ΔΔCt) is used to calculate the fold change of gene expression after induction, in which
ΔCt(control)1= Ct(uninduced operon genes)- Ct(Chloramphenicol gene)
ΔCt(test)2 = Ct(Induced operon genes)-Ct(Induced Chloramphenicol gene)
Finally, use ΔCt(test)2- ΔCt(control)1 to get ΔΔCt.
IPTG and 20mM of glucose were used to induce gene expression. Comparison of 1mM IPTG and 20mM IPTG was made and it was found that 1mM IPTG has a higher gene expression level. It is worth noting that the RT-PCR efficiency might be different for different genes due to varied sizes of PCR products and the formula used above assumes that the PCR efficiency is 100% such that 2 copies of products are eventually obtained.
How did they help us?
In our gene activation experiments, we observed that our truncated dCas9 generally exhibit poorer gene activation compared to full-length wild type. We had hypothesized that this is likely due to poorer target DNA binding, and hence shorter dwell time at the promoter for the VPR transcriptional activator to work effectively. One key weakness with our experiments was that we were unable to"

Regulations for Synthetic Biology
Since synthetic biology is not prominent in Hong Kong, there is no law specifically related to it. Also, the Hong Kong government gives less attention to scientific research itself. In fact, there are laws that only govern the derivative products developed from research. If this legislative trend continues, it is foreseeable that the Hong Kong legislation will consider synthetic biology in more detail when there are more commercialized products that are manufactured from the research of synthetic biology.
Currently, there are only laws related to the genetically modified organisms and guidelines for medical products. In order to monitor genetically modified organisms, Hong Kong implemented the Genetically Modified Organisms (Control of Release) Ordinance and the Genetically Modified Organisms (Documentation for Import and Export) Regulation based on the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, which is an international agreement aims at ensuring the safe handling, transport and use of living modified organisms (LMO). Under the ordinance, the importation of LMO to Hong Kong (except for exemptions provided by the exemption notice) with the intention to be released into the environment requires prior approval from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.
In terms of bio-safety of cloned animals, according to the Hong Kong Agricultural Biotechnology Annual written by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service, Hong Kong government’s awareness towards risk assessment of cloned animals was not sufficient.   Moreover, it is not compulsory to label biotech foods or feeds in Hong Kong. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) in Hong Kong released guidelines for voluntary labeling of biotech foods in 2006 because of the citizens’ urge of informed choices. The guidelines that apply to prepackaged food were constructed by a working groups comprised of members from various sectors including manufacturing, wholesale, retail, consumer groups and government departments. The guidelines mention that it is recommended to include information such as the intended use and presence of animal genes inside a product (Yuen, 2013).
Regulation for medical product is more stringent. If scientists want to apply synthetic biology to develop medical products that have clinical application, they will need to pass all the phases of clinical research. Starting from typical lab test, model organisms test, and finally to human test. Products that pass all these tests are finally allowed to be commercialized.

1. There are two components- the activator and inhibitor
2.Activator's self activation
3.Inhibitor's activation by activator
4.activator's inhibition by inhibitor
5.diffusion speed: Inhibitor>Activator
by following these condition, we designed the original reaction-diffusion model. The first condition ”two components- the activator and inhibitor” is already cleared. We designed Activator and Inhibitor like these;
Activator
cAMP(cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is the second messenger of cellular signaling.  cAMP activate global transcriptional factor CRP(cyclicAMP receptor protein). In our project, we introduce CyaA(cAMP synthase) to E.coli, and express cAMP. Then, activate CRP. This cascade fulfill first condition ,”Self-activation of Activator”. and cAMP secrete from activator cell and effect to Inhibitor cell . So, we can fulfill second condition, ”Activation of Inhibitor by Activator”. We designed biobrick as following. Putting CRP binding site, lac promoter, lacI binding site,(these sites become important to fulfill other conditions. We explain later.) RBS and ompA signal , on the upstream(5’ side) of Biobrick. these parts are Designed by USU iGEM2009,from team Utah state2009, for fused with a silver fusion compatible protein to make a functional device for secretion studies( http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K208017 ). we use this parts for secretion of cyaA and cAMP. when cellular CRP bind to CRP binding site of this parts, transcription of cyaA, and mRFP1(and terminators) will start. We going to register ( http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K336060 ) as a new parts.
Inhibitor
We choose Inhibitor factor as Glucose. When lacZ(β-galactositase/Glucose synthase) express by CRP from Activator cell, synthase transport by ompA signal to periplasm. On periprasm, sythase synthesys Glucose. It effect to Activator cell’s lacI, and repress transcription of Activator plasmid. So, we can fulfill the 4th condition “Activator’s Inhibition by Inhibitor.”  Biobrick of Inhibitor have also same structure with Activator. from Promoter"

Production of lysostaphin
How much lysostaphin is produced by a single cell?
Summary
A model based on Fick’s law for diffusion and the mass balance equation was proposed to determine production rates of lysostaphin produced by Escherichia coli, based on experimental data. This experimental data consisted of modified E. coli cultures that were applied to agar plates containing Staphylococcus aureus. The modified E. coli produced and secreted lysostaphin overtime, which eradicated the S. aureus gradually, creating a band around the E. coli colony. The radius of those bands were measured and used as model input determining the boundary conditions of differential equations used. Integration of the concentration profile determined the total amount of produced lysostaphin. By including a cell count, we were able to determine the lysostaphin production rate for an individual cell. This was however expected to be inaccurate, due to the inability of tracking the number of cells overtime. Nevertheless a reasonable production rate was found and the total production of lysostaphin for a single colony could be determined.
The best that most of us can hope to achieve in physics is simply to misunderstand at a deeper level.
▲
Introduction
Escherichia coli will be used as factory to produce lysostaphin. The amount of lysostaphin a single cell produces is relevant, because there is a certain concentration needed in order to eradicate Staphylococcus aureus. This concentration is referred to as the minimum biofilm eradication concentration or MBEC in short (1). It is therefore important that the concentration within the patch exceeds this concentration there where the patch touches the skin.
A model was designed that estimates the"

Collaborations
Being the first and the only iGEM team from Pakistan, we found the collaborative aspect of iGEM to be very effective. Many teams were willing to guide us through iGEM, and we shared the experiences and insights we had developed by being the country's first iGEMers. The truly international nature of iGEM made it possible to cross cultural and geographical borders, and made science an ambassador in international relations. Even though the constraints of time and experience made it somewhat difficult for us to offer acute technical help, we were extremely eager to help out in any way we possibly could.
User testing Team IIT Madras's Codonut App
IIT Madras built a mobile app Codonut to explain codon optimization in a fun and interactive way. In order to further improve this app, we tested it out ourselves and also shared it with our numerous followers on social media to get quality feedback for IIT Madras. Our feedback consisted of:
Advice about the educational aspect of the game and how they could make it more explanatory about DNA, ribosomes and codon optimization.
Feedback about some aspects of gameplay, that included instructions, color optimizations, reactions and more.
Attention to a typo and some design elements.
We compiled all of our feedback into a report complete with relevant screenshots of the game. This was appreciated by IIT Madras as it helped them understand the end-user's experience. Given the political tension between our two countries, this was a very unique interaction that not only enabled us to bridge divides and share science across borders, but also laid the groundwork for long and lasting relationships for the future.

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!

CRISPR revolutionised genome editing. When compared to older techniques, CRISPR machinery has overcome obstacles as efficiency, experimental time and, mainly, expenses. One milestone of this scientific ascension is its power of democratization: to turn available cutting-edge techniques to researchers from different nationalities, distributed worldwide, in a way that everyone has tools to develop research without demanding a great lab structure and huge amounts of investment. This democratic revolution that CRISPR has brought to science is fantastic and goes beyond the importance of promoting science for all. It’s in the building of this future that we will progress faster, not only in discovering of basic aspects and fundamental researchers as in comprehend genes function as far as CRISPR applications that will change our reality, like genetic editing of cancer cells.
A tremendous range of futuristic possibilities can be turned into reality through CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing system. Even with these rapid advances and the vast applications of this technique, it is essential to pave the way to discuss the social and ethical implications of CRISPR, taking into account the impact in the world and society. By standardizing a “toolbox”, CRISPeasy, to be implemented on standardized genome editing in bacteria, we considered fundamental to be aware of it and discuss the implications of our project.
The CRISPeasy toolbox was developed to expand and further facilitate the genome engineering applying standardized BioBricks, reducing the time for designing, assembling and building devices. Therefore, we aim to provide to iGEM community the power of genetic editing in a few steps. We believe that by through applying bioengineering principles, like standardization and abstraction, we can go fast forward.
Fundamental research provides essential outputs, which is, broadly, the knowledge building block for advancing applied research projects. Bo Huang said in an interview for Nature that he and his lab team took two months to adapt CRISPR to image study in his project “Imaging genomic elements in living cells using CRISPR/Cas9”. Thus, he highlighted that if there were as a more basal knowledge, like design optimization of guide RNAs, it would take less time and required fewer struggles.
Then, we could realize the value of “foundational advances”, that contribute so much to improve the technique, regarding its efficiency, off-target effects and to comprehend CRIS"
TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"Data collection
A project is shaped by its ecosystem - the complex network of interconnected entities such as stakeholders, resources, technologies, trends, regulations and so on. But the relationship is not unidirectional; the project itself can impact elements of the environment, changing it as a whole. Starting with this line of reasoning, we try to predict how Biolink can impact society and industry. We thought that the best way to do this is by asking researchers, scientists and managers that have experience in biofilm or 3D printer related fields.
Remember kids, the only difference between Science and screwing around is writing it down
Adam Savage, Mythbusters.
To collect data in a structured way, we formulated a questionnaire that we’ve sent out, after introducing our project to experts. In this way, we could study different responses on the same questions, gaining a broader view on our project. With the questionnaire, we tried to funnel questions from broad (common biofilm technologies and practices used) to specific (how does 3D biofilm printing fit in). We also formulated questions that seek answers related to biofilm-related ecosystem entities (industry, ethics, regulations, social responsibility, business, research, etc.). The template questionnaire can be viewed here :
Interesting Findings
These responses are fundamental for guiding our project, but they will not be individually discussed here, but rather their influence can be seen all across the project. The most helpful and interesting answers are gathered and categorized.
As a starting category of answers, we wanted to find out the current state of biofilm technologies, in what areas they are most used, and what their strengths and weaknesses are. We received responses from several people that work in both industrial and research settings.
Santiago Salas, Scientist at Colgate-Palmolive
A lot of money and resources go into finding out how to prevent and remove biofilm formation in oral care and pipelines/equipment
Santiago Salas, Scientist at Colgate-Palmolive
“From the point of view of consumer products, it is required to determine the mechanisms by which biofilm can attach to a surface and ultimately whether these can be disrupted or inhibited. The weakest point is that like many other methodologies, it cannot be a substitute for highly expensive clinical testing.”
Dr. Jonathan Tyler, CEO, Tyler Advanced Corrosion Technologies (TACT)
Biofilms are studied due to “Health concerns, industrial damage, and the ecological impact of biofilm-influenced corrosion.”
“There are few strong points to current biofilm technologies, with little or no industry standards, and a profound lack of awareness by industrial leaders and society in general"

Publicity
In order to explain our project and idea in a more interesting and intuitive way, we designed our postcards containing our logo, QR code and brief slogan. We distributed them to those who were interested in our project, and they were also sent to Düsseldorf-Köln to take part in their postcard exchange campaign on behalf on Light Harvester. However, when we continued to carry out our collaboration with other teams, we found postcards far too simple to convey our principle but did better as souvenirs, which motivated us to design our brochures. The brochures, we can see, contained our project description, the theoretical support, our group members, significances of iGEM competition and other important information. In the process, Syngen Tech Co., Ltd, which is an outstanding company in the field of synthetic biology, showed great interest in our project. With the philosophy of serving the country by industries, Syngen Tech Co., Ltd thought it meaningful to carry out comprehensive study on energy crisis and try to find solutions by means of synthetic biology. After seeing our postcards and brochures, and subsequent discussions held between Light Harvester and the company, Syngen Tech Co., Ltd generously decided to give us assistance on material sponsorship. We are very grateful for what Syngen Tech Co., Ltd provided and hope that we can do better in our project and explore more potential of synthetic biology.

FRET ME RUN
As the main principle of our project, FRET is an interesting and useful theory. But it may be a bit obscure for undergraduates, especially those who don’t major in biology. Considering that spreading scientific knowledge to non-scientific people is another aim of iGEM, we came up with an innovation activity called FRET ME, aiming at making the concept of FRET easier to understand.

Wechat
In China, WeChat is a prevailing APP which is similar to Facebook and Snapchat. The articles published on WeChat are accessible to different people in different communities with different backgrounds and different occupations.
We took WeChat as the main tool for online publicity. We gave a simple description of our project and then presented the principles of iGEM and synthetic biology for readers, hoping that through the articles we could receive recognition and support from our mates. And then from the community's comments, we knew about their concerns, which were valuable in our whole design.

Graph: Access to Customer Feedback
Access and use of customer feedback is also highly significant with a p-value of 0.001 and a positive coefficient of 0.527, all other variables held constant. This makes sense as customer feedback is very important in business creation as it directly addresses a customer’s problem, which enables the business to then build a product that solves it, developing into a viable business. Furthermore, customer feedback allows project developers to tweak the product according to changes in trends and customer needs, enabling greater product viability. However, judging from the graph, the survey respondents in general had hardly any customer feedback. This could present an area of improvement for iGEM and iGEM teams for making more successful projects and possibly businesses.

Interestingly, the factor that proves most significant in business creation related to financing is the awareness of government funding with a p-value of 0.001 and ß = 0.482, all other variables held constant. This can be interpreted to mean founding iGEM teams are 1) aware of government funding and can therefore take the opportunity to secure financial support, 2) are highly motivated and are seeking funding from sources outside of the university/iGEM and/or 3) are provided this information from mentors or other sources to support project development. As previously mentioned, the interviewees were very active in finding funding sources, some of which used accelerators and other sponsors. A team that is active and aware of opportunities certainly has an advantage in business creation.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s the low vision project where we do a lot of screening and offer reading glasses for free […].
Daniel C.
[…] What about the SAFE strategy?
Salomi:
[…] It’s S for surgery, A for antibiotics, F for facial cleanliness and E for environmental improvements. Yeah we do it, but then our main focus as BICO is S and A we don’t do F and E […]. But trachoma cannot be treated if we focus on the S and A but we leave out the F and E, they all need to be working together. So we talk with them but it´s not our main focus. There are other organizations who are specifically working on F and E.
Interviewing George Moyo - Data Analyst for BICO
In the provincial Chikwawa we met George, who works as a data analyst for BICO. He just finished his Master thesis in community eye health at Cape Town University, in which he dealt with the data of the Global Trachoma Mapping Program (GTMP). In the interview George told us a lot about the challenges in terms of (global) trachoma data collection and analyses. Furthermore he confirmed that a cheap and fast detection method for chlamydia would be extremely helpful, possibly even the only way to completely eliminate global trachoma.
Daniel C.:
Introduces us and describes the project to George.
George:
When will this project be finished?
Daniel C.:
Pretty soon actually. [...] We’ve just got message that our bacteria are as good as finished. The device is also as good as finished, so now we are testing it.
George:
Oh that’s good! We are supposed to do [...] an operational study that should confirm that itˋs the real trachoma. So we will begin maybe next week. We are going to the field, collect some blood samples, take some swabs. [...] So if you can provide your device we want to use it, because we have a project already. [laughing] We have a budget and we train some people to collect the data, especially blood, how to keep [it], how to collect. So this could be nice. But at the moment the device is not ready [...] but this could be very good. Right now there is PCR [...] to [analyze] if there is chlamydia or if there is no chlamydia.
Daniel C. Dominika Samira:
But I understood it in this way that you only find out later, [after] the people have been treated, [whether they really had the infection].
George:
Yes.
