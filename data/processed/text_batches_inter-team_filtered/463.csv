Week 1:  24/04/2017-30/04/2017
-The 2017 University of Sydney iGEM team met up for the first time (on a     public holiday)
-The project was introduced to us by our PI Nick Coleman as well as team     member Alex Kelly, who introduced the project to Nick at a BioFoundry     meeting.
Week 2:  1/05/2017-7/05/2017
Project design:
•This week the team discussed various insulin analogues on the market as     well as a new type of analogue which is starting to appear in the     literature. This ‘Single chain insulin’ keeps the C-peptide incorporated,     resulting in greater stability.
•We also discussed various expression systems for expressing our insulin.     Steph suggested expressing insulin in yeast. This was thought to be too     difficult as no one had much experience working with yeast.
•Alex referred to several scientific papers that summarised the expression     of insulin in the periplasm of E.coli - allowing for simpler purification     of insulin. He also suggested purification using a His-tag fused to the     protein.
•Various assays to test our insulin were compared. We compared antibody     assays (ELISA), cell culture glucose uptake assays, and an alternative C.     elegans assay where the bioactivity of the insulin can be monitored through     phenotype.
•The team agreed that we wanted to stay away from mice convulsion assays     due to ethical reasons.
Week 3:  8/05/2017-14/05/2017
Project design:
•This week, lead by our team legal expert Steph, the team looked at various     patented single chain and other insulin analogues and summarised their     features. We also looked through the patents for each of these insulins and     to determine which features are covered in the patent.
•We also discussed expression systems for our insulin analogues. Steph     suggested using Bacillus subtilis to secrete our insulin if the protein was     fused to a secretion tag.

10 mL of 10% Triton x-100
1 M MgSO4
0.1 M FeCl3 (anhydrous)
The medium itself is to be prepared in Week 6 once the results of sequencing are (hopefully) acquired.
Week 6 (June 4 - June 8)
This week, we first made a streak plate of our confirmed PetroBrick E.coli Colony 3, Plate 2, as well as a long-term glycerol stock for storage. In accordance with the Washington team’s protocols, we prepared our M9 minGlucose Media (Production Media) with the following reagents:
75mL ddH2O
0.6g Na2HPO4
0.3g KH2PO4
0.05g NaCl (855.6mL 1M solution)
0.2g NH4Cl
20mL of 1M Tris (pH = 7.25)
1mL of 10% Triton
100mL of 1mg/mL thiamine hydrochloride
10mL of FeCl3 (anhydrous)
100mL of MgSO4
**3.0g glucose needed to be added later after the mixture was autoclaved, as glucose is known to caramelize under the conditions of the autoclave.
We also prepared an overnight stock containing 5mL of LB broth inoculated with E.coli from our verified colony. The following day we measured its optical density, demonstrating that our OD was 1.311, suitable for our purposes. We obtained our PetroBrick sequencing results with a complementarity of 87%, as compared to the theoretical PetroBrick in the PartsRegistry, which was deemed by iGEM team leaders to be high enough to continue in our protocol. We also performed glucose filtration, transferring 3g of glucose into our Production Media solution after it had been autoclaved in order to ensure sterile transfer. On the final day of the week, we were able to start our General Production Protocol that would be followed by a 48 hour incubation. It was in this time that hydrocarbon production was reportedly supposed to occur. Use of the GC would occur in the following week to test for alkane production.
Week 7 (June 11 - June 15)
After preparing our production media 48 hour incubation sample for gas chromatography and extracting with ethyl acetate, we left our sample for use in"

    There was also a fair in the location of the Talk for people to sell some interesting made by themselves, and local people would like to go there for entertainment.
 
    We sold our postcards with codes there. Those postcards were specially designed by us, one kind was with riddles. And the answer of it was in the form of codes. Using a software which had a same principle of our Enigma machine, the information can be easily decoded. And that helped a lot to explain our project in a more clear way.
 
What’ the feedbacks?
 
 
    People from that organization also gave us many valuable advice. They are from different backgrounds, and unit together to improve the local cultural life. When we first gave the speech to them through the Internet, those who have studied biology, math and engineering find it easy to understand. However, the project manager, who is a designer, thought it a little confusing. They suggested us to tell a story which conveys the concept of our Enigma machine, which may fascinate the audience. And they also suggested us to split the proper noun from the main content, since the concept itself is very new, and it may take some time for them to understand.
 
What do we think and do?
 
    We are inspired by those sincere feedback, and try to improve our project and the way we introduce it. For an example, we consider feedback 1, and improved our hardware to make it capable of protecting the bacteria inside.  We consider feedback 4, and add answer this question in our future plan . We design what change we need to do in order to deal with more information.
 
    We told them about the improvement, and appreciated him for the suggestion. He was rather astonished that his advice can be taken, since he thought the public can only accept those information from the scientists. We are very glad to give the public an impression that they can also engage in the biology field. And integrate our HP work with the design of the project, which is really exciting.
 
    Since the audience focused more on the content itself, their feedbacks were centered on the feasibility of the project. However, the feedback from the people of the organization were centered on the way we introduced the project and synthetic biology. After the first trial speech, we got to know that our speech contented too much proper noun, which may make it difficult for the general public to understand. In order to change this situation, we improved the way to introduce the project. We cut up the proper nouns and focus more on the idea"

Cell targeting
Context
After the tissue vector action, comes the cell  vector , this one is a modified bacteriophage which has the ability to infect eukaryotic cells. Lambda phage, because of its high capacity of cloning and a capsid structure adapted to a concentrated presence of exogenous proteins, is a good candidate to design an eukaryotic tissue vector . The penton base originally from the adenovirus capsid appears as a promising candidate for Lambda phage targeting. Indeed, it is endowed of several functions like the cell receptors link, the viral particles internalisation and the release of the capsid by the endosome.
Objective
Our objectives are to design a cell vector of Lambda phage type recombined with a penton base from the adenovirus 5 fused by its D protein . The tissue vector should be able to integer the cell, go out of the endosome, transport its DNA to the nucleus of the cell and finally to transcript its therapeutic genes .

Goals for the week:
MAGE out HisB
What we've been trying/why it's not working — keep trying!
PCR out Kan Cassette (colony PCR)- analysis/check that it worked
We did the insertion and have things growing in Kan that look like our cells — we probably have it!
As long as it's the right size and in the right place, it probably worked, meaning we have 2 HIS genes → MAGE is to remove the endogenous genome copy in vivo

Wolfe strain seems to grow really slowly (~36h); try glycerol stock of PKD46, grows faster
Make other 3-AT plates (1.5)
3-AT is a competitive inhibitor of His; the stronger His is expressed, the more 3-AT the cell can tolerate and still grow
Test 3-AT plates
Today's results:
PCR to check whether kan-ZFB-wp-hisura was successfully inserted into the genome
Used KAPA master mix and protocols, same procedure as 6/29/11
Because of KAPA shortage, only ran samples 6-8 from 100µL 6/29 plate and 6-7 from 2mL 6/29 plate plus (ΔHisB)ΔpyrFΔrpoZ+pKD46 from 6/29 culture as a control (should produce a band around 300bp, while the insert would make the band 2-3kb)
Ran on E-Gel with team TolC's samples, but there was an issue loading the gel, so also ran separately on another gel. Unfortunately most of the PCR reactions strangely did not work, but two of the samples appeared not to have the insert (see below).

About Us
We started to prepare for 2018 iGEM a few weeks after the 2017 iGEM. Team leader, vice team leader and group leaders and reserved team members were determined at that time. We held a short training lasting for almost one week at the beginning of winter holiday with the help of our instructors and the college. Brainstorms were held to come up with our new project during the training. Two parts of our project, CRISPR system and indigo synthesis namely, were presented at this time. During the Spring semester, we held project analysis for several times to learn from other teams. ACMA was successfully held as well. General project frame was determined in May with the help of our teachers, advisors, as well as previous iGEMers. Experiments were done from July to October.
Details of our winter training will also be introduced to you here.
Winter training was held a few days after Fall semester. In a training lasting for one week, teachers and speakers will present the basic ideas and knowledge related to molecular biology and synthetic biology. It was our great honor to invite professor Yang Zhang to address several talks related to plant synthetic biology. Laboratory safety was also be emphasized. Considering the short time of winter training, we didn’t prepare experiments as before this year. Timetable of this year’s winter training is"

Team WashU is working towards engineering yeast to produce a wheat rust resistance protein. As a collaboration activity, they expected to collect responses from variety of wheat farmers across the world.  We helped them with relevant data from India. During one of our IHP visits, our team interacted with wheat farmers and collected responses to the specific questions sent by the WashU team. Team also provided the contacts of some farmers in India as part of the collaboration activity, thus helping them to improve their network of farmers and gain information about specifics of damage caused by wheat rust and their preventive measures.
Modeling: iGEM Tec Monterrey
Before going to actual in vitro studies, we wanted to check how our design of oscillatory circuit works in silico. We had already prepared a stochastic model of the circuit, but we wanted to verify it from experts.  We had a discussion with iGEM Tec Monterrey to discuss about the project earlier in this iGEM Season and they helped us out with our modelling. They verified our program and equations for us, and suggested the concepts such as leakage transcription which we missed to take into account. Their help was very valuable in terms of refinement of modelling of our initial circuit design.  Even though we were not able to gather the experimental data and decided to go about designing a different circuit , conversations with iGEM Tec Monterrey were highly informative and educative for our modeling experience.

First of all, we introduced our project to him. Then we consulted hem about some frequently used sewage disposal methods in relative companies. He told us that methods such as precipitation, resin adsorption, reverse osmosis and electrochemical methods are the most frequently used methods. He also suggested that biological methods aren’t the most prevalent yet except microbial methods. Many factories utilized the microorganisms to extract and purify precious heavy metal from the tailings.
During the interview, Dr. Tang also asked us about the state of the metal that we retrieve as well as the adaptability of our bacteria. He mentioned that these two problems are pivotal for the further development of our project. He also said that he was passionate about biological methods because there are inevitable disadvantages in chemical methods such as the high expenses, secondary pollution, low specificity and so on.
We also consulted him about the aspects to which enterprises pay more attention because we wanted to improve the practical value of our project. The most important aspect is the manipulation of the technology. There are many technicians in the company who barely know about the principle of the technology. Therefore, it is vital for them to manipulate easily without knowing the principles. Secondly, companies also pay a lot attention to whether the technology can cause pollution to the environment. Companies are optimistic about new technologies because not only are they beneficial for the company itself, the government encourages the development of new technology as well.
In the end, Dr. Tang said that our project was aiming at a practical problem in our society and that we should improve the accuracy of heavy metal adsorption. The prospect of our project will be better as long as we keep polishing the details of it.
Conference of China iGEMer Committee
On 14th-15th August, our team was invited by Peking University to attend CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee). The summit was a rehearsal of the Jiant Jamboree in September. All the 31 teams invited to the summit were invited to give presentations about their project. The speculators can ask questions about them. Besides, previous captains of Peking-iGEM and Tsinghua-iGEM were also invited to give speeches about the development of synthetic biology in China. We also brought our posters with us and discussed our projects with teams all around China.
The precious experience not only enlightened us about the design of our experiment, but also provided us with new ideas about synthetic biology. The presenters in our team also got more familiar with the presentation.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Hydroponics is the future of agriculture.  Compared to traditional farming, hydroponics demands less maintenance, fewer resources, and most importantly, less land.  It is a rapidly growing industry that is projected to be a $31.4 billion global market by 2022, with a growth rate of 6.7% annually [1].  As the population inches ever closer to carrying capacity, as the resources become ever scarcer, and as the climate becomes ever warmer, hydroponics is the most promising solution to ensure a sustainable world - one where no one is left hungry.
But despite its immense potential, hydroponics is severely limited by diseases, nutrient imbalances, and other environmental stresses.  In particular, the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known for affecting crop growth by hindering nutrient uptake, damaging cellular structures, and inducing undesirable immune responses [2].  Even though the current market offers technologies that can measure oxidative stress, they are often fragile, expensive, and lacking spatial resolution.  Moreover, little effort has been made to improve existing technologies.
At Cornell iGEM, we believe that we can do better.
ROS may be notorious for being correlated with cancer and aging, but perhaps paradoxically, research has also shown that a sufficient level of oxidative stress is critical to the growth and survival of any organism, whether it’s bacteria, humans, or plants [3].  Therefore, the essence of successful hydroponics is not the removal of all external stress, but rather its optimization.  We seek to control oxidative stress - to respond to any minute change in the environment rapidly and efficiently, and to modulate the ideal equilibrium state for each and every crop.  We accomplish this feat through a novel platform with dual functionality.  First, the platform allows for real-time, biologically-relevant reporting of the environmental oxidative stress via redox-sensitive fluorescent proteins.  Second, it employs an optogenetic circuit to express, with"

We could proof the change of the structure of 2‑NPA when irradiated with our LED panel by absorption measurements . It is detectable that LB‑media supplemented with a fresh stock solution of 2‑NPA in ethanol has a high absorption in the UV‑spectrum (< 370 nm). When irradiated over several hours, a peak at ~ 340 nm appears and grows over irradiation time. This indicates that the conversion of 2‑NPA to its cyclic form with causes a shift in the absorption spectrum.
Photoswitching of AzoF with our LED panel. Changes in the absorption spectrum of AzoF when irradiated with light of 367 nm or 465 nm. Naturally, cis and trans conformations are mixed (black) but can be primed by irradiation to the cis‑conformation (red) if irradiated with UV‑light or to the trans‑conformation (blue) by irradiating with blue light. The cis‑primed AzoF can be primed to trans again (green) and then back to cis (purple) until the amino acid degrades.
We could proof that our LED panel is suitable for photochanging 2-NPA and thus for the photolysis of proteins containing 2-NPA. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of the changing process of 2-NPA over time by absorption measurements.
Photobleaching & Destruction
To fulfill the advice of Prof. Noll to examine the damage of proteins by UV‑light at the light‑induced elution we performed some tests and investigated the bleaching effect of our panel on GFP. We irradiated cell lysate samples of a GFP producing E. coli culture for 1 hour at 100 % brightness with both versions of our LED panel and measured the fluorescence signal (ex.: 485 nm, em.: 515 nm) every ten minutes. At both wavelengths there was an observable decrease in the fluorescence signal. The effect was stronger when GFP was irradiated at 367 nm with a total fluorescence loss of approximately 40 %. When irradiated at 465 nm, the loss over one hour was about 20 %. This was surprising because the stronger bleaching effect was expected for blue light. Blue light excites the fluorophore of GFP, which leads to a bleaching effect. The UV‑light should not excite the fluorophore less, which is why a weaker bleaching effect was expected.

Overview
Figure 4 Quantity of the different free, unbound species in the cell over time. CepR gets bound by C8-HSL immediately and is therefore not found in free form.
The expression of EsaR, EsaI and CepR is driven by the same transcription rate, as they are transcribed into the same mRNA. Whereas EsaR gets bound to 3OC6-HSL and dimerised to EsaRHSL2, EsaI increases during time and produces 3OC6-HSL (Fig. 4). CepR is not really detectable in its free form at any time, because it binds to C8-HSL fast, which is produced by CepI. This is due to the transcription of mRNACFP_CepI before EsaR gets expressed and can repress transcription of mRNACFP_CepI. The first gene of interest (CFP) gets expressed just as CepI from the beginning. The formation of CepRHSL2 from CepR and C8-HSL induces further the transcription of the second gene of interest (mRFP).
DNA binding
Figure 5 Binding of the DNA to different Proteins over time.
If we simulate DNA binding over time we get a graphical trend that shows DNA gets bound to different proteins at different time points (Fig. 5). While free DNA (blue) decreases, the other species increase. After about 2 minutes DNA gets first bound to EsaR (yellow), which is expressed constitutively and its expression is positively influenced by a feedback loop by binding in front of PesaS which facilitates polymerase recruitment. However, EsaR binds"

Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," much more efficient optimization of existing genetic systems, is that scale up of biomolecule production could be done much more quickly than is now possible. This is significant because it is foreseeable that in the future a rare chemical or medicine derived from biological sources could require rapid scale up, and the ability to quickly optimize coding sequences could be extremely valuable.
BIODETOXIFICATION PATHWAY PROJECT:
Our strains of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida are engineered to be unable to survive outside of the laboratory and we use antibiotics to prevent other bacteria from growing. However, if our materials should ever become contaminated with wild-type bacteria, they could potentially transfer antibiotic resistance markers between hosts. We are inserting the neomycin resistance marker into the genome of P. putida and intend to remove it via homologous recombination in a second round of cloning. If that sample becomes contaminated, it is theoretically possible that other bacteria could acquire this antibiotic resistance. The late stage goal of this project is to engineer E. coli with a pathway to degrade the furfural toxin, which would allow it to survive in the presence of furfural and also metabolize it for energy. At a larger scale we could unknowingly be selecting for a more robust bacteria if any wild-type E. coli was ever able to acquire the pathway or antibiotic resistance markers.
Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them.
CODON OPTIMIZATION:
Since transgenic organisms almost always grow slower than their wild type counterparts, our hosts, shackled with a metabolically demanding reporter gene such as GFP would stand little chance at reproduction in the wild. In addition, by knowing the sequence of DNA in the plasmid harboring the fluorescent gene, measures could be taken to disable the transcriptive or translational machinery in these organisms. We are committed to making this data available to anyone who would require it.
BIODETOXIFICATION:
The biodetoxification project currently uses an auxotrophic strain of E. coli, in which it cannot grow without leucine. In the future we would intend for others to use similarly auxotrophic strains for biofuel production. If a strain of E. coli was engineered that it could live on furfural, this facility would have to be kept separate from other facilities producing furf"

Hevea brasiliensis is a fast growing tree that belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae. Though smaller when grown in plantations, the wild tree can grow up to 36 meters tall. The lesser height in plantations is due to the draining of latex. The tree is mature for latex production when it reaches the age of 7-8 years and has a period of employment lasting approximately a quarter century. The percolation of latex is done by attaching a bowl to the tree and making an incision into the cortex of the tree, thus letting the latex slowly drain into the bowl. Source: The Great Danish Encyclopedia (Link) World wide there exists many high-yielding clones of Hevea brasiliensis, ranging from 900-1600 kg/ha/yr from exotic strains to 2000-3500 kg/ha/yr from Nigerian clones.

ICEFINITY: CIRCULARIZED AFP
Inteins have been proven to be an efficient way to circularize proteins1. Furthermore, studies have shown that joining the termini of proteins leads to a significant increase in their thermo-stability2, 3. In 2014, The Heidelberg iGEM team worked on generating BioBricks which allow for this circularization. This year, our Icefinity project sought out to stabilize the Type III antifreeze protein (AFP) using their methods, specifically utilizing the Npu dnaE split intein found in part BBa_K1362000.
Design & Cloning
A thorough dry lab analysis was performed to determine the appropriate linker needed to circularize the AFP. Details about this crucial dry lab stage are described on our Modeling Page . After selecting the optimal linker (GAA), The AFP-linker-extein insert sequence was then designed to be compatible with the Golden Gate Assembly technique necessary for BBa_K1362000; BsaI cut sites were placed on the ends of the insert sequence to allow for successful insertion into Heidelberg’s BioBrick. The final designed insert is illustrated below in Figure 1.
Figure 1. Designed construct of BBa_; our circular AFP.
The cloning of our circAFP began with a Golden Gate Assembly Reaction, the insert being our AFP-linker-extein sequence described above. Golden Gate Assembly involved a one-pot reaction, where both insert and vector were cut then ligated to generate a pSB1C3 plasmid containing our gene of interest. The Golden Gate Assembly Reaction was then transformed onto Topten electro-competent E. coli cells and plated onto Chloramphenicol-resistant plates. Successful cloning was determined by colony growth and colour (Heidelberg’s part contained an RFP; therefore, non-red colonies would indicate successful gene insertion). Colonies were picked and screened for our gene of interest. Next, our gene of interest was then inserted into a plasmid containing a T7 promoter and ribosomal-binding site to be used for protein expression. To determine successful insertion, further colony screening was performed (Figure 2).

Stockholm,2015,Team:Stockholm#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," With Aalto-Helsinki and Pasteur Paris we have discussed the need for digital collaboration platforms for iGEM. Later we got in touch with even more teams. We designed a membrane protein Biobrick with BGU Israel, wrote for the Amoy newsletter, collaborated with Zurich on characterization, sent materials to Freiburg and gave modeling tutorials to CGU Taiwan. Getting to know these teams has been a pleasure and we are looking forward to meeting even more great teams in Boston!
iGEM Stockholm will be back next year. We've built an organization that will last, and the alumni of this year’s team are determined to make sure that next year’s team will take of with a running start. We have founded an association and have started planning how to headhunt project leaders that will carry the torch. Our year has been an amazing experience. Thanks to everyone that has made this possible!

What are your plans after university?
Revolutionizing the world! [REF]
Why did you join iGEM?
Same Same but Different! That is what iGEM can offer you… use the same parts but make something different. Who can’t resist?!
Let’s say you had to choose two celebrities to be your parents, who do you choose and why?
Helen Mirren, because she is incredible actress and incredibly British! And Andre Agassi, because he was one of the best tennis player in the world and he has quite a story to tell.

+ Three questions to Katrine
What are your plans after university?
I have one year left on my master, but I’m still trying to figure out what I want to do after that. I love working with projects such as iGEM where you work on potential solutions for current and future problems and needs. I can imagine myself either working in a consulting company or potentially work in start-up/smaller companies within Life Science.
Why did you join iGem?
At my previous university, my class mates attended iGEM and it looked like a lot of fun as I like working in teams. I was surprised that Stockholm was not that active within the iGEM society. I think it is a great opportunity for me to use academic skills on a real-life case.
Your pet gains the ability to speak, what does he tell us about you?

INSA-Lyon,2016,Team:INSA-Lyon#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," data, with flags -ignore_zero_occupancy and -no_minimize, and let it run for 20000 cycles (by default).
The algorithm used is Rosetta’s FARNA[5] (Fragment Assembly of RNA), a Monte-Carlo process, guided by a low-resolution knowledge-based energy function.
Step 4: Minimization
Rosetta will now score the structures and minimize only the 100 best ones                                   (atoms are moved in space to reach a local minimum of potential energy).
Remark: it is a delicate step, because we selected the 100 best structures before having minimized them. This intermediate step is required in order to prevent missing out on better candidates.
Step 5: Selection of the best ones
We ask Rosetta to score the structures, so we can end up with the 5 best ones.                                   This time, each structure corresponds to a local minimum of potential energy, so comparing structures really makes sense.
Step 6: Saving the results in PDB files
Rosetta exports the atom coordinates to write a PDB file.
Step 7 (only is the input was a DNA sequence): Retro-transcription into DNA
Our home-made python script can be used to modify the PDB files to change uracile bases into thymines and to deoxygenate riboses. Finally, structures are re-minimized to adapt atom coordinates from RNA to DNA.
Reliability
The structures you get as outputs may differ from one another. That is the reason why we keep the five most probable structures in the end instead of only one.                                       Indeed, we can often observe variable domains and stable ones.
Fig. Superposition of the 20 most probable structures of the ATP aptamer
We also made some analysis by comparing the models we obtained with the experimental PDB structures, obtained by X-ray crystallography, for the following single-strand nucleic acids:
ATP Aptamer[4]
HIV Reverse-Transcriptase (RT) Aptamer[6]
Thrombin Aptamer (contains a G-quadruplex)[7]
Human telomerase mRNA[8]
First, we superposed the 20 best structures to the native one.
Fig. ATP aptamer (left), HIV-RT aptamer (right). The green structures are native PDB files from X-ray crystallography, the coloured ones are our predicted structures.
Then we used a measure of distance between the “real” native structure and the predicted one called RMSD (Root Mean Standard Deviation), the square-root of the sum of atom distances squared. In parallel, Rosetta"
BIT-China,2014,Team:BIT-China#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," means you apply to ligase genes?
We do have difficulties in assembling biobricks.We have tried many ways to solve this problem including 3A Assembly，Amplified Insert Assembly and gene splicing by overlap extension PCR.
3A Assembly (which stands for three antibiotic assembly) is a method for assembling two part samples and selecting for correct assemblies through antibiotics. 3A assembly uses the restriction sites on the prefix and suffix to assemble part samples. This new composite part will maintain the same prefix and suffix as its ""parents"" and contain a scar, where the cut and re-ligated restriction sites were stitched together.
Amplified Insert Assembly is a method of ""BioBricking"" two biological parts (i.e. pieces of DNA) together. This method combines the ease and flexibility of 3A assembly with the reliability of standard assembly. In comparison to 3A assembly, this method can take up to two hours longer Splicing overlap extension by PCR is a convenient method to obtainrecombinant gene.
Q11:Is your lock too simple?
A: Our system is not just three genetic circuits. It was because that the time was limited so we just design three circuits for the IGEM competition. We will keep on discovering new “Transcription factor”and “Chaperone” to extend our system.
Q12: Gene sequencing
A: Although the sequence of the human genome has been completely determined by DNA sequencing, it is not yet fully understood. Future projects and areas of research related to the human genome are seemingly endless.
Q13: How does the AHL generated? What is its specific role is? How do you control the amount of the AHL to make the concentration of the bacteria at an appropriate value?
A: Bacteria can release a class of freely accessible small molecule bacterial cell signaling factors to the surrounding environment - Homoserine Lactone (AHL), AHL can be used as a self-inducing agent in the Qs system. The flora density can be induced by self-induced molecular. About the solution of the AHL, We can optimize the concentration repeatedly and use modeling to simulate the cellular state.
Q14:Since your system is so huge, then will your have room to add something more?
A: Certainly. At first, we put our system into E.coli. by two plasmids. After our system work normally, we will integrate our system into the genome of E.coli. by some experiments. Genome is just like a huge plasmid of E.coli. At that time the scientists will have room to do some other work on E.coli.

ERRATA: The band present in the negative control is not due to the water used, or LB, as confirmed by Fasih, who performed colony PCR and negative control using LB. The prime candidates for this band are contamination in the primers or in the Taq Red, both of which are shared by all the members in iGEM.

M1-AB, BC, CA were excised for subsequent purification.
M2-AB, BC, CA were NOT excised. The band pattern had a double band near the 100 bp mark, and the resulting digestion was unusable. The plasmid stocks used for digestion for M2-AB, BC, CA were dilute (~100 ng/uL), which may account for this result.

Of course, science is impossible without collaboration. Our project would not have been possible if it had not been for the innumerable times we were helped by our undergraduate mentors, our supervisor, Brian Teague, our PI, Ron Weiss and other researchers in the lab. From teaching us how to pipet, debugging our PCR problems to lending us parts to use in our project, providing expert insight on doing western blots or running cytometry on our cells, they were with us all the way. We were also helped throughout the summer by the MIT Bioengineering Department’s Writing and Communication Lab, which instructed us from skills ranging from reading scientific papers to making an effective poster to presenting a good talk. Without all the help and guidance we received, we would be lost.
New England iGEM (NEGEM)
Being in Boston with another hundred colleges and universities around us means it only makes sense for the iGEM teams to meet up. A Boston University tradition started in 2012, the 2014 NEGEM consisted of the BU, MIT, Harvard, Rutgers, Tufts, and Worcester Polytechnical Institute iGEM teams. We met three times throughout the course of our summer, presenting and critiquing our projects and presentations, and discussing possible improvements to research methods, presentation style and effectiveness. We also discussed the possibility collaborations between the teams.
We would like to give our warmest thanks to Traci Haddock and the BU team for organizing this wonderful and useful event.

Then you need to add the restriction sites on both sides of the sequence                                         by PCR. A pair of reference primers below is provided.

Well, so it sounds like it would be nice for you to have some meetings, for example in the capital or in another big city but you want to see the field conditions as well.
Daniel C., Dominika and Kai:
Yes.
Dr. Keenan:
I can certainly ask the Carter Center where we work in Ethiopia and also Indonesia. Although, I don’t know whether I can recommend Indonesia because of the security situation right now. Ethiopia is pretty dodgy also. But I think Ethiopia is fine. I don’t know.
Daniel C.:
It should be fine. I mean, as I believe, there are mostly demonstrations and if you keep away from those that can turn violent, you should be ok I guess.
Dr. Keenan:
Should be. The Carter Center has temporary canceled all travel to Ethiopia. So we are supposed to go there in December and then again January/February. So I am hoping that they will reverse that decision before. Anyhow, I can certainly ask them what they think. You know I am sure it would be tough for them to make a visit to the field just for you guys, but maybe it will work that they were going to be going anyway there for something, than you can tag along.
Daniel C., Dominika und Kai:
Ok.
Dr. Keenan:
What’s your timeline for that?
Daniel C.:
I am afraid our timeline is very unrealistic. We are going to the MIT to present (our project) at the end of October, like 27th to 31th. And we were planning to go to Africa before that, so maybe in two weeks or something.
Dr. Keenan:
Ok. I can still ask them. I mean you don’t work for the Carter Center. If you guys feel comfortable with Addis [Abeba] you can still do that on your own and at least talk to them in Addis Abeba. I am not sure, it might be difficult to arrange a trip out to the field. But they would definitely be happy to talk to you just in Addis Abeba. Let me just talk to them and see what they say. If you don’t hear from me in the next couple of days, will you e-mail me to see what’s up?
Daniel C.:
Yes, sure! No problem. We’ll just pester you until we get a response.

Analysis
This gel illuminates some things about our expression and purification procedure.
The band at around 40 kDa matches the expected size for honeybee silk based off of the paper we are using as a guideline, so we are getting at least some of the expected product.
There is a large contaminating band at 15 kDa. It is presumably an insoluble protein, just likely the"

Background
Promoter Pcar [BBa_K861171] is a glucose responsive promoter created by WHU-China in 2012. Pcar promoter region was de novo  designed with overlapping of CRP and RNA polymerase binding site. The initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase may be hindered by the binding of CRP, which occurs at the formation of cAMP-CRP complex in the low concentration of glucose. In other words, when the amount of glucose is high enough, Pcar would be turned on after the leaving of CPR due to the low concentration of cAMP, and vice versa.
PhlF repressor system contains the repressor PhlF [BBa_K1725041] and the PhlF repressible promoter [BBa_K1725001] created by Glasgow in 2015. PhlF could repress GFP fluorescence intensity by 83-fold according to the study of Glasgow’s work.
Lysis gene [BBa_K117000] created by NTU-Singapore in 2008 encodes Lysis protein which could not only lyse bacterial cell membrane but also activate the endonuclease of Colicin E7 (ColE7). The lysis-colicin is one class of bacteriocins which are produced to response to worsening environmental conditions and outcompete other bacteria1.
NucA [BBa_K1159105] created by TU-Munich in 2013 from Staphylococcus aureus produces a thermostable exo- and endo-nuclease that is able to degrade genomic DNAs2. NucA also has a role in the cleavage of extracellular DNAs and preventing biofilm formation.
We’ve innovated this year a novel glucose responsive repressor system (Pcar-wRBS-PhlF-T-Pr-sRBS-GFP/pSB1C3 [BBa_K2230012]) by connecting these two system created by previous iGEM teams and extend the function of them. Furthermore, based on this new system, we assembled lysis and nuclease genes to the device and created the suicide circuit controlled by the presence of glucose (Pcar-wRBS-PhlF-T-Pr-sRBS-GFP-sRBS-lysis-sRBS-NucA/pSB1C3 [BBa"

COPPER BINDING ASSAY
To begin, our team determined the standard copper concentration curve by measuring the average absorbance of various copper concentration solutions, and determined that the standard curve is linear. We can then relate the absorbance to the amount of copper left in solution; therefore, we can determine how efficient the metal binding proteins are, how many ions can be removed, the protein activity, optimal concentration of binding and optimal time of binding.
Figure 4 - Graph of standard copper concentration curve. Measured standard concentrations of copper in solution to provide a frame of reference for future copper binding assay.
Figure 5 - Graph demonstrating the absorbance of the copper solution after CutA (copper binding protein) was introduced as a function of time. Measured absorbance over various time intervals and determined that the optimal time is 60 minutes, and the optimal concentration is 151mg/L.
We added the CutA protein to the copper solutions and left the samples for several time intervals. After the given time intervals, the process of salting out was used to aggregate the remaining proteins in the solution while they remained bound to the copper. Then, following centrifugation, we measured the absorbance of the remaining solution, making sure to minimize capturing protein from the sample.  At approximately an hour the absorbance was lowest in all samples demonstrating that the most copper was bound at that point. The concentration at 151mg/L seems to show the optimal amount of binding over time.  However, our data does not show a significant change in absorbance and therefore there is not a significant change in the amount of copper ions being bound by the protein . This is likely because there was not enough protein being introduced into the reaction during our assay. To validate this idea we created a model demonstrating the binding events in our assay. This model showed that insufficient amounts proteins were indeed the issue and is explained more in depth on the modelling page. (Click here to view modelling page)
BACTERIOPHAGE ASSAY
The relationship between bacteriophage and bacteria is crucial to the implementation of our project. To demonstrate this relationship and help to improve our mathematical modelling, we completed a phage assay. We used a 96 well plate and filled various wells with a specific amounts of bacteria. Then introducing various concentrations of phage to specific wells, and using a plate reader we measured the absorbance during 23 hours.

We plated 100μL of afp1 culture on fresh Aspergillus plates to demonstrate its effectiveness. We ran a PCR for pC13AI with primers 45/52 and 48/51 to add homologous regions for Gibson. The PCR protocol was a 1-step PCR with a 60C annealing temperature and 1:10 extension using GC buffer. We picked colonies from new pC13CO plates. We miniprepped pC13CL colonies 3 and 4, and pC13BN colonies 5 and 6 although the results of the gel was not clear. We redid the PCR for pC13BN. We also redid the PCR to append cut sites to pC13F for creation of pC13BF. We did a PCR clean up for the inserts in pC13BG, pC13P and pC13AF. We ran a PCR for pC13J and pC13BG.

Expert Interview
In order to investigate the affect of an RDT in Sub-Saharan Africa, we asked a professor with years of experience in Muhuru Bay to give us some insight to the culture and how to integrate our design with that culture.
Social and Political Research
To talk about health is to talk about culture. This analysis shows some possible cultural barriers to HIV mitigation as well as some possible benefits of an RDT. Overall, an RDT should help to empower and inform populations in order to obtain more effective care for themselves and their families. With knowledge comes the power to change, and change is in desperate scarcity when it comes to the culture surrounding HIV infection in the region.
Economic Research
HIV/AIDS is a degenerative illness. In this sense it does not inflict damage quickly and violently, but rather, insidiously and slowly. It is draining economically in both the direct costs associated with treatment and the indirect costs. Indirect cost takes the form of the productive years lost when life is cut short as well as the ability to do work taken by the disease. HIV/AIDS takes a great economic toll on countries afflicted by the disease. It is a particular drain on those still developing economies.
Education In our Lab
During the course of the summer, our lab hosted a high school student, Justin Park, as well as a fellow Duke undergraduate, Daniel Getman, in our lab. Both young men shadowed lab members and learned about the different procedures associated with synthetic biology. While we were sad to see Justin leave at the end of the summer, we really enjoyed being able to teach him so much about something that he didn't know much about. Daniel is continuing to shadow our team and hopes to join future teams.  Both of our students were also guests on our youtube channel. Click here to learn more about Justin"

Quantification of Benzene  via GC/Mass Spectrometry
Dates of Collaboration: 10/7/17-10/16/17
Where: GC/Mass Spec Facility- MSU
-Dr. Dan Jones
Preparing Phage Lysate
Purpose- The overall genetic construct used to degrade benzene into acetyl-coA and pyruvate consists of 9 enzymes, and was broken into two plasmids to increase the success rate of cloning.  Purdue only has been able to clone the first of these two plasmids into E. coli, Upper Operon (UO). The upper operon expresses several enzymes pertaining to benzene degradation, however it does not express the protein transporter necessary for cellular benzene uptake. To get around this obstacle, you will test the induced cellular lysate instead of the living culture via GC. At the end of this protocol, you should have 30mL of uninduced cellular lysate and 30mL of induced cellular lysate.

iGem Safety Rules
For iGEM 2010 teams are asked to detail how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects. Specifically, teams should consider the following questions:    1.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?    2.Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry? how did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams learn from your experience?    3.Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project? If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?    4.Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Log_-_-_TEXT.html," into iGEM this year and the team seemed very interested in collaborating with us on the board game front. We intend to meet with them when we travel to London in August.
Following this we carried out research into current education on synthetic biology and unfortunately found there was very little education prior to postgraduate level, despite there being a fair amount of funding going into the field. In 2015, £40M was invested into synthetic biology research in the UK (see link) 1. This has encouraged our team to want to look at potential ways to close that gap between funding and education, and introduce the synthetic biology earlier on. One way of doing this is developing a new module for the university.
A few members of the team worked through papers on the killswitch KillerRed to gauge the current level of characterisation for it.

The work experience student worked through iGEM Labster and his feedback was that he thinks it needs better prompts to be more accessible. We spoke with him about his current GCSE syllabus, and found that synthetic biology could be taught alongside genetic modification and cloning. However, some students are confused between the differences of cloning and genetic modification. He also gave us his thoughts on the board game and overall he said it looks fun.
Peter Reader, a past Exeter iGEM team member, spoke with us about potential problems to be careful of. He advised us to be wary of parts which haven’t been used much, as it tends to mean they haven’t been characterised well meaning more room for error. He also advised meeting multiple lecturers to have them pull our ideas apart, point out potential flaws and make suggestions to amend these problems.
We also spoke with Ryan Edginton, a former iGEM member, about the wiki and the presentation. He gave us basic facts about the wiki, for example what happens on the day of the wiki freeze and required content.
He also gave us some more detailed advice about developing a brand for the project, including a logo and colour scheme, establishing a team leader for each section, fully defining the meaning of all equations used and explain the symbols and constants involved, and constantly keep testing on all internet browsers to ensure the wiki works on all browsers.

8 - two bands, around 100 bp
9 - one band around 100 bp
Clearly the results indicate that no activator was made.  However, because it took a long time to set up the apparatus before imaging, it is quite possible that some bands were missed.  Will re-run this gel once more.
**Mistakenly ran a gel of the promoters in place of the activators.  How foolish!!!  Will definitely have to run another gel for the activators separately.  Note that the results we saw for this gel are basically identical to those observed for the promoters previously.
Gel for activators:

6 - one band around 2000-3000, another at 1000-2000, and then two bands around 100 bp
7 - two bands around 100 bp
Resuls indicate that PCR definitely worked for ZifA minus promoter and LexA minus promoter.  The presence of the second band on the LexA is somewhat concerning, however.  Could this be due to adding the incorrect products to this tube?

Supernatant samples from C. difficile cultures over five days were obtained for specific times points and the sterile supernatants applied to the Vero cells. Cytotoxicity was estimated using a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. Our results suggest that ‘asRNA Construct One’ reduces the rate of toxin production by 80% whilst asRNA Construct Two reduces it by 85% over wild type.
Cytotoxicity of C. difficile supernatants.The graph shows supernatant cytotoxicity over a period of 120 hours. There is considerably less toxin production by C. difficile containing asRNA construct 1 and C. difficile containing asRNA construct 2 than by wild type C. difficile.
Rate of toxin production.C. difficile containing asRNA construct 1 and C. difficile containing asRNA construct 2 exhibit a significantly slower rate of toxin production than wild type C. difficile. Here we see an 80% reduction in the rate of toxin production by C. difficile containing asRNA construct 1 and an 85% reduction in the rate of toxin production by C. difficile containing asRNA construct 2.
General conclusion
Our aim was to offer a treatment for Clostridium difficile infections which would not involve antibiotic treatment. Avoiding antibiotics is desirable because of the antibiotic resistance crisis and the risk of relapse associated with broad-spectrum antibiotic use in cases of C. difficile infection (CDI). The alternative treatment we focused on is based on a phage which specifically infects strains of C. difficile. As such our project is a phage therapy project, but instead of simply relying on the natural abilities of the phage ‘phiSBRC’ we have designed genetic constructs to enhance its function as a treatment for CDI.
The phage we worked with (phiSBRC) is a temperate phage. This means that its normal lifecycle involves integration into the genome of C. difficile in which it can remain for many generations before excising from the genome to replicate and release many phage progeny into the environment. This natural lifecycle does not make it immediately amenable to serving as a therapeutic since many bacterial cells could escape the lethal effects of the phage initially as it integrates into the genome to lie dormant. This facet of its biology would essentially make the phage too slow acting to be a useful therapeutic against CDI. Our aim was to genetically engineer phiSBRC in such a way as to render it capable of suppressing toxin production within the C. difficile cells it integrates"

Human  Practices, Collaboration& Society:
We performed Language project with IIT  Madras and received the finished video a few days later.
We helped another iGEM team, CSU-China to  establish their team. We issued our Emoji chanllenge on the  official website and received some interesting feedback shortly after that.
Technical works Wet& Dry labs:
Wet  lab: Inspired by our Human Practice, we raised an idea of designing a device  for the growth of engineered E.coli strain. First we drew a draft on  paper and then used the software Solid Works to draw a 3D version draft.  Eventually, a real device came out. The device provided a great help to our  further experiments because it provided a suitable place for the engineered  strain to grow.
Near the end of this month, we performed gas chromatography to detect the amount of acetylene reduced to indirectly test the nitrogen fixation activity of our system. Up to wiki freeze, samples have been sent out and we will receive the result about five days later.
Dry lab: We refined our model by further reading literature and verifying one of our assumptions. In that way, we got a  more accurate result. This result provided useful guidance to our further  experiments.
Protocol
Plasmids and Bacterial Strains.
The bacterial strains, plasmids and primers used in this study are all listed in  Table 1. Escherichia  coliJM109 was purchased from Takara and  designated EJ. A high-copy plasmid, pUC57-nif (pMB1 ori), harboring the minimal nitrogen fixation gene  cluster (nif) of Paenibacillus polymyxa CR1 was chemically synthesized and then  transformed into E. coli JM109, and the resulting recombinant was designated EJN. For  construction of the second plasmid, pJQ200SK OmpA/PbrR (with  a compatible p15A ori), a lab store  plasmid pBAD24-OmpA/PbrR was used as  the template to PCR-amplify OmpA/PbrR with P200F and P200R primers. After confirmation by sequencing, the PCR product was digested with Kpn I and Hind III"

Who are team CLSB?
Team CLSB UK is an iGEM team from the United Kingdom on the High School track. They have 20 team members. Would you like to search for another team, search for a part or exit?
Protocols
And you can get a protocol by first asking the app to find some. Due to certain restrictions you can't ""one-shot"" the protocols command on Google Assistant (i.e. ""find ligation protocols""). However, this does work on Amazon Alexa.
Find protocols
Sure. What protocol are you looking for?
The app will then prompt you to tell it what protocol you want. For example, if you want a ligation protocol you'd just say
Ligation
Ok, I've found Ligation protocol. Ligation lets you take a strand of DNA that has compatible sticky ends and insert it into a vector. Would you like a step-by-step guide or to exit?
The app will then search the Protocat database and find you relevant protocols. It will then read out the summary for that protocol. You can begin the step-by-step guide for that protcol by saying
A step-by-step guide
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
The app will then proceed to read out the first step. Once you're ready, you can ask the app to move on to the next step. If you missed a step you can ask the app to repeat it, and if you've gone too far you can ask the app to go back.
Next
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Repeat
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Back
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
Where possible, the app will try to remember where you are in the protocol in case you accidentally quit the app.
If you want to add your own protocols simply add them to ProtoCat , a protocols database created by Michigan Software 's iGEM team. Once you’ve added protocols there, you'll be able to use them in the app within a couple of minutes.
Privacy
You can find out how we use data provided to the app in our privacy policy . We think it’s truly a gripping read.

WEEK TEN
20th-24th August 2012
Last Friday was the Google Campus meetup for all UK iGEM teams – it was a great success! The talks were all really good, our three speakers were particularly dazzling, and all of the teams had brilliant ideas. Our networking with other teams was put to the test as we exchanged details and business cards with several iGEM’ers. The opportunity to both give and receive feedback on our projects with other teams was very insightful.
This experience set us up nicely to start our preparations in making the design to our final presentation, ready for the jamboree in Amsterdam!
This week our wetlab team is still trying to PCR wbbC out of the E. coli genome. So far it still hasn’t worked! However Christine assured us that sometimes only a one in a million dilution will work with DMSO to get the genomic DNA into a PCR-ing mood.
We will prevail!
We met with various business members including DSTL to discuss the impact our project would have on their company if our idea proceeded into the future.
Next week the physicists will be dragged into the labs whether they like it or not!
Alex Clowsley will be taking over the project, Showcasing Polysaccharides !

The theme which the projects from team Heidelberg and our own share, is protein-tagging. We worked with 3 different tags to immobilize enzymes, team Heidelberg developed an intein-toolbox for protein-cyclization, protein-protein-coupling and other applications. When it comes to inteins (selfsplicing proteins), it’s quite useful to verify the sequence of the resulting protein. Knowing the original AA-code, that can be accomplished by mass spectrometry.  Since we had access to a MALDI mass spectrometer, team Heidelberg sent us protein-samples in a piece of PAA gel. We extracted the Protein, digested it with trypsin and analyzed it. For the exact procedure of this MALDI analysis, please see the protocol . λ-lysozyme was tested in three varieties: once linear, and twice circular with different linkers. For the latter two, we were able to confirm that they were in fact cyclized in the predicted way, while the first was confirmed to be no linearized, just as expected.
Figure: MALDI mass spectrometry results of team Heidelberg's proteins
Additionally, in our conversations on protein expression, purification and testing, we brought up the difficulty we had overexpressing our fusion proteins and voiced our concerns that the modified pET-vector we used might be faulty.  It just so happend that team Heidelberg had designed plasmid backbones this year, specifically for protein overexpression. They kindly sent us samples of their pSBX1K3 ( BBa_K1362093 ) and pSBX4K5 ( BB"

ATHENAEUM
The University of Pavia is one of the oldest universities in Europe. An edict issued by King Lotarius quotes a higher education institution in Pavia as already established in 825 A.D. This institution, mainly devoted to ecclesiastical and civil law as well as to theological studies, was then elected as the prime educational centre for northern Italy. Enlarged and renovated by the Duke of Milan, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, it became the University of the Duchy, having been officially established as a studium generale by Emperor Charles IV in 1361.
During the following centuries, even though passing through periods of both adversity and prosperity, the fame of the University of Pavia grew and not just in Italy. The continuous presence of learned men and scientists who wrote celebrated works and made important discoveries, such as Girolamo Cardano , Alessandro Volta , Camillo Golgi , Ugo Foscolo together with the distinguished educational record of the University, added to the good name of the institution.
Nowadays, the University keeps on offering a wide variety of disciplinary and interdisciplinary teaching. About 22.000 students follow the courses in Pavia. Research is carried out in departments, institutes, clinics, centres and laboratories, in close association with public and private institutions, enterprises, and factories.
These are the 9 faculties in which the university is divided into:
Faculty of Economics
Faculty of Engineering
Faculty of Humanities
Faculty of Law
Faculty of Physical, Natural and Mathematical Sciences
Faculty of Medicine
Faculty of Musicology
Faculty of Pharmacy
Faculty of Politics
Pavia is famous for the colleges, which are a quite unique feature of this university city. Merit-based colleges are: the Ghislieri College, the Borromeo College, the Nuovo College and the Santa Caterina College, while public colleges belong to the EDiSU. We have fun with sport events and all colleges have their own traditions.
Selected students in Pavia can take classes also at the IUSS (Institute for Advanced Studies), shaped according to the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa model, which reunites all the colleges of the Pavia Study System.

Study of the systems is varied, inlcuding the analysis of the physical transport of metabolites across systems which directly relates to our fundamental understanding of cellular biology and systems. Additonally, Professor Evans is interested in the manipulation of biological sensing mechanisms, with current work that has successfully incorporated bovine rhodopsin into an artificial membrane assembly for use in optical spectroscopic devices, and other work using actin filaments to create synthetic villi within Giant Unilamellar Vesicles.
Fiona Meldrum
Professor Meldrum's research interests fall under the general category of materials chemistry, but are particularly focused on crystal growth. The Meldrum Group is examining methods to produce crystals with defined properties, controlling their size, morphology, organisation and mechanical properties. Within this topic there is considerable emphasis on biological crystallisation processes, hence natural structures such as seashells, bones and teeth are used as an inspiration for the development of novel crystal growth strategies. These experiments also enable better understanding of natural crystal growth phenomena. The borad range of projects within the group call for a broad range of analytical techniques including scanning and transmission electron microscopy, Raman microscopy and X-ray diffraction.
Fiona works closely with Dr. Bawazer , devloping micro-fluidic techniques to control aqueous biomineralisation reactions.
Lorna Dougan
After gaining her doctorate on aqueous alcohol solutions using neutron diffraction at Edinburgh, Lorna spent 3 years as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Biological Sciences at Columbia University, USA. Coming to Leeds in 2009, Dr. Dougan lectures in biological physics, and specializes in extremophiles - organisms that survive in extreme conditions. In 2010, Lorna received an ERC Fellowship, and now heads up the Dougan Group . The group does research in many different areas, from life in extreme environments, to single-molecule manipulation to molecular self assembly and even cryo-preservation. The group make extensive use of Atomic Force Microscopes to study protein folding within extremophiles, as well as multiple techniques for analysis of lipid or amphiphillic systems, which frequently self assemble. This is important for the study of life, as these self assembling systems are the pre-cursors to cell formation, while understanding the energy landscape of a protein highlights how it affects its properties in varying environments.
Lorna is also very active within the Institute of Physics and the Astrobiology Society, recently giving lectures on single molecule approaches to protein analysis and Extremophiles and extra-terrestial life respectively.

It consists of abundant role-relationship and mutual promotion and restraint between every cards. The Bio Bang is themed with synthetic biology, including genetic engineering experiments, biological materials and equipment. We’ve also assimilate knowledge of biosafety into these set of cards in order to popularize knowledge of biosafety in lab, public and environment. This kind of propaganda tool is very useful to make different knowledge about genetic engineering and biology get across to high school students. Some examples of them are shown as follows:
We’ve dreamed about perfecting the rules and designing and sold it out to raise money for our project. But it didn’t come true owing to our tight schedule. However, we decided to make a English version Bio Bang as presents for other iGEMers. Just wait for us coming!
Surveys
Surveys on The Popularization of Synthetic Biology and iGEM  in high school students of Fujian Province
Our team conducted a synthetic biology survey before our lecture entitled ""Contemporary introduction to synthetic biology"". We wanted to compare how much they knew about synthetic biology and iGEM before the lecture with what they learn from our presentation in order to assess our work. We’ve prepared 300 questionnaires and hand out 227 of them. Among these drew-back questionnaires, 180 of them are valid. We put 11 questions on the questionnaire as below.
1. Have you ever heard about synthetic biology before our lecture?
2. If you have, in which way it was accessible to you?
3. Which parts do you think are the most intriguing about synthetic biology after our lecture?
4. Have you ever heard about iGEM before our lecture?
5. If you have, in which way it was accessible to you?
6. Are you willing to participate in iGEM after our lecture?
7. If your answer is no, why?
8. What’s your reason for participation, why?
9. If you participate in iGEM in which aspects do you want to get supports?
10. How much time can you spend on iGEM?
11. If you participate, you and your family are willing to afford in which aspects?
Some survey results are shown as below:
Discussion
Two major findings have been obtained from this analysis.
First of all, we drew a conclusion that almost everyone learned a lot from our lecture although they tended to be unfamiliar about the details of synthetic biology. Comparing the number of people who know about iGEM and the number of people who are willing to participate in iGEM, we think the number of"
UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," merely as a source of fear morphing into the trust deficit that grew out of it. Therefore, from this market perspective, the biotechnological practices that engender uncertainty become manageable through commodification (Pellizzoni 2011; Sonnenfeld and Mol 2011). With the open-source Registry of Standard Biological Parts, BioBricks are increasingly acquiring the status of commodity in the synthetic biology community. It is therefore not surprising that the iGEM competition also fosters the non-monetary value in the exchange of biological parts through the Registry. When iGEM teams also make it part of their project to develop a BioBrick themselves, they become eligible to win higher-level medals and thus gain prominence in the competition. At the same time, however, this incentive helps to grow synthetic biology as a discipline considering that their contribution to the Registry also promotes the economy of biological parts so that others in the community can work out other ways of using the parts. Sometimes these projects can turn into something that has real-world implications in terms of new product developments and spin-off companies. From then on, the monetary market takes over, creating potential for lucrative applications. This however still happens very rarely at this point. Nevertheless, teams are encouraged to set up networks and collaborations to make their project as realistic as possible. The competition can therefore become more than just playing around and being creative as their work always suggests a potential real-world contribution to the discipline (Balmer and Bulpin 2013; Frow 2013; Kera 2014).
While the theory of ecological modernization envisages a continuing role for government to remain a central figure in politics, an alternative view of late-modernity would state that “the truly political disappears in and from the [formal] political system and reappears, changed and generali[s]ed […] as sub(system)politics” (Beck 1997: 52). The challenges imposed by the industrial society have brought new uncertainties to the fore to which the traditional modern approach to politics could not adequately respond to. Consequently, other sections of society have attempted to counter the environmental crisis, which provided leeway for further technological development. Therefore, Beck (2001) notes that, in these conditions, the discourse of ecological modernisation will start to prevail as an umbrella concept for practical alternatives of pre-crisis politics, and hence promote new societal configurations. As a result, the reflexive approach in late modernity prompts the political landscape to break with its own rigid pre-existence. Nonetheless, the promise of industrial and democratic modernity to bring welfare remains unchanged as decision-makers"

François Le Fèvre évoque « c’est la première fois que l’homme est confronté à la possibilité de créer de nouvelles formes de vie ».
Il nous a paru important de nous intéresser à ces points, en plus de l’aspect technique de l’ingénierie biologique. Dans cette optique, nous avons organisé un débat éthique reposant sur le thème de la biologie synthétique, auquel différentes personnalités expertes dans le domaine ont été convié. Lors de ce débat,  différentes problématiques ont été soulevé. Comme l’a souligné Thierry Magnin, certaines d’entre elles sont d’ordre métaphysique, et concernent notamment ce que « cela nous donne comme représentation du vivant, de la vie » ; d’autres concernent directement les applications et leurs aspects techniques qui pourraient nous pousser  à les limiter. A l’occasion de ce débat, nous avons présenté notre projet à nos invités afin d’en faire ressortir les questions éthiques.

Il convient tout d’abord de s’intéresser aux finalités de cette science. Que cherche-t-on à faire ? Cherchons-nous à atteindre un état de perfection ? Lorsque l’on travaille à l’amélioration d’un organisme vivant, outre les difficultés techniques, il faut se demander si ce que l’on fait est souhaitable. Hormis les dérives égocentriques que l’on peut aisément imaginer, on pourrait chercher à corriger nos faiblesses, nos handicaps, nos maladies. Dorothée Benoit Browaeys met en avant que le contexte peut changer une « tare » en atout : « il y a des maladies qui vous confèrent aussi certains avantages.

It took us seven days to the West Coast, through Chicago and Glacier National Park. Dr. Johnson was the only driver throughout the trip, driving 12 hours a day with an admirable toughness.
Upon arrival at the Friday Harbor Laboratories, we were welcomed by Dr. Robert Fernald, Director of the Lab. We set up our work space in Lab 1, a small building consisting of two rooms, and we started to work. There were three other scientists in the room, and one of them Received 23 March 1995; accepted 5 June 1995. was Dr. Dixy Lee Ray, future governor of Washington State, who was always accompanied by a dog, her wellknown trademark. The laboratory area was a sanctuary prohibited to common dogs, but she declared that the animal was her assistant, not a dog.
The jellyfish were abundant. A constant stream of floating jellyfish passed along the side of the lab dock every morning and evening, riding with the current caused by the tide. We carefully scooped up the jellyfish into buckets, one by one, using a shallow dip-net. The specimens of Aequorea are shaped like hemispherical umbrellas and are nearly transparent. An average specimen measures 3- 4 inches in diameter and weighs about 50 g. The light organs-about 100 granules-are distributed evenly along the edge of the umbrella. Thus, the margin of the umbrella containing light organs could be easily cut off with a pair of scissors, yielding a thin strip called a “ring.” When the rings obtained from 20-30 jellyfish were squeezed through a rayon gauze, a liquid called “squeezate” was obtained. The squeezate was only dimly luminescent, but when it was diluted with water, the luminescence increased significantly for a period of 5- 10 minutes, as the granular light organs were cytolyzed.
We tried to extract luminescent substance from the squeezate by every thinkable method, but all failed; and we ran out of ideas after only a few days of work. Convinced that the cause of our failure was the luciferin-luciferase hypothesis that dominated our thinking, I suggested to Dr. Johnson that we should forget the idea of extracting luciferin and luciferase and, instead, try to isolate the luminescent substance whatever it might be. I was, however, unable to"

TAS_Taipei,2016,Team:TAS Taipei#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"nea (Bonate 2005). In the case of nanoparticles, which are much larger than chemical molecules, more is lost (Fraunfelder 2008).
The results show that the bioavailability of nanoparticles is about 1.404 x 10 -3%, which means that for every gram of GSR (or any drug) we place into nanoparticles, approximately 14.04 ug of the drug reach the aqueous humor. The variance is 2.34 ug/g. (Calvo 1996)
Figure 4.9: Bioavailability. For every 1 g of nanoparticles in the eyedrops, only 14.04 ug of them get through the cornea and into the lens.
Necessary Adjustments in Eyedrops
To ensure that sufficient concentrations of GSR are delivered, we must place an excess of GSR. To determine how much, we simply divide the concentration of GSR in nanoparticles we found in Model 3 by the fraction of GSR that reaches the aqueous humor. This result is programmed in our calculator below.
We conclude that we need 5.48 mM of GSR in nanoparticles in our final eyedrop to maintain 43.5 uM GSR and thus 2.5 LOCS.
Sensitivity Analysis: Revisiting Nanoparticles Model
The mechanism for eyedrop delivery is complex, and there are variances in the bioavailability depending on the conditions of the eye (Fraunfelder 2008). The thickness of the cornea, lens, other eye diseases, age, and even time of day may impact the bioavailability of the drug (Gaudana 2010). We use a stochastic model to simulate Model 3 again, but this time, add a degree of variance. The result is shown in Figure 4.10.
The variance is impacted by the frequency of eyedrops. By giving eyedrops more frequently with less amounts given each time, the variance is decreased.
Ideally, we wish to deliver 100% of the GSR concentration of the amount found in Model 2 (43.5 uM). Because of variance, the actual amount maintained in the lens is different, shown in Figure 5. The full details and mathematics of the stochastic model can be found in the collapsible.
Figure 4.10: Stochastic Model. This model takes into account randomness and uncertainty related to the conditions of the eye. The average case (deterministic) is shown in blue, while each test trial is shown in various colors. Clearly, daily eyedrops is superior as this decreases the sensitivity of our"

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"egens could become a powerful cloning chassis. Its incredible growth rate should excessively reduce the time wasted by waiting for cultures to grow. We were caught by the vision of “Cloning in one day”. With a doubling time of seven minutes it should be possible to start with a transformation in the morning, picking colonies in the early afternoon and finally obtain purified plasmids in the evening. Such cloning cycles usually take three days when using E. coli as the cloning chassis and we attempt to perform the same steps in one day.
When using our Marburg Collection, we should be able to create a multigene construct in three days by repeating “Cloning in one day” three times.
We designed a LVL2 plasmid that contains a sfGFP and RFP transcription unit. This should facilitate easy detection of the intermediate plasmids thus omitting the need of sequencing.
Figure 1: Baffled falcons
Enhanced oxygen availability increases the growth rate even further
During the process of cloning optimization we realized that the limits can be pushed even further with improved culture conditions. To enhance availability of oxygen during the liquid culture, we constructed self-made “baffled falcon”. We assume that 3 mL culture in such a modified 50 mL tube should provide the cells with the maximum possible oxygen, additionally increasing the growth. We payed attention to prewarm liquid media as well as the agar plates.
As an outlook we want to suggest a future where cloning is done by robots instead of humans. We consider the combination of V. natriegens with colony picking and pipetting robots as a powerful method to incredibly accelerate scientific progress. Machines do not need after-work-hours and therefore the short growth periods of V. natriegens can be used to their fullest potential.
Design of the Marburg Collection
We created a novel golden-gate based cloning toolbox consisting of 123 parts. Here we describe the design of all relevant features of this toolbox. We provide instruction on how to use the connectors and the thought behind the selection of specific fusion sites.
Overview of the Marburg Collection
A major goal of our project was to create a collection of characterized  parts for use in V. natriegens to provide other iGEM teams, as well as the whole scientific community a toolbox for the rational design of metabolic pathways, genetic circuits or any other DNA construct.
Our toolbox was initially conceived for being used in V. natriegens. However, while designing the Marburg Collection, we realized that a toolbox with maximum flexibility can easily be used in more than one bacterial species. Because alternative bacterial chassis"

However this wasn't a success and so we returned to BBa_K216009 in order to get data on the PyeaR part.
The assay
The general procedure for the assay, whether using the BBa_K216009 part or our own BioBrick (we made one attempt to use our own construct before realising that the ligation had failed).
Day one
Prepare overnight cultures of E.coli containing the relevant BioBrick - one culture per repeat of the experiment.
Prepare the following solutions for use during the assay:
Z Buffer - 500mL
Prepare 1M solutions of the following:
KCl
1x20mL aliquot - 1.49g in 20mL ddH2O
MgSO4
1x20mL aliquot - 2.40g in 20mL ddH2O
Na2HPO4
2x20mL aliquots - 2.84g in 20mL ddH2O
NaH2PO4
1x20mL aliquot - 2.76g in 20mL ddH2O
Combine these as stated in the table below

Add 270μL to ~100mL Z Buffer on day of use
This can then be separated into ~100mL aliquots and will keep until required.
1M Na2CO3 - 250mL
26.5g Na2CO3 dissolved in 250mL ddH2O
1M KNO3 - 50mL
For our assays we wish to measure the sensitivity of the PyeaR promoter to nitrate levels so we included KNO3 as the test solution - this is not a standard β-galactosidase assay solution!
5.05g KNO3 dissolved in 50mL ddH2O.
This was then autoclaved for sterility.

“RECOUNTER” a short story
We developed an Android app for the ones who can’t live without their mobile phones, but also we try to approach a whole new different type public by writing a short story.
Since English is not our native language, it was a challenge for us from the very beginning to write the story. Nevertheless, we kept some characteristics of Japanese literature when we were writing it. The story is divided in two parts  vol. 1 and vol. 2. In Japanese literature, books are usually divided into two separated books, you can read the first part and if you like it buy the second part, and also it saves a lot of space. The story is light to read (shouldn’t take more tan 3 hours) and events take place in Japan. Our Project “sigma recounter” is a main theme of the story and we tried to explore also topics such living abroad, language and culture differences, and science.
We want to present the first part of the story in our wiki and the second part will be distributed at our poster presentation space. This will also serve us as an experiment for the future human practice methods.
¿Does by giving out a piece of art, can we trigger interest in our Project?.

Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#Project#Promoter study_-_-_TEXT.html," the promoter pTEF1 could have been used, while pGLN1 could have been used to replace pAQR1. According to our results, this would have created a moderate overexpression of both the genes of interest. If something would have gone wrong with the promoter exchange, like poor growth of the yeast with new promoters, the results from the promoter study could also have helped with troubleshooting and guidance to what the next step should be.
The information from the promoter study could also be of great use for other people interested in expression levels of different promoters, especially on acetate, where there is very little data comparing strengths of different promoters. Therefore, the promoter study serves a purpose in itself, separated from the rest of our project. Hopefully, the information gained will be used by future iGEM teams.
