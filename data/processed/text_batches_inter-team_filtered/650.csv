STUDENTS
We work as a wonderful team. We come from different departments of Fudan. We unite under the Bertalanffy Association. Everyone has earned a position and stuck to it through the whole project. We designed the whole project and did all the experiment by ourselves. We worked in schools and society to educate public with our own efforts. We designed and painted as if we are the greatest art designers. We worked on the modeling and wiki pages day and night to achieve the best. Every bit of effort has together brought here our final presentation. Everyone, well done!
Xilin Jiang
I am a junior in the school of life science, Fudan University. As the team leader, my mission is to coordinate the whole team’s work. I have a strong passion in synthetic biology while always participate in public affairs, so I work both in the lab and in the community. I believe that our team should propagate the basic idea of synthetic biology to the whole school. Consequently, I have paid a lot of attention to the influence of synthetic biology in Fudan, which has the best genetic labs in China. Fudan team is only set for a few months, but I hope we can initiate a trend for synthetic biology for a much longer time.

As the graph shows, the transformation rate can reach almost 80 percent in general.
The improved model with gene expression
Despite the great accuracy showed by the original model under in vitro conditions, we still want to figure out how the recombinases might work in in vivo experiments with gene expressing at the same time, for an obvious reason that we will finally carry out our circuit inside a living changing E. coli.
Considering the fact that the combination between the inducer and promoter are much faster than the production of integrase, we we assume that the activation of the promoter happens instantaneously..
Furthermore, the concentration of the protein (except for recombinases) shall decrease as a result of both degradation and dilution.
The maximum promoter activity can be estimated by the following equation
For the serine integrase, we assume the decrease in concentration is solely caused by dilution. And the dilution rate can be estimated as follows.
Last but not least,with the cell division, the new DNA produced without integrase combined should also be taken into consideration. So the origin model can be adapted to a new form as follows.
As the graph shows(figure2.1), the transformation rate can reach almost 100 percent in general. The critical difference between the vivo and vitro environment is the replication of DNA which decrease the concentration of LRI1 and LRI2 and increase the one of LR relatively and partially. Such process is a special kind of “transformation” which can skip the slow equilibrium process., ”syn”, to achieve a higher transformation rate in a short time.
Figure 2.1 | The figure separately describes how the proportion of substrate “PB” and product “LR” in total DNA varies within 10 hours in vivo. The red line represents the concentration proportion of the product, “LR”. More calculation details about this graph are attached to the back.

In the permit application, a description of the activities must be provided as well as the environmental impact that might occur and the protection measures to be undertaken to minimize the impact (Study visit P Gruvstedt 18 Sept 2018).
Emission requirements differ depending on the type of industrial activity. Therefore, municipal and private WWTPs do not have exactly the same requirements for individual parameters (Email P Gruvstedt 5 Oct 2018).
The municipal WWTPs with permits carry out “operator self-monitoring”, which includes the inspection of the facilities themselves, the management of chemicals and waste, measurements in the recipient and further analysis of the environment [10].
The operating permit of a private WWTP requests sampling and analyzing procedures. As a result, the environmental risk assessment is sent to the Government (Study visit P Gruvstedt 18 Sept 2018).
The Swedish EPA and the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM) coordinate national environmental monitoring to document changes in the environment.  County councils are, on the other side, coordinating the regional and local level [10].
Specifically, the Swedish EPA has a screening programme for pharmaceuticals that performs occasional sampling surveys and analysis [11].
Stockholm Vatten och Avfall, the institution producer of drinking water and responsible for treating wastewater, annually writes environmental reports.
SwAM will be publishing during 2018 a report related to the advanced treatment of pharmaceutical residues [11].
The Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP), in collaboration with the Helsinki Commission (Helcom), aims to restore a healthy ecological status in the marine environment by 2021 [11].
Big changes in WWTPs imply the need for better resources, such as space (Study visit J Olsson 15 Aug 2018). According to the Swedish Water and Wastewater Association, “resources are lacking for long-term strategic efforts” [12]. However, some plants have the space to introduce modifications in infrastructure (Skype call S Berg 29 Aug 2018 and study visit P Gruvstedt 18 Sept 2018).
There is an increase of population causing an increase in pharmaceuticals’ consumption.
Our Solution - Biotic Blue
To protect the environment from pharmaceuticals, we developed Biotic Blue. Our product consists of an enzyme (fungal laccase), capable of degrading SMX in wastewater. This enzyme is immobilized on magnetic beads which are recovered from the water and re-used during the prebiological step of WWTPs. Our mission , therefore, is to prevent SMX from reaching the aquatic"

-and reverse the signal
As mentioned before, we need to convert the signal to a negative response, which we accomplished by adding a PhlF repressor, combining to form part K2572016. PhlF binds to an operator in the pPhlF region to repress the expression of downstream suicide sequences (ccdB/GBSV1/colicin E2). When temperature and cell density are high, regulator PhlF (and sRNA) is produced to repress the expression of suicide genes. As temperature drops and community density decreases, simulating that engineered strains escape from the fermentation condition, PhlF is repressed and consequently turns on the expression of cytotoxic sequences.
Also a model was built to predict the function of this device.
Integrase
The second device we build is for therapeutic bacteria. The device can carry out noninvasive tracing through ultrasound imaging of the gas vesicle(Shapiro et al.), release the drug (from SHSBNU 2017) controlled by a thermosensitive regulator at nidus by ultrasound tissue heating, and heat to a higher temperature to release nuclease and kill the bacteria after it finishes its mission.
-can it work
Quantitative Characterization of integrase was not as expected . We gain access to the integrase Bxb1 from 2017 Peking University iGEM team, who constructed a time-sequential logic system with the use of integrase (Peking iGEM2017). The integrase Bxb1 is regulated by the upstream pBAD operon, which activates in the presence of arabinose.
Theoretically, presence of arabinose will turn on PBAD thus initiates the production of Bxb1. Bxb1 flips the promoter upstream of GFP and starts the transcription of GFP. Conversely, without arabinose induction, no green fluorescence should be observed in bacteria colonies. We assume this was due to the leakage of BAD operator.
From the fig, there are differences between the one with bxb1 plasmid and the ones without, they glows as expected with their combination. However, as the expression should increase with higher mole of arabinose, the experimental results showed that the expression was decreased.
The plasmids co-transformed were extracted out for sequencing, so we can not assess it right away.

PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
RNA Day
On August 1st, also called “RNA Day”, our team decided to help the University of Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM team at a booth set up at our local farmer’s market. This public engagement activity introduced the members of our community to iGEM, in addition to the work that both the collegiate and high school iGEM teams have accomplished. At our booth, we interacted with the community by providing different activities, such as synthetic biology based colouring sheets and toothpicks and marshmallows to make DNA. People at the farmers market were even able to conduct a DNA extraction experiment, which allowed them to venture into the types of activities that members of iGEM partake in.
Whoop Up Days
Our team had a booth at our local summer carnival, Whoop Up Days, to promote synthetic biology and iGEM. The booth allowed individuals to learn about iGEM and how to pipette. We were even able to raise over $100 in donations through selling stickers that we had designed ourselves. This booth was successful in bringing awareness to synthetic biology in addition to fundraising.
iGEM Music Recital
We held a music recital to showcase the musical abilities and talents of our team members, in addition to raising money to send more representatives to Boston. We were also able to engage with our community by giving a presentation on iGEM, our project and synthetic biology as a whole.
STEAM
As part of our public engagement, our team had the opportunity to integrate our project into ""Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics"", or STEAM, an after school program for elementary school students run by The Crossings Branch Library in our city of Lethbridge. At the beginning of the program, we taught the kids about iGEM; afterwards, we explored the topic of bacteria, proteins and DNA by doing two fun activities: DNA extractions and play-doh protein-expressing bacteria. Our goal was to teach these students about the wonder of synthetic biology, which has subsequently created interest in the community of youth for synthetic biology. This demonstrates the engagement of our team with the Lethbridge youth.
We found that the interlab study was a good way for us to learn the"

The results from this initial run are characteristic of those obtained when screening over Anderson Promoters and Ribosome Binding Sites. With only pImm transformed (left of first red line) we observe Imm2 mRNA very rapidly reaching equilibrium and Imm2 also reaching equilibrium shortly after. pCol is transformed (between first and second red lines) and reaches a much lower equilibirum at a slower rate compared to Imm2 due its larger size and hence slower rates of transcription (of Colicin E2 mRNA) and translation. Maxicell formation occurs (at second red line) and pImm is as a result linearized, we observe an immediate spike in Imm2 production due to the now longer halflife of Imm2 when in non-dividing Maxicells however this quickly drops as no new Imm2 mRNA is produced. We can also observe considerably higher Colicin E2 expression once maxicells are formed which is again due the longer halflife of proteins when not being diluted due to cell division. Free Colicin E2 becomes present at 19.6 hours and hence DNA degradation occurs and maxicells are deactivated.
Figure 3 displays the distribution of different killswitch activation times obtained by screening across Anderson Promoters and Ribosome Binding Sites. We can observe that there is a wide variation in activation times between 1.8 minutes and 194 hours interestingly we can also observe that the distribution closely approximates a power law distribution with fast activation time (0-50 hours) being significatly more numerous than those with longer activation times (>50 hours).
Figure 3 - Distribution of Degradation Switch Activation Times
Figure 4 displays the protein levels over time for runs 20, 457 and 2585 which correspond to the slowest, fastest and average activation times of 194 hours, 0.03 hours (1.8 minutes) and 33.28 hours.

Sean Ross Craig
BSc Microbiology Graduate, University of Dundee; MRes Microbiology Graduate, Birkbeck, University of London
A University of Dundee BSc Microbiology 2012 Graduate, he worked as a chef for a year and a half after graduation. Birkbeck, University of London gave Sean the opportunity to study the subject that he loves and work at the same time. He was able to complete his MRes due to the flexibility of Birkbeck. Without an institution such as Birkbeck offering the flexibility in study, he would not have been able to obtain a research based post-graduate qualification.  Being a part of the iGEM team means a lot to Sean & he hopes to give back to the great institute that provided him with the opportunity to pursue a career in academic science.
When Sean is not looking at Biosynthetic pathways or dreaming up scientific ideas for the good of mankind sean enjoys playing & watching football. He also has a keen interest in nature. He has the pace to keep up with Elliott on the eating"
UI_Indonesia,2018,Team:UI Indonesia#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," on emergency response, which is useful to know the effective response to emergency situations; minimizing the effects of emergency situations. In the last day, the team also conducted a lab practice to simulate directly the lesson that have been learnt in the last 4 day. iGEM UI 2018 are very excited in participating the training.
OVERALL CONCLUSION & RESULT
Why we should be chosen as the Best Integrated Human Practice?
Through their Human Practices efforts, teams must convince the judges that they have:
• Carefully and creatively considered (i.e, taken a thoughtful and innovative approach to both reflect and act upon)
• Whether their projects are responsible (i.e, conducted with care and foresight)
• Good for the world (i.e, can be reasonably anticipated to benefit and not harm people, and other ethical considerations like the just distribution of benefits and harms).
The UI IGEM Team has taken a thoughtful and innovative approach to the whole society level to make it integrated and acceptable. We realize that we need to see and implement our human practice by considering many perspectives within the society. We have reached the experts through holding some social studies that involves their participation such as biosafety study, ethic study, and health expert study. We also held some innovative activities to reach the public in order to understanding the society’s perspective towards our project, such as: a Day with Diphthy, Public Discussion Forum (in Collaboration with NTU Team), Grass-root Outreach, and more. Both had been done in order to understand the whole perspective of society that will direct our project work (Point 1).
The society’s response is surprisingly positive and very supportive. They are very pleased to welcome this project for they see that Finding Diphthy is answering their basic needs of health in such an urgent condition. But, we are not stopping at just being good for the world. We still try to ensure that every detail of our project is ethically acceptable and that is why we held an Ethical and Religion Review by discussing with the experts. It results a positive answer that our human practice is ethically acceptable. (Point 2)
Not only being good for the world, we are also considering about our responsibility in human practice aspect. Build upon the result of our discussions, we make a biosafety term of our project as our biggest form of responsibility to the society regarding to its implementation. We are thoughtfully made it by discussing this follow up with the expert. Besides, in every human practice project that we held, we always involving the society consideration and participation, so that we keep conducting our project with care (Point 3).

Nanjing-China,2015,Team:Nanjing-China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," view of the fact that our project’s target is pollution control and recycling, Mr. Wu gave us more advice on how to use policies and funds to support our project. The policies include the “Circular Economy Promotion Law”, and the “Water Pollution Prevention Action Plan”. Also, there is a sum of considerable fund specifically supporting the circular economy from the government which we can take advantage of.
In the third aspect, we demonstrated our concerns about the disadvantage of biological methods when dealing with the environmental pollution. On the one hand, the genetic engineering was what our project used, but we were not sure about whether the genetic modified bacterium we created would have some inhabitation from the government and the public. On the other hand, the efficiency of the biological method was relatively low, so we wanted to seek for more help at present.
Mr. Wu dispelled our concerns. In his opinion, the genetic engineering project is only excluded by the agriculture, not the disposal of pollution. In addition, although the biological methods have the relatively low efficiency, it has more advantages such as the moderate condition and low-frequency of the second pollution. Furthermore, he inspired us to use the biological methods to cope with soil pollution.
At the end of the interview, Mr. Wu highly complimented our project and our in-depth thought on the law and policy issues of the project. He wished that we could get a satisfying result in the final. We also expressed our sincere appreciation for his patient answers and explanations.
In conclusion, we did learn a lot from the interview. Firstly, we obtained more legal knowledge about the pollution of heavy metals and water pollution, and thus we have a much clearer concept of the current legal situation in China. Secondly, we knew more supportive policies on the new environmental technology, and to know that the application of the genetic engineering in the disposal of pollution will not contradict the related laws gives us more confidence about our project. Thirdly, we got information about the policies’ support to industrialize our project. Last but not least, we are inspired by the idea to expand our project to the disposal of soil pollution. No doubt that it could be a promotion both for our project and the application of synthetic biology on environmental issues.

LMU-Munich,2012,Team:LMU-Munich#Inverter_-_-_TEXT.html," SD of uof is indicated.
We aimed at using this system to build our inverter (Fig. 2). For a proof of principle, the promoter to be inverted, was the arabionose-inducible PBAD (PCR of BBa_I0500 ), which regulates the expression of the small RNA RyhB (PCR of pURyhB) ( Vecerek B., Bläsi U., 2007 ). RyhB itself translationally inhibits uofCGU (upstream of fur) (PCR of pRuofCGU-lacZ) ( Vecerek B., Bläsi U., 2007 ) by binding and masking the Shine Dalgarno sequence. If uofCGU is translationally fused to a reporter, in this case lacZα (PCR from pRuofCGU-lacZ from Vecerek B., Bläsi U., 2007 ), expression of the β-galactosidase is translationally repressed. The repression of the reporter is dependent on the concentration of RyhB, and therefore the induction of the PBAD promoter. consequently, the induction of the PBAD promoter is inverted to a negative output of the reporter.
Fig. 2: Design and functional principle of the Inverter switch.
The β-galactosidase assay below shows the function of this Inverter. 1 mM IPTG is always present, so that the Reporter is fully induced. When grown with increasing amounts of arabinose in the medium, RyhB is produced and inhibits uofCGU and consequently the fused reporter in a concentration-dependent manner.
But since the PBAD promoter lacks the repressor binding sites, it is leaky and always produces a bit RyhB. Therefore there is always a repression of the reporter. Consequently, we got only a small signal without Arabinose (minimal repression) and the PBAD promoter is generally poorly titratable.
In order to use the Inverter for the promoters and output of choice, it has to be constructed by fusion PCR (see next section).
Fig. 3: β-Galactosidase assay of Inverter with lacZα as reporter. The higher the arabinose concentration, the higher the translational repression of uofCGU-lacZα

That‘s why loss of integrated plasmid gets more unlikely over time. Upon plasmid loss the integration cassette can no longer be excised and the cell is stable genetically altered.
Figure 1: a. Functioning of integration and excision based on FRT-Flp. b. Suggested utilisation of the system for a reversible genetic engineering by inducible excision. The idea might be applicable for example for synthetic organs.
How could we utilize this system for our safety approach? We are suggesting to encode the Flp recombinase, on the same plasmid as the integration cassette, under the control of a tight promoter like the tet-promoter. With this design we could ensure that the integration plasmid and the Flp recombinase are always present in any cell. Upon exposure to a suitable stimulus Flp recombinase will be transcribed and excise the integrated plasmid from our synthetic organ.
A practical contribution to Biosafety in iGEM projects: The kill-switch
Aim of the new designed Thymidine kinase / ganciclovir system
One key factor in guaranteeing the safety of our project and preventing in advance any dangers is the implementation of a well-known kill-switch. In this case, we worked in cooperation with the iGEM-team of Slovenia and Freiburg, who each provided us with their Biobrick ( BBa_K404113 - HSV-thymidine kinase fused to mouse guanylate kinase, iGEM Freiburg 2010 and BBa_K782063 - CMV-promoter, iGEM Slovenia 2012). This specific kill switch is known as the Thymidine kinase / ganciclovir system. In order to enhance the current Biobrick, we have repaired a point mutation that led otherwise to a pstI restriction location. An additional Poly-A-tail should also stabilize the mRNA later on. For more details, see our experiment protocol further down.
The role of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase
Thymidine kinase plays an important role in pyrimidine salvage pathway. It catalyzes the monophosphorylation of thymidine to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) [6] . Human TK is incapable of phosphorylating guanosine analogues as ganciclovir, acyclovir, buciclovir, penciclovir and famciclovir. Since herpes simplex virus TK is able to phosphorylate guanosine"

“Business training isn’t in our course load,” said Ward, thanking all the advisors, Community Futures and everyone who helped them along their way so far.
“We’re thankful we have an opportunity to pursue this, and to see others think it’s an idea to pursue as well gives a real sense of encouragement.”
Team: Synbiologica CEC Site Idea: Technology
“We found the diversity of the workshops to be not only eye opening but also very informative.  The speakers that were brought in provided a lot of one on one time with participants to cater advice for their business.”
Mackenzie Coatham
Isaac Ward, Erin Kelly, Mackenzie Coatham, and Harland Brandon are four science students at the University of Lethbridge who are developing a hormone detection device called Biologically Enhanced Assay in Real-time (BEAR). As their studies at the U of L don’t include any business training, they signed up for the Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge and its 8 week training program.
The team of four students are currently working out of the laboratories at the University of Lethbridge, and are being advised by professors at the University. Isaac and Erin are currently obtaining their undergraduate degree while Mackenzie and Harland are master’s students. When asked if it is difficult to handle their duties for Synbiologica and their studies, Isaac responded “As with many start-ups it takes a lot of work but with integrating planning, dedication, and most importantly team work, we feel confident that our commitment to education will be enhanced through real world application.”
While Synbiologica is still in the research phase and has yet to produce a prototype of BEAR, they are already looking to future applications of their product. They plan to market it to scientific researchers – more specifically ones focused on endocrinology and neuroscience – but also feel that BEAR will be useful in an agricultural or medical application.
These four students are excited about their idea, and while it may be a few years until BEAR is fully functional and approved for use, they remain committed to their research.

Worldshaper-XSHS,2018,Team:Worldshaper-XSHS#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," have plate readers in our lab. Luckily, we eventually borrowed one from other labs in the College of Life Science with the help of our mentor. Yet, the greatest difficulty comes from the actual operations in the experiment. In high school study, we never had the opportunity to see such complex instruments and equipment, let alone to use them. But thanks to the guidance of Dr. Huang Fangliang and the partnership with ASTWS-China and HFLS-ZhejiangUnited, we worked together by learning from each other and helping each other and thus the experiment was finally successfully started.
We started our first experiment on July 15. But due to the fact that it was our fisrt experience, we spent a total of 6 days from the beginning plasmid transfection to the completion of colony counting. While we were praying in our mind nervously to pass the review after submitting the results online, we received the following reply from Mrs. Traci Haddock-Angelli on July 30: Your submission is not yet acceptable for fulfillment of the bronze medal requirement. In the reply, she kindly pointed out the reason, which was that the values of our fluorescence and OD measurements for cell samples were not within the values of the standard curves for fluorescence and OD. The organizing committee hoped that we could repeat the standard curves, the cell measurements, or both. So, we reflected on the entire experimental process, the only thing we could think of was that we waited for more than one hour before the measurement of fluorescence intensity, resulting in probable partial bacterial proliferation that elevated the expression of fluorescent proteins. We had to wait because at that time the plate reader was not preheated and there were a lot of people waiting to use the device. So, we decided to strictly control the time during the next experiment and to never make mistakes again on this same issue. We are especially thankful to the help of ASTWS-China and HFLS-ZhejiangUnited for their help and advice during the summary of our first experiment, and for the bacteria strain they provided for our second measurement.
We started our second experiment on August 15. Upon finishing the experiment, after we checked the data in the table carefully and confirmed that all of our fluorescence and OD measurements for cell samples were within the values of the standard curves for fluorescence and OD, we submitted the results to the organizing committee. Unfortunately, on August 20, we received a message from Mr. Vinoo Selvarajah, which put us in a mixed state of feeling. On the one hand, our results were still not ideal. He said “your new data also have an issue:"
NYMU-Taipei,2010,Team:NYMU-Taipei#Project#Speedy reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," more RNA aptamers. The more RNA aptamer, the more our split GFP will combine to emit a stronger fluorescence. With a weaker promoter, less RNA aptamers are created, and thus, less split GFP will combine to fluoresce.
2.Locates specific genes or chemicals (such as heavy metals)
Similar to the promoter testing, we can use the inducible promoter whose inducers are heavy metals(e.g. As or Zn). When these heavy metals is present, the promoter will be induced and transcribed into mRNA aptamer. With our GFP reporter, it will bind to the RNA aptamer and emit fluorescence. With this we can know that the quantity of heavy metal pollution in that environment.
3.Helps other teams test their biobricks.
4.Shows mRNA positioning in a sigle cells.
By understanding the RNA localization in a cell, we can learm more about how gene regulation works in a cell. And by understanding more about the precise gene regulations, we can explore more about the design rules in synthetic biology.
5.Measures the quantity of the mRNA.
6.Can be used to view the temporal dynamics in a cell
7.Speeds up the reporting progress.
With our reporting system, we can produce fluorescence in or RNA or protein assya in roughly 3 minutesWe can do a protein assay or mRNA assay in our speedy reporter system. It is faster than the conventional method RT-PCR for mRNA which needs about two hours and western blot for protein quantitative analysis which requires about 4.5 hours.
The split GFP is a constitutive protein in the cell. Once the RNA aptamer is transcribed, the split GFP linked with eIF4A will bind to the RNA aptamer due to its high affinity. We skip the translation process due to the already-generated GFP.

5 Marketing Plan
Industry Description
Our product belongs to two industries: eduction and small-scale research. The biotechnology education market is steadily increasing as new discoveries come to light and equipment costs decrease.
Target Markets
We have identified three markets: Education, Citizen Science and Field Research.
Education: Our primary market is science education in UK secondary schools. When At present, schools are reported to have too little equipment for effective practical work and unable to offer a full range of practical lessons.
http://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBAHoldings/PolicyAndInternationalRelations/ClientForums/Schools/Events/Archive/2004/DesigningFromInsideOut/AndyPiggott.pdf
2.     Better science laboratory facilities in schools should be a top priority http://www.rsc.org/AboutUs/News/PressReleases/2010/BetterLabs.asp
3.    The new facilities enable the pupils to gain a better understanding of the subject through more ‘hands on’ experience . Science departments receive £9.89 per pupil .
Citizen Science: Citizen scientists is a term used to described amateur or nonprofessional scientists that has gained popularity in recent years, including in research , science magazines and the maker community . As it is is difficult to estimate an accurate figure of molecular biology citizen scientists, we choose to approximate the size of a group by using the example of the DIYBio network. DIYBio presents a growing citizen science community of molecular biologists, biotechnologists and bioartists. Projects range from microbe mapping to yeast printing . DIY Science can be considered as an alternative approach to scientific experimentation . One common barrier is access to the technology, where cost and skills are both problems.
Field Research: A range of fields, from textile conservation to evolutionary biology, require the use of biotechnology, in particular PCR.
Market Analysis
As of January 2013 there are 3,281 state-funded secondary schools in the UK with approximately 3.2 million pupils. Schools submit yearly budgets on the July 31 .
As of October 2013, there are 42 groups declared worldwide and 3353 members on DIYbio Google group mailing list.

We are especially grateful to our numerous sponsors on gofundme,  who supported our project and made it possible.
Every public donor, who helped us to achieve our goals got a special place on our bacterial wall of fame and a handdrawn microbe to show our appreciation. A link to that wall can be found here:

Survey
To get people involved from all kinds of social and educational backgrounds, our survey was distributed during our interactive informational booth, after the panel discussion, at the Master’s information day and online. One important part was to understand how much the public knows about glyphosate. We also wanted to get an overview of the opinions of the general public towards glyphosate. Most importantly, we wanted to understand what the public thinks about our project and if they had the chance, what they would change about it. The survey was conducted by people of various occupations such as student, teacher, farmer, biologists, hair dresser, electronic technician, pensioner and public officials of ages between 20 to over 50 years. 60% of those were men and 40% were women living mostly in Lower Saxony, Bavaria and Hamburg.
The survey showed, that the people think that far more glyphosate is produced and used in Germany than it is actually the case. In addition, even though the majority wanted the usage of glyphosate to be reduced or forbidden, not all of them knew that it is an herbicide and its mode of action. This shows, that more must be done to educate the public about the scientific background so that they can form a well-grounded opinion.
Participants also underlined the fact that the highest risk of glyphosate are its effects on biodiversity and accumulation in the soil. In addition to this survey, we also talked to politicians who expressed their uncertainty about the removal of glyphosate from the soil. Hence"

We helped them with data in Australia, and they in turn told us more about the Brazilian situation, as well as sharing knowledge on our Bacillus work and using the modelling program MatLab.
 
We also communicated with Bristol University , and upon learning they had developed a tool for editing the iGEM wiki, we gave it a go and sent them our feedback. They returned the favour by providing us with data about insulin prices in England, which we were finding hard to come by!
 
We worked with Cologne-Dusseldorf to contribute to their post-card distribution idea, by both producing a post-card and by distributing their postcards once they arrived. This collaboration worked both – we all helped one another by distribution each others’ project ideas to otherwise unreasonable parts of the world, a fantastic experience.
 
We talked with Auckland University over skype multiple times, and were able to help each other with working on our wikis. We were also excited to host them at our University when a couple of their team members flew over to visit the SBA conference.
 
We also worked with Chennai by exchanging protocols and tips for the lab.
 
Finally, we worked with Uppsala by participating in their webinar series about the ethics of synthetic biology and intellectual property, which was a fantastic learning experience – both by us contribution our experiences and hearing what other teams from around the world had to say about our work.  This work contributed significantly to how we approached our work; particularly with how intellectual property affects the ability of iGEM teams to contribute to the open source registry.

HUMAN PRACTICES
 
As we were developing a therapeutic agent, there were various things that we needed to address to ensure that we delivered a safe, ethical, useful product for the world. On our Human Practices page we have discussed these issues and how they have impacted our project in its development. Furthermore, we went out to the general public to discover how close to home the issues we were learning about really are. This survey, though we only had a limited response, gave us great insight into the reality of diabetes treatment in the world. These results then made us reconsider our understanding of the Social Injustices caused by high priced medications.

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

Proof of concept:
For linkage of nisin to chitosan a tyrosine residue has to be introduced first. While the Nisin-team was working on the modification of nisin we linked the tyrosine containing green fluourescence protein (GFP) to chitosan as a proof of concept. Therefore we tried two different protocols for the reaction and analyzed the reaction product by SDS-PAGE subsequently. Figure L.3 depicts the SDS-PAGE results for protocol 1 and 2. There were loaded samples from supernatants of different time points on the gel. For protocol 1 chitosan was mixed with GFP and tyrosinase and incubated for 3 days. In protocol 2 GFP and tyrosinase were incubated for 3 days before adding the chitosan solution.
Figure L.3: SDS-PAGE of tyrosinase based linkage of GFP to chitosan. Sample supernatants of different time points were loaded. A: Sample supernatants of time points (0, 24, 48, 72 h) of control and sample treated acording to protocol 1. B: Sample supernatants of time points (0, 72(1), 72(2), 144 h) of control and sample treated acording to protocol 2.
The supernatant was loaded after short centrifugation of the samples. After centrifugation the chitosan was found in the pellet. Therefore bound GFP was also in the pellet. A decrease of protein in the supernatant indicates a linkage of GFP with chitosan. Figure L.3.A shows that the GFP band (~25 kDa) of samples of time points 24, 48 and 72 h  is smaller and less intense in contrast to the control. This indicates a decrease of GFP in the supernatant and therefore a successful linkage of GFP to chitosan. In addition you can see a new band (~63 kDa) for the samples at 24 and 48 h. This band likely originates from cross linked GFP. The oxydized tyrosine can form a covalent bond with the amine group of the chitosan but also with the amine group of the amino acids of the GFP. This side reaction was stronger for protocol 2 (Figure L.3.B). In this case the ty"

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Knocking out the Fumarase proteins leads to a dysfunctional or a ‘broken’ TCA-cycle, since malate cannot be formed anymore from fumarate. This impairs the efficiency of the TCA-cycle and the production of amino acids; since some amino acids are formed from TCA-cycle intermediates (Waegeman et al. , 2011) (Fig 1a). Team Amsterdam faced a similar problem and aimed  to incorporate a glyoxylate shunt into Synechocystis to increase fumarate production. The glyoxylate shunt is composed of two enzymes, which are Malate Synthase and Isocitrate Lyase. They form a shortcut in the TCA-cycle (Fig. 1b).  In this way, the glyoxylate shunt restores some of the flux through part of the TCA-cycle, which should lead to a more efficient TCA-cycle. This is predicted to be beneficial for the cell in terms of fitness, as modelled by iGEM team Amsterdam.  For E.coli, a similar approach could be adopted, since E.coli can express the glyoxylate shunt genes to produce malate from isocitrate via glyoxylate. Thereby, in the process of producing malate, also succinate is formed. Because the cell can produce FADH2 by converting succinate to fumarate, the formed succinate will go to fumarate. In this way we are able to gain fitness and fumarate production, by having the glyoxylate shunt active.
Figure 1. The TCA-cycle with and without glyoxylate shunt. 1a). Fumarate is produced in a growth coupled way as a side product of arginine production. By knocking out fumarase, it cannot be degraded to malate. This way Fumarate accumulates. The TCA-cycle however is ‘broken’.1b). By expressing Malate Synthaese (MS) and Isocytrate Lyase (ICL), we can partly fix the ‘broken’ cycle. Now Isocitrate is made into both glyoxylate from which malate is synthesized and into succinate, which can be converted into fumarate. This way we have a better functioning cycle and more fumarate production thanks to the glyoxylate shunt.
However, when we look at the E. Coli physiology, the glyoxylate shunt genes are already present, but repressed by a repressor encoded by the ic"

In preparation for Gibson Assembly of the DNA2.0 chromoproteins, I did a miniprep on meffRed (iGEM chromoprotein) in order to have a plasmid to linearize with the primer I ordered yesterday. I also did a restriction digestion of 1 ug (of a 1 ug/uL solution) of each DNA2.0 chromoprotein in order to use the isolated protein sequence for the Gibson Assembly. The DNA2.0 restriction sites are designed so that EcoR1 and Nde1 can be used to remove the whole protein sequence from the plasmid.

I spun down the liquid cultures I started yesterday and replaced them using the cultures from plates. I put 20 uL (and 1 uL of .134 M EDTA) of each of the clumped cells into a PCR tube and heated them in the thermal cycler for 1 hour at 70 °C. Pictures are below, but most notebably Cupid Pink which has been shown when dry to lose its color in response to heat then regain it when cooled, now turned a dark purple color after being heated at 70 °C for 1 hour. Other colors showed mild responses to the heat treatment, but the orange and purple chromoproteins remained unchanged (as was observed yesterday).

①We didn’t use GeneMorph II EZClone Domain Mutagenesis Kit mentioned in the figure above, instead we utilized ‘Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix’ (NEB, M0494L) to realize mega-primer PCR. It took us quite a long time to explore the PCR conditions since the annealing temperature and initial template amount was difficult to determine.
②Since the PCR products generated from mega-primer couldn’t act as PCR templates due to their nick, the producing mutation library may be rather small. So we utilized T5 exonuclease to digest approximately 30 base pairs on mega-primer(734bp), thus the generated products could act as PCR templates, resulting in exponential amplification. This table below shows the T5 exonuclease digestion results through sequencing.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#8 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," sequence of LuxPQ in Colony 7; however, the BBK restriction site, PstI, was not present. Therefore, a plasmid switch was set up of LuxPQ colony 7 from AC to AK in order to restore the BBK suffix.  This was performed by setting up a restriction digest using EcoRI and SpeI for the insert and the psB1AK3 vector. After this restriction digest, phosphatase and ligation treatment was performed and the plasmid was subsequently transformed into TOP10 competent cells and plated overnight on LB+Kanamycin.

Creation and Modification of Scripts and Notecards
I have completed creating instructional and information note cards for the various activities within the virtual lab on our island, including:
Bacterial Transformation
Transcription
Basic Quorum Sensing Explanation
Note cards that are almost finished and will be completed by tomorrow include:
Restriction Digest
Translation
DNA Replication
I have also been creating and modifying the scripts for PCR, Gel Electrophoresis, Restriction Digest and have just started Bacterial Transformation. They have been modified to use a more user friendly prompt system (using llDialog function in second life scripting language) so asking avatars for information and having them answer looks cleaner and is more intuitive.
The script I am presently working on for restriction digest can:
Detect the order in which you add materials within the object and alerts you to any wrong order of addition
Check for appropriate restriction enzymes and determine if those detected with place the insert behind or in front of the recipient part
Prompt user for information regarding what they would like to put together
I am hoping to have restriction digest functioning by Friday and will be working on finishing notecards, Restriction Digest and Bacterial Transformation in the upcoming days. I will also be organizing a sequencing station, which may be used for a section of the lab activities.

Tokyo_Tech,2014,Team:Tokyo Tech#Policy and Practices#Our questions about biosafety_-_-_TEXT.html," the school festival of the  University of Tokyo. After communicating with the students who majored in business,  we realized that we do not know much about economics.
iGEMers know a lot about synthetic biology, but what about economics? Can  we apply our ideas commercially? How can a student who has never studied  economics before start to learn? From these questions, we thought of making an educational tool of  economics by using E. coli, which is familiar to iGEMers.
> Jump to Poster Session at the University of Tokyo
 
Next, we introduced our Bank E. coli project to businessmen, executives, and technicians engaged in IT company for some professional opinions at MUSE  TALK.
They pointed out that economic wave should be introduced into our system for more reality. According to their advice, we improved our system to show more authenticity.
Also, many people asked questions related to safety. It was because the safety problem must be cleared in order to commercialize our ideas. They all thought it would be a big business chance, if genetically engineered E. coli can be released safely in human and nature. We encountered two questions here: reality and safety.
> Jump to MUSE TALK
 
Finally, we sent out questionnaires to the students of Tokyo Institute of  Technology to confirm whether our project would help the understanding of economic  system. Most of them said that they almost understood the mechanism of how  economy works.
Additionally, we consulted Mr. Tomoya Saito, an expert  in biosafety working for National Institute of Public Health. He gave us a  lecture about dual-use technologies and useful advice on biosafety.

2.Poster Session at the University of Tokyo
We participated in a poster  session held at the University of Tokyo on May 18th. iGEM teams from all  over Japan
gathered at this event and introduced their project to the visitors. Not only students and professors at the university, but also people without any  scientific background came and listened to our projects. After introducing our projects, we asked  visitors  for feedbacks to  make our projects better. Our central purpose in this event was to let people know what iGEM is, and change the negative thinking about synthetic biology that many people have.

Modeling
We modelled the small single cell bioreactors on drawing programs before building many of them.  We made sure that they were cost effective and are reasonable to build.  A per unit cost is presented in full detail in the drop down list below where the final total cost is $7.43.  This does not include a way to measure the current, which would be about another $30.00 depending on which Arduino board (1,2,3) you purchase and how you set it up.  This would bring the total cost up to $37.43, which is well within reason for a system that can be reused and will detect harmful contaminants in water.  The cost of a drinking water test can range from $50-270.  While these tests can detect more contaminants than our system currently can it would only take more genetically engineered Shewanella in order to match the range of tests at a significantly more affordable price.

Wash_U,2009,Team:Wash U#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," for LH2 and in the future design of systems for the optimization of Light Harvesting Antenna size for photobioreactors .
The most striking difference between the Wild Type Rhodobacter Sphaeroides 2.41 and DBCOmega (LH2 knockout) growth patterns is that the first flask in the WT (closest to the light source) grew less than the second flask, while the converse was true in DBCOmega (figure 2a and 2b).  This can be attributed to the photosystem saturation curves for the respective cultures.  The Wild Type has an LH2 complex, meaning that their antenna size is inherently larger and that their photosystem will be saturated at lower light intensities than the LH2 deficient mutant.  We observed that the incident light intensity used in this experiment led to oversaturation for the first WT tissue flask and resulted in growth-inhibiting photodamage, as is evidenced by its lesser growth relative to the second culture.  In contrast, photodamage was not observed in DBCOmega as is evidenced by the first tissue flask that grew at the fastest respective rate.  Furthermore, it appears that this photodamage slowed the growth of the first WT tissue flask to the point that the OD of this tissue flask was nearly equal to that of DBCOmega after 5 days of growth(.987 vs. .967) (figure 1a).  As such, the contribution of LH2 to the growth of the WT in flask 1 can be assessed to be little after day 3 when the growth curve slows- though, this light (at 800 and 850 nm) was still greatly absorbed by flask 1 (Figure 5e).  It is likely that much of this light was then wasted through Non-Photochemical Quenching (NPQ), depleting the flasks behind flask 1 of photons at the LH2 absorbtion peaks and decreasing the cumulative productivity of flasks 1-5. This effect of wasting photons though NPQ under high light intensities is one that we sought to minimize in the design of our synthetic regulation for the pucB/A genes.
A further a comparison of the WT and DBCOmega experiments reveals that the 3rd tissue flask in each had almost identical growth rates (figure 1c), while the DBCOmega 4th and 5th tissue flask outperformed that of the WT (figure 1d and 1e).  This can simply be attributed to the higher density of cells in the  2nd flask of the WT that led"

Introduction
The modeling part of our project was to simulate our biosensor in silico to gain insight in how the output might look, and what may be changed or modified in it to produce a better result.
One of the main parts of our biosensor uses the yeast pheromone pathway with custom GPCRs that will make the cells sense volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are lung cancer biomarkers. These receptors, when activated by the VOCs in the breath of patients will trigger a proteolytic cascade, the MAPK cascade, in the pheromone pathway which ultimately leads to increased levels of a transcription factor called Ste12 [1]. Ste12 acts as a “first checkpoint” in our biosensor as its values will correlate with the downstream processes. This transcription factor will then promote expression of the protein Fus1, whose function involves coordinating cell polarization and fusion in order to make the yeast mate with the opposing mating type [3]. Therefore, the promoter region (PFUS1) was used as a way to signal when the pheromone pathway is activated.
In parallel to the normal pheromone pathway, a construct containing Cre recombinase with PFUS1 in front of it was added, which causes it to be co-expressed by pheromone pathway activation. Cre in turn flips the constitutive promoter PTEF by recombining two loxP-sites surrounding the promoter. This leads to expression of Cas9 in one mating type and a gRNA in the other. When the cells of opposing mating types then mate to form a diploid, the Cas9 and gRNA will bind to each other. This will in turn cause the Cas9-gRNA complex to cut the ADE2 gene in yeast and turn the cells red.
Modeling and results
To model this system, we decided to use a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that correspond to the different species involved in the pheromone pathway. The model relies upon the work of Kofahl and Klipp [1], whose"

We were able to find the binding probability of one ligand to a receptor using the tools of statistical physics, but this seems unrelated to the well-known Hill's function. In order to obtain the Hill's function we can write the ligand concentration as           \[             c = \frac{L}{\Omega V_0},           \]             where \(V_0\) is the volume of one lattice box. We also introduce a reference concentration \(c_0=1/V_0\). Thus we can write the binding probability as             \[                 p_\text{bound} = \dfrac{\frac{c}{c_0}e^{-\beta\Delta \epsilon}}{1 + \frac{c}{c_0}e^{-\beta\Delta \epsilon}}             \]             Finally, by defining the association constant             \[                 K_a = \frac{1}{c_0}e^{-\beta\Delta \epsilon}             \]             we obtain the Hill's function of order "

According to the result of the experiment, we succeded in reducing the reproduction rate to its half value by the growth inhibition of barnase on highly expressed pLac. We can reduce the rate more by inducing other lethal genes.
We defined the range of this value as geometric mean of alpha and beta multiplied by a random number from 0.1 to 1.0.
kappa
The parameter corresponds to the constant part of the term representing the death of E. coli by Colicin.
This can be changed by expression rate of colicin (just as like K).
We defined the range of the parameter as mu multiplied by 0.1 ~ mu multiplied 10. We chose the value from this range randomly.
gamma
This can be changed by pH or temperature[10]. Weiss et. al[9] estimated this value to be between 0.274 to 1.19,
within the range of pH where the reproduction of E. coli is not interfered.We chose the value of the parameter from this range randomly.
mu
The degradation rate of colicin
We could not find the value of this. We also have not certificate if this can be changed. iGEM Heidelberg 2008[5] said that the degradation of colicin can be ignored; however, its scale was second, not hour. They also said that the death rate of the AHL can also be ignored. However, as shown above, it cannot be ignored in a scale of So we set this value as the same or less than AHL. This parameter also may be changed by adding protease to the medium.
We want to take the range of mu as broad as possible, because only the value of the ratio to kappa is provided. Too large or too small value is not appropriate for the pattern formation. Considering this, we chose the value of the parameter from 0.01 to 1.0 randomly.

Alicia Illen
Hi everybody! My name is Alicia and I am a member of the iGEM team Göttingen. I just earned my Bachelor's degree of Biological Sciences at the University of Bonn where I majored in Microbiology and Biotechnology. I am currently attending the Master's program Microbiology and Biochemistry at the University of Göttingen specializing in Molecular Genetics, Microbial Cell Biology and Biochemistry. This will be my first iGEM participation and I am eagerly looking forward to working on our project. It will be an opportunity to work independently and on our own responsibility and I hope I will be able to  learn a lot about lab work in general. I am looking forward to take part in the international competition"
Queens,2009,Team:Queens#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," I am currently a third year undergraduate student at Queen's, with a concentration in Life Science. Given the nature of my studies, I have always been fascinated by the sheer variety of phenotypes that can arise from a simple genetic code; therefore, the chance to play ""Lego"" with these complex molecules of life was an irresistible opportunity for me. Specifically, my role on the team this year was to help construct the genetic components required for plaque binding, as well as to conduct background research on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. And, so far, this has proven to be a challenging but unforgettable project.

About: I am in my fourth year of a chemical engineering degree at Queen’s, focusing on the biomedical stream. I spent last summer working as a field engineer in the Alberta oil patch, but this year I wanted to broaden my horizons and focus on biotechnology or biomedical research. I was especially interested in iGEM due to the wide-ranging applications of synthetic biology – from smog cleanup to combating tumours to degrading plastics – and now I hope to continue in this field after graduation. During the summer I worked in one of the labs testing the heme/HO-1 effector system and researching the amelioration of atherosclerotic plaques by CO, HO-1, and biliverdin. Outside of QGEM, I spent my summer camping, BBQing, and reading like a fiend.

2. The knowledge of new energy
 
Most people think that fossil fuels are running out and exploration of new energy has a big impact on future. However, people are overconfident about the time left. More than half the people think that energy crisis is 200 years away from now, which is not the case at all. This results dictates that propagation of basic knowledge about chemical energy and new energy such as solar energy is necessary. Solar energy is also the most well-known energy among the people surveyed.
 
 
Besides, we also investigated the attitudes of the public about the applicability of new energy. It turns out that cost and damage to the environment are the most important considerations of new energy development from the points of the public. We also found that community activity and propagation on the internet are the most acceptable ways for new energy propagation.
 
 
 
3. The knowledge of Bio-hydrogen
 
We are also curious about the public opinion of bio-hydrogen production. It turns out that the public don’t know well about the advantages of hydrogen as a new energy. Most people regard hydrogen as an unsafe form of energy and think it difficult for application to the industry, which is also the main problem that scientists want to solve.
 
 
For hydrogen production methods, water electrolysis is the most widely known. However, the public expect photo-biological water splitting as the most promising way, which is exactly what our project is focused on.
 
 
To get more specific opinions about our project, we also asked some detailed questions. To our surprise, most people have heard of microbes for energy production ad regard them as organisms with short life cycle and low energy consumption. Most of them can accept genetic modified organisms in hydrogen production, which makes it easier for propagation of our project.
 
 
 
4. The propagation of iGEM
 
In the last part of our questionnaire, we also designed some questions to propagate iGEM. The data shows that around 50% of respondents have heard of iGEM, and they mostly heard from educational or scientific research institutions. Besides, they treasure it as an opportunity to communicate other than competing as the meaning of this competition. It indicates that although iGEM is well-known to universities and scientific research institutes, it still lacks online propagation and social communities. Thus we made up plans to propagate iGEM through social activities"

Gaston Day School
Previous work to develop an arsenic sensor has been performed by several iGEM teams. Most recently, a team from the Gaston Day School devised a detection method for arsenic. They combined GFP with a promoter that produced a regulatory protein for arsenic, and developed a kit that could be distributed to people around the world struggling with arsenic contamination.
This kit contains in situ plasmid DNA in a test tube, as well as bleach, in order to dispose of the bacteria cells after use. The Gaston Day School used a spectrophotometer to quantitatively assess the GFP output. Since spectrophotometers generally cost about $200,000, it is reasonable to assume that the average user from Bangladesh, whose water carries the risk of arsenic contamination, would not be able to quantify the arsenic concentration in their water. Instead, they would be required to qualitatively identify the amount of GFP present in their kit. There is a fine line between a concentration of arsenic that is or is not toxic; as a result, qualitative analysis of GFP expression is not reasonable.
Raspberry Pi reader
The Cadets2Vets team provided a solution to this problem by designing a prototype camera for quantitatively assessing GFP expression. The camera itself was developed by our partners at ECBC (the Edgewood Chemical and Biological Center) and is made of an inexpensive Raspberry Pi, case, and RedBear boards. Cadets2Vets improved upon this model by building a box for ultraviolet imaging and altering the software that captures the image. The im"
Lethbridge,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," that Red Deer is implementing these pollinator parks, which to me is basically a ‘word of the day’. In the actual population of bees, putting in one or two or even ten of these one acre parks is not even going to do anything. We have 1800 acres of ‘bee park’ within the city. I think if we’re [going to get] the best bang for our buck, and we’re currently doing this, is reseeding the river valley with a native mix. We’re actually doing more than just focusing on one or two little parks around the city.
iGEM: Do you think that our idea would be sustainable?
Ryan: If it met certain parameters. The seed mix would have to be low growth, dry-land tolerant- we aren’t going to irrigate those boulevards. We currently don’t irrigate those roadways. It would have to be okay with the residents. It wouldn’t be something so drastic that they wouldn’t accept it and it would have to limit conflicts. So if we’re adding all of these flowers and people are getting stung left and right, we would have to take a look at it. So if we met all of those and looked at it systematically, we could come up with something.
iGEM: If we were to do this, what do you think members of the community would say?
Ryan: We would get varied opinions. Currently we are doing the river valley master plan. We are looking at what’s existing in the river valley, what needs to be changed, and what [needs to be done in the future]. Within that, we’re getting a variance of comments [from the community].
iGEM: If we did use flowers native to Southern Alberta, would it be as big of an issue with those who want it to be more natural?
Ryan: I don’t think so. I think that people are accepting of that. [It does take time] for people to accept it. Some people are going to complain, some might get really frustrated and write letters to the mayor. I think overall, it’s all in how you frame it. So I might frame it as there is a problem with bees. Bees help with everything from food production to everything else that they do. These are the steps that we’re taking to [help them]. [If you did this], I think you would get better acceptance.
iGEM: Would you see any further difficulties with this?
Ryan: The difficulty I see is that meeting with you, I can’t just go and implement this. So, if this is going"

Nithin's Notes
PCR to add the iGEM suffix to our PcQuad was done. We used igem prefix 1 and igem suffix 2 to run the reaction. The template DNA was obtained through the dna extraction that was done yesterday. This product was diluted to give us a 20ul tube of 1ng/ul. I loaded 500 ng of template for a 50 ul reacton.  After running the gel, we werent able to see the band that we wanted. But, we did see the same nonspecific band that had haunted us earlier shining ever so brightly.
I did change the annealing time from 25 seconds to 30 seconds for this reaction.

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  The PCR product from yesterday will be used as a template for the amplification reaction today.  If the amplification is successful, RE digestion, and possibly ligation, will also be done today.
Procedures:
Amplification:
Nithin ran the amplification, and made the agarose gels.
Observations:  The gel appeared to have no band at the desired product size, and only a very strong non-specific band.   The non-specific band was the same band that appeared in the previous PCR with the iGEM prefix and suffix #1 primers.  It was noted that the annealing time was set to 30sec, instead of the extension time.
Rerun of the amplification: From the PCR product of the initial amplification, 10uL of 1ng/uL stock was made using 0.635uL of 15.75ng/uL DNA.  The extension time was made to 30sec, and the annealing time was returned to 20sec.

Do you think that our project is feasible?
Your project is definitely feasible because it comes as an answer to the many questions that farming communities had in this ongoing climate change.
What do you see as the biggest obstacles to farmers potentially using our GMO?
The biggest obstacles that farmers will be faced with regarding the use of GMOs will only be how to prevent the negative impact on the environment that come with the benefits.
Lawyers
Dr. Jennifer Carter-Johnson, MSU Assistant Professor of Law
The laws and regulations surrounding GMOs are complicated and complex, but we hoped to better understand them. We took advantage of the law school at MSU, and spoke with an assistant professor. Along with her law degree, Jennifer Carter-Johnson has a PhD in microbiology, which gives her the ideal background for discussing GMO regulations and patents. Team members Jessica and Jordan meet with Dr. Carter-Johnson in person twice to discuss the government regulations and patent laws pertaining to our GM bacteria.
What is the legislation regarding GMOs (federal and state)?
Federal regulation provides a common framework as a group of laws. These regulate the marketing of GMO crops and cover international aspects such as importing and exporting. Everyone must comply with these, as they trump state regulations. State regulations are ad hoc, often covering issues such as when you can spray GM products. There are also new laws on labelling; all GMO food products will have to be labeled as such. This was passed in 2016 but is not in effect of now. THe EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) oversees crops with pesticides, such as BT corn, but your project would not fall under this. The USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) regulates crops based on plant pest; your project would have USDA implications. The FDA (Food and Drug Agency) has voluntary submissions.
How do GMO laws and regulations differ worldwide?
In the US, common thought is that GMOs are all the same; most are thought safe unless found not to be. We have the least strict laws and regulations, and the FDA has voluntary reporting standards. The European Union (EU) takes the precautionary principle. Most of the EU wants to be shown safety of the products first. They take GMOs more strictly.
Would farmers and companies that use our GM bacteria have difficulty selling their crops due to regulations/legislation?
There may be marketing issues, but labelling laws are not in effect yet.
Explain the ethics of patents on synthetic biology research.
Patents in the medical and food areas often cause ethical issues. For example, your product could be life saving, which causes many"

Polysialic Acid
The K1 strain of E. coli produces and encapsulates itself in alpha-2,8-linked  polysialic acid (PSA), a polysaccharide that biochemically mimics the human glycoprotein Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM). This similarity renders virulent K1 E. coli poorly immunogenic in humans because they aren’t seen as foreign and are therefore cloaked from antibody opsonization and complement-mediated killing. Clearly, equipping our minicells with such protection would be highly advantageous for improving their successful delivery rate and reducing harmful immune responses.
A significant amount of machinery (14 genes in total) is required to generate the PSA capsule in K1 E. coli and transferring this ability over to the comparatively docile K12 E. coli is quite the feat. Thankfully, we were able to find previous work by Dr. Eric Vimr that accomplished just that and obtained a single pSR23 plasmid that contains all the required genes. We are currently in the process of confirming the presence of PSA on our K12 E. coli via antibody-labeled fluorescence microscopy.

He                         informs that currently the successful UDCA synthesis rate is not hight enough and requires                         repeating measures to increase its purification ratio. It is very important for us to consider                         more about the balance between cost and profits if we want to further develop our method. Now,                         the exported UDCA drugs are highly demanded and we need to find ways to help simplify the                         production process and to increase the supply of UDCA-contained drugs.
Interview
Q：We still have some questions regarding to the market. It would be such a pleasure if you can                         share some of your ideas or understandings about them.
A : Please ask, I’m very glad to help you.
Q1: Could you please inform us UDCA medicine’s value in market and its efficacy?
A: UDCA is an cholic acid medicine that has choleretic effect to human bodies. It can cure                         various dan diseases like gallstone as well as hepatopathy including hepatic adipose                         infiltration. UDCA medicine has stronger healing effect than CDCA medicine while having less                         side effects in treatment. However, subtracted from bears, UDCA has a relatively high costs. And                         using UDCA directly converted by CDCA mainly has two benefits: first of all, it requires a lower                         cost because CDCA is subtracted from poultry like chickens, ducks, and geese; also, use CDCA                         instead of UDCA can help protect wild animals (bears.) Also, I consulted experts in our                         marketing department about it and they revealed to me that this approach has very high                         vendibility that medicines manufactured oversea are in short supply.
Q2: What is the basic principle of this drug design/production?
: First we extract CDCA from the bile of chicken, duck and geese. Then we convert CDCA into UDCA                         through two steps of redox reaction. These two substance are isomers than differ in their                         three-dimensional structure only.
Q3: We found out that there are only few factories manufactures UDCA medicine. Is it because the                         producing process’s complexity? Where is the complexity embodied in specific?
A: In fact, the actual process or technology used is not very complex but the key dangerous                         factor is the need of sodium, a dangerous, active metal that burns when it meets with water.                         Moreover, to consider this issue from other perspectives, UDCA medicine’s production copes wth                         the pressure from people’s safety and environment protection concerns. Therefore there are not                         too many factories that manufactures UDCA medicine.

Week 12 (July 17-July 21, 2017)
Our SP1 gBlock was re-digested with XbaI and HindIII-HF and ligated into a linearized pET29B backbone with XbaI/HindIII sticky ends. Colonies were run on a confirmation gel and the transformation of colony 3 appeared successful, as shown in Figure 2. A sample of SP1-colony 3 was submitted for sequencing.
Rachelle developed a line of cells that contain pET29B-RFP. This was done because HindIII and NotI restriction sites in pET29B are overlapping when there is no insert, making our double digests of SP2 with NotI and HindIII-HF very difficult. Thus, RFP was inserted to separate the two restriction sites and permit our digestion. Vector pET29B-RFP can be sequentially digested with HindIII-HF then NotI-HF to remove the RFP insert and leave the sticky ends intact for SP2 to be ligated to.
On the wiki, Sam and Kaitlin coded the Experiments page. Furthermore, we took individual and team photos so that we could start completing the Team page of the wiki.
Figure 2: Screening results of 3 colonies of DH5α transformed with pET29B-SP1. Plasmids from the colonies were digested with HindIII-HF and XbaI (DD) or HincII (RD) then run on a 1% agarose gel at 100V for 30 minutes. The molecular ladder (L) is visible on the far left and the expected band sizes, obtained from Benchling Virtual Digest, are visible on the right. Undigested plasmid (U) was used as a control and the digests from colony 3 (the only SP1-containing colony) are visible in lanes 11-13.

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters"

Fig. 1 Results of BsaI digestion of VF/R amplified MaSp2 2CA. Digestion of the fragment is mostly complete (compare to previously) . The faint band smear at 443 bp corresponds to undigested fragments. The bands at 150 and 184 correspond to digestion 'leftovers' that contain the VF+prefix and VR+suffix fragments respectively. The band at 100 bp corresponds to our desired digested product containing the sticky ends.
These results indicate that BsaI digestion of VF/R amplified products are viable, and this could be an alternate route to synthesizing MaSp monomers.

Safety Questions
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of research safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
There are potential safety concerns with our project, but they do not exceed the normal caution exercised when working with antibiotic-resistant organisms. Although the team is working with a lab strain of E. coli that must be provided with the proper nutrients to survive, we are also working with a variety of antibiotic-resistant plasmids. While we follow proper sterile protocol in our work in the lab, there is still a chance that a wild pathogenic bacteria may enter reactions. In this event, a wild bacteria may have the chance to acquire an antibiotic resistant plasmid. If it were to be removed from the lab, this bacteria could exchange this resistance factor with other bacteria. We do not work with virulent or potentially hazardous strains of bacteria in the lab, and thus would not risk infection or illness from these antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The only hazard is in allowing these antibiotic-resistant bacteria to transfer their plasmids to pathogenic bacteria outside the lab. Here there is the possibility of danger to the public or the environment depending on the strain of bacteria.
Since some of our project ideas require the use of specific antibiotics, their use and disposal must be taken into consideration. Some of these compounds are toxic or even carcinogenic to humans and must be handled appropriately. These compounds may also be toxic to the environment or public if they were to not be disposed of properly.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
None of our BioBrick components raise any safety issues other than the antibiotic resistance they carry. Steps must be taken to ensure the antibiotic resistance is not accidentally imparted to a pathogen bacterial strain. Otherwise all of the BioBricks created by the team are for analytical purposes only and can only produce fluorescent proteins when correctly used.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
Yes, there is a biological safety review board at Penn State University. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) records, reviews, and approves laboratory research based on the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules. They have approved the research conducted in our lab, and we are in full compliance with the biosafety regulations imposed on our work by the"

Summary and Conclusions
Our Results
We cloned three parts into the pSB1C3 shipping vector
BBa_K2450401 - OmpA-SpyTag-sfGFP(SpyTag N-terminus of OmpA)
BBa_K2450451 - OmpA-SpyTag-sfGFP (SpyTag C-terminus of OmpA)
BBa_K2450501 SpyCatcher-sfGFP-Quencher
We cloned BBa_K2450401 with and without the quenching peptide into pBAD-33, our expression vector of choice
We showed that the sfGFP was produced though microscopy and plate reader experiments
We determined that the quenching peptide was effective at quenching fluorescence by comparing the two parts in pBAD33
We showed that this quenching could be relieved by cleavage by the TEV protease by co-transforming another plasmid into the same strain and inducing both BBa_K2450401 and the TEV protease
It was unfortunate that we could not characterise the TorA leader, OmpA, or SpyTag-SpyCatcher system, however due to the design of the system we needed both parts to be induced simultaneously to get this characterisation. Our difficulties in cloning the OmpA-SpyCatcher part into an expression vector prevented this.
Improving Characterisation of an Existing Part
The Aachen 2014 iGEM team from which we took the GFP-TEV cleavage-Reach2 section of our part showed in their system that the quencher worked and that it could be relieved by cleavage by the TEV protease. We have added to this characterisation by comprehensively showing that the same effects occur even with:
The addition of a His tag onto the quenching peptide
The addition of upstream leader sequences (TorA and SpyTag)
The substitution of GFP for sfGFP
We have therefore taken another step towards the development of an assay for protease cleavage in OMVs. This could either be an assay to check for the localisation of a protease to the OMV or to see if the vesicles have been lysed by adding the protease to the media.

Background
amilCP is a blue chromoprotein from the coral Acropora millepora.
Aims
To improve the part by producing darker blue and/or other coloured mutants, to be used as a reporter gene in our biosensor.
Results
Produced 3 colour mutants:
• Pink
• Purple
• Mint Green
BioBricks
• BBa_K1996003 - pink colour mutant of amilCP
• BBa_K1996004 - purple colour mutant of amilCP
• BBa_K1996005 - mint green colour mutant of amilCP
Introduction
amilCP is a chromoprotein, derived from the coral Acropora millepora, that has a strong blue colour that is visible to the naked eye, with an absorbance maximum at 588nm.  The original part was developed by Team Uppsala Sweden 2011 ( BBa_K592009 ).
Motivations and use in biosensor
amilCP was chosen as the reporter gene for our biosensor as it is easily visible to the naked eye. This allows it to be easily observed by consumers in a fruit sticker version of our biosensor, or to be detected by scanners in a plate or handheld versions, without the need for extra equipment. In contrast, fluorescent proteins such as GFP would need an additional component to shine UV light before the output can be observed.
There were several reasons for our choice to improve amilCP:
• To allow for more sensitivity in the detection of the output – by creating a darker blue mutant
• To decrease response time – by creating a mutant that would turn blue faster
• To add to the spectrum of chromoproteins – by creating different coloured mutants
Error Prone PCR
To create our mutant amilCP, we used error prone PCR (EP-PCR). EP-PCR involves the addition of Mn2+, which increases the error rate of Taq DNA polymerase. This creates random mutations within the"

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Cholera - Detection_-_-_TEXT.html," up two E.Coli overnights for miniprep on Wednesday.
As part of our presentation on Friday we plan to present the results of whether our plasmid is functioning to detect cholera or not and why. We are still waiting for the sequencing results to come back to us. We also will present the research we have done on Lambda.
KP 4/8/13 I worked with kendall to set up an overnight so that we can do a mini-prep tomorrow to continue our sequencing of our plasmid. After we completed our overnight prep, we set up an experiment to test to ability of our plasmid to give off a color response to cholera. We prepared the 5 tubes that Kendall explained above, we then put them in the 30 C room overnight and we will check on them tomorrow.
4/10/13
KK 4/10/2013 Results from our overnight cholera preps: The first three tubes from the left are controls, one with pure LB, one with cholera + LB (which was grown at 30 degrees by the other subgroup), and one with E.Coli + LB, respectively. The fourth and fifth tubes have cholera, E.Coli, and LB. The fourth has a slightly greater number of cholera (500 microL of cholera-saturated broth) compared to the fifth (100 microL of cholera-saturated broth). These are the results after two days of shaker-incubation at 30 degrees C, when the cultures are viewed under UV light.
We went over the quorum-sensing circuit with Dr. Grose. The Cqss membrane receptor phosphorylates Lux U, which cascades phosphorylation to LuxO. LuxO, when phosphorylated, binds to the Qrr4 promoter, activating transcription of Qrr4 mRNA. Qrr4 mRNA interferes with HapR, so there is no protein HapR. HapR is a repressor whose binding site is at the promoter for GFP. When Qrr4 eliminates HapR, there is no repression of the expression of GFP. Thus, GFP should be ON when Cholera is NOT present. The reverse is also true. In the presence of Cholera autoinducer, CQSS acts as a phophatase on LuxU, which does the same to LuxO, which does NOT activate Qrr4 mRNA which does NOT degrade HapR which represses transcription of GFP. Thus GFP should NOT glow in the presence of cholera.
Our results in these test tubes aren’t exactly in agreement"
BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," easy to use that researchers in synthetic biology will be excited to make microfluidic chips. We want a workflow that interfaces with fabrication protocols that are low cost, such that even DIY hobbyists could make new chips. We wanted a workflow whose hardware could be fabricated with a 3D printer, and whose software is open source so that the entire synthetic biology community can contribute to new features in Neptune. Further, we wanted to ensure our workflow completely and cleanly integrates with current fabrication methods, so that we are still following current standards.
Open Source Software
While this is already an iGEM requirement, we are proud to say our source code for Neptune is licensed as open under a BSD-II license. Further, we are very proud to say that Neptune is public on GitHub, and we encourage developers to fork the repo.
Neptune is free to download from GitHub too, and very soon NONA will provide a distribution method.
GITHUB REPOSITORY
NONA
Simple Design Process
Accessibility means ease of use. Ease of use means simplicity; it means a no-brainer user interface and powerful code to help you design microfluidics with ease. Indeed, the biggest setback to designing microfluidics before Neptune was the tedious, long, and difficult process of hand-specifying all features in the microfluidic device. In Neptune, simple english-language descriptions allow you to specify complex microfluidic designs.
Tutorials, Wiki's, Documentation
Not knowing how to use a new tool can dissuade researchers from ever bothering to learn; poor documentation, lack of support for new users, confusing or nonexistent tutorials- all of these add up to a big headache to a researcher who wants to get into microfluidics.
We targeted this issue by creating a tutorial video for our software and hardware workflow. This tutorial is a complete “Hello World” walkthrough that will guide new researchers step-by-step through the microfluidic creation process. We hope that this will encourage anyone who had been intimidated by microfluidic design to come forward and give it a shot.
A  tutorial video is good, but not complete. We followed up by starting a extensive written tutorial to writing LFR and MINT files (to design microfluidics,) and written tutorials on how to setup the hardware components. We also added wiki into to the GitHub repositories for Neptune and our hardware, providing yet another resource for new users to try.
Integrated, Low Cost Fabrication Protocols
This is truly where the integrated human integration contributions become apparent. We had a clear choice here: We could have made Neptune interface with industry grade, powerful and very expensive fabrication methods using photolithography"

We have also found articles that describe how GANs were used to generate novel anti-cancer drug molecules that were not tested before, and proven to be effective alter on.
Deep down we already knew the question we wanted to ask - can we generate novel enzymes using the Generative Adversarial Networks?
Setting the goals
Despite the recent success of GANs in various field, to the best of our knowledge, no one attempted to apply this novel technique to proteins. In a way, it can be explained by the great complexity of such task. In order to proceed, one would need to re-design the architecture of GAN networks that work well with images and audio, to architecture that works well with sequences of amino acids.
This is why we have decided to create the world first Generative Adversarial Networks for Enzymatic Sequence generation.
We believe that the development of such framework will facilitate the discovery of novel and useful enzymes and accelerate the field of synthetic biology and protein engineering immensely."
Tsinghua,2011,Team:Tsinghua-A#Project#echo_-_-_TEXT.html," constant, so the RED signal comes out while GREEN fades away at the same time, and vice versa. Consequently, time goes, RED and GREEN flare alternately.
1.5 Why we need a delay?
Oscillation is more than just a feedback. In order to keep oscillating, the system should introduce a delay part to avoid a steady result.
Suggest a two-node system without a delay part, and write ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the interaction as follows:
dAdt=α∙Bn1k1n1+Bn1-μ∙A …...(1)
dBdt=β∙k2n2k2n2+An2-μ∙B …...(2)
set:
dAdt=0 …...(3)
dBdt=0......(4)
then we get a simplified equation:
1μ∙B-1β-1β∙k2n2∙αμ∙Bn1Bn1+k1n1n2=0......(5)
with (A0, B0) as a steady-state solution, the system is incapable to oscillate.
Figure: the improved network
Now we realize the importance of delay. Therefore, an auxiliary state B2 is introduced to the improved system, as a delay part. Moreover, B2 enables an access to maneuver the system.
1.6 What more can we achieve?
In our expectation, ECHO is not just a single oscillator. Three parameters that determine the property of an oscillation is the amplitude, the period and the phase, and we hope to maneuver each of the three independently.
The amplitude represents the intensity of the fluorescence. It’s not a hard work to amplify it by increasing the expressing rate of the GFP/ RFP gene. The period of the cycle is up to the accumulation of AHLs, so both the producing and the degrading will help. As for the phase, we design an extra circuit to generate AHLs under commands, in order to accelerate the process of accumulation before reaching the threshold, shorten a certain cycle and thus change the phase.
2. Project_Design
Two E.coli populations (CELL-A & B) regulate each other to realize oscillation under the QS modules, LuxI/LuxR together with LasI/LasR.
The constitutive promoter p1 in CELL-A produces LasR, a transcriptional regulator, who maintains its high concentration within the cell.

Swarming Assay
Fig.1 E. coli swarming to aspartic acid
L: aspartic acid (10 mM, 40 μl) R: ddH2O (40 μl)
Incubation: 108 hours
temperature: 30 ℃
E. coli cultured was spotted on the center of agar plate, and chemotaxis was spotted on 25 mm distant from the center.
The swarming circle of aspartic acid (L) was larger than that of ddH2O (R), and the swarming area around aspartate acid (L) was more larger than that of ddH2O (R), suggesting that E. coli swarming to aspartate acid.

The Bridge Between Microfluidics and Benchtop Biology
Welcome to the 2018 BostonU HW Project: TERRA
Microfluidics allows for the manipulation of small amounts of fluids on the scale of microliters and nanoliters. The application of microfluidics in synthetic biology research would enable scientists to design and implement synthetic biology systems more efficiently and with greater reproducibility.
While microfluidics is not new to the field of synthetic biology, it is not currently widely used or accessible to many benchtop biologists. The current “lab on a chip” microfluidic devices are highly specialized to each experiment and expensive to manufacture. In order to analyze the results of the experiments on microfluidic chips, many designs embed sensors directly into the chip. Many of these sensors, however, already exist as traditional analytical devices, such as plate readers. These devices could be used for analysis of microfluidic outputs if the outputs were dispensed selectively into a compatible vessel, such as a microtiter plate. If this were possible, synthetic biologists would be able to incorporate microfluidic chips to streamline their experiments without sinking time and money to design and fabricate highly specialized chips.
Our project, TERRA, aims to create an automated system that bridges benchtop biology and microfluidics. Terra is comprised of three main components:
Microfluidics: A microfluidic chip designed to execute a desired biological experiment.
Hardware: A low-cost, accessible active XY-plane selectively dispenses the output of the microfluidic chip to a 96-well plate and automated control syringes.
Software: A software interface that will allow the user to detail the parameters of the experiment run on the chip; the specific location per output on the 96-well plate; and the amount of each output dispensed."
