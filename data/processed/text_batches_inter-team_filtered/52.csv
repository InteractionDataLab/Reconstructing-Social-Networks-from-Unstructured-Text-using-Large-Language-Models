Wash_U,2009,Team:Wash U#Biological Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," we can determine exactly how much efficiency is gained by adding a red light sensor.  The absorption spectra of a DBCOmega mutant (LH2 deficient) transformed with pRKCBC3 containing the puc promoter and pucB/A genes will allow us to characterize the puc promoter under high and low oxygen conditions.
More absorption of light at the LH2 spectra peaks normalized to culture OD corresponds with more transcription and vis versa.
Method
Cultures were grown in the dark at 34° C, shaking at 160 rpm.  The anaerobic test condition was established by inoculating a 10 ml culture tube with 10 ml M22 tet 5ug/ml with a loop of R. sphaeroides DBCΩ pRKCBC3 and capped with a rubber stopper.  The aerobic test  condition was established by innoculating a 10 ml culture tube with 5ml M22 tet 5ug/ml with a loop of R. sphaeroides DBCΩ pRKCBC3 and covered with vented cap- the vented cap and relatively low culture volume left significant headroom in the culture for oxygen exchange. Oxygen tension was not able to be quantitatively measured due to the nature of the experiment
For measurement of pucB/A expression from the puc promoter:
Cultures were removed from the incubtor and placed on ice to slow changes in cellular composition. 1 ml was extracted from each culture and a UV-vis absorption spectra of the culture was taken from 300-950 nm.   The optical density of the cultures at 600nm was used to normalize the absorption spectrum by division by this value.  Background subtraction of spectrophotometer data was performed in Origin 6.1 Software.  A ten-point baseline was created by a ""positive peak"" algorithm then modified to approximate the scattering curve that falls as the inverse fourth power of wavelength.
Results
Conclusion
This data matches the literature for expression from the puc promoter at different oxygen tensions and as such confirms the assumptions that we have made in modeling our system.
See: Braatsch et al. 2002
Future Characterization
The next step in our characterization of our synthetic red light response system is to analyze changes in phosphorylation of ompR in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.  In our final system, we only want puc genes to be transcribed and expressed via halting the autophosphorylation of ompR, not simply the puc promoter as it naturally occurs.  By placing the ompR coding region"

INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS
The main industrial application of our talking yeast is to know the moment at which fermentation started. This is possible because we can calculate the time elapsed since the medium ran out of glucose according to the fluorescence intensity. Taking this into account, we could ask the yeast, through the addition of hydrogen peroxide: “How long have you been fermenting?” And the cells would answer telling us how long it has been since all the glucose was consumed. One possible answer could be “I have been fermenting for 1 hour”.
There is also a second possible application, but it needs a more detailed explanation:
There are several factors affecting yeast ethanol production during alcoholic fermentation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae seems to have adapted all along its evolution to optimize its growing rate in environments that are rich in easily assimilable nutrients, such as sugars and amino acids.
There are two important characteristics responsible of S. cerevisiae adaptation to this particular niche. One of them is its capability of metabolizing glucose and fructose through both the respiration and the fermentation pathways. The second one is its ability to grow in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. All of this makes this species exhibit some metabolic peculiarities, such as the Pasteur and the Crabtree effects. The Crabtree effect, described in S. cerevisiae and in a few other yeast species, must be taken into account when ethanol production is being studied or modified during fermentation. This effect causes that, even under high concentration of oxygen and with a relatively low amount of glucose, a considerable fraction of the consumed sugar is used to produce ethanol through the fermentative pathway. This is why in every industrial process which requires yeast growth (such as starter yeast production) it is necessary to provide the optimum amount of glucose that permits its direct consumption through the respiratory pathway (or the other way round if fermentation is desirable, such in bioethanol production).
We present here one way of monitoring the fate of glucose in the medium. By adding a small amount of hydrogen peroxide as a chemical input, we plan to ask our culture: “Is there any glucose left?”, and the culture would answer -according to the amount of glucose already present in the medium- what concentration would be necessary to optimize either yeast growth or fermentation through the Crabtree effect. In this way, the Crabtree effect could be monitored (perhaps even"

Mitochondrial Leader Sequence
Introduction
Mitochondrial Leader Sequence (MLS) helps direct proteins to the mitochondria when this peptide sequence is in front of the N-terminus of the protein of interest. MLS will be removed upon the peptide’s translocation into the mitochondria, but four additional amino acid residues (Ile-His-Ser-Leu) will be left at the N-terminus of the protein. The CDS of MLS was cloned out from pCMV/myc/mito (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA) using PCR.
MLS is submitted in RFC25 standard ( BBa_K1119001 ) to facilitate fusing with other CDS. MLS in RFC10 standard ( BBa_K1119001 )is submitted as alternative, but it cannot be fused directly to other CDS due to the limitations of RFC10. Users who obtained the part in RFC10 standard can obtain the part by PCR and fuse to other domains using overlapping PCR.
In our characterization, the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of MLS was assembled in frame with that of GFP reporter using Freiburg’s RFC25 format ( BBa_K648013 ). The translation unit was driven by CMV promoter ( BBa_K1119006 ), and terminated by hGH polyA signal ( BBa_K404108 ). The aforementioned construct ( BBa_K1119009 ) was then transfected into HEK293FT cells. Mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker® Red CMXRos dye after transfection and co-localization between the GFP signal and that of the dye was determined as the area of signal overlap. To provide a positive control, the CDS of EGFP from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was"

We looked into protocols.io’s API , another protocol database, and contacted the team there to try and get access to the public protocols without the user’s login details. Their cofounder, Alexei Stoliartchouk, informed us that they are working on adding that ability but at the time of writing it had not yet been implemented.
We also looked into sourcing protocols from OpenWetWare . Despite having an immensely useful database the protocols are not in any standard format and thus very difficult to parse automatically. We talked with Michigan Software , who are looking into standardising a protocol format as part of their human practices work.
Testing and feedback
Several teams tested it at the UK meetup, including Judd-UK. Judd suggested the team lookup feature and the ability to repeat a step in the protocol (as opposed to just next and back), both of which we implemented soon after.
Judd also suggested having a command to skip to a particular step. We tried to implement this but found it wasn’t feasible as it caused conflicts with the part lookup feature. This was because the natural language processing algorithms tended to match the numbers to part IDs.
Future work
As it’s open-source (GPLv3 license) and available on Github , other teams are free to build other functions or improve the current ones. In the future all kinds of biological queries could be supported such as looking up particular reagents or safety instructions. It also has the potential to control future IoT lab equipment, such as WiFi-enabled centrifuges or electrophoresis power supplies.

Tuesday 17th August - Re-restriction
Steve, Caz and Matt attempted the restriction digest again with a lower concentration of ladder DNA compared to the plasmids. Tom returned home in the morning for a bit to carry on work on the wiki before returning at 2pm to interview DTU-Denmark. Nii and Narmada had a meeeting with Qaiser to try clarify some technical aspects of the modelling. Tom, Matt, Caz and Steve later plated out some cells to see if the transformations were successful on the Kanamycin and Ampicillin plates. At 5pm Tom interviewed Virginia.
Evening plans are at Matt's for homemade curry and Tekken!

If antibiotics are required, add them when the autoclaved medium has cooled to 50 °C. Plates should dry for at least 15 min in a sterile hood with lid off to reduce condensation. Before use, remove prepared plates from the refrigerator and keep them at RT for at least 10 min to avoid condensation and cold shock to the cells.
0.8% (wt/vol) Agarose gels: For 100 ml, add 0.8 g of agarose to 100 ml of 1× Tris/boric acid/EDTA (TBE) buffer. Completely melt the agarose gel in a microwave and then cool it to ~60 °C. Add 5ul of ethidium bromide solution (10 mg ml−1), mix it thoroughly, pour the gel into a mold with an appropriate comb and let it solidify. The agarose gels should be freshly prepared before use.

Figure 5: BPA degradation by E. coli KRX carrying genes for BisdA and BisdB (only bisdA (black), polycistronic bisdAB (red) and fusion protein between BisdA and BisdB (green)) behind the medium strong constitutive promoter <partinfo>J23110</partinfo> with RBS <partinfo>B0034</partinfo>. Cultivations were carried out at 30 °C in LB + Amp + BPA medium for 24 h and 36 h, respectively, with automatic sampling every three hours in 300 mL shaking flasks without baffles with silicon plugs. At least three biological replicates were analysed (three for bisdA alone, seven for bisdAB polycistronic and five for the fusion protein).
We also carried out these cultivations at different temperatures and BPA concentrations, but the chosen conditions (30 °C and 120 mg L-1 BPA) seem to be the best. Higher BPA concentrations have an effect on the growth of E. coli and higher temperature leeds to a worse BPA degradation (probably due to misfolding of the enzymes). Lower temperature also leeds to less BPA degradation (probably due to slower growth, expression and reaction rate at lower temperatures). These data on the effect of the temperature on the BPA degradation is shown in fig. 6.
Figure 6: BPA degradation by E. coli KRX carrying genes for BisdA and BisdB (polycistronic bisdAB (black) and fusion protein between BisdA and BisdB (striped)) behind the medium strong constitutive promoter <partinfo>J23110</partinfo> with RBS <partinfo>B0034</partinfo>. Cultivations were carried out at different temperatures in LB + Amp + BPA medium (starting concentration 120 mg L-1 BPA)  for 24 h in 300 mL shaking flasks without baffles with silicon plugs. Samples were taken at the end of the cultivation. Three biological replicates were analysed.
As shown by Sasaki et al. (2008) , BisdB expressed in E. coli leeds to hardly no BPA degradation. In our experiments we could not detect the BPA degradation products 1,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propanol and 2,2-B"

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Tools#Gibson assembly_-_-_TEXT.html," primers that contain the overhang on their 5' end. After the PCR, you can purify your reaction products with a PCR purification kit and measure the DNA concentration.
Preparing the assembly reaction: In order to have a successful reaction, you must mix together equimolar ratios of each of the parts. An easy way to calculate this is to divide the DNA concentration by the part length; you can also go on the Gibthon Construct Designer website and use the online tool. For inserting a gene in a plasmid backbone, we suggest to use a 2:1 ratio of the gene over the backbone.
Running the reaction: Add Gibson mastermix and simply heat the tubes at 50°C for 45 minutes. You can use a normal PCR cycler for this step.
Transforming cells: After the reaction, simply use a few microliters of it to transform cells.
Negative control: For the negative control, make a Gibson reaction on just the plasmid backbone DNA and transform it. This will show you how much of the backbone closes itself up in your actual Gibson reaction.
Preparing the parts
Left overhang (green):
The backbone has a light green extension, whose sequence is the first 20bp of the RFP fragment
The RFP fragment has a dark green extension, whose sequence is the last 20bp of the backbone
Right overhang (red):
The backbone has a dark red extension, whose sequence is the last 20bp of the RFP fragment
The RFP fragment has an orange extension, whose sequence is the first 20bp of the backbone
Advantages
No need to use restriction enzymes: this can sometimes be very tricky, if a cleavage site is present in one of your sequences. Also, it means that you can perform Gibson on any DNA sequence.
Simplified reaction: 45min at 50°C replaces digestions and religations.
No scar: this allows you to place a promoter and RBS in front of a gene for example
Disadvantages
Primers are more complicated to design and longer - they are more expensive and take longer to be produced
The reaction mastermix is expensive - due to large amounts of Taq ligase needed
A lot of negative results, due to the tendency of the plasmid backbone to close up on itself

Preparation
James has part of the solution...literally!
Items needed
Lysozyme (not available, ordered)
10mM (0.01M) Potassium phosphate (Crystal form available, ordered)
50mM (0.05M) KCl (Stock solution of 1M available)
1mM (0.001M) MgCl2 (Stock solution of 0.5M available)
L-alanine (not available, ordered)
0.01M Potassium Phosphate Solution
MW * Desired Volume (L) * Desired Molarity (M)
174.18 * 0.1L * 0.01M = 0.174g
Therefore, 0.174g of Potassium Phosphate is mixed with 0.1L of DI water to make 0.1L of 0.01M Potassium Phosphate
0.05M KCl Solution
1M (Stock Solution) / 0.05M (Desired Molarity) = 20
Therefore, in order to obtain a solution of 0.05M, the stock solution needs to be diluted 20 times.
Desired volume = 0.1L
100ml / 20 = 5ml of KCl, and DI water would make up 95ml, producing 100ml of 0.05M KCl solution
0.001M MgCl2 Solution
0.5M (Stock Solution) / 0.001M (Desired Molarity) = 500
Therefore, in order to obtain a solution of 0.001M, the stock solution needs to be diluted 500 times.
Desired volume = 0.1L
100ml / 500 = 0.2ml of MgCl2, and DI water would make up 99.8ml, producing 100ml of 0.001M MgCl2 solution
The above 3 solutions have been prepared and sent for autoclaving. The group is now awaiting the ordered items, to carry on with the recovery of the cwlD spores. Meanwhile, we're in the progress of planning for the next lab session.

Our team reviewed primers design for our Golden Gate Assembly with emphasis on ensuring proper ligation of our products. This involved matching melting temperatures, ensuring there were no palindromic sequences, and considering the other requirements involved. Primer design is integral to our overall project since we must successfully use Golden Gate Assembly to synthesize our parts. Much of our time has been spent towards this goal.
Also, Ferritin gene sequences have arrived. We have transformed, MiniPrepped and ready as a template for the Golden Gate primers.
Also received this week were the redesigned primers for extracting beta-lactamase from the pSB1A3 plasmid. These primers were used in three combinations to produce the beta-lactamase gene by itself, the beta-lactamase gene with a His-tag at the end and a beta-lactamase gene with a flexible glycine linker ( BBa_K157013 ) fused to the N-terminus of the protein. The gels of these PCRs indicated that the experiment was successful (Figures 6, 7).  These products were PCR purified in order to be used for constructions.

We performed sensitivity analysis to discover ways to improve the effect of CRISPRi repression and to more precisely estimate the parameters above. Sensitivity analysis was performed on a global and local level. Since we were interested in improving upon the best possible case of our system, analysis was performed using the 35-fold model. Local sensitivity analysis involves computing the relative change of the steady state with respect to a change in the parameter. Using Matlab and a finite-difference approximation of the derivative, sensitivities were calculated for 5% changes in the parameters. The larger the sensitivity of the parameters shown below (in magnitude), the more important it is for said parameter to be estimated precisely.
The data provided by the local sensitivity analysis provides insight into parameters that need further investigation, such as the Hill Coefficient. However, these parameters are structural and cannot be easily modified through external control. Therefore, it was determined that a more overarching analysis be performed that covers a broad range of the parameter space. Global sensitivity analysis provides a method of estimating parameters that have the greatest effect on the system over a large range. We chose to use an approach that accounted for observed data from (Qi et al., 2013), as used during the least squares fit. The approach used is equivalent to used by Chang and Delleur (Chang et al., 1992) as well as Jia and Yue
. The steps of this analysis are explained below:
Formulate upper and lower bounds for the parameters. We chose to let parameters vary one magnitude above and below the least squares fit.
Generate a set of sample parameter sets that fall within the upper and lower bounds using Latin Hypercube Sampling. Latin
Hypercube sampling is a technique that effectively distributes random samples over a space of values. It ensures good coverage without needing to generate an absurdly large number of samples.
Run a simulation for every parameter set and calculate their errors from the observed data set (in our case, Qi et. al)
Calculate the average error, and set this as a threshold.
Choose a parameter named Q.
Partition parameter sets as acceptable and unacceptable.

Freiburg_Bioware,2010,Team:Freiburg Bioware#Project#insertion of motifs into surface-exposed loops_-_-_TEXT.html," were subsequently used in two different sandwich ELISAs. The first one aims at the detection of the particle’s ability to bind IgG-antibodies. The therapeutical antibody Cetuximab was employed to test the affinity of the virus particles. As displayed in figure 1A, only Z34C-presenting particles should be immobilized and only assembled viral capsid will be detected due to the affinity of the A20 antibody (as described above). Figure 1B shows that absorbance signal were obtained in case of the 587KO-Z34C and 587KO-Z34C-spacer insertions. Loop 453-Z34C did not yield any significant absorbance signals. In addition, the assay was performed with undiluted samples and those which were 10-fold diluted in PBST + 0.5 % BSA. Signal strengths in the undiluted ELISA samples indicated that the assay was saturated, therefore the diluted sample data were used for evaluation. The ABTS conversion indicates that highest amount of Z34C-presenting viral particles is present in the Äkta fractions 7-9 of the two different 587 insertions. No viral particles with a binding affinity for the IgG antibody were present in the 453 samples.
A: Sandwich-ELISA scheme for the detection of AAV-2 particles. Immobilization is achieved by binding to the A20 capture molecule which also acts as the biotinylated detection antibody after washing. Intact viral capsids can be specifically detected by Strepavidin-HRP
B: ELISA using the principle described in A for loop insertion samples obtained by gel filtration chromatography of 453- and 587-Z34C particles. Undiluted and 10-fold diluted samples were employed
C: qPCR data for the CMV-promoter-based DRP-titer determination. Samples as in B
D: ELISA signals obtained by absorbance measurements from B at 405 nm, diluted samples
A second approach was conducted to reveal the reason for the absence of Z34C-presenting particles in case of the 453 insertion. The sandwich ELISA, as shown in figure 2A, uses the A20 antibody to capture and detect all assembled viral capsids independent of the presence of a Z34C motif giving the so-called physical AAV titer (see figure 2D). To correlate these measurements, we additionally conducted qPCR measurements to determine the amount of encapsidated vector plasmids, the so-called DRP (DNAse-resistant particle) titer (see figure 2"

Goals
Since firstly taking part in iGEM in 2007, Peking iGEM has the tradition communicating with other teams in China. This activity strengthens Peking iGEM Team’ understanding of synthetic biology as well as this competition, deepens friendship with other teams, widens views towards the advanced fields of model biology.
During this summer, Peking iGEM 2014 kept this tradition for the following purposes:
a. communicating experiments and modelling with other teams.
b. Investigating how synthetic biology as well as iGEM Competition spread in China.
c. Spreading the knowledge of algal bloom and promoting our project.
Trip
In later August, Peking iGEM 2014 visited several universities in China and paricipated in the First Central China iGEMers’ Meet Up.(Figure 1) And some universities went to us with their ideas and questions. During the trip, we visited SJTU, ZJU, and USTC. To these teams, we introduced our project “Ranger amongst Enemies”, especially introduced the modelling part.
Figure 1： WANG Chenggong was explaining our project in the Central China iGEM Meet Up
Zhejiang University
19th, August, we arrived at ZJU (Zhejiang University). On the meeting, biosafety was the main topic. ZJU was doing experiments on E.coli genome, so they were seeking a comprehensive plan preventing leakage of modified gene. While we used an algae toxin Microcystin(MC) in our experiments, biosafety is a serious concern to us. Instrutor of ZJU iGEM was invited to join their discussion. (Figure 2)

FUTURE AND APPLICATION
Aiming at controlling and eliminating pests, TERMITE TERMINATOR uses modified bacterium to produce insecticide. In order to attract termites successfully, deliver the packed and carried by chemical agents. This novel way of insecticide delivery create an eco-friendly model to eliminate pests and can be directly applied to other pest control projects. As our purpose is to control termites which do great harm to people' houses, we can bring the result of the project into production. The business outlook is considerably broad because our project is environmentally friendly and closely associated with people's daily life. Those who have suffered from termite invasion might accept the product easily for the dramatic insecticidal effect and non-ecological influence.
We take advantage of synthetic biology to improve the drug production, cut the industrial cost of the drug and even save the purification process, which will make it more convenient for utilization of the drugs. We offer not only a whole system for killing pests, but also a referable model that uses nano size chemicals to pack bacteria for biomedicine, food manufacturing and cosmetic industry.

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced a an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all award, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," project days in cooperation with the teachers. Our overall goal was to give them an understanding of synthetic biology and microbiology and introduce iGEM to them.
We gave a presentation about synthetic biology, our project and the iGEM competition in general and afterwards gave a safety instruction and performed some experiments with them. During the visits, we were happy to answer all of their upcoming questions as they got more and more in touch with synthetic biology, our project and iGEM.
Since we visited different grades with students of different ages, we adapted every presentation and each experiment to the particular school and their demands. After the experiments and the dialogue with the students we spend some time with the teachers to reflect on our visit. While talking to them we discovered the lack of possibilities for them to perform biological experiments in schools. To meet those needs, we created a collection of easy to understand experiments that do not require any specific equipment.

Monschau
We visited a girl’s school in Monschau on two days. First, we talked to several teachers to plan and prepare our visit. We benefit from the teacher’s hints about which topics might be interesting for the students. It was a great pedagogical experience for us, as we had to think of a way how to explain the biological topics to students who do not have a huge biological knowledge.
We thought a lot about it and in the end, it was a great success. We could evoke curiosity and the girls asked a lot of questions about Synthetic Biology and iGEM.
Aachen
Moreover, we visited the St. Ursula Gymnasium in Aachen and presented our work to students who already had a good biological background through their school. We created a new presentation for this purpose and experiments adjusted to their level of knowledge. It turned out that many students were interested in choosing a biology-related topic as their study field. This led us to explaining more about our university and talking about different subjects which are interesting for example Synthetic Biology. Later, we had a lively talk with the teachers who gave us some feedback and discussed the role of genetic engineering in Germany.
Düsseldorf
In Düsseldorf, in cooperation with two different schools, we organized a whole “Biotech-Day”. It was an and challenging experience for us because there were 89 students for whom we needed to do a lot of preparation. But luckily, with the help of the teachers we managed to plan the day. We did not only present the theoretical"

Network Restriction: If you want to carry out topological identification, this file lets you cut unnecessary edges between species and restrict special rate term form of ceritain species. For other cases, this file also plays the role to input a certain topological structure. Compared to Initial Parameters File, there are two less columns in this file. The first three columns ""flag"", ""object"", ""activator"" are used to specify an edge in the network while the last column ""func_list"" determine type of the edge.
Parameter Restriction: Lets you specify a parameter value that holds at all times during the identification. The organization of this file is absolutely the same with Initial Parameters File. This file is not needed unless you want to do identification.
Parameter Relation Restriction: Lets you specify mathematical constraints on one or more parameters, species, or compartments that must hold during a simulation
Parameter Range: Lets you specify the feasible range of parameters regardless of ""7. PARAM_RESTRI"". The organization of this file is similar to Initial Parameter File, while the last two columns ""min"" and ""max"" are minimum and maximum value of a parameter, instead of a certain value.
Candidate Function List: All possible types of functions following different kinetic laws (see Table.1). User define functions are added to the end of this file.
Algorithm Parameters: Lets you specify parameter values in genetic algorithm. ""population"",""mutation_ratio"",""recombine_ratio"",""max_cycle"" are set in this file.

SCU-China,2018,Team:SCU-China#project#indigo_-_-_TEXT.html," our dCas9 protein and sgRNA present their biological function successfully.
We tried to use electro-transformation to co-transform these two plasmids (vector of dCas9 without GFP, the basic circuit) for several times, but the efficiency was quite low. Therefore, we are working on assemble the two functional devices into one plasmid in the following days.
We designed and synthesized the 20bp variable sequence of gRNA (J23100), which is critical for its specific targeting. Next, we use primer annealing to insert this sequence to the sgRNA generator plasmid (BBa_K1689000), which was submitted by 2015 Peking iGEM team, to successfully built the T7-gRNA (J23100)-pSB1C3 vector. Then, we chose 3A assembly method to build the basic circuit by inserting J23100-GFP fragment (BBa_J364007) into T7-gRNA (J23100)-pSB1C3 backbone.
The successful ligation of T7-gRNA (J23)-pSB1C3 backbone and J23100-GFP inserts using 3A assembly is shown as follows.
Bacteria Genome Editing——Knock in
In order to minimize the plasmid applied in CRISProgrammer, we are supposed to design a modularization workflow by applying CRISPR/Cas9 system to write (knock in) and erase (knock out) parts in genome.
We tried to apply Red/ET4 system, which comes from Lambda bacteriophage, and RecA protein 5,6, which could improve the stability of single strand DNA, to assist the
HR process. Besides, two plasmids system or two step method will work at low efficiency and is time-consuming, so we try to combine all parts into one big plasmid which could shorten the period of workflow. There should be no plasmid or antibiotic gene remaining in bacteria after genome editing, therefore, we used pSC101 temperature sensitive origin of replication7, the plasmid containing which would replicate at a low efficiency under 37℃ and finally loses after 1 day’s incubation. Considering the cytotoxicity of Cas9 protein, and the controllability of knock in system, we used arabinose (Ara) promoter to control the expression of Cas9 protein and recombination related proteins, because the leaky expression of Cas9 protein could not only slow down the grow of bacteria, but also decrease the efficiency of transformation. Providing glucose only should inhibit gene transcription. While providing ar"

To that end, we've undertaken a number of different approaches to establish contact between ourselves and parties that we believe might have a vested interest in our final product. These include questionnaires sent to several companies - including NASA and our attendance at a University open day. Attendance at the open day generated feedback from new scientists about our project, including how accessible they found the research and any potential uses they thought it could have.
Public outreach
Click the icons below to visit our Twitter and Youtube accounts, as well as Ellin's blog. A summary of all our video logs can be found on our Team Diary page or by clicking on the youtube account link below.
The video logs were made every week so that we could give everyone an insight into what it's like to do iGEM. It gave information about the team in a highly accessible and technologically relevant format; and best of all - it allowed us to communicate with people outside the lab in a more personal manner compared with a lab book.
Check out our Twitter feed for date specific information on our successes and our 'almost-but-not-quite' successes of the project.
Interested in a personal video log of each week of the project? Each of the 9 recorded weeks were summarised by a different team member.

Live-lab
We recorded a time-lapse video every day at the lab. This one sums up all of Week 3. The video is posted on youtube so the whole world can have a look at what working in a synthetic biology laboratory is really like, though we are of course working so fast that the naked eye can hardly see!
One of the main purposes for making this video was to give the public the chance to get a look inside an actual laboratory, an experience that many scientists take for granted. We hope that this time-lapse video helps to alleviate some of mystery surrounding life in the lab.

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Design2_-_-_TEXT.html,", C.elegans has many advantages.It is one of the simplest organisms with a nervous system. Research has explored the neural and molecular mechanisms that control several behaviors of C.elegans, including chemotaxis, thermotaxis, mechanotransduction, learning, memory, and mating behaviour. Therefore, C.elegans is a suitable model organism which we can easily manipulate and observe. In our program, we aim to change the physical behaviour of C.elegans by using the two specific optogenetic traits. Through microinjection and selection, we are able to get two strains with two phenotypes of the preference to blue light and the aversion to red light, and the next step is to obtain the single worm with the combination of these 2 different traits. To achive our objectives, we choose a mating method, because it is less time-consuming and easier to operate than microinjecting the other array to the existed strain. In general, mating is the pairing of either opposite-sex or hermaphroditic organisms. However, for C.elegans, mating can hybridize two different traits on the next generation by the paring of the hermaphrodite and the male. Besides, one of the greatest advantages of C.elegans is that it can either autocopulation or hybridization, which means that after hybridization, the hermaphrodite can self-fertilize and guarantee to produce a large number of offsprings with identical genetic characteristics. Here is the mating procedures:    1.Heat shock to get males(30℃,8h).    2.Parents mating to get the first filial hybrid generation(：=3:4).    3.Single out each hermaphrodite in a small plate.    4.Test the fluorescence of F1.    5.Single out F1 and self-fertilizing to get F2.    6.Test the fluorescence of F2.

The gel image below belongs to the PCR confirmation of FucO composite part insertion by using isolated plasmid from colony 3. The PCR we’ve conducted with FucO left and VR primers, using the plasmid as template, was to check orientation of our part in backbone. The expected band length was 754 bp, we decided that 6th and 7th wells (starting with ladder) confirm our transformation.

We’ve conducted a colony PCR with GSH specific primers to test our transformations of composite part 2 in DH5α. We wanted to see a band of 225 bp on gel and all GSH colonies have given the band as expected. Below, wells from 11 to 17 confirm our transformations were successful and the 6th colony has given the best result.

Composite part 3: Dual Insertion of FucO and GSH in pSB1C3 ( BBa_K2571006 ) PCR Confirmation:
Our composite part 3 has the genes both FucO and GSH as coding regions and was successfully inserted in the pSB1C3 backbone. After transforming the plasmid to DH5α competent cells, we’ve conducted the colony PCR with FucO specific primers and our expected band length for confirmation was 194 bp (figure 12). All the results seen on the gel (wells 3-11) were positive, proving that our clonings were successful and we have come to the conclusion that the best band was shown by the 3rd colony.

Far East Bio Tec
We want to build some connections between the society and our lab work. We are convinced that we will not succeed to accomplish our project without the interaction outside the lab, including learning the market trend in algae and energy field, novel technology applying and gaining suggestions to our project. Furthermore, we believe that we have the responsibility to eliminate the misunderstanding about genetic engineering in a community. As a result, sharing the experience about conducting a high standard of biosafety in our project is necessary. Introducing the iGEM spirit and promoting the concept of synthetic biology are also important goals we want to reach through all kind of activities outside the lab.
This summer, we were honored to meet with Far East Bio-Tec Company(FEBICO) in their headquarter.
Far East Bio-Tec Company is the largest microalgae supplier in Asia, and its clients are located mostly in Japan, Europe, and the USA. Providing high-quality microalgae products to serve public's nutritional, cosmetic and biomedical needs is their primary mission.
Mr. C. C. Chiueh, the founder of FEBICO, met us in person. He not only gave us some professional suggestions from an enterprise view but also inspired us to find out more prospective ways to conduct our project. We summarize the key points we have reached in this conversation ：

BGU_Israel
In the spirit of iGEM we met with the only other iGEM team from Israel, BGU_Israel , from Ben Gurion University of the Negev. We met at Tel Aviv University, presented our projects to each other, shared ideas and discussed collaboration. BGU helped us by testing out our Gate 1. Although our team projects are very different from one another, the Policy and Practices projects have a similar theme. Both teams aimed to help the Arab minority in our country; BGU with their campaign to help the Bedouin community in the Negev Desert combat diabetes, and the Technion with our “Synthetic Biology in 3 Languages” program to foster Arab-Jewish relations through the media of education and science.  After a particularly difficult summer, we both felt that our Policy and Practices projects needed to help bridge the gap between the two peoples in the hopes of bringing us one step closer to a peaceful region. 2014 is the first year that Israel is represented in iGEM by two teams and we hope to bring honor to our country and nation.

Lethbridge_HS,2017,Team:Lethbridge HS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," Carbon Black production and reduce the frequency of these harmful practices. Our use of synthetic biology to produce the pigments will allow us to have a minimal amount of byproducts, which include Carbon dioxide and cellular debris. Our project will become more applicable in the industry as the world moves away from the use of petroleum, as more money is being invested into sources of renewable energy, as shown in Figure 1.
This graph reveals that the global community is putting increasing importance on the need for alternative sources of energy. Investment has increased significantly in the past decade, from $7 billion in 2000, to $154 billion in 2010(4). This increase in investment will eventually result in less demand for petroleum-based energy, which will in turn result in a decrease in the availability of the Carbon Black pigment. This is when a product such as our own will flourish in the ink industry and its related sectors.
Interview with Dr. Greg Vilk
Members of our team had the amazing opportunity to interview Dr. Greg Vilk, who has a phD in biochemistry and works in the liaison office at the University of Lethbridge. During the meeting, a discussion on how our project would develop as a business took place, allowing us to gain more information on how patents and other intellectual properties work. As well, Mr. Sean Roberts and Mr. Keith Aiken were also in attendance during the meeting, adding more perspectives and ideas during the discussion.
In regards to Intellectual Property (IP), we learned of the different types that it can include, such as trademarks, trade secrets, and patents. Dr. Vilk discussed of how the different types of IP can be used together to create value for the product. Moving on to patents, we learned of a public database (lens.org) to search for pre-existing patents on the different enzymes, and parts of our construct. This is crucial as if a patent already exists, it will be difficult for us to use in a business. The discussion then turned to looking at the commercialization viewpoint of iGEM. If our ink production did turn into a business, who would obtain the profits, iGEM or our team? This led to realizing that the best option is to enter a partnership with iGEM to benefit both parties, if a business were to develop.
The conversation then turned to marketing. As the largest benefit in our pigment production is the friendliness to the environment, this would be the angle that our marketing would be based upon. It was also suggested for our team to focus on the successful production of just one pigment instead of all four, as this is an example of"

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Description Laccase_-_-_TEXT.html," a terminal oxygen reducing site. Laccases were long reported to be present in some lignin- bio-degrading fungi, where they catalyse the oxidation, including carbonyl formation, of aromatic compounds. Nonetheless, there is considerable evidence showing laccase’s affinity to non-aromatic substrates, such as saturated hydrocarbons.
 
Due to the lack of any hydrolysable functional group, a specific enzymatic attack on the PE backbone may not be favourable; however, a random oxidation on PE could effectively weaken its chemical integrity. Presently, the activity of laccase on PE has been confirmed by documented cases from scientific research papers as well as from past iGEM projects. For instance, University London College IGEM team 2012 proposed that the laccase could lead to increased deterioration of polyethylene structure and was confirmed by the SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) which showed an evident scratch made on a PE film surface after incubation with laccase, compared to the control. Moreover, in research conducted by other teams, crude laccase secreted by rhodococcus ruber was incubated with LDPE of average molecular weight 191,000. It reportedly resulted in 15 to 20 percent of mass reduction over a period of two weeks, which demonstrated the feasibility of laccase-degradation of polyethylene. To further enhance the efficiency of laccase, introduction of copper ions and mediators to the reaction medium were also justified to yield a higher degradation rate ([3], [5]) .
 
The target of this module was to demonstrate the ability of Laccase, expressed by E.coli, to fragment PE into simple hydrocarbons. For the purpose of utilizing laccase in the outer-membrane space, outer membrane protein A (OmpA)  is required to serve as a protein signal to the membrane so that the laccase can be dumped to the intracellular space. Meanwhile, to minimise the misfolding of laccase with OmpA, our chosen OmpA includes a linker sequence at the N-termini to separate laccase from the signalling protein OmpA. To aid in protein extraction for characterization, a 6X his-tag region is added to all of our laccase. The final effective construct for activity assay is as follows:
 
 
Apart from the construct above, another construct was also involved to characterize the effectiveness of OmpA in bringing out laccase to the intracellular space.
With these two constructs constitutively expressed in E.coli, it is expected that we can compare"

Biobrick2 : Biobricking our Biobrick-er
Urease (Image generated with Autodesk Maya)
Research and acquisition
In June, we conducted background research on Sporosarcina pasteurii and its ureolytic ability. In these preliminary searches, we learned that the urease cassette of S. pasteurii, responsible for the organism’s ureolysis and biocementation capabilities, had already been the subject of some cloning and transformations experiments involving E. coli. 1 , 2 , 3
We contacted all of these investigators to learn the status of their current research in this area and to learn more about the urease cassette; unfortunately, many of these researchers were based in South Korea, and we never received a response to our inquires. Their research papers were similarly inaccesable on the internet.  We lucked out when we contacted Dr. Sookie Bang of the South Dakota School of Mining and Technology, however; her lab had developed a number experiments studying microbially-induced calcite precipitation of both S. pasteurii and recombinant E. coli, and still kept active strains of both. She and her graduate student, Terran Bergdale, generously sent us a plate of both S. pasteurii and HB101/pBU11 E.coli, and provided us with wonderful advice and"

For this year's iGEM competition our goal is to do the first step: design and build a switch that can be toggled by a RNA molecule. To be precise, we want to apply the design rules of our switch to modify a transcription terminator in such a way that it interacts with a second RNA molecule and, as a result, is no longer capable of forming a stem loop. This objective will require intensive in silico designing and modeling of switches based on different terminators and their corresponding transmitters. In connection to this theoretical part, we also have to test and verify the switches. For this step, we establish custom-made assays, in vitro and in vivo.

Once the objective mentioned above is accomplished, these basic RNA/RNA-interactions have to be modified in such a manner that the described identity/trigger site pattern for the transmitter and the complementary recognition/target site switch composition has to be established. The most important requirement is to is to optimize these modules that the transmitter is only able to switches specifically, meaning only in the presence of both, identity AND trigger site.
Once the objective mentioned above is accomplished, the creation of an OR gate will be rather simple since it only requires two switches. However the creation of an AND or NOT gate and optimizing the logic gates to improve their responds function will remain the goal of future work. Also the creation of small networks and the correct integration of BioBricks as input and output molecules will be future challenges. Furthermore, we wanted to rather focus on the development and the testing of our structural design of the switches, rather than developing a variety of new BioBricks.
In silico design
As described above, our switches are based on certain design rules. However, there still are different structural parameters that need to be tested and optimized (length of recognition site and target site, choice of terminator, etc.). We used in silico design and modeling ) to test different parameters. Furthermore we tried to use the antitermination principle observed in nature, such as attenuation in E. coli or tiny abortive RNA´s of T7-phage.
Evaluation and Measurements
To evaluate the functionality of our molecular switches, we first had to establish several assays. Therefore, we improved an existing in vivo assay and developed an in vitro assay for this purpose. For more information please refer to the lab section.
Summarizing, the main challenges are
to find a suitable terminator construct and design a complementary trigger unit, which is only functional in combination with a specificity site - meaning an optimization of the thermodynamically parameters (see in silico design )

Science Sketch Collaboration
We have initiated a collaboration request to ALL iGEM teams. We invite them to join us in showcasing the wonderment of iGEM and synthetic biology by creating a science sketch of their team’s project or any major techniques/principles that their project is using.
Through the series of 1-3-minute sketches, we hope to promote public awareness of the iGEM competition as well as to show how synthetic biology can be utilized to solve problems facing mankind in an innovative manner!
The aim of the science sketches is to make a collaborative educational playlist with videos from teams all over the world, about their projects and/or the scientific principle behind their project. This playlist will be made public, so that any iGEM team can use it in their outreach activities, thus enabling all teams to spread the knowledge of synthetic biology to their communities.
We have also created a detailed description of how to make a science sketch to help other teams in creating their science sketches.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Purdue,2015,Team:Purdue#TheProblem_-_-_TEXT.html,"ims). Third generation production of biofuels involves using quickly growing cellulosic biomass such as algae. Fourth generation involves plants specifically engineered to have less lignin making it easier to use the cellulosic biomass (Putri). However, these technologies are still young, expensive, and largely untested compared to first and second generation biofuels (Sims).
Production of second generation biofuels would be preferable to first generation if the two were equally economically feasible as second generation biofuel production does not have as many environmental and social issues as first generation production. The goal for second generation biofuel produciton then is to lower the cost of ligno-cellulosic biofuels compared to the first generation counterparts by making it easier to bypass the lignin barrier.

Biodigestion
Biodigestion involves the decomposition of organic matter by bacteria in an anaerobic environment in order to produce a fuel source (biogas, bioethanol, biodiesel, etc.). Biodigestion can be divided into four main stages: Pre-treatment, Digestion, Processing/Filtration, and Reuse/Disposal of Waste (Putri).
Pretreatment for biodigestion in bioreactors or biodigestors for lignocellulosic biomass can take many forms, but is always energy and/or chemically intensive. Pretreatment can be done using uncatalyzed steam explosion, liquid hot water pretreatments, acid catalyzatation, flow through acid pretreatment, lime and other alkali pretreatment processes, and AFEX (Ammonia Fiber/Freeze Explosion) pretreatment.

Figure 32 shows the illustration of ABTS oxidation by BPUL with time compared to the negative control. The increase in ABTS oxidized proves laccase activity even if a direct comparison with the original and not immobilized laccase solution was not possible due to the very high activity of BPUL, which could not be measured properly.

We will subclone the TPH1 into the PSB1A3 backbone today and attempt transformation again. If we succeed with that, we will subclone it into the expression cassette on CAM-resistant backbone in the beginning of next week.
Improvement of Biobrick
After the RFP cultures did not grow on the Ampicilin medium we made made a new culture on chloramphenicol because we thought it might be a mistake in the registry. However, they did not grow on that plate either. A liquid control without antibiotics worked well, so at least we know that the cells (initially) are alive. We think that the the transformation did not work. Maybe there is a problem with the DNA too. We used the liquid cultures of the GFP we made on Tuesday to make minipreps and to use them with the promoters from the interlab-study.

After a bacterium has been infected by a lytic bacteriophage, the viral genome material is transcribed, translated and replicated using the bacterial cellular machinery to produce viral proteins. The proteins are assembled to make viral particles and the genomic material is packaged into the virions. Once the bacterial cell reaches capacity, the host cell lyse, resulting in the release of the viral particles. These viruses can go off to infect other uninfected bacterial cells. Bacteria can also be infected by lysogenic bacteria. However, transcription and translation of the viral genetic material is repressed. It is instead integrated into the host genome where it remains and is replicated with the host genome. Upon induction, however, the lysogenic life cycle is switched to the lytic life cycle.
The diagram above shows the two possible life cycles of phages. Following infection, phages following the lytic life cycle will hijack the host cell machinery to produce                   multiple copies of the phage proteins. These proteins are then assembled into multiple phage progeny which burst out of the host cell and go on to infect other bacterial                   cells. In the lysogenic life cycle, phages can integrate their genome into the host cell chromosome upon infection, where they can remain dormant for long periods of time                   as prophages. When conditions are favourable, usually due to host cell stress, prophage induction can occur. This is where prophages can excise from the host cell                   chromosome and enter the lytic life cycle"

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," promoter systems (e.g. ""TetR repressed GFP""; BBa_K577893 ) that are available in the parts registry, but when we saw that two of the available systems did not work in our own hands, we decided to built the system on our own. We used the Tet-Repressor generator that was available on the distribution plates ( BBa_I739001 ) as we believe that it is very important for the standardization in SynBio to use available parts. Downstream of this repressor generator we designed and fused a BioBrick ( BBa_K2170141 ) that encodes a double Tet-Operator (Tet-Repressor binding site together with a bacterial promoter and an signal peptide of the outer membrane protein A (OmpA [11] ) from E. coli that has a 3' RFC[25] restriction site, allowing the protein fusion of proteins that are secreted into the bacterial periplasm when expressed with this BioBrick. As a protein fusion, we then assembled a protein cargo domain that is generally exchangeable for any protein that is so small in size that it can be transported through the outer membrane by the EspP autotransporter. In our project we used the same extracellular domains as for the eukaryotic receptors: enhanced monomeric Avidin (eMA; BBa_K2170204 ), single-chain Avidin (scAvidin; BBa_K2170205 ) and a composite part composed of a N-terminal Biotinylation acceptor peptide (BAP) and a C-terminal NanoLuciferase (together shown as BAP; ; BBa_K2170118 , see Fig. B). Our design features an A3C5-epitope tag further downstream that can be recognized by a high-affinity Fab-fragment and is generally used to detect and quantify the surface display of the cargo domain [12] . Further downstream of this affinity tag we fused the BioBrick for the EspP autotransporter from E. coli [13] [14] which is then followed by a bacterial terminator. For the termination we chose again  a well-working terminator from the distribution plate (""double terminator""; BBa_B0010 - BBa_B0012 ).
But this was just the DNA-part. What is expected to happen on a protein level? The construct constantly produces Tet-repressor that binds to the Tet-Operator and repressed the promoter activity of the autotransporter gene. As soon as the inducer anhydrotetracycline (aTc) is added"

Conclusion
It was an event that few people could attend, due to the conditions explained above, but from which the attendees took much advantage. Holding such an event in September could be much more crowded if it was announced from the beginning of the summer and allowed the rest of the teams to organize around it. As it provides a series of very useful tools for the presentation of Boston."
Evry,2012,Team:Evry#GB_-_-_TEXT.html," to make the repetition of several {RBS-Protein} units in a single cassette (OH2=OH4) possible. We will see later how we can achieve control of this repetition.
To conclude, we have five different kinds of parts, which implies to create five different prefixes and five different suffixes with four different overhangs, which will help to assemble the five different DNA parts in the correct order.
In addition, we would like to generate a scar that can be digested by another enzyme, in order to control whether all the elements we intended to insert are present in the cassette or not, before sequencing it. As we will see later this element is critical for the selection of the clone that have inserted all the genes we want and avoid sequencing  incorrect constructions. In order to generate such a scar, the overhangs 1, 2, 4 and 5 has been engineered in the middle of a BbsI site. When two pieces ligates, they recreate a BbsI restriction site, and the construct can be checked with a simple BbsI  digestion.
One last condition to fulfill to get a RFC 10 compatible brick after GoldenBrick cloning is to leave no illegal restriction site inside the brick after the assembly of the cassette. However, we should keep the as similar as possible the BioBrick extensions around each elements leaving the four usual enzyme restriction sites, so that the brick can be still assembled using RFC 10 BioBrick method. The only drawback is that if several GoldenBrick parts are assembled with RFC 10 standard, they cannot be assembled with other GoldenBrick parts afterwards, because the BioBrick assembly will leave illegal BsaI site inside the casette.
The proposed new set of Golden Bricks extension
Having all these design principles in mind and meeting the requirements we have proposed, we designed the new GoldenBrick prefix and suffix with the following sequences:
Figure 6: Sequence and design of the different prefixes and suffixes used in the GoldenGate cloning method. The presence of the EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI and PstI keep the compatibility with Biobrick cloning while the BsaI site enable single shot GoldenGate assembly. The BbsI sites serve as a single digestion control.
This design fulfills all the requirements enumerated before and ensure that the different elements will be assembled in the correct order. We also generated a scar that can be digested afterwards with the BbsI enzyme, so that the correct insertion of the different elements can be checked afterwards by doing a single digestion. This also enable the polymerization of the"

Motivation
For the reasons above, biofilms become our best candidate to engineer and would be equipped with some additional functions we want. Here, we conceive the semiconductor-enzyme system linked to the E.coli’s biofilm, whose subunits are engineered respectively with PolyHistidine tags and SpyTag and SpyCatcher system from FbaB protein to provide binding sites for inorganic nanomaterials and enzymes.
Based on these ideas, we constructed several E.coli strains which secreted:
CsgA-Histag
His-CsgA-SpyCatcher-Histag
His-CsgA-SpyCatcher
We envision two application system to utilize the biofilm display to establish the whole biohydrogen platform:
Plan 1. Strains secrected CsgA-his or His-CsgA-SpyCatcher-(Histag) biofilms for binding nanorods + Strain producing hydrogenase HydA
Device: CsgA-Histag/His-CsgA-SpyCatcher-(Histag)
We learned that inorganic nanomaterials can template on biofilm by utilizing Co/Ni-NTA- -Histag coordination bond. Therefore, we want leverage synthetic biological engineering to program CsgA biofilm from E.coli with Histag to endow its capability to bind with nanomaterials (i.e. quantum dots, nanorods), form a bio-abiotic interface platform and produce electrons. Through this approach, we want to realize producing hydrogen by attach nanorods onto biofilms. The electrons from nanorods excited by sunlight can transfer into engineered hydrogenase-producing strain through mediator solution and accepted by hydrogenases which are not secreted. Since anaerobic hydrogenase will not be exposed to oxygen directly in this way, we view it as a practical and promising way to conduct in lab and consequently realize biohydrogen.
Plan 2. Strain secreted His-CsgA-Spycatcher-(Histag) biofilms for binding nanorods + purified  hydrogenase HydA-SpyTag
Device: His-CsgA-SpyCatcher-(Histag)
Based on this concept, we want to construct a catalytic system outside cells. After extracted and purified from strain which produce hydrogenase, the HydA-Spytag engineered enzyme could covalently bind with SpyCatcher protein on the Strain secrected His-CsgA-Spycatcher-(Histag) biofilms. At the meanwhile, nanorods are firmly attach to biofilm as well for there are histags on biofilm"

On August 5th, teams from 7 top universities in China, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai , ECUST-Shanghai , Peking , Tsinghua , USTC & USTC_Software , ZJU-China , and Sun Yat-sen University all gathered in Shanghai and had a nice day at the iGEM 2010 China Meetup.
The meetup started around 9 with a short speech by Professor Lin He, head of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Bio-X Institute, which hosted the event. Then each team made a presentation displaying their projects and progresses since the summer began, followed by free questioning and discussion time. And when it was near the end of the day, student members had a hour or two to talk and play freely with each other, with a big meal waiting ahead for them.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," adaptation due to changes in pH affects cellular functions which could have an influence ageing at the cellular level. Our modification of the Spy-GFP to a pH sensitive promoter was done to measure pH changes within the cell due to a change in the pH of the extracellular environment. See discussion of how the pH links with our dental devices here
A characteristic feature of cellular aging are the damages caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to low intracellular concentration of antioxidants. Our response to this problem was to characterize our lycopene-mNARK promoter . We assayed how different stimulated stress conditions induced the mNARK promoter to produce lycopene and how the expression of this protein enabled cell survival in different stress conditions.
For our experiment with lubrication gel and IrrE, we wanted to show that bacteria transformed with IrrE was better adapted to live in Lubrication gel compared to wild type E.coli cells. This concept is based on the possibility of employing IrrE transformed cells to detect different pathogens (that is in personal lubricant for STIs or catheter lubricant for UTI-causing bacteria) and produce a simple visible colour change.
Furthermore, we tested the feasibility of employing SOD3 for gene therapy using lentil virus vector. Mammalian cells, HeLa, were transfected with lentil virus consisting of SOD 3 gene and the reported protein, GFP. GFP titration, where we changed the volume of lentil virus and measured the amount of positive cells transfected with the virus were carried out to test our system.
In summary, we have characterized:
The Spy-GFP, showing that SPY GFP could be used as a pH sensitive promoter due to its ability to measuere pH changes in experimental conditions.
Our lssycopene-mNARK, showing that cells which expressed lycopene could still survive and grow within certain stimulated stressed environments.
The IrrE, showing that IrrE protein enabled E.Coli to grow better in lubrication gel.

Overview
At the Wellesley HCI Lab, we are committed to fostering STEM education, passionate about empowering women in the sciences, and strongly believe in the power of mentorship.  The 2013 Wellesley iGEM team worked toward achieving these goals by promoting Synthetic Biology public education and awareness with our outreach project Bac to the Future. By demonstrating this project in various public settings, including with groups of middle school and high school students, we focused on making Synthetic Biology concepts fun and accessible to students and non-scientists. Additionally, we participated in the Wellesley College Science Outreach program and mentored high school interns in the human-computer interaction lab throughout the summer.
Upward Bound students

MIT-Wellesley Upward Bound
We performed three user studies for Bac to the Future with the MIT-Wellesley Upward Bound program , student ages ranging from 12-17. To prepare for these studies and explore the potential use of our application in an educational setting, we prepared a brief preliminary presentation to introduce Synthetic Biology concepts and terminology, and also performed a project demonstration.  The students then worked through the application in groups of 2 or more.

Our goal was to create a microfluidic device. We used negative lithography to create a patterned wafer and the pattern in the wafer will be used as a negative master mold to create a PDMS microfluidic structure. The PDMS microfluidic structure will use the application of hydrostatic transport of a liquid media.  The PDMS microfluidic structure is being adhered to a glass slide to create a sealed chamber and that will be used to transport liquids through microfluidic channels. A microfluidic channel is commonly defined as having one or more dimension less than 100 microns in size.  Transport mechanisms used by microfluidics to transfer liquids include capillary forces, hydrostatic pressure gradients, electrokinetics, pumps, magnetism and digital arrays.  Microfluidic channel material is important to consider when choosing the transport mechanism.
The goal of the experiment is to create a master mold with a patterned wafer, to use that master mold to create a PDMS microfluidic device and to transport liquids through the PDMS microfluidic device.
The wafers are now primed for photoresist application.  The photoresist being used is SU8-25 which should give a thickness of approximately 25 microns.  We decided to try to increase the thickness of the resist to 75-80 microns by slowing the spin rate to 1000 rpm and applying the resist extra thick. Room lights are turned off and special orange lights that filter out light below 530 nanometers are used because SU8-25 photoresist is sensitive to ultraviolet light. The SU8-25 photoresist is applied using a static spin.  One at a time each wafer is placed on a two inch chuck and a centering spin is done to ensure the wafer is centered.  An eight milliliter pipette is used to apply the SU8-25 photoresist to the wafer.  The pipette is used to cover the entire wafer with SU8-25 photoresist and to remove any air bubbles.  The first step of the recipe is a 5 second dwell at 500 RPM with a ramp rate of 100 RPM per second.  The second step of the recipe is a 40 second dwell at 1000 RPM, we changed the exposure time from 45 to 60 seconds. A soft bake on a hot plate is performed on the wafer (after the photoresist was spun on) to remove any solvents and harden the"

Figure 5. Safety Control Diagram.
Dispersing and killing system
Although we have assessed that all of our organisms are included in BSL 1, there are still some possible risks that our modified parts or system may damage the natural integrity and balance.
To fulfill our obligation, we designed a genetic circuit as our safety guard to dispose the escaped cells, which means to disperse biofilm, kill bacteria and further, to degrade DNA under the control of oxygen concentration.
As the colony fermented anaerobically in MFC, nirB promoter is constructed to respond according to dissolved oxygen around in the atmosphere. Anaerobic condition activates nirB promoter so that the following genes can expressed and inversely, nirB promoter will inactivate in the presence of O2.[1] Inspired by this phenomenon, we further take in lac promoter and lacI geneintended to activate the dispersing and killing system after provided with O2, which accords with our actual need. Lacl works as repressor when nirB promoter is activated without oxygen and suppresses the expression of DspB, DNasel and MccS.
Figure 6. The biosafety system with/without oxygen. The figures show that dispersing and killing mechanism can activated only in the absence of O2.
Our safety system designed to reduce the possibility that modified bacteria may affect the equilibrium of the environment when our MFC is applied outside of laboratory one day. We found that biofilms are related to most bacterial chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases as well as involved in biocorrosion and biofouling in diverse areas.[2] Additionally, Dispersing B (DspB) exhibits bioﬁlm-detachment activity.[3] Hence, we introduce it in our system as a hard core to prevent biofilm formation through matrix polysaccharides degration. Further, the reprogrammed bacteria kill the latent cells and itself by expressing and secreting the antimicrobial peptide microcin S (MccS).[4] After dispersing and killing, nuclease DNaseI has been used to deal with the gene leakage which may hybridize with native species and causing genetic pollution.[4] Besides, several studies has indicated that exogenously added DNases could inhibit bioﬁlm formation, disperse preformed bioﬁlms, and sensitize dormant bioﬁlm bacteria to biocide killing.[4] So we introduce DNaseI as supplementary power to disperse and to kill.

CF is a pleiotropic disease affecting all exocrine epithelia, not just that of the lungs, therefore CF is a complex and demanding disease1. Most people with CF will suffer from chronic lung infections, gradually declining respiratory function and eventual respiratory failure which is the most common cause of mortality in CF patients.
Early symptoms of CF are: increased susceptibility to lung infections, persistent coughing and increased sputum production. As infecting microbes fail to be cleared, excessive inflammation begins to cause permanent damage to the lung architecture, resulting in bronchiectasis and pulmonary hypertension and hypoxia4. Late stages of CF require the use of air masks or ventilators to mechanically assist breathing. CF can also lead to nutrient loss by the progressive scarring of the pancreas, which becomes dehydrated in a fashion similar to that of the lungs4.
Physiological aspects
Chloride ion flow through CFTR is required for normal function of epithelia that line airways, the intestinal tract and ducts in the pancreas, testes and sweat glands3. Without anion flow, water movement slows and dehydrated mucus clogs ducts, collecting in the lung where it ultimately leads to propagation of lethal bacterial infections3.  In the healthy lung, foreign particles are removed from the airways in the surface liquid layer over the beating cilia5. The depth of the liquid layer is regulated by a balance between the opposing processes of sodium absorption and chloride secretion5.
This mechanical clearance of mucus, known as the mucociliary escalator, is considered the primary innate airway defines mechanism4. Additionally normal functioning epithelia have a “chemical shield” with the production of salt-sensitive defensins that are secreted into the airway lumen, and the production of a low-salt (<50 mM NaCl) liquid on airway surfaces that activates the defensins, together protecting the lung against inhaled bacteria5,6. In CF patients, chloride secretion in epithelia is impaired while sodium absorption is increased which causes mucus to accumulate (as shown"

DH5a pBAD_xylE transformants grown in Glucose do not show any protein bands at this size and hence can be verified as negative control. While DH5a pBAD_xylE transformants grown in Arabinose show the bands at the expected size.
In presence of Glucose in the substrate, the enzyme is not synthesised, while in presence of Arabinose, the enzyme is synthesised, which is true to the fact that the construct having promoter pBAD is being induced only in presence of arabinose to synthesise the enzyme catechol-2,3-dioxygenase.
The above gel confirms that the constructs are well assembled and successfully synthesize the desired enzyme catechol-2,3-dioxygenase which is used for catechu degradation and further tested for its ability to degrade various dye substrates.

Experiment 8:
Assay for detection of catechol-2,3-dioxygenase
An assay which will detect the presence of the enzyme catechol-2,3-dioxygenase which is a translational product of our cloned gene-XylE.
Learn More
This assay gives a direct readout of the presence of the enzyme catechol-2,3-dioxygenase. The colourless substrate catechol is broken down to a yellow coloured product 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (2-HMS) and this reaction is catalysed by the enzyme catechol-2,3-dioxygenase.
Intensity of the generated yellow colour was detected in the form of absorbance values.The absorbance readouts were taken at 415 nm at an interval of 5 minutes and graphs were prepared to interpret the generated data.
The XylE gene in our construct is under the regulation of the pBAD promoter which is arabinose responsive. From the generated data we could conclude that with advancement in time, the absorbance of the system increases when the cells are grown in the presence of arabinose but remains fairly constant when grown in glucose.

PCB Concentrations  2 plates. 2 rows equivalent, two different tubes, were 0 PCB, 0 DMSO. Cells grown overnight. 1 ML cells from culture, spun down at 8,000 rpm, pelleted and took out medium, washed, re-suspended in synthetic Trp-Leu-medium, and resuspended in 1ml. So 1 mL of culture from 2mL of culture originally incolutated at 10 pm last night. Took OD600 reading diluted at 1:10. DMSO makes the cells clump so you really have to vortex and shake them. Too much DMSO inhibits their growth, and PCB up to high concentrations does not seem to inhibit it. Need to multiply all number by 10. Not in triplicate, probably +- 0.05. Need to be consistant about shaking up REALLY well. You will be significantly off otherwise.        PCB DMSO Equivalents  0 uMol  .607 .586   5 .583 .518  10 .599 .533  25  .552 .452  50  .592 .432  100  .373 .316  125  .260 .175  The decrease in growth is apparently a function of DMSO concentration, not PCB, since it is seen with both.  Did a 1:10 dilution of everything. when you zapped with laser, each had 100 uL aliquots of cells. All numbers below .607, everything was brought up to .6 OD worth of cells, should be 1x10^7 cells per mL, and 100 uL of cells. Then the plates were staggered—on one plate you have 2 rows of cells with no PCB no DMSO. In second plate they were staggered. First had 5 uMol DMSO, 5 mMol PCB, etc. Each got 10 seconds. Now sitting in incubator, finished at 8pm, going to go till 11, then transfer onto filters.    Cells were loaded into the biodot as follows, and two replicates of this were made (for a total of 8 samples per condition between the two films). Cells were loaded onto the nitrocellulose three hours after exposure. Labelled photographs PCB Concentrations I, II, and III. 5 uM PCB  10 uM PCB  25 uM PCB "

Berke Gürkan
 
Boss (Demi-God)
Hi, this is Berke Gürkan from METU iGEM team 2012. I am a '12 graduate from Middle East Technical University department of Molecular Biology and Genetics. It is my second year in iGEM. I met synthetic biology and iGEM during my Erasmus year in The Netherlands, Groningen; where I immediately fell in love with the whole idea of creating genetically engineered machines that are able to do the tasks which I program them to. Believeing synthetic biology is one of the key subjects for taking biological sciences one step further and creating the lifestyle of tomorrow I started the iGEM 2012 team in METU. Through the process I learned even further and had a greater vision of synthetic biology which keeps fascinating me every single day. It is just incredible to design a biological system which can help the world get rid of the problems they normally cannot by physical means. This year I had quite a lot of fun working on the project with the most awesome team members. All together we hope to add a notch to synthetic biology in the upcoming years.

Wet Lab (Team's Cat)
I am Özge Özgüç, a second year student at Molecular Biology and Genetics department in METU. I am at wet lab part and human practice part of our team. My reason for being a member of an iGEM team was that it has been my dream since my high school days. Although I haven’t decided what I will study yet, studying synthetic biology is one of my thought about future and iGEM has an important role on this. I am happy with being a member of this team because my team friends are really enjoyable people and I am also happy with working on this project because WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE WORLD BETTER TO LIVE.
