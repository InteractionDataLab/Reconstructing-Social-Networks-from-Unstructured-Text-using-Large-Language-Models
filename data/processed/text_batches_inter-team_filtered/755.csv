The ATOMS-Turkiye iGEM team believe that communication about safety issues can improve overall safety levels in synthetic biology. Their outreach consisted in accumulating information on other teams' safety issues with their projects. We contributed our data on KillerRed, applied to analyse its potential risks and the consequent measures taken to ensure the safety of the researchers and the general public, as well as preservation of the external environment (see below). We hope the collaboration with the ATOMS-Turkiye team will help encourage other teams to communicate about Safety; as it is as essential as the synthetic biology we work on, communication and collaboration should be on the same level for both. Thus we put this collaboration on he same level as synthetic biology for our team's outreach effort.
To analyse the risks present in our project and their possible consequences, we need to take into account all the parts that we bring together inside a single bacteria. This is done with the safety sheet. Here is a final version of our safety sheet as of 08/30/2013. The document is completed and signed.
In our project, KillerRed is the new part that we have to study in order to determine its potential effects. Before working with the actual DNA, documenting ourselves on the protein was necessary.
For safety considerations, several aspects of the protein have to be taken into account:
The protein function
The protein structure
In the case of KillerRed, the function is that of a fluorescent protein similar to EGFP or dsRed, but with photosensitizing properties increased 1000-fold. EGFP is used in many research applications as a reporter protein but is actually slightly toxic.[1,2]
This phototoxicity is due to ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) generation. This ROS generation is only possible with the presence of molecular oxygen as an electron donor [3,5]. with superoxide being the main ROS generated, and the main source of KillerRed's phototoxicity [3]. ROS are extremely unstable compounds that readily react with many substrates including lipids, proteins and DNA [4]. There are many possible reactions and most if not all damage the substrate, leading to cell death. Reactions with DNA can also lead to mutagenesis and it was necessary to take this risk into account when working with the protein.
Since the protein generates ROS, the risk of researcher exposition to ROS is also present, for example if part of a KillerRed-expressing culture was spilled on an exposed body part.
Once the risks have been identified, scenarios can then be imagined in which one or more parts of our system are"

The injection volume was 1 μL. MS detection was measured on an Agilent 6545 QTOF MS with an electrospray ion source. Capillary voltage was set to 4000 V with a nozzle voltage of 500 V. Mass spectra were recorded for m/z 85–1700 in MS mode and m/z 30–1700 in MS/MS mode, with an acquisition rate of 10 spectra/s. Analysis of the spectra was done using Agilent MassHunter version B.07.00 to determine the presecnce of tyrocidine, surfactin, and modified surfactin using the “find by formula” function, with the formulas found in the table above. Manual inspection of the extracted ion chromatogram traces for [surfactin+H]+ at m/z of 1035.706 and [surfactin + Na]+ at m/z of was also performed.
MALDI-TOF-MS Equipment and Method
Mass spectra were determined using a Bruker Autoflex II MALDI-TOF instrument. Extracted samples were spotted on an AnchorChip MALDI target plate (1 uL) and allowed to dry before being covered (1 uL) with Universal Matrix from Sigma-Aldrich (1:1 ratio of 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic Acid to alpha-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid). The machine was operated in both linear and reflectron mode with a mass range of 500-3000. Positive and negative ion detection and reflector mode were used. Analysis of extracted samples in methanol (previously verified by HPLC-MS) by FlexAnalysis Version 3.4 indicate that tyrocidine and surfactin was clearly detectable. Surfactin was detectable in negative mode with reduced background noise compared to the positive mode, making verification a simple task.
Results
Tyrocidine HPLC-MS:
Looking at the extrapolated ion chromatogram for a mass range between 950 - 1300 Tyrocidine is clearly visible in the UHPLC-DAD-QTOFMS running under the described parameters.

Background
The Fifth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study is one of the largest collaborative studies ever performed in synthetic biology, featuring the work of iGEM teams across the world. Each annual iteration of the study is dedicated to identifying and rectifying sources of variability in measurements and protocols across lab settings. This year’s edition primarily focused on standardizing absorbance and fluorescence measurements of GFP-expressing bacteria, correcting for human and machine variability across labs.
Per the iGEM protocol, we transformed New England Biosciences 5-alpha E. coli with the eight following plasmids from the iGEM Distribution Kit 7:
Positive Control: BBa_I20270
Negative Control: BBa_R0040
Test Device 1: BBa_J364000
Test Device 2: BBa_J364001
Test Device 3: BBa_J364002
Test Device 4: BBa_J364007
Test Device 5: BBa_J364008
Test Device 6: BBa_J364009
Bacterial colonies were grown either in liquid cultures or plated with Luria Bertani (LB) broth and chloramphenicol; Each plasmid backbone confers bacterial resistance to chloramphenicol (pSB1C3 backbone).
Calibration: 3 Experiments
1. OD600 reference point
The purpose of the first calibration is to establish a conversion from “absorbance at 600nm” (Abs600) data in our 96 well plates into an “optical density at 600nm” (OD600) measurement, as would be obtained in a standard spectrophotometer. “Such conversion is necessary because plate reader measurements of absorbance are volume dependent; the depth of the fluid in the well defines the path length of the light passing through the sample, which can vary slightly from well to well.”   To do so, we first measured the absorbance values of LUDOX-S30 versus deionized H2O. Reading the LUDOX-S30 absorbance value from our spectrophotometer, we subtract"

This returns cells to normal metabolism after being in late log phase overnight.
Meanwhile, set up a 96 well assay plate with serial-diluted aTc stocks prepared the night before. Stock concentrations should be (in μM): 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025, 0.0125, 0.00625, 0.003125, and 0 (control is water). Add 10μl of each dilution to the plate as depicted below. Wrap plate in tin foil once complete.
At a corrected OD~0.5, dilute back to a corrected OD~0.1 in a 24 well block of M9-Cm-Kan.
Dilute back in 3mL of media.
Mix the plate at 300 rpm for ~1 minute to ensure the cultures are well-mixed.
Using the first two tips of a multichannel pipettor, fill the columns of the aTc plate with 190μl of diluted culture. Try to work as quickly as possible to reduce variation within and between columns.
Measure OD at 595nm for timepoint 0. Cover the plate with a breathable seal and incubate at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm. Measure OD every hour for 7-8 hours.
Analysis: plot OD vs. time for each aTc concentration in R or Excel. Compare growth curves between the control and test sgRNA to approximate the effectivity of your CRISPR system.
Leaving the lab
Prior to leaving the lab, you should:
Clean dirty glassware, or at least set aside the glassware to be cleaned by a designated individual.
Wipe down your workspace.
Ensure that all materials have been returned to their places, and that the plates have been properly stored in the fridge.

IISER-Pune-India,2017,Team:IISER-Pune-India#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," whereas the promoter in Ara-Lac oscillator has one binding site for AraC protein and two sites for LacI binding. We then modified the model to fit the ara-lac system and incorporated IPTG, arabinose inducibility into the model. This model did not include the intermediate reactions of transcription and translation and also assumed that the reactions are dimerisation and tetramerisation are fast, and equilibrium is attained instantaneously. These assumptions were relaxed by adding four more differential equations, that of mRNA production and protein unfolding for both AraC and LacI; and also by adding a delay in the differential equation of mRNA.
The production of mRNA is governed by the differential equation-         \begin{align}        \frac{dm_a}{dt} = b_a(P^{a}_{0,0} + \alpha P^{a}_{1,0}) -  \gamma_{ma} m_a \\        \frac{dm_r}{dt} = b_r(P^{r}_{0,0} + \alpha P^{r}_{1,0}) -  \gamma_{mr} m_r        \end{align}
Here, $P^{a/r}_{0,0}, P^{a/r}_{1,0}$ are also variables, and the differential equation above is coupled to the rate equation governing promoter binding reactions for LacI and AraC.       We assume that these reactions are fast reactions and attain equilibrium very quickly. Thus, we can write-        \begin{align}       P^{a/r}_{1,0} = k_1 a_2 P^{a/r}_{0,0} \\       P^{a/r}_{i,1} = 2k_2 r_4 P^{a/r}_{i,0} \\       P^{a/r}_{i,2} = k_2 r_4 P^{a/r}_{i,1} \\       \end{align}       The dimerisation and tetramerisation reactions give us-        \begin{align}       \begin{split}       a_2 & = k_{da} a^2 \\        r_2 & = k_{dr1} r^2 \\        r_4 & = k_{dr2} r^2_2 \\ & = k_{dr2} k^2_{dr1} r^4\\       \end{split}       \end{align}       We define $c_a := k_1 k_{da}$ and $c_R := k_2 k_{dr2} k^2_{dr1}$."

Integrated: Equality and Diversity
We also wanted to find a novel way of integrating our Human Practice work into itself, as we believe that this allows us to form well grounded research into areas such as equality and diversity. We initially spoke to students to understand their perspectives on the issue of gender inequality in science, highlighted in a video. At the end of the video, we spoke to our supervisor, Dr Chloe Milner, who said that whilst she had never experienced sexism directly, all of her bosses were men and only one of her lecturers had been a woman, and she didn’t know if this was a sign of times past or present but it would be interesting to see why. Because of this, we decided to find out why this was the state of affairs at the university.
This led us to a meeting with Dr Andrew Griffiths, chair of Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity group for Biosciences at the university. He talked about issues such as a lack of confidence in women, ways of making the workplace more flexible and inclusive for all and the issue with maternity and paternity support and the potential for a parental leave to be introduced.
We took these concepts to Dr Eduarda Santos, the former chair of the Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity committee for Bioscience, for a different perspective. We followed this pattern throughout the series of six interviews, adapting and evolving the argument as we went, commenting on previous interviews and the thoughts and experiences shared with us.
This series of interviews concluded with a panel discussion on equality and diversity which integrated our public engagement and education work into the integrated equality and diversity work, for we opened up a two-way discussion with students and the public via a live discussion in front of a crowd that was also live streamed on Youtube, via XTV Online, and live broadcasted on campus radio, Xpression FM. We succeeded in highlighting the issues of equality and diversity in science, using the university as a case study, but we also succeeded in educating the public and providing a platform for further debate and discussion to be held. More information of this integrated work can be found in our 'Integrated: Equality and Diversity' page here."

Kent,2015,Team:Kent#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," are definitely safety and the public’s approval. In a Country such as Italy it will be remarkably hard to help the idea come across, mostly because of the lack of faith towards the government and public institutions in general. For example, consider for a moment the current debate on the return of nuclear power in  Italy, or even the controversy surrounding the high-speed train in Piedmont. Any kind of complex public work will generate a great sense of fear. The population in Italy doesn’t trust in the ability of the government to manage these works, and at the same time there is also a lack of faith towards regulating the private sector.
Anneliese: I think it’s a good idea to try and save money, time and energy by not building a new infrastructure from scratch. However, I would have concerns about this technology essentially taking away the potential to develop a different form of power on that site, and I think there would have to be strong guarantees that the pilot project could generate a significant amount of energy.
7) In the upcoming Climate Change conference happening in Paris this December, what are the possible agendas that your political party will advocate for?
Franco: My party will advocate for anything that will promote sustainable developement. It appears that there is a growing awareness on this topics. For example, in July I lead a diplomatic mission in China and the authorities in Beijing reiterated their engagement. If this could head somewhere, it would definitely result in a historial change.
Anneliese: I am a member of the Labour Party, which is not currently in government in the UK. However, this does not stop us from calling on the Conservative government to push for tougher climate change targets in the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris. We are concerned that the current plans will not be able to stop a 2 degrees Celsius rise in global temperatures, and if we cannot stop the impact could be devastating. We will push for a net goal of zero net global emissions in the second half of this century, and for more ambitious European targets on reducing climate change.
8) Since funding for solar and wind energy is being reduced, is there a chance that funding could be allocated to the development of our technology given its potentials?
Franco: By always keeping track of any ethical implications, your technology could become a great opportunity for developement. However, to succeed, it will certainly need the cooperation from the public.
Anneliese: Decisions about this type of funding are made by the UK government, not MEPs, so I’m afraid I couldn’t tell you.

Consideration of Animal Ethics and Welfare
1 & 2   Search information and interview
At the very beginning, we searched information of animal welfare and learnt how to construct animal models.
• Rationale and purpose of the proposed use of animals
• A clear and concise sequential description of the procedures involving the use of animals and timely intervention, removal of animals from a study, or euthanasia if painful or stressful outcomes are anticipated
• Availability or appropriateness of the use of less invasive procedures, other species, isolated organ preparation, cell or tissue culture, or computer simulation
• Justification of the species and number of animals proposed; whenever possible, the number of animals and experimental group sizes should be statistically justified (e.g., provision of a power analysis; see Appendix A, Experimental Design and Statistics)
• Duplication of experiments
• Housing and husbandry requirements
• Impact of the proposed procedures on the animals’ well-being
• Description and rationale for anticipated or selected endpoints
• Method of euthanasia or disposition of animals, including planning for care of long-lived species after study completion
• Adequacy of training and experience of personnel in the procedures used, and roles and responsibilities of the personnel involved
• Use of hazardous materials and provision of a safe working environment.

According to principles of AAALAC International (Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care), we standardized experimental conditions and designed our animal experiments.
• Firstly, we would strictly follow the protocols of animal model construction and scientifically group for them according to statistical analysis.
• Secondly, all experimental conditions would be supervised in order to ensure welfare and ethics of experimental animals. For example, all the mice in our experiments would be housed in laboratory animal house where temperature is set at around 24"

Another set of plates with 10-5 and 10-4 dilutions of Chloramphenicol were prepared.
The plates were divided into quadrants with CHOP on the top left and bottom left quadrants and crcB on the top right and bottom right.
CHOP had the most growth at 100μM F at 10-4 dilution.
Future Directions
The CHOP System can be used to improve the affinity and characterization of the fluoride riboswitch.
Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) system may be used for detecting presence of fluoride; at a certain level of fluoride, it can trigger gene expression of the GFP as the fluoride riboswitch releases terminator. This may provide a better visual mechanism for people to determine if their water can be safe to drink or not.
A fluorinase gene can be utilized to bio-remediate the excess fluoride in water."
Genspace,2015,Team:Genspace#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," Canal. Just as Craig Venter sailed the seven seas to discover new and useful life forms, the citizen scientists of Genspace ventured into the wilds of the Canal to catalog and study the microrganisms hardy enough to survive in a Superfund site.We partnered with the Gowanus Canal Conservancy, the landscape architecture firm Nelson-Byrd-Wolz, and Dr. Chris Mason’s lab at Weill-Cornell Medical College. To date, four separate collections (summer 2014, winter 2014, spring 2015 and summer 2015) of bottom sludge from 14 different sites along the canal have been made. DNA was extracted from the samples by Genspace members and the microbiome explored through whole shotgun sequencing at Weill-Cornell Medical College. The samples were included in the PathoMap project, an ambitious effort by Dr. Mason's lab to map the microbiome of New York City. The data from the first sampling expedition (summer 2014) was published in the journal Cell Systems  and can be explored in an interactive map .
Our iGEM team decided to build upon this work by making a cosmid library of DNA from the Gowanus Canal. Cosmids are extrachromosomal elements similar to plasmids except much larger. They are able to contain inserts of up to 40 or more kb, large enough to contain whole metabolic pathways, Making a cosmid library from high molecular weight DNA fragments from the Gowanus Canal would be useful for several reasons. It would preserve the DNA in a form that could be replicated, it would allow for functional screening of the E. coli containing the cosmids for interesting new properties such as toxic compound degradation or antibiotic synthesis, and it would allow screening of the library for specific types of enzymes via degenerate  PCR primers to conserved sequences.
Our goal was to identify and archive useful DNA sequences from the Gowanus Canal extremophiles by adding them to the registry.
Sampling Methodology
Our iGEM team used the long tube sampling procedure to collect samples of bottom sludge in gallon glass jars. We felt that there was less opportunity for splashing than with the trap-jaws method.  The large amount of sample was necessary since we wanted to not only extract DNA for eventual sequence analysis, but also to use extracted DNA to create a cosmid library. Since the Canal contains some chemical waste and sewage runoff that could potentially contain human pathogens, the collection team wore disposable Tyvek suits, eye protection, and heavy rubber gloves. We were careful to avoid splashing the water unnecessarily,"

Results of Experiments and Analysis
1.3 Results of Experiments and Analysis
     1.3.1 Digestion check
        (1) Use NcoI and XhoI to digest plasmid on lipase after PCR. We know our result is correct because two bright parts of plasmid is in the same position and of the same size.
        (2) Use NdeI and NotI to digest plasmid on OAH after PCR. We know our result is correct because two bright parts of plasmid is in the same position and of the same size. (Figure 10)
    1.3.2 Sequencing
        The results of t sequencing of Lipase and OAH are both correct, for more detail, check appendix 1.
    1.3.3 Functional Test of Lipase

Cardiff_Wales,2017,Team:Cardiff Wales#Public outreach_-_-_TEXT.html,"iff iGEM helped out at the School of Biosciences at Cardiff University open day. We showed prospective students around the lab we were using, demonstrated how we infiltrated plants to genetically modify them, and talked to them about the applications of GM and synthetic biology. Synthetic biology, as it is relatively new and growing field, is often not covered in high school biology. We wanted to teach the sixth form students how plants can be used for genetic engineering, especially how plants can be used to make pharmaceuticals. We worked alongside Jamie, one of our iGEM supervisors, who was demonstrating the use of Luciferase, which we have been using as part of our lab project.
Biology and Geology Rocks!: 7/10/17
National Museum Cardiff, alongside Cardiff University, ran an event for children and families to teach children about biology and geology. There were 3680 visitors at this free event, mostly children, and we were very happy about the interest in our stall where we were extracting DNA from strawberries. Our stall was so popular that we actually ran out of strawberries before the end of the event! The event was aimed at fairly young children, who had not yet been taught science and what DNA was, we therefore, had to explain to them what cells were, and that they were made up of cells that contained DNA that made them who they are.
UK iGEM Meetup
After a week of preparation, we set off for London. The first part of the meet-up was held at the University of Westminster, where a series of guest speakers, lots of free Pizza and poster presentations were set in place for us. Dr Vitor Pinheiro, a guest speaker from UCL, gave a lecture discussing the risks associated with synthetic biology. Dr Stefanie Frank, a researcher from UCL, also gave a fascinating lecture of her current research in synthetic biology. This was a great opportunity to hear about current research outside of iGEM.
After lunch, research posters from the UK teams were displayed across the conference room. This was the perfect opportunity to learn about the other team’s projects and was an opportunity to get to know our fellow UK iGEMers. It was great to see such a diverse range of projects, with BenthBioFactory being the only team using plants. We rounded off the day at the iGEM social, where we had dinner with the Manchester, Sheffield and York iGEM teams.
UCL were our hosts for the Saturday morning. The main aim of this session was to debate the fundamental issues surrounding synthetic biology. This was an extremely interesting session as it made us"

Dilute BSA solution 1:20 with water.                 Use 11µl BSA and 209 µl water for one 96 well plate.
Assay
Transfer 100µl Bradford solution and 2µl BSA solution in each well.                 Mix the solution well and destroy all airbubbles with a pipette tip.
Measurement
Measure absorption of the 96 well plate with a photometer at 580nm.
To pass the pipetting test the error rate of two following rows in a 96 microwell plate had to be less than 6 %.                 If a student met this criterium, we decided by this calculation:
1. average for one row
2. deviation average – a single well plate (for every well plate in a row)
3. result of 2. / average for one row * 100
Establishing an iGEM-Team
The beginning of our project
During a regular seminar of virology, we discussed about different possibilities to engage into scientific research as soon as possible. Annabel and Nicole came up with the idea to participate in the iGEM competition. We were motivated by the outlook to conduct our own research project with all tasks and responsibilities but with close supervision by experienced researchers. Mostly we were eager to gain experience working in the lab.
After collecting more information about the competition online and from other participants, we decided to bring iGEM to Wuerzburg and founded the first team of our university. Together with two additional bachelor students we motivated Prof. Jochen Bodem to become our PI. He also provided us with lab space to get started with the lab work. By advertising our project among friends, we soon got more and more students, until we were a huge group of 50 participants.
After various brainstorming sessions we decided to start exploring new methods in the detection of infectious diseases.  This led us to our project, designing a rapid diagnostic test to distinguish different types of Plasmodium, the pathogen which causes Malaria.
Organizing the team in different subgroups meant that every student could contribute to the topic they liked the most. Unfortunately, many students did not spend as much time and passion on our project as necessary, so our team shrank to the final number of eleven student members and three advisors. Our final team consists of an interdisciplinary synergy of bachelor students from biology, biomedicine, medicine and mathematics.

Amit Malhotra
B.Sc. Computer Science - Web Applications
B.Sc. Microbiology and Immunology
Amit graduated from McGill University with a major in Microbiology and Immunology, however, his career saw him on a completely different path.  After running his own business for 13 years in sales, marketing and information technology, he decided to do a second bachelor's degree, but in Computer Science, a subject he had grown fond of during his business venture.  He is currently studying Computer Science with a focus on Web Applications at Concordia University and works full-time at Radialpoint Inc. as an automation developer.  Sort of a workaholic, he enjoys the pressure full time studies combined with full time employment brings on and is always looking to combine his love of microbiology with his love of computers.
David Oram
B.Sc. Biology, iBBA, SCS
Hey, I’m David Oram from Newfoundland, Canada and am entering the last year of a B.Sc Biology at Concordia University. Before joining Concordia, I obtained an iBBA from Memorial University and gained my Canadian Securities Course (CSC) certification while working in investment banking.
Since returning to the sciences I am become enthralled with synthetic astrobiology and the promise of exponential technologies.  I am honoured to be apart of the only iGEM team from Quebec and am looking forward to representing Concordia on the International stage!

Completed:Bachelor of Science in Biology with focus on human and molecular biology (Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
I was always fascinated by the power, especially the power of manipulation. In synthetic biology you  only have to manipulate one enzyme, one molecule or one base pair; you   must turn one little wheel to change the whole consensus, the whole mind, the whole  structure of the organism and finally the whole universe. In our  project I will  demonstrate the power of manipulation by the expression of a hyaluronic acid  synthase (HAS)  which only has two small amino acid exchanges in comparison to all  other HASes but therefore produces  high molecular weight hyaluronic acid.  Furthermore I hope that I can improve my skills of bending an organism according to  my sake, but personally I do not think that Bacillus megaterium has anything to oppose  me . The last part of my motivation to participate in iGEM is that I wish to get in  contact with other creatures of this surprisingly manifold universe and to have a lot of fun.

- Jens J and Camilla
Week 27 (30/6 - 6/7)
Monday 30/6
The overnight culture was not red, which means that something was wrong with the plasmid. Therefor a new overnight culture was prepared, so that colony pcr can be performed on the cultures. Furthermore an overnight culture was prepared of the wild type E. coli strain, so that it can be used for transformation tomorrow.
- Jens J
Tuesday 1/7
Today colony PCR (iGEM2014_SOP0021) was performed on the E. coli MG1655 strains with the plasmids: pSB1A3, pSB1C3, pSB1K3 and J04450 (also known as aza). The results showed that the constructs all had approximately the same weight, just below 1500 bp. This corresponds to the theoretical weight of the constructs, which is 1382 bp.
The development of the construct used to produce lacI was commenced. This was done by first running Phusion PCR (igem2014_SOP010) on lacI (BBa_I732100, Template 8A, Plate 3). The PCR product was then analysed on gel-electrophoresis and purified.
Transformation was performed on the plasmids pSB1C3 and pSB1K3 as the former transformation was unsuccessful. Furthermore transformation was also performed on the parts BBa_R0010 (lacP promoter) and BBa_E0840 (GFP coding seq.). The transformed E. coli were put on agar plates with antibiotic according to their respective resistance. The plates were placed in the heating cabinet and should be examined for colonies tomorrow.
-JJ
Wednesday 2/7
Because the PCR on lacI from yesterday yielded a low concentration, Phusion PCR was repeated today, where both the PCR product from yesterday and BBa_I732100 from iGEM were used as template. The results showed that the PCR product from yesterday was too short and still yielded a low concentration. While the PCR reaction with BBa_I732100 as template produced a higher concentration of lacI.
The transformation on the parts BBa_R0010 (lacP promoter) and BBa_E0840 (GFP coding seq.) from yesterday was unsuccesful so the experiment was repeated today.

Introduction
We aim at setting up a biological device counting random events occuring in a microfluidic device (see figure 1). These events are recombinations in the cells of the device, stimulated by pulses of arabinose coming from the tunnel. Once a certain number of pulses have been triggered, we expect our device to start emitting green fluorescence. First, we shall describe the dynamics of the population of bacteria in our device as for instance its recombinations, which further lead to the rise of the concentration of produced AHL. AHL is a quorum sensing molecule that, once a certain concentration threshold is reached, triggers in our device the production of GFP. It then alerts us of the end of counting. To count how many recombinations (so how many events) are needed to get the quorum sensing response, we shall determine the role and assess the value of a few critical parameters in our model.
The process
To be able to model the system, we first need to have a feeling of how the components of the system react and interact with one another. First, we send a pulse of arabinose through the tunnel which triggers, with a certain probability, the recombination of some bacteria. Those bacteria are then expected to become red (RFP expression) and start producing LuxI, which in turns promotes the production of AHL. AHL will play two roles:
it can bind with intracellular LuxR, which is a constitutively expressed protein so that its concentration inside the cell will be considered as constant. We call it LuxRf as long as it is free from AHL, LuxR* otherwise;
it can cross the cell membrane to bind with LuxR of other bacteria in the device.
Every time a pulse of arabinose is injected, the production of AHL increases as a result of more recombinations. Once a certain level of AHL has been reached, all the cells respond to the quorum sensing signal and start producing GFP, which is the event putting an end to the counting.

Protein Trafficking
Overview
In nature, eukaryotic cell mitochondria usually have their protein encoded by gene in nucleus and produced from cytosol. In this process, MLS will act as signal peptide to target the protein into mitochondria.
In our module, we will construct the MLS BioBrick K1119001 , and characterize it quantitatively[link].
Mechanism of MLS
MLS is attached to the N-terminal of the protein in interest, and be recognized by receptor in the outer mitochondria membrane. The complex of receptor and attached protein diffuse to a contact site, where protein is translocated across both the outer and inner membrane by a protein translocator. The MLS will be cleaved off by signal peptidase inside the mitochondria afterward. Chaperone proteins will help to pull the protein across the membrane and help the refolding of protein.
Linkage to project
In our project, we introduced bacterial enzymes to mammalian cell to modify metabolic pathway. However, unlike bacteria, citric acid cycle in mammalian cells is compartmentalized in mitochondria. The ACE proteins should be targeted to mitochondria for their functionality. To do so, we fused ACE enzymes with Mitochondrial Leader Sequence (MLS).

(3) For each template species we found, we continue to search template reactions containing this template species as a reactant or modifier or both. Only forward or reverse reaction is handled, never for both.
(4) For each template reaction found, we search in the species list for possible species which could be instances of templates of other reactants and modifiers. If not found, then go for next reaction.
(5) For each possible combination of reactants and modifiers, if the reaction parameter conditions are satisfied, we generate the structure of products based on the transfer table and structural templates of products. And then add this new reaction to the reaction list.
(6) Go to step 2 until the end of the species list.
In the following, we will focus on the step (2), (3) and (5). Our algorithms are totally different with that of other software tools since we design them for the purpose of proving the feasibility of MoDeL for synthetic biology. They are kind of complicated because the complexity of biological systems require so.
What are special reactions and How to handle with them?
Transcription and translation reactions are not supported by MoDeL reaction definitions; they are handled specially in the core program. We use pseudo first-order reaction to model both transcription and translation reactions (RNA polymerase are ignored). The rate constant k is the value of forwardPromoterEfficiency/reversePromoterEfficiency for transcriptions and forwardRbsEfficiency/reverseRbsEfficiency for translations defined for each part in the database. A transcription will not end at a terminator with termination efficiency less than 100% (values are stored in attribute forwardTerminatorEfficiency/reverseTerminatorEfficiency): RNA polymerase will pass over and continue transcription. For translation reactions, the prerequisite condition is that the part next to RBS along the 5' to 3' direction must have non-zero attribute value forwardStartCodon/reverseStartCodon. Opposite to transcriptions, translation reactions would stop if one part with non-zero attribute value forwardStopCodon/reverseStopCodon is encountered.
What are differences from single compartment to multi-compartment?
Consider an example first. AHL molecules outside diffuse into E.coli cells with rate k1, while AHL molecules inside E.coli cells diffuse outward and enter into the bio-reactor with rate k2. We assume diffusion reactions are all driven by concentration gradient.

PCR was run on at two different annealing temperatures (70 °C and 71 °C) to see which was most effective
●
A PCR cleanup was performed on both the PCR from the Histag and the meffRed and the nano drop showed concentrations of DNA in each that showed the PCR was effective. The annealing temperature of 70 °C produced higher concentrations of DNA after the PCR extraction so we decided to move forward with this as the annealing temperature if we need it in the future and we are using the PCR extraction products from the 70 °C to perform a Gibson assembly with.
●
Because our HisTag and meffRed PCR were effective (nano drop showed significant concentrations after PCR Cleanup) we performed a Gibson assembly using the 12 different DNA 2.0 chromoproteins and the meffRed linearized backbone and the HisTag. The Gibson assembly prodcut will be transformed into T7 express LysS cells and plated on LB +Chloro plates.

A photo is taken (within the app) of the Chrome-Q dome target base (that contains the rows of samples in triplicate). The app finds the samples in the photo by looking for low luminance values compared to the high luminance values in the white background. Then, the app finds the average hue and luminance for each sample by averaging the RGB values for all of the pixels in the circular sample. It groups the samples into rows by comparing their vertical locations in the photo.

Overview
   
From Aug.23 to 27, we held a theme exhibition on synthetic biology, entitled Genesis of Synthetic Biology, at Ziqin Building, Xiamen, China. Thousands of visitors were attracted by the exhibition, and among them were both adults and kids. As far as we know, it is the first theme exhibition focusing on synthetic biology in China, even in Asia.
The exhibition was basically composed of two forms. On one hand, 22 exhibition panels acted as the most important knowledge carriers illustrating issues such as what is synthetic biology? What is iGEM? How synthetic biology benefits our life? What if synthetic biology is misused by terrorists? What did we do in 2011 iGEM project and what shall we do this year? On the other hand, we also created a small but cozy cinema. Showed on the screen were various resources linked with synthetic biology as well as iGEM competition. For instance, we selected several documentaries about the central dogma, human genome project, cell and life, and through this window we also presented our 2011 iGEM project, in which we synthesized intelligent control-cell- density bacteria (iccdB) and awarded by gold medal. For better publicizing effect, the panels were written in Chinese instead of English. Moreover, we also offered guidance to visitors explaining some of recondite concepts.
A message board was under our consideration too. Many visitors, after visiting the exhibition, initiatively left their messages and stick the post-in-note. It is quite exciting and gratified to notice that the majority messages are encouraging words wishing us a good result in 2012 iGEM competition. Besides, some visitors wrote down their opinions-both positive and negative"
MIT,2011,Team:MIT#HumanPractices#_-_-_TEXT.html," MIT was kind enough to let us use their labspace. We had a number of applications for the class, and accepted a wide array of students including freshmen exploring different majors, architecture students, and Ph.D candidates from Boston University.
Our lectures and discussion sessions were open to anyone who wanted to join, even if we could only finance 12 students in the lab. Because the class was for people of all experience levels, our first lecture started as an explanation of the most important biological mechanisms. Building on the basics, the second lecture introduced synthetic biology both within the context of iGEM and as it is understood in some of the most significant synbio laboratories. The third lecture explained, at a high level, intricate circuits and systems in many chassis developed in labs at MIT and Caltech, and the greater applications of such research. We brought in guest lecturers, such as Prof. Douglas Densmore of Boston University, to talk about their work in different approaches to synbio, and had students read and explain important scientific papers to practice finding and comprehending the significant conclusions in dense academic papers.
When we felt like the basics of synthetic biology had been covered, we were keen to explore its public perception as well as the possibilities of its future. In the last week of the class, the lectures were replaced with involved discussion groups on topics from the ethics of synthetic biology to its public image to the problem of intellectual property. We challenged the students to choose one intriguing paper in synthetic biology, present it, and then craft their own experiments to extend the research in a new and exciting way.
The class as a whole was a rewarding experience for us. Not only did we reach out to people far beyond the scope of MIT to both explain and explore the field of synthetic biology, but we began to understand the possibilities and problems of synbio on a whole new dimension through teaching the concepts to others.
Class Safety
The safety of our students was a high priority. Every student in the lab section was trained by the MIT Environmental Health and Safety department in BL1 practices and Hazardous Waste Disposal. We (the instructors) cleaned and prepared the lab space every night before class and made sure all reagents and materials were available to the students in the morning. The Knight Lab was a safe place to perform our BL1 experiments. No risks were taken in our classroom. Our lectures were given in meeting rooms and presentation rooms throughout the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory building, well outside of the Knight Lab setting.
Lack of organization and sufficient space looked to pose a problem early on in the class. However, by splitting the students into two groups and"

Collaboration with iGEM Teams
In our vision iGEM is all about working together. Thanks to much work performed by others, the iGEM competition and the Registry exist.  We shared all our plans, data and results right from the start. Once all projects descriptions were available, we contacted all teams with similar plans. So far this did not lead to concrete collaborations
Fortunately we could work together with the following three teams:
Freiburg Bioware
During the competition Freiburg Bioware had the cool idea to do a photo competition in which the winners could win a Cuckoo Clock. We send in a number of our cool & funny photo's and are happy we could help them.
Groningen
This year Team Groningen traveled all the way to Delft to come and visit one of our professors working in their field of interest. Of course we seized the opportunity to meet up and make plans for cooperation.
Sheffield
A survey was conducted among iGEM Teams by the Team Sheffield . The interviews focused on the roles and identities of synthetic biologists. Since iGEM has grown to such a big community, we think the outcome of this research will be interesting and really significant. We were happy to help!
Wiki development
A lot of teams have used our source code and included it in their wiki’s. Apparently our code pleases these teams and emphasizes the high quality and its perfect working. We shared code sniplets that can be reused by other teams on our Wiki Tips & Tricks page.

CLSB-UK,2016,Team:CLSB-UK#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," it to a strong constitutive promoter we are hoping to increase the growth rate of cyanobacteria making it possible for them to be used in shorter time periods. This inevitably poses a potential threat. Should this organism wriggle its way to freedom and find itself in the wild, its increased growth would outcompete other rival species. However, this has been taken into account. By using a replicative rather than an integrative plasmid, we are able to adequately test any increase in BPV efficiency whilst still ensuring that in the worst case scenario (that is, release into the wild) the plasmid will be lost after around two generations and the organism will no longer present any threat to the surrounding environment. More importantly, any equipment used and any organisms after the work had been finished were discarded in Virkon and autoclaved.
Safety when scaling-up
In the event that this were to become a feasible large scale operation it would require an integrative plasmid coding for an increase in cmpA, this would require a control mechanism to be installed with it to ensure that in the event of a release into the wild it could still be controlled. Viable control mechanisms include: Logic gates controlling transcription - only in the presence of specific molecules would the desired gene be transcribed thus allowing us to up regulate the gene. A ‘deadman’ switch, where an external chemical prevents transcription of genes coding for toxins that would otherwise destroy the cell. A CRISPRR kill switch would be viable as well in the event of large scale use of these BPV’s, allowing DNA to be accurately and precisely deleted in the presence of a new environment, having been shown to reduce viable cells by 10^8 fold in the presence of a control substance, this type of kill witch could prove valuable for future large scale work. Ingenious innovative means of control could one day ensure higher levels of safety for an industrial operation, introducing synthetic amino acids into the organism meaning that once the organism is dependent on these synthesised amino acids it would be unable to survive in the wild allowing safe lab use."

SCUT-China,2015,Team:SCUT-China#criticalThinking_-_-_TEXT.html," its departments working under it and these regulations are classified into administrative laws and regulations and/or Departmental rules, it’s not so possible for the regulations to work as powerfully and compulsively as law made by People's Congress.
Limited by the development of government department, these regulations were put more emphases in principle of legality instead of practical operating. For example, as stated in Human genetic resources management interim measures, research and development institutions in our country shall enjoy the exclusive ownership of human genetic resources information within the territory of China, including important genetic genealogy and genetic resources like data, materials and samples from specific areas and without permission, no one should transfer the possession of this information to others. Actually, where we should come for permission is still puzzlement.
Meanwhile, shortage of compound talents with gene science background and legal professional knowledge and ability is another obstruction that impedes the development of gene technology legislation research. During the conversation with Prof. Zhou, she mentioned several times that she has not enough talents to carry out more researches in gene legislation, for life science itself is difficult for professional students to understand and it’s easy to picture a law school student without life science background is pressed up against the wall unsurprisingly when he/she try goes deep into research.
The Chinese law concerning gene is permissive.
It’s more common to regulate gene therapy by administrative laws and regulations in China, such as technical guidelines for Gene therapy research and preparation quality control, which is not powerful enough to regulate gene therapy systematically, a rapidly developing and changing subject, for its temporality and contingent character.
Legal remedy problem is another theme that China must face in the field of bioscience. Technical guideline is just rules or instructions that are given by the official organization telling you how to do something, especially something difficult, and it is not equal to law that has the power to compulsively urge people to abbey. When the infringement happens, it’s the law, not the guideline to cope with the problem during the lawsuits.
To summarize, laws in our country China is permissive and patchy and we need to learn from counties with thorough law system and to do research to seek out the compatible pattern in biology to avoid potential accidents and disasters buried under gene editing and therapy.
C. Suggestion for Legislation in China
What should the Chinese government do?
Government can choose to compile a specialized legislation for gene technology including the gene therapy and gene editing so as to systematically regulate and promote academic research and market practice. And at the same time, there should be a specialized department with specialized talents in charge of gene technology for professional supervision.

Based on other user input constraints, such as organism and plasmid backbone, the program then outputs the required promoter and RBS sequences needed to produce such a biofilm.
Given the striking similarity in QGEM's bifunctional biofilm optimization project, to that of Waterloo's prion based, a logical collaboration existed between the two team. This summer QGEM faced a deficit in web development knowledge, which Waterloo was eager to aid with - graciously offering to building a web accessible version of the software for public use. Both teams planned to build upon the existing software program, broadening its bases of organism knowledge. QGEM primarily worked with E.coli this summer, and thus, the program solely contained an E.coli database. In contrast, Waterloo worked with Yeast this summer, and therefore planned to add Yeast data to our organism database. Waterloo hoped to then utilize the program, allowing faster progression of their project - as optimal parts of their organism would be quickly brought to their knowledge, saving valuable time.
Unfortunately, this collaboration between teams did not happen until late into the summer, and not enough time existed to complete the collaboration to its full extent. Nevertheless, the opportunity to discuss projects to parallel in idea and execution provided imperative problem solving aid to both teams. Waterloo brought to the attention of QGEM, various parameters that should and could be incorporated into the ratiometric program. For example, looking into the effects of degradation rates of protein production. Incorporating these aspects produced in much stronger, more accurate results from the ratiometric program. Similar feedback, along with tips and tricks, were given back to Waterloo who similarly directly benefited from the ongoing collaboration.
Collaboration with Sydney
This summer, QGEM was contacted by the University of Sydney iGEM team, who were interested in learning more about the oGEM network in their quest to set up an Australasian iGEM network. As a result, QGEM shared with Sydney iGEM details on how oGEM meetings are organized and structured during the summer, and provided information on meeting agendas, topics of discussion at oGEM meetings, methods of communication, sponsorships for oGEM meetups, and strategies for promoting oGEM to industry and academia. Some advice we gave regarding setting up an iGEM network included:
Establishing a consistent and effective form of communication between all teams (e.g. Slack)

BIT-China for BNU-China
This year we collaborated with BNU-CHINA team and held a meeting on July 11st, 2015. During the meeting we exchanged our ideas and discussed on our projects. Finally, we confirmed our collaboration relationship.
Because most of BNU-CHINA’s team members were freshmen for iGEM, after the discussion, we decided to help them for parts of their gene circuits. Meanwhile, we had some difficulties in modeling and expressing functional gene NhaA and NhaB, so they offered help to solve these problems.
Fig.1 meeting with BNU-China
We helped them finish the light regulation system (Pcons+B0034+PcyA+B0034+ho1). In this system, Pcons is one of the constitutive promoters (from BBa_J23100 to BBa_J23119) which can be used to tune the expression level of expressing part and what we chose was J23100. B0034 is a kind of strong ribosome binding sites (RBS). PcyA and ho1 are two requisite genes which are required for the transformation from heme into phycocyanobilin (PCB). Ho1 will oxidize the heme group and then generate biliverdin IX alpha, and PcyA converts biliverdin IX alpha into PCB.
Fig.2 Gene circuits of light regulation system
Overlap extension PCR (OE-PCR) was used to finish their gene circuits. However, there were secondary structures in this part. So we could not get the part at first. Then we changed DNA polymerase Pfu to Primer STAR, which performs better than Pfu. Finally the light regulation system was constructed successfully.
Fig.3 The construction result of light regulation system
In this period, we also had some discussions about experiments and modeling face to face. Through these discussions, we learnt more about each other and made progress together.

1 Overview
1.1 Genome Reduction
1.2 Chemostat selection
1.3 Switch circuit
2 Outline
Overview
In order to approach our goal of creating an E. coli strain carrying a minimal genome, there are three main problems that have to be overcome:
Genome reduction:  show that in vivo restriction and religation is possible
Chemostat selection:  introduce a limitation that confers a growth advantage to organisms with smaller genomes
Switch circuit:  design a biobrick that provides for short-term synthesis of the desired gene products
Genome Reduction
To prove that in vivo restriction and religation is possible is fundamental to our project which relies on short-term expression of a restriction enzyme and a ligase. While the restriction enzyme will randomly cut DNA, the simultaneous or shortly delayed synthesis of the ligase should religate the DNA. If the DNA is cut at several sites, religation will lead to exclusion of chromosomal fragments in a random manner.
Chemostat selection
In the continuous culture of a chemostat, those organisms with the highest rate of proliferation will overgrow those with a smaller growth rate. In order to bypass the need of selecting for those E. coli which have successfully reduced their genomes by massive screening of thousands of clones, we need to introduce a constraint that confers a growth advantage to organisms with smaller genomes. We have chosen to introduce mutations in the nucleotide synthesis pathway to achieve this goal. This will render DNA replication the rate-limiting step of proliferation and therefore be advantageous to organisms with small genomes.
Switch circuit
Expression of restriction enzymes that cut genomic DNA inside the cell is likely to decrease viability. Actually, the Waterloo iGEM team is using restriction enzymes to kill cells in their project this year. Therefore, construction of a switch circuit, which allows to restrict expression of the restriction enzyme to a short period of time, is a crucial part of the project. The switch circuit allows expression of a gene under control of the lac repressor and rapid termination of lac-controlled expression despite presence of inducer by expression of an engineered LacI mutant, which is unresponsive to IPTG.
On the following pages, we will show a detailed description of how we are trying to achieve these three goals.

Questions:
Is in vivo restriction and religation possible without killing the cell?
Does in vivo restriction and religation lead to the exclusion of chromosomal fragments?

Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#CatherineNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," back-to-back. I was responsible for transcribing the dialogue, and it was interesting to hear what other users did to accomplish the same tasks I had tried the previous day.
Friday: Basically today involved user studies scheduled back-to-back from 10 am to 5 pm, and I led most of the studies today. It was quite nerve-wracking to make sure I was explaining the task clearly without giving subtle cues that could implant a bias in the participants' ideas. I also needed to make sure they were providing thorough descriptions of their intentions, otherwise the testing session would be unproductive. I think I did a good job running through the studies, especially for a first-timer! As there were studies going on all day, I had plenty of time to practice and refine the process.
Week 3: June 10 - June 14
Monday: Concluded user studies today! Also caught up with the Eugene DeSyne team's progress during the time I was working on the Tabula user studies. Orit suggested that we focus on developing new ways of visualizing rules, rather than continue refining the general user interface. She mentioned that we should draw inspiration from UML and the bio-visualization used in MoClo Planner. I'm starting to realize it's kind of difficult to create new ideas when you've become so invested and attached to a single design. I'm going to have to learn to let go of my ideas and try to create new ones with fresh eyes, lest I go through the 5 stages of grief every time an idea is shot down and torn apart.
Tuesday: Started developing our ""tree"" visualization of rules. This is in addition to the ""icon"" visualization, in which we created icons to represent components of rules. We tried to apply this visualization model to rules developed by Swapnil, a postgraduate researcher at BU.
Thursday: Prepared for our presentation to BU on Friday by drawing up posters that demonstrate our icon and tree-based visualization models. We made sure these visualizations could account for Swapnil's rules, which specify constraints such as order and part type.
Friday: The big day! The BU team visited Wellesley campus and we presented our projects to them. The brainstorming session was very helpful--many sticky notes were used and pasted over the white board. For Eugene DeSyne, we found out we were focusing on the wrong level of device development; we developed for Level 0 design, whereas the BU team was looking for Level 1 and Level 2 design. However, they seemed to really like both our icon and tree-based visualization models. I think we're"
UCSD_Software,2014,Team:UCSD Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"Der application to visualize the network using CytoscapeJS as well as updating the web page without need to reload the window unlike when employing JQuery. Additionally, AngularJS is compatible with many JQuery functionalities which allows for a combination of use for both libraries with negligible drawbacks. Effectively, AngularJS allows SBiDer to effectively and dynamically communicate with CytoscapeJS and other components of the application without the clutter of JQuery’s syntax.
Modular Interface
CyNetShare is a new innovation from the creators of CytoscapeJS which is used to share visualizations made with CytoscapeJS without the need to manually exchange files, instead rendering the files through encoded url’s. CyNetShare provides the basic framework for SBiDer as it has much of the core foundation in its source code including the CytoscapeJS visualization, table of node information, and a basic user interface layout and styling. SBiDer developed upon this framework to include the ability to retrieve results from the SBiDer database, display images of genetic devices, and easily access and download data.
Other Utilized Technologies
Apart from the aforementioned technologies that were used to create SBiDer itself, there were two other major technologies/languages involved, namely Boostrap , to design the website & the wiki, and Java, for the server.
Bootstrap is a front-end framework that contains several HTML & CSS-based design templates for various aspects of web pages. It's an easy to use framework that's used widely all over the world since it makes websites look more modern, cleaner and aesthetically pleasing.
The language chosen for the server was Java since it's easier for other developers to use, is extremely common and is compatible with a lot of languages including but not limited to Python, JavaScript and SQL. In essence, all of the languages that we made use of are very well documented, modern and easy to use languages.
The Search Algorithm
Introduction to the SBiDer Search Algorithm
Purpose of the Algorithm
SBiDer is fundamentally constructed on a manually curated database of existing genetic devices, or operons. This SBiDer database stores operons, species, and most importantly the biochemical interactions of these elements. Also, the database can be represented as an operon interaction network via species. Using this network representation of the database, SBiDer’s search algorithm searches for feasible operon paths connecting a set of species to another set of species. As a result, given a set of input species and a set of output species, the search algorithm returns a subnetwork of operon paths connecting the input species to the output species. Each path within"

A lot of experiments need to be done!!!
1. Fluorescent protein: five totally, amplify by PCR, cut by BamHI and EcoR, ligate to 414 and 424. (Charged by Tianyi); 2. Clone CYC terminator and GPD promoter, ligate to pRS413-mRFP and pRS423-mRFP (charged by Xiaoyi); 3. Clone LasR and CYC-overlap, ligate by overlap PCR, cut by SpeI and BamHI, ligate to pRS413/423-GPD-mRFP-CYC. Clone LuxR and CYC-overlap, ligate by overlap PCR, cut by SpeI and BamHI, ligate to pRS413/423-GPD-mRFP-CYC. The cardinal work of this week is overlap PCR. 4. Cut rtTA by BamHI and EcoRI, ligate to pRS413/423-GPD-mRFP-CYC. Clone TetO, ligate to the fluorescent protein plasmid. (Charged by Jinyang) 5. PCR of Luxl has been done. Now need PCR CYC, cut by EcoRI, BamHI, BglII, XhoI, ligate to the mRFP plasmid (this could be done first. Xiaoyi and Chaochang can first finish this before the primer of GPD comes, then add GPD and CYC). Everyone give a hand!!!!!!!!

2013/5/26 From Tianfang
I have asked all the workers in the lab. None of them said there is vector in the lab containing promoter and terminator. They add promoter with target gene when construct the vector. So I decide to construct the vector by myself, including pRS413,414,415，pRS423,424,425, which may be useful in our project. Add promoter and terminator to the 6 vectors’ MCS region. I chose another strong promoter TET promoter for we don’t have GPD promoter in the lab. The terminator is still CYC. I have ordered the primer for TET promoter."

7.8 Mutagen Concentration Test - Fourth Protocol
This is our fourth round of mutagenesis. In contrast to the previous two, in which we either incubated phage with mutagen for 30 minutes or 22 hours, we tried 3 hours this time. Results from this experiment were confusing: titer between different mutagen concentration was not significantly different, although in terms of average 200ug mutagen formed the most number of plaques. After discussion, we were able to identify several source of error, one of which is the death of our stock phage. We will propagate and titer our phage next.
Detailed procedure: 7.8 Mutagen Concentration Test - Fourth Protocol
7.13 Phage Propagation Experiment
We performed two rounds of propagation to increase the titer of our phage stock. An accurate titer with x1 agar was then performed to confirm the concentration our newly generated phage stock.

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Air Samples Testing for ICT-Mumbai
ICT-Mumbai is working on dealing with the problem of excessive ammonia in toilets and chemistry labs. They contacted us via email after reading our abstract and found out that we both deal with excessive ammonia. We collected air samples from the toilets and chemistry laboratories in Huairou Campus of UCAS, and assayed them following their standardized protocol. We are glad that this data is helpful for improving ICT-Mumbai’s project.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

EcoRI is not used in Golden Gate assembly, so those sites do not necessarily need to be removed. Credit: Stratton Georgoulis.
In order to assemble the construct, the coding sequences for the genes of interest must be amplified from the Ga. hansenii genome and edited such that they have the correct Golden Gate overhangs and no internal BsaI or BsmBI restriction sites. The sequences were uploaded to Benchling for analysis and planning. The coding sequence for the membrane-bound ALDH contains a BsaI restriction site near the middle of the gene (Figure 2), and the PQQ-ADH coding sequence contains a BsmBI restriction site near the end of the gene (Figure 3). To eliminate the BsaI site in ALDH, primers were designed that would introduce a point mutation at the restriction site. One set of primers, igem2016_KOM_EtOH_01 and igem2016_KOM_EtOH_02, amplifies the sequence upstream of the restriction site, adding a type 3 Golden Gate prefix and removing the restriction site. Another set, igem2016_KOM_EtOH_03 and igem2016_KOM_EtOH_04, amplifies the region downstream of the restriction site, introducing a mutation to the site and adding a type 3 Golden Gate suffix to the end of the gene. These two products will be used in an overlap PCR reaction to create a final product with no BsaI restriction sites and the correct prefix and suffix for assembly. To remove the BsmBI site from the PQQ-ADH coding sequence, a set of primers (igem2016_KOM_EtOH_05 and igem2016_KOM_EtOH_06) was designed to amplify the region upstream of the restriction site and add a Golden Gate type 3 prefix to the beginning of the sequence. The reverse primer additionally adds a mutation to existing BsmBI restriction site and creates a new BsmBI restriction site that will be used to join the piece to a double-stranded DNA, igem2016_KOM_EtOH_07, containing the rest of the gene’s coding sequence appended with a Golden Gate type 3 suffix. The assembly of the PQQ-ADH part will therefore take place in two reactions: one reaction in which the upstream piece of DNA is created, and one reaction in which it is ligated to the g"

This shows the process that occurs with the T7 System. We induce the Lactose inducible promoter with IPTG as it mimics the lactose and cannot be broken down by the cell. This allows it to continually perform transcription on the construct embedded in the genome of the BL21(DE3) and thusly constantly produce the T7 RNA polymerase encoded by the gene(3).This T7 RNA Polymerase binds to the T7 Promoter and starts transcription on the construct within our plasmid pSB1C3. This then creates the mRNA which will undergo translation and produce the protein encoded by the gene due to the E. coli RBS on the construct. Part BBa_I712074 .
 Ribosomal Binding Site
The RBS we have chosen for our constructs is an E. coli Ribosomal Binding Site, Part BBa_B0034

Building the PQS Sensor
Chromosomal DNA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 strain was kindly gifted to us by Drs Robert Ryan and Shi-Qi An from the Division of Molecular Microbiology in the College of Life sciences at the University of Dundee. This was used as a template for the amplification of the pqsA promoter gene.
The pqsA promoter region was cloned into the pSB1C3 plasmid (BioBrick BBa_K1315001 ), and was then subcloned into pBluescript. Promoterless mCherry was amplified (template used: BBa_K562012 ), and was cloned into pBluescript downstream of the pqsA promoter. The PpqsA-mCherry construct was then subcloned into pUniprom. A schematic of our completed construct can be seen in Fig 2.
The pqsR gene (present in BBa_K1315001 ) which was designed and cloned by Lin Ang Chieh from iGEM13-NTU-Taida was used as a template for the amplification of pqsR with an  influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA) tag coding sequence, which can be detected by commercially available antibodies. The HA-tag was fused to the C-terminus of the protein to allow visualisation by immunohistochemistry.
The plasmid was verified by sequencing.
The completed construct was transformed into E. coli strain MC1061 as a chassis for our biosensor.
Characterisation
Initially, western blots were undertaken to test for the production of PqsR-HA. We transformed our plasmid encoding PqsR-HA into E. coli strain MC1061 and blotted for recombinantely expressed protein. An overnight culture of the cells was lysed and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE in a 12% acrylamide gel. Anti-HA antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase were used for detection of PqsR. Fig 3A shows the expression of PqsR within our system.
As shown in Fig 3, successful production of PqsR-HA (expected mass 38 kDa) was observed. With the PqsR regulator being produced we could begin to test for a response to PQS. To test how the system would respond to PQS, cells containing the construct were cultured in LB medium and spiked with synthetic PQS (in 100% DMSO) at finals concentrations of 50 and 500 μM."

Glyoxylate Shunt
Overview
Our artificial  futile cycle design is based on the tested findings by Dean et  al, who demonstrated that by introducing the artificial glyoxylate shunt in mouse  liver cells, fatty acid uptake would increase and the mice would acquire  resistance against obesity when fed with fatty diet. (Dean, 2009) In essence,  we are reproducing their work from scratch but through the use of standard  BioBricks.
Dean, Jason T. Resistance to Diet-Induced Obesity in Mice with Synthetic Glyoxylate Shunt. 2009. Graphic.
In Dean et al.’s  work, the glyoxylate shunt was achieved by the expression of two key enzymes  from the bacterial glyoxylate cycle, isocitrate lyase (AceA) and malate synthase (AceB). When the two enzymes enter mitochondria in liver cells, isocitrate  lyase will convert a proportion of isocitrate into glyoxylate, which will then  be converted by malate synthase into malate. This process would bypass the pathway  through alpha-ketoglutarate, and therefore, bypassing the ATPs and reducing  equivalent generating steps. (Dean, 2009)
To reproduce  this masterpiece, we would first need to convert every single part into  BioBricks: we cloned out the glyoxylate enzymes genes aceA and aceB from E.  coli and assembled them with mitochondrial leader sequence (MLS). The two  translation units were then assembled downstream of mammalian constitutive CMV  Promoter and EF-1alpha Promoter respectively. Lastly, the hGH polyA signal  sequence was added to serve as terminator of the construct. These constructs,  when put together, should return the original constitutive glyoxylate shunt.

Results
1. Identification of a HPV target sequence
Most probes used to detect the virus today target the L1 gene which codes for the major capsid protein of the virus. As this region has been used as a genetic probe for the virus with success, its sequence has shown to be robust and reliable as a target. We chose to identify a target from this region also.  The target sequence chosen corresponds to a fragment that is generated from the HPV16 genome upon digestion with the 4-cutter enzyme HaeIII. This generates a 55 base pair fragment.  A number of factors had to be considered when choosing the target sequence. This included the considerations similar to when choosing a primer such as GC content, dimerization and annealing temperature.  This fragments low GC content (54.05%) mean that there is a low chance that it will form hairpin structures, making it an ideal target sequence to detect.
Fig. 5 Depiction of the sequence of the HPV target region within the L1 gene of the HPV16 virus genome.
2. Choosing a Restriction Enzyme
Our target was chosen as it was flanked by restriction sites of HaeIII. A number of restriction sites could have been chosen, however our choice was limited by factors such as the iGEM restriction sites located on the biobrick prefix and suffix.  A target had to lack these sites to create a biobrick part that could be used by other teams.
The HaeIII restriction enzyme bluntly cuts at two GGCC recognition sites within HPV16’s L1 gene.  HaeIII is not affected by DNA methylation and so the 55bp target sequence should be readily released upon HaeIII digestion of DNA prepared from a clinical sample in which HPV  infection is present.

Modeling & Simulating Bacterial Movement
Overview
Schematical overview of the relation between the chemotaxis pathway and the movement model.
Analogous to the highly complex signal transduction network in the chemotaxis receptor model, there is an at least equally challenging molecular mechanism on side of the flagella, responsible for the movement of the bacterium.
In order to capture the features of cell motility, we not only implemented, but also conceptually created a probabilistic two state model, which simulates the cell movement in accordance to the existing empirical observations.
At every time point of the simulation of the movement model, the current CheYp concentration is received as an input from the chemotaxis pathway model. This input determines the probability of the CCW and the CW rotation direction of the flagella. A counterclockwise rotation corresponds to the directed movement (running) state and to a change in spatial coordinates, together with a slight change in angle, while a clockwise rotation corresponds to the tumbling state and to a new movement direction, with nearly unchanged spatial coordinates.
By coupling the probabilistic movement model with the deterministic molecular model we can simulate the variations in motility which occur due to variations in the concentrations of the molecular species of the chemotaxis pathway, namely in the concentration of CheYp.
Known Features of Chemotaxis Motility
Flagellum of a gram negative bacterium. Free cytosolic CheYp binds to the flagellar motor protein FliM and induces tumbling. FliM is located in the motor complex and acts as a motor switch.
The focus in creating the movement model was to reliably reproduce the known chemotaxis behavior of E. coli cells. We used as a benchmark the statistical estimates of chemotaxis motility, as presented in [1] . In order to be successful, our movement model had to reproduce the following features:
In a constant extracellular environment, the transition times between the two states the cell can employ (run length and tumbling length) are approximately exponentially distributed, with a tumbling length of 0.14±0.19s and a run length of 0.86±1.18s (each value given as mean and"
NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#Introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," the                         intestinal wall [4]. Some biomolecules are released by bacteria which induce an inflammatory                         reaction to intestinal epithelial cells, causing the destroyed tight junction between                         intestinal epithelial cells and the reduced of mucus layer thickness . When dendritic cells in                         the lamina propria sense these biomolecules, they release inflammatory signals to recruit                         immune cells, which exacerbates the inflammatory response. Microorganisms in the intestinal                         lumen pass through the leaky intestinal epithelial barrier, which further exacerbates the                         immune response against bacteria and creates a vicious circle. These immunological attacks and                         inflammatory injuries eventually lead to the death of intestinal epithelial cells [5]. IBD                         occurs when this condition persists without intervention.
Figure 2. War inside the intestine. In IBD patient’s gut, the immune system overreacts to the flora, causing a series of inflammatory events that may damage and destroy the intestinal wall.
3. A growing global disease
IBD is a global disease that is most common in North America,                         Western Europe, Northern Europe, Australia, and New Zealand [6, 7], which may be related to the                         higher level of industrialization in these regions [8]. There are more than 1 million IBD                         patients in the United States [9], and the medical burden associated with IBD directly exceeds                         $6 billion per year [10]. In Canada, more than 200,000 people have IBD, and the annual medical                         burden exceeds CDN$1.2 billion [11]. In Europe, there are more than 2.5 million IBD patients                         with an annual health care burden of more than €4.6 billion [12]. Due to the growing number of                         cases, huge medical expenses, the loss of work capacity of the sick and the aging of the sick                         population, IBD will place a heavy burden on the world in the next decade [7, 13].
Figure 3. The global prevalence of IBD in 2015.
4. Rising in the Asia
In the past few decades, IBD has shown a growing trend in low-incidence areas, especially in new                         industrialized areas such as Asia [14, 15]. This is likely to be related to the Westernization                         of residents' dietary patterns and the rapid urbanization process [16, 17].
Asia is one of the continents that experiencing fastest urbanization in the world [18], and                         there is a close relationship between urbanization and IBD [19]. In Asia, the high incidence of                         IBD is mainly found in some highly urbanized areas"

Protocol
Protocol for Static & Dynamic Performance
Cultivate the BL21 containing riboswitch in LB at 37℃180rpm until OD600 reaches 0.5.
Induce the bacteria with 1mM IPTG (final concentration), and cultivate them at 37℃180rpm for 4hrs.
Dilute the suspension culture with LB to 0.1OD600 . Inducer is added at concentration ranging from 1.00E-05 mol/L(for K411003) or 1.00E-06 mol/L(for Atrazine and Theophylline riboswitch 2)to 1.00E-01 mol/L.
Measure the RFU ( ex488/em525) and OD600 synchronously.
Data Analysis
Protocol for Performance Reliability
Cultivate the BL21 containing riboswitch in LB at 37℃180rpm for 15hrs.
The culture was diluted 1:500 into two identical 5mL cultures. Add inducers to one of the cultures to an input level of 1)5mM(for K511003) 2)1mM(for Atrazine and Theophylline Riboswitch 2).
The culture was diluted 1:500 in the morning and evening every day for 4 days.
Each evening, a second culture was inoculated by a 1:500 dilution from the culture for both the high and low input condition. These cultures were grown in the absence of inducers for 8hrs to eliminate the accumulated GFP before assaying performance.
Samples from both of the second copies were induced with inducers at 37℃180rpm for 45 min. Single-cell fluorescence measurements were carried out on a flow cytometer.
Limited by time and resources, it is impossible for us to characterize all riboswitches. Any teams or individuals are warmly welcomed to enrich our riboswitch standardization library.

Dr Brooks emphasised how useful our sensor would be for detection of leptospirosis – a bacteria commonly detected in the blood samples RIPL test, with the paper-based aspect making it very well-suited to the developing countries where this disease prevails. We arranged a future consultation with Dr Brooks to discuss our technology further, and after conferring with the rest of the team, made the executive decision to alter the primary target of our sensor.
Collaborating with members of Public Health England combined with the analysis of collected data led us to conclude that when detecting for Lyme disease, an in vivo form of our sensor would be most appropriate. The advantages of using paper-based sensing over in vivo are the ease of use, stability and cost, however, if our system is used in clinics in developed areas, these benefits become secondary to concerns over sensitivity. An in vivo detection kit would be more easily tuneable for sensitivity than an in vitro paper-based kit, on the basis that it is more easily analysed under imaging and assay techniques, with the loss of ease of use and affordability. In developed areas, and when used by appropriately trained professionals, the benefits regarding sensitivity when using in vivo detection outweigh any negative aspects.

Application of the appropriate positive controls (eg. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for Jurkat cells) and control staining (PI for necrotic cells) will lead to more detailed and reliable results.
Alternative induction of apoptosis using PMA
Susceptible cell lines can be incubated with PMA in appropriate incubation period and concentrations as a positive control to sTRAIL induced apoptosis. The following protocol is designed for Jurkat cells.
Incubate cells with 5 µg/mL PMA and 1 µM Ionomycin overnight.
Wash cells 3 times with DPBS and resuspend in Annexin V binding buffer for detection with Annexin V-Alexa488.
Measurement of the Lactate output of mammalian cell lines.
Our project relies on the phenomenon of elevated lactate output of cancer cells upon metabolic reprogramming referred to as the Warburg effect . To validate this effect in our cell lines of interest we determined the lactate level of the cell’s culture medium after cell culture within the timeframe in which our system will be applied. Based on this, the lactate production by single cells can be estimated .
The experiment can be carried out in any volume of interest. We performed our measurement in 24-well plates.
Click here to see the results of this experiment.
Count cells and prepare a mastermix to have 80’000 cells or 600’000 cells per well for adherent and suspension cells, respectively. Prepare enough mastermix for all desired time points and replicates. Counting must be very accurate if the determination of the lactate output per cell is the aim of the experiment. Consider using a cell counter.
Distribute the cells into the wells of a 24-well plate, 500 µL  per well.
Adherent cells must be allowed to settle for 2 hours previous to the start of the experiment.
At the beginning of the measurement, the medium has to be exchanged to start at the minimal level. To this end, spin down the cells at 250 rcf for 3 min and resuspend the pellet in 500 µL  of fresh, prewarmed medium. The sample for time zero has to be taken right after the exchange of the medium.
Samples are collected in regular time intervals by transferring the medium into an Eppendorf tube. Centrifuge samples at 250 rcf for 3 min and transfer the cell free medium into a new Eppendorf tube.

In other droplets, where the Trigger RNA binds to the Toehold Switch with weaker affinity, there are also less catalytic biomolecules and Product Nucleotides produced. Finally, the droplets in which the Trigger RNA does not bind to the Toehold Switch, there are no biomolecules or product nucleotides produced.
After the Amplification and Sequencing steps, from each unique sequenced single molecule we can receive the information about the Toehold Switch and Trigger RNA sequence pairs, and also the information about how that regulatory pair interacted. In this case the interaction stands for how strongly the specific Trigger RNA bound to the Toehold Switch.
For our proof of concept, we have chosen multiple Toehold Switches which were already described in literature. We have first prepared a small library of different combinations of Toehold Switches and Trigger RNAs. Then, we measured those interactions using standard, low-throughput methods. Lastly, we have used CAT-Seq to determine those cross-interactions in high-throughput.
In this way, CAT-Seq can be applied to conveniently record the activities of large number of regulatory parts and at the same time assess their cross-interactions."

If the costs of recurrence, as estimated by Cancer Research UK were taken into account - £16000 for stage 1 and £17000 as the average cost of other stages [19] - the cost per QALY would still only be £8300, and at 39% sensitivity would be £19900 per QALY.
Our modeling therefore proves that our sensor would be cost effective in reducing mortality rates from NSCLC. The same principle on which this model is based could be applied to any cancer to screen those with sufficiently high risk using miRNA biomarkers.
