Introduction
Transactivator-Like Effectors (TALEs) are a technology that once revolutionized the way researchers manipulate DNA with exceptional site specificity.Though it works well in eukaryotic organisms, it is not available in prokaryotic organisms. We come up with the idea that the long repeating sequence of the TALEs coding sequence leads to it. In our project, we attempt to construct a marvelous TALEs system which can efficiently work in prokaryotic organisms. By optimizing the TALEs coding sequence with modeling methods and testing it by Golden Gate Assembly and Report System, we hope we can have a handle tool for gene editing in prokaryotic organisms.
Project
Background, hypothesis and workflow of designer TALE.

Took all yeast transformations out of incubator.  Although the cells are rather dense, it is possible to find at least one or two decently isolated colonies on each one.  Noticed significant contamination on the transformation for pRS304* + pRS306.  Decided to take a colony from the opposite side of the plate and streak it out onto a fresh plate, just in case this might work.  However, it will probably be necessary to re-do this transformation.  For the others, we'll make glycerol stocks next week, possibly in conjunction with testing.

Amsterdam,2015,Team:Amsterdam#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,", sunlight and water to create the biomass they need for growth. Through genetic engineering, some of this flux can be redirected to create desirable products. Although complex product formation is still limited by from genetic instability or lack of productivity at present, we can engineer Synechocystis to produce and export relatively simple carbon compounds instead. These compounds, e.g. sugars, can then be used to feed other species, like E. coli, that can use these compounds for their own biomass production, and, if properly engineered, the production of valuable products. Since water, light, and CO2 are virtually infinite in supply, and absolutely non-harmful to the environment (quite the opposite), the production of carbon-compounds from Synechocystis, and the subsequent product production by E. coli, is essentially a self-sustaining, carbon-neutral process.
Besides the carbon-neutral production potential of cyanobacteria, this approach thus benefits from the fact that genetic engineering practices for production formation is much wider established in chemotrophs like E. coli. Indeed, results obtained in E. coli cannot be translated directly into cyanobacteria. For example, an E. coli strain designed to produce 1-butanol via an engineered pathway produced more than 30 g/L, but the cyanobacterial strain with the same pathway produced only trace amounts (in a later study, the optimized pathway for S. elongatus, another cyanobacterium, reached a maximum titer of 2.8 g/L). By combining the sustainable photosynthetic capacity of cyanobacteria with the fermentative production potential of chemotrophs, we essentially combine the best of both worlds, and, importantly, are not inhibited by the process of re-inventing the many wheels that have been fine-tuned in E. coli in cyanobacteria.  Several important questions remain: how to tackle the issue of genetic instability? How should the consortium practically be implemented in a biorefinery? And how to deal with potential safety concerns? These questions will be addressed in the following sections
Genetically stable production in cyanobacteria
As mentioned, genetic stability is a crucial design constraint that must be taken into account if photosynthetic bioproduction is to be used in real-world applications. This constraint has therefore guided our efforts in choosing what carbon compound we want Synechocystis to share with its neighboring species in the biorefinery. The issue is best explained through an example: say there are two options for engineering Synechocystis such that it produces carbon compounds on which a chemotroph like E."

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced a an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all award, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2017,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," from Rattus norvegicus and recognizes n-octanal [7], while Olfr1258 originates from Mus musculus and recognizes butanone [8]. Previous studies have shown that Ri7 can successfully be incorporated into S. cerevisiae [7], while Olfr1258 has yet only been expressed in mammalian cells [8]. Olfr1258 is incorporated into mating type α and Ri7 into a, see Figure 2. Like the native GPCRs, Olfr1258 and Ri7 will activate the MAPK cascade and initiate mating between the cells. Because the cells now lack Ste3 and Ste2, solely the presence of butanone and n-octanal will lead to mating as the recombinant GPCRs will not recognize a- and α-factors.
Figure 2. The receptor Olfr1258 in α cells recognizes butanone and activates the MAPK cascade. Ri7 has a similar task in a cells, but recognizes n-octanal instead of butanone.
Switch
When the cells detect n-octanal and butanone, the MAPK cascade is activated and mating promoted. The second part of the biosensor, the switch, is simultaneously turned on. The basic design of the switch is the same in both α and a cells; Cre recombinase is expressed by PFUS1 and two mutated loxP-sites in opposite directions surrounds a backward directed promoter for expression of part of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. FUS1 is a mating specific gene and the promoter PFUS1 is activated by the MAPK cascade. Thereby, detection of the VOCs leads to expression of Cre recombinase. The mutations in the loxP-sites prevent the sites from further recombining (and returning to their original location) after the first recombination has occurred [10]. Once this irreversible system is turned on, it amplifies the internal signal of the biosensor by continuing to express the CRISPR/Cas9 system and help creating a more significant output of the AND-gate.
The CRISPR/Cas9-system consist of two parts; the Cas9 protein and a gRNA. Both parts are needed for the system to function and this is exploited in the AND-gate. Two different constructs are designed on plasmids and cloned into either mating type α and a, making α cells express the gRNA and a cells Cas9. In mating type a, the strong constitutive promoter PTEF1 expresses the Cas9 protein after recombination of the loxP-sites, see Figure"

Gold Medal Criterion #4
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your project works. There are many ways in which your project working could be demonstrated, so there is more than one way to meet this requirement. This gold medal criterion was introduced in 2016, so check our what 2016 teams did to achieve their gold medals!

The focus of our project is to characterize the physical and chemical manifestations of the biofilm response in cells where key genes in the biofilm response (for both structural and regulatory aspects) have been either overexpressed or deleted. The numerous assays that need to be done drove us to develop a standardized battery of assays, so that the cell can be studied as an entire system, as opposed to the methods used in past literature that only measured the effects of genetic engineering on just one manifestation.
Defect in the Biobrick Paradigm
The Biobrick paradigm is that gene parts are necessarily additive, due to the mechanics of the Biobrick Assembly method. Consequently, apart from by using “additive” exotic methods such as RNAi to disrupt gene expression to achieve functional gene silencing, gene deletions from a genome (negative “additive” modifications) simply cannot be submitted to the Gene Parts Registry.

The stained cells were first imaged at maximum excitation intensity. At this excitation energy, only the OmpA-silicatein expressing cells showed fluorescence colocalized with the cells and not in the medium. Silicatein, INP-silicatein and the negative control (OmpA-silicatein without silicic acid) all caused overexposure of the camera. In figure 1 the imaging results of OmpA-silicatein and the negative control (OmpA-silicatein without silicic acid) are shown. The cells that were not stained with Rhodamine 123 showed no measurable fluorescence. (data not shown), indicating there is no autofluorescence at this wavelength.
Figure 1: Widefield and fluorescence images of OmpA-silicatein with silicic acid and OmpA-silicatein without silicic acid (negative control) at maximum excitation energy. Of the widefield and fluorescence images an overlay was made to show the colocalization of fluorescence with the cells. The negative control caused overexposure of the camera, attributed to the Rhodamine in the medium, therefore the fluorescent image only gives one uniform signal.
Since Silicatein,  INP-silicatein and the negative control all caused overexposure of the camera, they all had the same output. We can thus not draw any conclusions for these strains. Therefore, samples where overexposure was observed were imaged again at only 1/3 of the excitation energy. The imaging results are displayed in figure 2.

It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Risk assessment of our bacteria
Above we have highlighted many aspects of biosafety concerning the release of our bacteria from our device. Additionally, we want to emphasize the biosafety of the used organisms by themselves. E.coli is a naturally derived organism from humans. JW3367-3 are specially modified bacteria of the strain E.coli that lack the EnvZ/OmpR cascade signalling. We also used the strain DH5alpha. These strains are so called “lab strains” and cannot survive in the human digestive system. They are also not able to produce toxins and are attributed to the risk group one.  Therefore these organisms are classified as the lowest risk for safety and health for humans and to team members and people working with them. Additionally they are not able to survive outside of the laboratory hence do not pose  any harm to the environment.
ref. TU Eindhoven 2014
Future steps to maximize biosafety
Taking an outlook into future biosafety maximization one comes up with several approaches. Given the possibility of encapsulating with  higher alginate concentrations than 2.5 %, capsule integrity should rise in ratio with alginate concentration. Using other polymerizing agents than alginate should also be taken into account since those could possibly enforce capsule resistivity against acids and other depolymerizing agents.  On the other hand biosafety nowadays mainly residues on kill-switch integration in bacterial genomes. Given that there are already plenty of well working established kill-switches available as biobricks, it would be easiest to transform our cells containing the mTaz-sensing and fluorescence reporter system with one of the existing systems. However a light dependent kill-switch would be most efficient and in this case elegant. Given that exposure to light of 495 nm induces fluorescence of the reporter system, light exposure could also induce a light dependent kill-switch. Therefore the device would be inactivated directly after measurement and usage - providing a biosafe waste disposal of the used device.

KUAS_Korea,2017,Team:KUAS Korea#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"_Korea concluded that the top priority is to communicate with the domestic academia especially with current and young-future science professionals. In order to promote a discourse and interest, we have opened an open seminar (see Human Practice; Open Seminar) to attract attention from undergraduate students, and distributed the translated report - New directions; The ethics of Synthetic Biology and emerging technologies - to student councils in Division of life science and biotechnology of major colleges in Korea.
This report is the U.S. presidential report, which covers from the general concept of synthetic biology and its emerging concerns to 18 major recommendations of the presidential commission. This original text was published in 2010, and has been the fundamental guideline to science policy makers, bio-industrialists, researchers, and every people interested and related to synthetic biology in the U.S.. The report has been translated last year and distributed this year with further modification.
Alongside with the distribution to young-future science researchers, we have distributed the report and translated and analyzed materials, international GMM related laws and regulations (see Collaboration; Manchester), to the Environment and Science Committee members of the Congress. We anticipate that this resource can acknowledge the members of the committee the importance of newly emerging field and open the discourse in a legislation manner."

Requirement for Additional Personnel
With a core group of individuals identified to lead the company through it's early development, it was additionally important to determine what positions our company would need in order to have success.  While our present group has a detailed technical background, we lacked the business and legal framework required to achieve success within the company.  We identified the most critical components of our business could be grouped into four key divisions listed below:
While many of these positions are not of critical importance within an early start-up framework, our group aims to bring on players with key skill sets in all four of these major divisions of our company. Achieving an advisory board (detailed below) of strong players with technical, business, and legal expertise has been our first step in bringing the right people into our company. The evolution of our team will occur as skill sets are needed, identifying business and technical experts to aid in engineering and prototype development of our system and in financial recording and accounting.

Human Practices
We consider Human practices to be one of the most important and rewarding things about iGEM.  During our project we gain a bigger perspective on synthetic biology, its importance and its impact on society. Our goal was to spread the knowledge not only about synthetic biology, but especially about our project antibiotic resistance in general. We can't fight this battle alone.
Antibiotic resistance involves people all over the globe, and it is impossible to decrease the trend without as many as people being involved. We have been in touch with several experts in the field and we have held many lectures about our project to other students, from secondary school pupils to master students. We have appeared several newspapers, attended a science festival, got interviewed for a TV-show, been in magazines and even on the radio.
You can read more about our work under Education, Public engagement and Integrated practices. We have learned so much while doing this and we have met so many interesting people on the way. Most important of all; it has been so much fun!
Education
Increasing knowledge for primary and secondary school pupils
The 27th and the 28th of September ""Ungforsk"" was arranged at the University. ""Ungforsk"" roughly translated means young science and was arranged for the 20th time. Secondary school pupils get to visit the University were they can visit labs and learn more about science. We were so lucky that we got to hold a total of six presentations for those who came to visit. Ragnhild, Paul, Marthe and Torleif held those seminars, and they did a really good job.
Torleif also handed out our comic book to Dokka VGS, the high school in the municipality of Nordre Land. Let's hope they'll get more excited about synthetic biology.
Increasing knowledge for new students at the university
The 30th of August and the 6th of September we held lectures for new biology students at the University. In addition to spreading the word about iGEM, we presented our project and told the new students of the problem of antibiotic resistance. We held three lectures each day and six in total. The students seemed very interested about iGEM, so we hope next years team will have loads of interested students. Marthe, Hans, Paul and Camilla held"

This GFP was designed as one of five variants we optimized at the codon level using different criteria in order to develop a novel method for codon optimization.  Traditional methods of codon optimization rely primarily on the distinction between degenerate codons that are common throughout the entire genome of E. coli and those that are rare. This GFP was optimized instead using only degenerate codons that are more frequent in higher translation initiation regions of the genome, ie fast codons. This criterion is based on the results of a recent project in which all the coding DNA sequences of E. coli are divided into five groups based on the naturally occurring TIR, from lowest to highest. Then, the codon usage profile of each group of genes is statistically analyzed to determine whether a codon is slow or fast. A fast codon is defined as one with high correlation between TIR and its frequency. Otherwise, it is a slow codon.   Ng, C. Y., Farasat, I., Zomorrodi, A. R., Maranas, C. D. & Salis, H. M. Model-guided construction and optimization of synthetic metabolism for chemical product synthesis. Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center Spring Retreat (2013), Berkeley, CA. It is hypothesized that the groups of CDS with high TIR will hold more “fast” codons, which will lead to higher translation elongation rate and thus higher protein expression, whereas the slow regions will hold more “slow” codons leading to lower expression.
Codons whose frequency increases with TIR are defined as fast codons. Those with declining frequency in relation to TIR are slow codons, and those with no correlation are defined as independent of TIR. This can be viewed in the figure above as the slope of the graphs for each codon showing ratio and TIR. If ratio increases with TIR, the codon is fast, and the graph displays positive slope. Slow codons slow negative slope, and TIR independent codons show essentially no slope.

Demonstration
Team NYMU Taipei this year accentuates on the enhancement of oil accumulation in microalgae through genetic manipulation and stress condition cultivation. Several achievements and criteria have been attained during this long odyssey. The followings are brief results of our project:
(1) A well-documented microalgae transformation platform has been created
We have constructed a backbone, pPIGBACK, particularly compatible for microalgae to transform foreign genes into the cell by triggering gene double-crossover homologous recombination. CRTZ gene has been successfully transformed into microalgae and sparked a cascade of chemical reaction to produce Zeaxanthin. Moreover, the transformation accuracy is 52%, which clearly points out the roaring success of the construction. The appearance of the transformants are significantly different from that of the wild-type.
See more detail: Pigments - Conclusion
(2) High-affinity protein NrtA system combined with suicide mechanism has been successfully implemented
NrtA gene is extracted from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and transformed into E. coli for mass production of the high-affinity protein. Combined with semi-permeable and protein extraction system, the amount of nitrate and nitrite in the microalgae medium has declined, which has firmly proved our concept. The concept is further applicable to our nitrogen starvation plan.
Taking biosafety under consideration, an inducible suicide mechanism based on the combination of endolysin and holing has been constructed and undergone a functional test. The suicide mechanism has been proved valid by a cooperative functional test conducted by team TAS Taipei and us.
See more detail: Nitrogen Starvation - Suicide Mechanism Functional Test

Several modeling,"
Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#HP#Future_-_-_TEXT.html," after the interview we had at the Groninger Archives; Jan Jaap Hoogstins,    collection manager from the Groninger Archieven, explained us that now    most of the documents are being changed from analogous data storage to    digital data storage, and one of two most important things that a    storage system must fulfil is the durability, which means that the information    stored must be conserved for a long period of time.
Spores of Bacillus subtilis are a reliable    option since they have shown its long-term resistance.    Actually, in 2000, a spore-forming Bacillus strain was    isolated from a 250 million years old salt crystals. Moreover, DNA itself is a    more stable data storage medium when compared to magnetic and optical    medial, because it can remain intact for at least 700 000 years at    -4˚C. [3] Even in harsh    environments, DNA has a half-life of over 500 years. [4] Contrastly, current magnetic storers of    information have lasts at most 30 years. [5]
However, is the DNA that contains the encrypted information in bacteria able to mutate through this period of time?
A complete discussion about mutation in Bacillus subtilis spores can be found in the Modelling Section .
A complete movie has been successfully stored in DNA
Third fictional scenario
This fictional and extreme scenario provides an example of the    future applications of CryptoGErM based on the current files and    archives that have been stored successfully in DNA.
Currently, big companies such as Microsoft® have shown interest in the    storage of information in DNA. This gives us an idea that DNA storing    has started to become one of the most promising methods to store    information in the upcoming years. This is mainly given by the capacity of    storage that DNA posses; Church, Gao and Kosuri showed that 0.5    exabytes of information can be stored per gram of single-stranded    DNA. [6]
A big breakthrough happened in April 2016, when Microsoft published an extensive    paper in a joint project with the University of Washington [7] in which they explore the    potential application for the use of DNA as storage medium.    According to this work, DNA storage has a higher    durability in comparison with current systems. Within the applications    of storing information in DNA, this group stored in a DNA sequence and    recovered succesfully three images that originally were in JPEG format.    This shows that nowadays, it is not only possible to store text and    information as we did in CryptoGEr"

Modelling
Introduction Basic Phage Activators Extended Systems Modelling Basics References
Introduction
Our initial work was based around creation of a system that allows switching on of output at different calibrated input signal levels. Creating a model allows the feasibility of the proposed systems to be tested. A basic model of the original amplifier system was put forward, building on both our data and the Cambridge 2007 data.
Modelling the phage activator system
This is the basic 'amplifier' system that consists of an input sensitive promoter system,a protein activator and sensitive promoter. It can therefore be divided into two boxes, the approach taken in putting forward an initial model.
The pBAD promoter
An arabinose input acts as an inducer, permitting transcription, by binding the AraC transcription factor. This is a dual transcription factor; when unbound to arabinose a dimer restricts access of polymersase to reduce basal levels of transcription, upon binding arabinose the conformation changes and the dimer permits binding of polymerase. [1]
To model this situation, araC is first assumed to take the role of a repressor that reversibly binds and unbinds a site on the DNA. If it binds arabinose, it is sequestered and cannot bind the DNA. Here, an input function is created, after Alon [2] . This gives the rate of transcription from the promoter dependent on the concentration of arabinose. Since mRNA is then translated at a roughly constant rate, it is related with a multiplicative constant to the rate of protein production, in this case activator and RFP.
This gives the rate of transcription as a function of X* which represents the concentration of active repressor, unbound to arabinose. B is the maximum rate of transcription, here this rate is when induced by arabinose at highest concentration. K_d"

Objectives
One of our major objectives for this presentation was to show to students the biology from                 a new point of view and to speak with them about the fun, the goals, the perspectives and the                 limits of this science. Moreover, we wanted to do a presentation to high schooler to help                 them discover a new domain of application of biology, the synthetic biology with concretes examples                 of its application. Also, it was a great occasion for us to present our project softer shock and the IGEM competition.

Our presentation was cut into three different parts, the first one is to help them discover               what is synthetic biology with example of its applications and concretes examples of modified organism               for each application. In a second time, we warned them about the limits of the synthetic biology for the               human health, on the biodiversity, ethics, and what the law permits us to do. In the other hand, we also               spoke about the perspectives of synthetic biology. Finally, we present the iGEM competition and our project.               To stimulate them, we also challenged them with question about their general knowledge on biology and their logic               on synthetic biology.
The card game
To help students have a better understanding of synthetic biology, we created a card game with simple rules:
Make teams of 4-6 members.
Pick 3 green cards representing organisms.
Pick 3 yellow cards representing DNA vector.
Finally pick 1 red card"

Checking concentration of the dope from last Thursday
We aliquoted 100 uL to check the dry weight
11 mg in 100 uL
that's 11% wt/vol... which decreased
In addition, the dope has started gelling at the bottom of the tube
I think the dope is a lost cause. We'll have to do a new concentration dialysis.
Preparing HFIP dope
75 mg lyophilized silk in 268 uL of HFIP for a 28% w/v dope
Our procedure for dissolving the dope DIRECTLY IN THE SYRINGE
Prepare a tube apparatus with a tube that was already clogged. This will serve as the syringe ""stopper."" Add the stopper to the syringe luer lock
Cut the lyophilized silk into small pieces
Place the silk pieces into the syringe
pipette in the HFIP volume
Dip the plunger tip into HFIP
insert the plunger into the syringe body
invert the syringe, then push the plunger to purge some of the dead air. Ensure that ALL silk pieces are covered by the HFIP
Wait for HFIP to dissolve the silk. Periodically remove the stopper. This will allow bubbles to form and escape.
Some of our observations on this protocol:
push silk to the bottom of the syringe as you add the pieces. DON'T let the silk get densely packed!
cut the silk into the smallest pieces that you can
Don't drop any pieces!"

What we show in our project is only the tip of the whole iceberg. More possible applications of halorhodopin could benefit not only synthetic biology but also the human society. Here we propose several more advanced applications of halorhodopsin.
Halorhodopsin could facilitate light detection and light-coupled inter-cell signal transduction. Light signal could be converted to intracellular chloride level signal, which thus induces Pgad downstream genes. The target genes could be constructed to accelerate the synthesis pathway of quorum sensing signals, such as N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHL)1. As a result, one clone of bacteria could be designed as light detector, amplifying and converting light signal to quorum signal to cooperate with other clones of bacteria.
Moreover, halorhodopsin is not the only channel that couples light to pump ions. There are other ion channels from retinylidene protein family sharing similar sequences and structures but pumping other ions using light, such as bacteriorhodopsin pumping proton ions out of cells2 and channelrhodopsin non-specifically pumping cations into cells3. Combining pH sensitive promoter4 with bacteriorhodopsin and osmolality sensitive promoters (OmpF, developed by iGEM08_NYMU-Taipei in 2008) with channelrhodopsin,   the light-coupled expression platform can be extended to more accurate and more complex regulation, which facilitates bacteria being more programmable by computer.
Together with channelrhodopsin, halorhodopsin also enables water desalination utilizing solar energy. Sea water desalination has long been attractive and difficult to implement efficiently. E. coli which can express halorhodopsin and channelrhodopsin could be one promising way to solve this problem. It is possible to drive E. coli to capture various ions (mainly sodium ions, potassium ions and chloride ions) in sea water and move these ions away by controlling the movement of E. coli. By this means sea water could be desalinated for drinking, irrigation or other daily usage.
In conclusion, halorhodopsin could fulfill the need of utilizing light as signal or energy resource. We believe"

Counting aphids on day 10
We count the aphids for a second time to allow the second generation to develop. This way we investigate whether MeS has an effect on the aphid’s behaviour. That they are encouraged to leave the plant, reproduce less or generate mobile (flying) aphids.
The head of the plant is where the majority of the secondary metabolites gather; hence we expect to see an effect on the distribution of the aphid population.
Aphid mobility experiment
Aim: To determine the effect of EBF on aphid mobility.
Experimental setup: Leaves infested with aphids were divided in two glass containers (not sealed) randomly (n=3; 3 leaves per group). After 1h plates with bacteria, either control (BL21) or BL21 with EBF construct, were put under each leaf.
Measurement: Aphids that were on the top of each leaf were counted at start and at each time point during the experiment.
At each time point the amount of aphids moving on the leaf were also counted. The time points used were 0, 50, 150 and 200 minutes.

How to fabricate
After studying existing papers about the processing technology typically used in microfluidics chips production, and endless trial-and-error, we have formed our own processing protocol based on our equipments and requirements. The microfluidics chips used in our project were all produced using this protocol (Fig. 5).
Process Overview
SU-8 Photoresist can cross-link to a network of polymer when exposed to short wavelength light. If the cross-linked network has formed, it cannot be dissolved by the SU-8 developer. So if we place a photo mask to shade the light shined on the photoresist, we can make a copy of the pattern on the photo mask.
Both PDMS and glass contain silicon element. When they were treated by oxygen plasma, unstable hydroxyl group will form on the treated surface. When they get close enough, two hydroxyl group will dehydrate and bond together covalently.

Sound Stimulation Devices
Acoustic Devices
Various devices generating frequencies from 300Hz to 1.7MHz were made to identify the most sensitive acoustic parameters for MS channels. The cytotoxic experiment of each device is determined from cell proliferation experiments with sound generator dipping into culture medium.
Audible Frequency
Audible sound is defined as 20Hz to 20kHz sound wave. We designed modulated devices to generate audile signals to stimulate cells. Three kinds of sound generators were used for generateing audible sonic stimulation. Each one has its specific range of frequency and power, as shown in the following table.

The signal was generated by a signal generator. After magnified by an amplifier, the signal was sent to a sound generator, which can be buzzer, balanced armature or speaker. As all of the three sound generators showed cell toxicity in some extent, sound generators were kept outside the cell dish and sonic stimulation was transmitted by air or polysterine plastics. Each one has its specific range of frequency and power which are shown in the following table.

OMEGA is a work-in-progress with many remaining challenges, but the goals are of critical importance: sustainable energy, water and food availability, and minimization of our environmental impact.
Interview:
As an expert of the technological use of sea, we contacted him to have his opinion about our project, and discuss about its feasibility and the challenges it will face.    He showed great interest in our project and gave us some clues about the needs our directed evolution tool could answer, such as:
Allow in increased resistance to temperature, with the goal to improve the growth of microalgae.
Better the abilities of Chlamydomonas to produce of Omega 3.
Create an enzyme to  digest cell walls to ameliorate extraction procedures
Set up a selection system so that we would not have to worry about contaminations
The creation of a strain of microalgae able to grow in ""semi-salty"" waters used in some purification wastewater treatment station.
The production of molecules of interest in chlamydomonas, for example heat shock proteins
What we learnt and how we used it:
From our discussion about the molecules of interest to produce and about the potential of our retrotransposon, we focused and deepened our work on our biological design. Moreover, he gave us some contacts of people he previously worked with and would also like to stay in touch with us after the iGEM competition. We are both excited for possible collaborations in the future.
Stéphane Lemaire
Stéphane Lemaire: Dr Stephane Lemaire works at CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique). He’s studying Calvin’s cycle in microalgae and Chlamydomonas.
Interview:
We worked in his lab this summer. He has been very interested in our project. As we were concerned about the biocontainment system, we talked with him about a biocontainment system based on a non-natural amino acid.
What we learnt and how we used it:
Even though the idea was very interesting, it was complicated to realize it in a one year competition. Indeed, it would have needed to recode a codon, recode RNA transferase, etc … Otherwise, we will of course keep this meeting in mind and consider the ideas raised for a potential further development of our project.

Those activities included free debate about the better research method of synthetic biology, “Quiz King” (synthetic biology Q&A competition), and iGEM life salon.
It is worth mentioning that, before the conference, many attendees were under great pressure of doing experiment and other preparation for the Jamboree. During the conference, this pressure might even be deepened by listening to other teams’ presentations and, possibly, the terrible weather condition in Wuhan. But these fun activities significantly expelled the worried looks on attendees’ faces. Especially in the final part of iGEM life salon, Professor Chen Wenliang from NCTU_Formosa shared his idea of “enjoy science”. He reminded us that whether win a medal or not was not important comparing to whether you had fun in this experience. It was more convincing with a positive attitude and a smile on your face to show the judge that you had benefited a lot from this experience. And with this attitude, it wouldn’t be hard at all to fulfill the project and claim a medal. All the attendees were deeply moved by this idea and the true meaning of iGEM become clear to us. This conference was really a “cheer-up” for us as both host and also for all the attendees. It gave us inspirations on changing perspective in our work both inside and outside the lab.
Meetup with NWPU
NWPU is a new-found iGEM team this year. We had a small meetup with them on May 22th and shared our experience in team organizing, training, project preparing and some tips on attending the Giant Jamboree abroad.
Three-school iGEM Conference in Wuhan
After the frequent communications and collaboration last year, we had established Wuhan iGEM Committee with HAZU-China and WHU-China. Earlier this year, on April 17th, members from the three teams met together at HUST. We exchanged our preliminary ideas of our 2016 project and discussed the matters on interlab collaboration among three teams."

UAlberta,2018,Team:UAlberta#BeeLab_-_-_TEXT.html,"Solvent System (80 uM) and Solvent System in sugar-water without PPIX.
We controlled for the solvent system in which our store-bought PPIX was prepared by introducing it into the sugar water solution, such as not to mistakenly attribute the possible action of the solvent system to PPIX’s therapeutic capability, as this might skew our results.
After ten days, honeybees were collected for spore counting according to the procedure described below. Spore load in healthy and infected bees treated with PPIX were compared to that of the sugar water-only control groups. It was hypothesized that the PPIX treatment would lead to a significant reduction in spore load, ultimately protecting the infected from the detrimental effects of Nosema infections.
Results
Figure 9: Displayed are the spore counts per honeybee for each treatment group determined using a hemocytometer. PPIX-treated Nosema-infected bees show a statistically significant difference in final spore load as compared to its untreated counterpart.
As our results will show, the PPIX-treated group experienced a significant decrease in the spore load.  Our results indicate that the spore load was unaffected by the solvent system alone,  and thus the significant decrease in spore load is due to the action of PPIX alone. In fact, when comparing treated Nosema-infected groups treated with PPIX to the healthy, untreated controls, there was no significant difference in spore count. These results, within the scope of this preliminary experiment, demonstrate a definitive reduction in spore count as a function of our novel porphyrin treatment.
Experiment 4: Will PPIX negatively affect the health or longevity of the bees?
After finding that our therapy was capable of reducing spore load, we had to make sure that extended treatment was fully helping the bees in the long term as opposed to ultimately hurting them. To test whether increased concentrations of PPIX affects bee longevity or health, we designed a PPIX toxicity time course study for the duration of 18 days. We fed Nosema-infected and healthy honeybees with sugar-water supplemented with PPIX 80 uM. Bee death was recorded daily, such that a mortality trend could be observed. It was hypothesized that PPIX would not have a negative health effect on infected bees or healthy bees. This hypothesis was based on a previous study which used a chemically synthesized PPIX derivative and demonstrated that porphyrin-based treatments had no negative effects on bee longevity or behaviour [8].
Results
This experiment has recently been completed, though the data analysis remains to be completed.
That said, given the therapeutic effects observed"

ABBY BELL
Abby Bell is the sweetest person to ever bless the iGEM team. It’s easy to get cocky, being so smart and capable, but Abby could not be more humble and welcoming. Not only is she confident in her ability, but she also uses that confidence and kindness to lift up others. Abby never fails to be exceedingly thoughtful, going the extra mile to make her peers feel valued and appreciated. And it is this trait, just as much as her inquisitive intelligence and mad wet lab skills, that makes her such an asset to the Lambert iGEM team and the world as a whole.
GAURAV BYAGATHAVALLI

Not only is he willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish the tasks in front of him, he is also the most passionate person you will ever meet. Aside from his intimidating side, Gaurav is truly a genuine, caring person that pushes his friends and family to be the best possible person they can be. Lastly, his love for Khalid, the color Red, and his addiction to coffee are a close second to his love for science and all of its endless capabilities.

Heidelberg,2010,Team:Heidelberg#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," predict its results. It is the appropriate strategy to model complex processes and it is able to learn from experience. Neural Networks generally require a big amount of data to be fully trained. Even though the experimental data was limiting, the results agree with the experimental values and the model was able to determine the importance of the bulge size for knockdown.
The Fuzzy Logic Model is combining the strength of intuitive integration of prior knowledge with a sophisticated Global Genetic optimization Algorithm. After training the model, it was able to reproduce the experimental data, especially the correlation in a 3-dimensional space of the AU content score and 3' pairing score to the knockdown percentage.
To create our informatic tool to support the project, we looked at the problem from three different perspectives:
- Adjustment of gene expression in specific tissues.
- Tuning expression level accurately.
- Predefine a construct to be used.
These three paths were the inspiration behind creating miBEAT (miRNA Binding Site Engineering and Assembly Tool), to provide a strategy which makes possible to control the expression of genes in a specific way between tissues.
To make this work, we tried to match the functionalities of the tool to our experimental project. Additionally, we provided a strategy that guides the user through the cloning process and allows them to use characterized standard parts sent to the MIT parts registry.
Our complete work is present in the form of a graphical user interface called miBEAT . This tool combines and connects the output of the different models and scripts and then generates a suitable miTuner construct that will express the gene of interest, miGENE, up or down to the desired level. miBEAT consists of three subparts; miRockdown, miBS designer and mUTING.
miRockdown is the subpart which contains two computational models that work on different concepts: Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic plus the experimentally obtained data.  The models are sequentially associated with a script based on Target Scan algorithm. miRockdown takes as an input the desired knockdown percentage and the sequence of shRNAmir and gives out binding site parameters that are then compared with model predictions to finally generate the appropriate binding site.
miBS designer is available as a stand alone for generating customized binding sites, but a modified version of it is also a part of miBEAT, in charge of generating more than 2000 different binding sites for every miRNA sequences, following more than 135 combinations of regions.
mUTING provides the tissue specific targeting function to the GUI. It uses literature data for miRNA expression in various tissues and can output miRNA binding sites that could be used to differentiate between"
UT-Tokyo-Software,2012,Team:UT-Tokyo-Software#Project#BioBrickSearch_-_-_TEXT.html,"elasticsearch can handle complex queries on structured data quickly and this characteristic of elasticsearch allowed us to build a sophisticated and responsive search tool.
Sorting Criteria
Sorting criteria for BioBrick search results are the most important part of this tool as it has great impact on the usability of the software. In designing sorting criteria for BioBrick Search, we decided that the features of a part that users most frequently consider in determining which BioBrick parts to use are:
Reliability of the part (Will this BioBrick work?)
Relevance (How relevant is this BioBrick to your query?)
Popularity of the part (How many teams have used this BioBrick?)
Reliability is computed from 3 entries (part_results (whether the BioBrick works or not), part_status (whether the BioBrick is available or not), best_quality (whether the nucleotide sequence of BioBrick is confirmed or not)) on the data obtained from partsregistry.org API.
We quantified the reliability of each parts in 5 grades, from 1 to 5 (higher is better). The code (in Python) used to score the parts is shown below.
pos = neg = 0 if part['part_results'] == 'Fails': neg += 2 elif part['part_results'] == 'Issues': neg += 1 elif part['part_results'] == 'Works': pos += 1 if part['part_status'] == 'Available': pos += 1 if part['best_quality'] == 'Confirmed': pos += 1 elif part['best_quality'] == 'Questionable': neg += 1 elif part['best_quality'] == 'Bad Sequencing': neg += 2  if pos >= 3 and neg == 0: return 5 elif pos >= 2 and neg == 0: return 4 elif pos - neg > 0: return 3 elif pos - neg == 0: return 2 elif pos < neg: return 1
Relevance is a measure of how relevant  a BioBrick is to your query. This score is automatically computed by elasticsearch.
Popularity is a measure of how many teams have used the BioBrick. We counted the number of teams that submitted a part that (directly or indirectly) contains the specific BioBrick and used the logarithm of this number as the ""popularity"" score.
The search results are ordered according to the product of these 3 scores.
3. User-Experience
In designing the BioBrick Search software, we saw to it that users can intuitively and comfortably use this tool."

S: The settlers you talk about are long gone. In this age we can all come to see each other as fellow human, as travelers in this myriad existence. Perhaps you do not fear to lose our ways and traditions. The ties that bind us as a community will not fade, father. This I will not lose, you have taught me to honor these sacred ties. These bonds can only grow if we open ourselves to the right people. The new settlers believe in fixing the damage they did, as if it were their duty. This is their spirituality! They are not as different from us as their fathers were. Everything is changing, Father, and as you said, change is inevitable. Many others from our community have the same hopes for the future as I do. We hope to give our families the ability to choose their own path. We hope to let our children grow as members of a larger community. We hope to provide them with whatever they desire.
F: Son, many have stood in your place and joined the settler’s societies. And I have seen it erode their character. Where once they sought contentment with oneself and harmony with one another, it is instead filled with emptiness. Emptiness that digs itself deeper the more they fill themselves with material wealth. And the emptier they find themselves, the emptier they feel towards their fellow man. As a bundle is unbreakable together, but a stick just as easily snaps on its own, I fear you will fall to this.
S: Dad, I know myself well. I know who I am and where I am from. I will carry this knowledge with me and I will not falter. But I must choose my own way through this life. I cannot be a continuation of yourself, and your father, and your forefathers. I do recall a poem I once read “your children are not your children, they are the sons and daughters of life’s longing for itself, you may give them your love but not your thoughts, you may house their bodies but not their souls, for their souls will dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit.”
S: But we will not forget our culture. Change is modification, not deletion. We will continue to guard our land as zealously as you have. With the new technologies of the settlers, we will form new traditions to reflect our changing world. This is still OUR land!

He suggested we could use a tube with a preservative in its lid that is only released upon closing the tube. The tube could then be sent out via post to an individual to provide a saliva or urine sample, and could be posted back to a centralized lab for processing. For blood, there would be localized centers for tests (or just GP centers) and one main processing lab.
He also recommended using a multiplexing assay to detect multiple different miRNAs simultaneously from the same sample. However, at the time we had only designed one series of switches which would be activated by homologs. For a multiplexing assay, cross-hybridization levels need to be minimal - so we knew we had to think about new ways to design our switches. Our second series of switches, designed after talking with iGEM EPFL, were designed to solve this problem.
Professor Lovat’s team at UCL also helped us choose the best pieces of equipment for miRNA extraction which helped us with our cost analysis . We also discussed carrying out miRNA extractions in the field with them, as well as automation of the miRNA extraction protocol.
Sensitivity and Specificity
Professor Lovat and Dr Desai were concerned about the specificity and sensitivity of our test, and how it would be used for screening.
There are two types of sensitivity and specificity:
In terms of the toehold switch, sensitivity is the lowest number of miRNAs that can be detected and specificity is whether only the target miRNA can activate the switch. The feedback of doctors prompted us to seek out the advice of iGEM EPFL, to create the second generation switches with massively superior specificity.
In terms of a screening tool, sensitivity relates to the false negative rate, while specificity relates to the false positive rate.
A 100% sensitive test will always pick up the disease but may also pick up patients that do not have the disease (no false negatives).
A 100% specific test will never pick up healthy patients but may also miss patients that do have the disease (no false positives).
High Sensitivity

What is ‘programmable‘?
Logic, which tends to be presented in the form of truth tables, shows a relationship between inputs and outputs. Below are the truth tables of the two basic gates: the And gate and the Or gate. So we quickly find the difference lies in the outputs when only one of the inputs is true. In the And gate if there are only one true input, either A or B, the output is false. But in the Or gate it’s to the contrary. So if we can control the output when only one input is true, we can successfully make the switch between the And gate and the Or gate, which can be called a programmable device.

How we make it happen?
We accomplish the design of the switch between the two gates with the help of the site-specific recombination system. Cre-Lox system is a typical kind of site-specific recombination system. The system consists of two components: Cre recombinase and LoxP site. It is a site-specific recombinase technology widely used to carry out excisions, insertions, translocations and inversions in the DNA of cells. It allows the DNA modification targeted to a specific cell type or be triggered by a specific external stimulus. We make use of the cre-lox site-specific system to accomplish the inversions in the DNA. When the external stimulus comes, the Cre recombinase will be expressed and then flip the sequence between the two LoxP sites.
After the flip, the direction of the signal stream is altered, which results in changes of logic on the physical layer. Through controlling the direction of the signal stream we can achieve our goal to make a logic-flexible device. Now let"

ABSTRACT
Promoters are the key regulators of gene expression. Possessing promoters which are active under a desired condition, at a desired strength and in a specified tissue is of great value for Plant Biotechnology, Gene Therapy and fundamental research in Bioscience. Therefore, it has become a desire to synthetically construct promoters responsive to a variety of pathways. We explore two ways to the synthesis of promoters: On one hand, we have developed a bioinformatical model and database (HEARTBEAT) describing the structure of promoters responsive to user-defined inputs. On the other hand, we have developed a biochemical method for the synthesis of randomized promoter libraries. Using this method, we have created a library of constitutive promoters of varying strength. Also, we have created libraries of promoters putatively responsive to a variety of pathways. We have screened these libraries for functional, pathway responsive promoters and present a detailed characterization of a NF-κB responsive promoter of our making. We finally discuss ways to combine randomized biochemical synthesis and bioinformatical modeling to propose a method towards the generation of promoters of complex regulation (i.e. by multiple pathways).

NTU-Singapore,2016,Team:NTU-Singapore#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," order to have fair comparisons, all 5 Cas9/Cpf1 are targeted to the same target sequence. We further tested the HDR efficiency of the Cas9 and Cpf1 with ssODN (single-stranded donor oligonucleotides).
Project Evolution
62% of the public we surveyed during our exhibition on Aug 5 and 6 expressed interest in using CRISPR/Cas9 to cure diseases such as cancer in the future, but they are also concerned about the potential risks/side effects associated with this technology due to the relatively low efficiency of the current CRISPR/Cas system. We were then highly motivated by the popular demand from the general public and brainstormed the possible methods to improve the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas technology in human cells.
In order to improve the efficiency of the system, one of the methods that our team proposed is to use directed evolution to screen for more efficient SpCas9 variants in cleaving DNA. By comparing the cleaving efficiency of the SpCas9 variants and wild type SpCas9, we can prove that the cleaving efficiency of the selected mutant(s) is better than the wild type, and hence can be used to improve the CRISPR/Cas9 system.
In order to achieve this, firstly, random mutagenesis was conducted on the RuvCII-HNH-RuvCIII nuclease domain (Addgene plasmid BPK746 #65767. BPK764 was a gift from Keith Joung)2 to generate libraries of mutants. We used Genemorph II EZClone domain mutagenesis kit (Agilent Scientific)3 to generate SpCas9 variants . A few colonies were randomly selected to assess the mutation rate of the mutagenesis kit and thus determine whether the mutants generated can be used. All colonies were then pooled together and the mutated plasmids were extracted (named EZ). A few libraries of EZ plasmids (each library contains at least 1000 colonies) were generated and subjected to the screening process.
Following this, competition assay was conducted to isolate more efficient SpCas9 variants. Both the EZ plasmids and wild type::M13F (SpCas9WT::M13F) plasmid were introduced into BL21(DE3) that carries the selection plasmid, BBa_K2130004. The M13F sequence was introduced into the plasmid backbone of SpCas9WT, which allows us to differentiate the EZ plasmids from the WT plasmid via colony PCR. As we perform iterative rounds of competition assays, a few colonies were sequenced"

Preparation for competence and Transformation of G. xylinus
Preparation of electro-competent G,xylinus cells(Imperial)
If the goal of transformation is to produce cellulose-producing transformed G.xylinus, use regular HS media for culturing. If cellulose production after transformation is not primary and speed is required, HS-cellulase medium can be used. Usage of HS-cellulase medium during growth results in the formation of a higher number of cellulose negative mutants, but results in much higher transformation efficiencies, and requires less time. Even with HS-cellulose medium, cellulose producing colonies can be identified on the plate after transformation, as cellulose-producing colonies differ in morphology from cellulose non-producing colonies (see section Gluconacetobacter for images of colony morphology).

Procedure: To prepare the 1% and 20% Oxalic Acid concentrations, solid oxalic acid was weighed for a solution of 50 mL. 0.5 g of oxalic acid was weighed out and placed in a 50 mL falcon tube. 50 mL of d2H¬2O was added to the falcon tube to dissolve the oxalic acid and  create the 1% Oxalic Acid concentration. Two falcon tubes of 1% Oxalic Acid was prepared.
10 g of oxalic acid was then weighed and dissolved in 50 mL of d2H¬2O in a 50 mL falcon tube for the 20% oxalic acid concentration. The 50 mL of 20% oxalic acid was then placed in the 60˚C oven to help dissolve the oxalic acid.
In addition 1 M H2SO4 was created using stock 5 M for the Wieden Lab. Both the 1 M H2SO4 and 1% oxalic acid were stored in the 4˚C fridge in E770.

Hong_Kong-CUHK,2010,Team:Hong Kong-CUHK#Project ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," gave the Allies army enough time to defeat Hitler’s army. However, it was just an example that a person with a moral mind can override the curiosity of research. When we develop synthetic biology, there is a chance to transform the new system into designated biological weapons if people develop a lethal and functional machine using living organisms. It will eventually become the terminator of human beings. Based on the example and the future potential situation stated above, we need to ask ourselves one question: should curiosity override our moral rights?
Own knowledge? Own money
The current trend regard synthetic biology as intellectual property rights is increasing, prompting one to think not in terms of the universality of science but rather the one who owns it and the reason for it. With so much funding given to a research institute, there are lots of DNA sequences with studied functions being patented. Now this is the question, who is benefited from it? The research institute or the public? The DNA sequence representing a specific function in living organisms is patented. It is similar to patent an organism in another way. In this case, even if people share the knowledge (the DNA sequence related to the function), they still own it as we need to pay for it when we need to use that sequence, even though they can be found naturally. The ultimate benefit bearer is not the public. The public is cheated by millions of shared data passing around every day and still think they have the right to use it freely. Without doubt, this will bring an ethic question: Can we practise the knowledge we have gained? Can we use the DNA sequence  after learning without paying for it?

23-09-2010 Maya Repressor group
Today we got the proof that the plasmids pSLD20 and pSLD22 have been mixed up during O/N or miniprep. This means that the plates we have in the fridge are correct, but that the plasmids are swapped in the glycerol stock. We haven't corrected the naming, but will do that tomorrow.
Annemi and I spend most of the afternoon talking to Sebastien about the problems we have had with the colony PCR and also with the background we got when we did the transformations. As the colony PCR Annemi did yesterday didn't work, Sebastien advised us to do the PCR on the purified plasmids. Therefore we started O/N, and tomorrow I'll do miniprep and a PCR.
Regarding the background we got when we transformed the ligated plasmids, Sebastien came up with several strategies to solve the problem. We talked about them at the meeting today, and they will also be written here in the log tomorrow or the day after.
22-09-2010 Annemi Repressor group
Colony PCR on transformations G1, G2, GR1, GR2. Same approach as Lisa did yesterday, however we marked the colonies this time:)
We used 3 different forward primers: IGR01 (for G1 and GR1), IGR04 (for G2 and GR2) IG201 (for all of the colonies). The same reverse primer IG202 was used in all of the reactions.
Result: only two bands appeared; one which corresponds to the size of amplified G1 and the other one to G2.
Questions: Why didn't the iGEM primers IG201 + IG202) amplify anything? Digested plasmid? Why did Lisa get so much more bands yesterday?
Restrictions:
GFP+rbs: cut with X+P
pSB4A5: cut with E+P
G1: cut with E+S
G2: cut with E+S
GR1: cut with E+S
GR2: cut with E+S
Ran a gel of restrictions. Didn't have enough time to study the picture in detail. However the bands do not look too concentrated.
Did a PCR clean-up -> working box tubes with white stickers provided with: date, DNA, RE-info, 'cleanup'

These two parts went after a constitutive promoter (BBa_J23119) and RBS (BBa_B0034). They were both assembled on pSB1C3 and then transformed into E. coli SE 2. The construction is shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4
The results indicated that these exogenous proteins were expressed successfully with little toxic effect on growth of the host bacteria. The expressed color shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6 were also desirable.

4.3 Yield green------combination of two chromoproteins
Green is a indispensable composition of a world map, and the changing process from green to yellow (Inland) as well as from green to blue (Coastal) are also important to mimic the effect of global warming. Inspired by Paris-Saclay igem team (2014), we combined a yellow chromoprotein and a blue chromoprotein to get green color.
Blue and yellow chromoproteins were designed to express simultaneously. Two different linking methods were illustrated in Figure 7. The reason why an extra promoter was added after the yellow chromoprotein was to increase the expression of blue chromoprotein. Additionally, it enabled us to respectively control to the expression of two chromoproteins. For instance, the green could turn to yellow by repressing the blue chropmoprotein.

The colony of BL21 (DE 3) was cultured in 4ml liquid medium for 5 hours, and induced by IPTG for 3 hours under 37 degree Celsius. The result was shown in figure 8. It was unexpected to see the final colors of the combination were blue and violent instead of green. A possible reason could be that the yellow color expressed here was not pure yellow. Without pictures kept, the colonies tended to be orange when grown on agar plate. That was why we decided to replace FwYellow chromoprotein with the backups.

As illustrated in DESIGN page, we constructed four working plasmids, including BBa_K2890005, BBa_K2890006, BBa_K2890007, BBa_K2890008 . Among them, the BBa_K2890005 part did not constructed successfully, but the other three did.
After formaldehyde-induced expression, it was found that BBa_K2890007 and BBa_K2890008 whose formaldehyde promoter is frmR had no obvious red fluorescent protein expression. The plasmid containing HxlR worked well and finally be selected as the working plasmid of our project (BBa_K2890006). The composition of subpart of BBa_K2890006 is shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1 Composition of part BBa_K2890006.
Methods:
The E.coli BL21 consisting of part BBa_K2890006 was as the TEST group, while the same strain E.coli containing eRFP gene was as the CONTROL group. The two groups were cultured at different concentrations of formaldehyde (0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4 mM) under 37 °C and sampled every four hours for OD600 and Fluorescence detection. Using LB medium (added 30μg/mL chloramphenicol) as blank control. 
Results and Discussion:
As shown in Figure 2a, we can clearly see in the growth curve that as the concentration of formaldehyde increases, the growth curve of the control group decreases significantly, and the growth of the transferred eRFP bacteria is inhibited when the formaldehyde concentration rises to 6.4 mM. On the other hand, the bacteria almost stopped growing. While, comparatively, the growth curve of TEST group is basically normal and, as the concentration of formaldehyde increases, gradually slows down. 
Compared the TEST group with CONTROL group, it is obviously revealed that the tolerance of bacteria to formaldehyde is spectacularly strengthened after adding this part (BBa_K2890006), which proves the degrading potential to formaldehyde.

This blue color again changed back to purple when put in the oven at 75 °C. The same sheet was then placed in the oven at 95-100 °C and the protein turned yellow.

The results depicted above are promising. Next week will be spent better characterizing the color change observed. Currently, the wetness of the concentrated protein is making it hard to evenly coat the cellulose paper with it. As can be seen in the pictures above, the protein color tends to be concentrated around the ridges of the droplets instead of being evenly coated. To address this, I have placed a thin strip of cellulose paper in a epindorph tube containing the concentrated protein at the bottom and left it close for the weekend to allow the color to saturate the paper as it is drawn up through capillary action. Another approach will be to freeze dry the extracted protein and rehydrate it in a extremely small"

Another idea to test this binding was provided by this year’s iGEM team of Bielefeld, which are also working with nanobodies. They send us a GFP-split-CFP on pSB1C3 vector and anti-GFP nanobody-split-CFP on pSB1K3 vector to verify the binding of our nanobody.  Unfortunately, we were not able to test with the split proteins we received from team Bielefeld due to time constraints.

Composite part Plan B (E. coli BL21):
This construct is optimized for E.coli BL21, it constitutes our “Plan B” for our psychobiotic, which consists of producing a soluble, mutated, gp80 attached to novel signal peptides for secretion to the media from E. coli BL21. The production of the mutated alpha chain receptor for IL-6 (gp80) will act as an antagonist protein, due to mutations, it will associate with IL-6 forming the IL-6-alphaReceptorgp80 complex but it will not bind with human gp130, thus inhibiting the formation of IL-6-alphaReceptorgp80-gp130 complex which leads to inflammation pathways [1].
The system is first regulated by a Pbad promoter, which allows to induce expression with L-arabinose of the nsrR repressor protein (of PyeaR promoter) and then regulate the expression of mutated gp80 with the PyeaR promoter, after it senses nitrosative stress. Reporter fluorescent proteins iLOV and M-Cherry will help us corroborate expression of both promoter systems. iLOV will be attached to the Pbad-nsrR system and M-Cherry to the PyeaR-Mutatedgp80 system. The mutated gp80 has a His-Tag (6 histidines) attached to it for purification purposes. It is also attached to a signal peptide for excretion into the media.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Ribosense#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," form of riboswitches. The rationale behind this decision is found on our Design process page, whilst the success of Ribosense can be found on our Results page.
Riboswitches have several advantages over traditional inducible promotors: firstly, they are usually modular in design, typically containing an aptamer (ligand binding) domain and an expression platform domain, which alters expression of downstream genes. Such a structure may allow for abstraction of discrete parts of each riboswitch, and construction of new regulatory elements with engineered properties that could be designed ""de novo"" using software tools (Although we may have to wait a little for such modelling capabilities to be realised). Secondly, if the expression platform acts by altering translational rate after transcription has finished, such devices may allow for faster respone times than those seen for current genetic devices, which can only alter transcriptional rates.
Our sensors
For more information on the biology of each of our parts, please see the links below.
Other Biosensors
We also aimed to use other biosensing parts that were pertinent to the topic of groundwater contamination and which were already available in the registry. Early thoughts of mercury and arsenic testing proved to be unfeasible within the time constraints as our laboratory does not usually handle these materials and so was not already equipped for their use.
Copper BBa_K190024 and Zinc BBa_K190022 inducible promoters were selected from the registry, as they seemed promising, with our focus on the copper part as this was labelled as 'working' by the original team Groningen_09 . We have sadly been unable to replicate this result through our work over the summer. The capacity of metal ions to induce these promoters is highly dependent on the heavy metal transporter protein BBa_K190018 , also used by Groningen_09.
One of our initial concerns was that the system may not be compatible with B.subtilis as it was designed in E.coli. Tests in both species were unfavourable however. After several weeks with little success we sent these biobricks to Source Bioscience Ltd for sequencing. While we can now confirm the sequences of the inducible promoters, we found sequencing inconsistencies in the transport protein. This experience has been added to the parts registry.
These inconsistencies seem to have rendered the protein non-functional, or at least sufficiently less functional, and time shortages prevented us from looking for an alternative. As such we have been unable to test the capacities of these biobricks in relation to our system.

Background
The upp gene from Bacillus subtilis W168 encodes for a Uracilphosphoribosyl transferase (UPRTase).  Its key reaction in uracil salvage is the reaction of a uracil molecule with a 5'-phosphoribosyl-a-1- pyrophosphate (PRPP) molecule, resulting in the formation of UMP. A second locus, the pyrR gene, encoding a second UPRTase has been identified. However it has been shown, that the UPRTase derived from pyrR locus has an influence on overall UPRTase activity of < 1 %. [1] This makes the upp-derived UPRTase the only physiologically relevant catalyst for UPRTase activity. Exposure to the pyrimidine analogue 5-Fluorouracil UPRTase results in production of 5-fluoro-dUMP, a very potent inhibitor of the thymidylate synthase (Neuhard, J. (1983) Utilization of preformed pyrimidine bases and nucleosides. In Metabolism of Nucleotides, Nucleosides and Nucleobases in Microorganisms. Munch- Petersen, A. (eds). New York: Academic Press, pp. 95– 148. ). As a result 5-FU is toxic to the Bacillus subtilis W168 strain. B. subtilis 5FU-resistant (5FUR) mutants selected on low drug concentration (10 mM 5FU) are UPRTase-defective. [2] . This has made upp a go to choice for negative selection in combination with an B. subtilis W168 Δupp strain. So far it has been used to make clean in-frame deletions and point mutations. [3]
However, to our knowledge, no application using upp for clean insertions has been established so far.
The I-SceI Restricition endonuclease has a highly specific recognition sequence of 18 nucleotides. No such sequence is present in the B.subtilis W168 strain. It creates a double strand break at targeted location, which leads to an increased rate of repair at the specific site. By this, the rate of homologous recombination is increased by a factor of 100.

NJAU_China,2015,Team:NJAU China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,", biological molecules are potential to be the great substitute for electrical elements in creating powerful bio-computer. Nowadays, people have attempted to use many biomaterials to construct basic logical gates such as nucleic acid, enzymes or other small molecules.
H
owever, one of the most difficult problems that limit computer development is about logical circuitry micromation. The physical elements of electrical circuitry could not smaller than 0.1 um. If scientists could construct nano-size materials through biological molecules, it is probably to create smaller but more powerful computer in the future.
N
owadays some researchers have proved that DNA can replace electrical elements to build the logical gates and realize logical operations, such as INHIBIT logical gate system based on DNase PW17 full of G and SET-RESET logical gate system.
I
n summary, molecular computer based on nucleic acid has made large achievements in the past 20 years. Because DNA could probably make nano-size molecular computer come true, bio-computer can have extraordinary parallel calculation ability. Though there still have some problem remaining to be solved, bio-computer will no doubt make the development of computer more hopeful and powful. (Prepared by CHEN Zhiqin and ZHENG Fanjun)

Background
What are furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural?
Figure 1: Chemical structure of furfural
Figure 2:  Chemical structure of 5-HMF
Furfural is an inhibitory by-product formed by the dehydration of pentose sugars during dilute acid pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass (Kumar & Sharma, 2017).
A corresponding compound, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), is formed of hexose sugars such as glucose and fructose (Kumar & Sharma, 2017; Wang et al., 2012).
These toxic furans are known to suppress cell growth, decrease ethanol yield, cause damages in the cell DNA and                  harm many enzymes during glycolysis, therefore, pose a great danger to the convenience of lignocellulosic ethanol                  production (Ask et al., 2013). These toxins are proven to affect not only E.coli KO11 that was used in our project                  but also other ethanologenic organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae a strain of yeast, which is widely used in                  fermentation. (Wang et al., 2012; Almeida et al., 2007; Ask et al., 2013).
Moreover, the addition of furfural to hemicellulose hydrolysates has been shown to restore toxicity                  (Wang et al., 2011).  Furfural is, hence, unique in potentiating the toxicity of other compounds unlike                  various hydrolysate inhibitors, hindering the bioethanol production drastically (Wang et al., 2012).
