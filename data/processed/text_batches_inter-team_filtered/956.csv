Overexpression of tagged NOX and peptides
Figure 1:SDS-PAGE for the overexpression of NOX  compared to the empty vector. Different fractions of two clones (C1, C2) carrying the NOX-insert were compared to a clone carrying the empty vector. Cultures were lysed and centrifuged to separate the supernatant (SN) from the pellet (P). Samples of the cells were taken at different time points (PI = pre-induction, AI = 2h after induction). 20 μl of fractions were loaded.
The protein composition of the two clones show no difference in contrast to the strain carrying the empty vector. A band at around 55 kDa would have been expected for NOX. Thus, the expression of NOX was not successful.
Figure 2:SDS-PAGE of induced (I) and uninduced (UI) strains carrying the peptides C4P, CSP or A5P fused to MBP. Strains carrying the plasmids coding for the His-MBP tagged peptides were induced, lysed and centrifuged to separate the supernatant (SN) from the pellet (P). Samples were taken at different time points (PI = pre-induction, AI= 2h after induction) and uninduced strains serve as an control for expression. The lanes were loaded with 15μl.

Suspend the pellets in .675 mL phage suspension buffer and let sit overnight at 4◦ C.
V) Results
We were able to purify phage to a point that it can now be used in the CsCl gradient.  We finished with phage dissolved in phage suspension buffer.  We will be using this solution in a later class to further purify in a CsCl gradient.

Nagahama,2015,Team:Nagahama#Medal Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," solution of the standard farnesol compound dissolved in decane. Mass spectrometry confirmed that the peak at 8.5 min was farnesol (Fig. 3-A). However, the peak was not observed in two-phase culture without introducing BBa_K165025. The formation of farnesol from FPP was further confirmed by blocking FPP synthesis. In the GC-MS, the farnesol peak was observed in E. coli JM109 (BBa_K1653025)  culture, whereas no peak was observed with transformed E. coli JM109. It was found that farnesol need not only ispA(BBa_K1653018) but also MEP(BBa_K1653024) in E. coli. We submit new part(BBa_K1653025)  as producing farnesol.
Gas Chromatography/Mass(GC/MS)
Fig. 3: The farnesol standard solution (Ref) was used as a control. The peak corresponding to the farnesol standard at 8.5 min is indicated by an arrow. The peak at 8.5 min was applied to GC/MS. The farensol standard solution (Ref) was used as a control. E. coli JM109(Bba_K1653025) were compared with respect to farnesol formation using GC-MS.
Geraniol production device( BBa_K1653027 )
To realize ""Flovorator"" we need to make E. coli produce Farnesol. Surprisingly, We may have succeeded in farnesol production by geraniol production device. Our new biobrick device ""Geraniol production device"" worked as expected. Because we validate this fact  by questionnaire survey analysis experimentally. We have documented and submitted this new Biobrick device( BBa_K1653027 ) to iGEM Registry .
Geraniol is generated through GPP hydrolysis by geraniol synthase. A MEP pathway has been shown to synthesize IPP and DMAPP efficiently in E. coli. E. coli engineered with Geraniol production device (BBa_K1653027) showed different smell as compared with the counterpart control (pSB1C3) and the original strain JM109. This result was obtained by the double blind test following the questionnaire survey. And then we tried to detect that the geraniol generated by engineered E. coli by GC and GC-MS. Geraniol was not detected. These results may suggest that E. coli with Gerani"

Who did the work on our different projects:
Primer Designer
Hannah Landes coded the primer designer scripts in python after learning it at the beginning of the summer.
BLAST Tool
Balvir Kunar completely coded the BLAST programs from beginning to end.
Genome Sequence Analysis
While we arranged the delivery of our experimental Deinococcus strains, Russell Durrett prepared the sequencing libraries for them.
Russell also taught us how to analyze the coding sequences of the new genomes by going through the pipeline on the existing sequences. He helped us write the run_pipe.sh shell script to generate the data files, and then Sun won Lim generated the visualizations. The Mason Lab typically works with Human genomic data, so this project is substantially different from the research currently going on there.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," a university” ring-a-scientist.org .  Kerstin Göprich, herself a young scientist, believes that it is very important to inspire the next generation of scientists. On the other hand there is always the issue of the lack of time. “Ring-a-scientist.org” solves this problem in a gorgeous way.
Kerstin was very happy when we offered to try her concept and supported us by sending her evaluation questions. We completed our school lectures with skype-calls directly into our lab. Marvin and Jan explained the concepts of plasmid-design with geneious and showed the evaluation of a gel electrophoresis in real time. We experienced enthusiastic students, thankful to see it up close.
Karl von Frisch award ceremony
On the 29th June we were invited to give a presentation to pupils at the Karl-von-Frisch-award ceremony. The Karl-von-Frisch-prize was awarded by vBio (a german biology association) to high-school students with outstanding performance in biology. The ceremony was held in the Max Planck Institute  in Dortmund. To inform the pupils about different job and research opportunities in sciences, Dr. Johann Jarzombek held a talk about the research in the Max Planck Institute  in Dortmund and Professor Dr. Dr. h.c. Peter Proksch from our university in Duesseldorf talked about drugs from the ocean. Following some researchers from the Max Planck Institute offered guided tours through some institutes. We used this event to convince people to study science and of course to be part of a future iGEM team. One of the pupils is now studying biochemistry in Duesseldorf.
Radio interview
On the 13th of July we had the opportunity to present iGEM and our project in the university’s radio. During the interview with the radio moderator, we explained our idea about producing nootkatone , an environment friendly mosquito repellent, in an artificial compartment.
By talking about our project we wanted to inform the listeners about synthetic biology and its opportunities.
Jülich Biotech Day
On the 28th and 29th of September, the “Forschungszentrum Jülich” celebrated 40 years of biotechnology within the research centre.
We felt very honored to be invited to join this celebration and present our project at a stand outside the lecture hall. Besides us, iGEM Team Aachen attended this event as both of our universities are involved in the research centre.This gave us the opportunity to further promote iGEM within the community of researchers working in this field.

Take a 100µl aliquot of a frozen cell glycerol stock and add it to 10ml of LB with antibiotic.
When you reach an OD of 0.4 place the samples on ice.
Dilute the cells of each sample to an OD of 0.2 in 10 mL of LB. Make sure that you keep all the samples on ice during this step.
Place again the samples in the 37C thermoshaker simultaneously. From now on treat all the samples equally to guarantee less variability in the results.
Grow until 0.6 and induce with 0.5 mM IPTG.

2. Poster Session at the University of Tokyo
 
We participated in a poster session held at the University of Tokyo on May 18th. iGEM teams from all over Japan gathered at this event and introduced their project to the visitors. Not only students and professors at the university, but also people without any scientific background came and listened to our projects. After introducing our projects, we asked visitors for feedbacks to make our projects better. Our central purpose in this event was to let people know what iGEM is, and to change the negative thinking about synthetic biology that many people have.

2-1 The Projects
To introduce our projects to the visitors, we made a poster for each project. Using figures, we tried our best to make it easy for people from any background to understand. Besides posters for our projects, we also made an introduction to iGEM to let more people know about it.
The five projects that we introduced at the poster session were: solar battery, treatment for pollen allergy, lie detector, Bank E. coli, and fertilizer.
・Solar Battery
Fig. 6-1-2-1. Bacteria-using Solar Battery Poster
Solar energy is one of the alternative sources of energy widely used in the world. In this project, we made a solar battery by using photosynthetic bacteria and current generating bacteria to generate power. Wherever sunlight shines, electricity can be generated by this solar battery. It was invented and improved in several institutes, but the low efficiency and inconvenient hardware still tend to be a problem. Therefore, we tried to improve the efficiency of the existing bacteria-using solar battery to make it practical.
 
• Treatment for Pollen Allergy
Fig. 6-1-2-2. Immunotherapy Poster
In Japan, it is said that one in five people suffers from pollen allergy. More than twenty million people suffer from symptoms, and the number is increasing every year. In order to cure this, we thought of using E. coli in immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is a recently developed treatment that can completely cure the allergy. You introduce allerg"

2 Methods
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Control: Untransformed E. coli -- Round 1
3.2 Control: Untransformed E. coli -- Round 2
3.3 Untransformed P. aeruginosa
3.4 Nir Transformed E. coli
4 Conclusions
Introduction
In this anaerobic experiment we characterize how readily nitrite is converted to nitric oxide (NO), and subsequently to nitrous oxide (N2O) by adding nitrite  (NO2- ) in a series of spikes to:
an untransformed strain of E. coli
an untransformed strain of P. aeruginosa
Mutant 2: a strain of E. coli transformed with the Nir gene from P. aeruginosa
We also monitor nitrite, ammonia and nitrate concentrations before each spike.  The concentrations of nitrous oxide is measured continually and the ammonia, nitrite and nitrate concentrations are measured at a series of time points around the spike.  For some experiments, we have data for the concentration of nitric oxide as well, however, the sensor frequently gave unreliable results and was replaced during the summer.  While we were waiting for the new one to arrive, we were not able to take NO measurements.
Methods
The experimental procedure follows Protocol for Experiment 2 .
For the calibration of the N2O and NO electrodes we follow the calibration protocol .
Results and Discussion
In the following diagrams, the y-axis shows mg of Nitrogen (as nitrite, nitrous oxide or other N-source) per litre vs time.  Vertical lines indicate the time at which we spiked with nitrite.  All experiments were performed anaerobically.
Control: Untransformed E. coli -- Round 1
The first round of the experiment was performed on August 8th and August 9th .
It appears that we observed a response from the cells after the third spike.  However, this could also be due to fluctuations in the sensor"

Intravenously injected targeted exosomes delivered Dox specifically to tumor tissues, leading to inhibition of tumor growth without overt toxicity. The results suggested that exosomes modified by targeting ligands could be used therapeutically for the delivery of Dox to tumors, thus having great potential value for clinical applications in our project.
filter_dramaSilencing capability validation in vitro
1.1 KRAS siRNA interference efficiency verification in vitro
To ensure the interference efficiency of anti-KRAS siRNA, we transfected the plasmid loaded with this siRNA into human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and extracted protein to perform western blot. Significant down-regulation of K-ras can be observed in A549 cells treating with anti-KRAS siRNA plasmid, compared with the control group, demonstrating that anti-KRAS siRNA has a gene silencing effect on lung cancer cells.
Figure 3. Anti-KRAS siRNA transfected into A549 cells successfully reduced KRAS expression. Left panel: western blot analysis of KRAS protein levels in cells without any treatment (Nude) or treated with negative control siRNA (NC, siRNA targeting at a random sequence) and transfected with anti-KRAS siRNA using Lipo2000. Right panel: protein quantitative analysis made for intuitive support that anti-KRAS siRNA can suppress KRAS expression.
1.2 TEM imaging of exosomes carrying KRAS siRNA and expressing iRGD peptide on their membrane
After co-transfection of the two plasmids mentioned above, we performed a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize the iRGD-KRAS-siRNA-exosomes. The TEM image showed that the exosomes presented normal morphological characteristics after outside modification and siRNA loading, with a diameter of approximately 200 nanometer and a double-layer membrane.

Tsinghua-A,2011,Team:Tsinghua-A#Safety#QA_-_-_TEXT.html,"ization contributes to the bio-safety. With a proper standard on BioBricks, the utility of parts and devices and the synthesis of new ones will be of safety. Therefore, we hold the idea that a library with detailed information and explanation in registering and sorting BioBricks should be established.
As for bio-safety engineering, nucleotide near the gene of BioBricks can be edited, in order to protect the nucleotide sequence from unexpected change. With a certain protective method, gene will become steady and involve less possibility to do wrong, then, parts, devices and systems can be made safer.

GeorgiaTech,2015,Team:GeorgiaTech#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"ase (a heat-resistant DNA polymerase) begins assembling base pairs along the entire template DNA strand, extending it until a complete dsDNA molecule is formed. After the 3 steps are complete, the cycle repeats again to duplicate the two parent DNA strands. Each cycle theoretically doubles the amount of DNA present; PCR generally exhibits exponential growth patterns, allowing for the rapid generation of large amounts of DNA replicates.
Figure 3. Error-prone PCR. Modifications to the standard PCR conditions are required to achieve different error rates of the PCR.
Error-prone PCR (Figure 3) is essentially the same as canonical PCR, but with different reaction conditions, including varied ratios of available dNTPs, elevated concentrations of already-present magnesium chloride, and addition of manganese chloride. In small amounts, magnesium chloride acts as a cofactor for DNA polymerase, but in large amounts, magnesium chloride will stabilize non-complementary base pairing. Manganese chloride also stabilizes non-complementary base pairing (Cirino, Mayer, Umeno 2003).
Figure 4. DNA Shuffling. This technique involves digestion and reassembly of homologous genes to form unnatural chimeric genes with possible new activities.
In addition to EP-PCR, DNA shuffling can also be used to generate a diverse protein library. DNA shuffling is another widely used molecular evolution technique developed by Willem Stemmer in 1994. The protocol calls for a set of naturally occurring homologous genes that code for the proteins of interest (Stemmer, 1994).
Figure 4 illustrates the general process of DNA shuffling. The genes are digested by DNase1, and the resulting fragments are sorted by gel electrophoresis. Fragments of the desired length are selected for subsequent purification. The purified fragments are subjected to a “PCR-like” reaction in the absence of primers (Stemmer, 1994). Instead homologous fragments to anneal according to complementary base pairing, resulting in the formation of chimeric gene sequences. Starting with naturally occurring homologous sequences leverages billions of years of evolution to combine the most useful mutations from individual genes.
While proteins with homologous sequences can be directly used in DNA shuffling, when homologous gene sequences are not readily available, a protein library can still be built by using a combination of EP-PCR and DNA shuffling.  These genes can first be subjected to EP-PCR to generate sequence diversity prior to DNA shuffling.

Overview
This year's human practice of Tianjin iGEM team mainly focused on how to start a new iGEM team. We held five main activities this summer to attract more students to participate in the competition of IGEM. The number of the people who was directly influenced by us up to 2 000people. With the help of Internet media, more then 30 000 people start to cast a look on the synthetic biology and IGEM. We interfaced with industry and our sponsors through visiting biological company. Besides, to raise up biosafety problem the notice of the public, we organized the youths in the city through our E-sport Competition in collaboration with Plague Inc. Our task can be divided into following parts.

Our goal is to let more students who are interested in synthetic biology get familiar with iGEM, participate in it and join in our big family.In this part, we influenced high schools and universities related with biology in Tianjin. We shared our ideas with them by lectures, visits and interviews, and we successfully helped Nankai University start their first iGEM team.We aim to challenge this current predicament by introducing the emerging field of synthetic biology to high schools across the Tianjin City to spur curiosity towards the field and allow high school students to get involved in cutting-edge research opportunities.We helped more iGEM teams to grow with our joint efforts.We used a wide array of open panel discussions on campus to introduce other students to iGEM and synthetic biology, and the possibilities they hold as scientific pursuits.

XJTLU-CHINA,2017,Team:XJTLU-CHINA#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," aureus. In the early 1940s, the introduction of penicillin in staphylococcal infection dramatically improved the                 cure of patients. However, a few years later, penicillin-resistant staphylococci were recognized, first in                 hospitals and subsequently in the community. By the end of 1960s, more than 80% of both community and hospital-acquired                 staphylococcal isolates were resistant to penicillin. Thereafter, methicillin, a penicillinase-resistant                 semisynthetic penicillin, was introduced. However, in less than 1 year later, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was reported and subsequently spread to the other parts of the world. In the 1980s, quinolones represented                 a significant therapeutic advancement in the treatment of patient with infection caused by S. aureus.                 However, quinolone resistance among S. aureus emerged quickly, more prominently than the MRSA, and became                 a serious clinical problem. “Therefore, if you can really use antimicrobial peptides to replace antibiotics,”                 said Ms. Shi, “I think it sheds light on relieving the trend that Staphylococcus aureus develops resistance                 to the last therapeutic resorts for fighting S. aureus infection.”
Figure 7 Conversation with Ms. Shi
Ms. Shi also mentioned that beside the abuse of antibiotics, acute watery diarrhea, or even with blood for up to dozens of                 times during one day, is a very serious symptom of S. aureus infection. Diarrhea may                 persist for more than 14 days. And if it is MRSA infection, it may lead to pseudomembranous colitis and becomes                 lethal if the patients are untreated. Despite of the improvements in public health and economic wealth, the                 incidence of S. aureus intestinal infection still remains high and continues to be an important clinical                 problem.
Figure 8 Conversation with Ms. Shi
The doctor additionally mentioned other regular methods of diagnosis of enteric infection and treatment. Initially, doctors                 should incubate a little sample from patients’ defecation into multiple media to identify the strain of the                 pathogenic bacteria that makes the patients ill. The whole diagnosis process may take a week, or if fortunately,                 four days at least. Therefore, it is a considerably high risk for patients who have acute diarrhea. For the                 treatment part, doctors usually test the tolerance of morbigenous bacteria to distinct antibiotics. At last,                 they prescribe the most effective antibiotic"

At this temperature <partinfo>BBa_J72008</partinfo> can be replicated and so the pir protein product can be expressed in the cells. The pir product enables the propagation of the integrative vector by replicating the R6K origin.
Inoculate a single colony in 5 ml of LB + Cm at 12.5 ug/ml and incubate the culture at 37°C, 220 rpm overnight. At this temperature the <partinfo>BBa_J72008</partinfo> helper cannot be replicated and the Phi80 integrase is expressed by the remaining copies of the helper. The bacteria that are able to grow in this selective medium should be correct integrants because the integrative vector cannot be replicated by the pir product anymore.
Streak the culture on a Cm plate (at 12.5 ug/ml) and incubate it at 43°C overnight to ensure the loss of the helper plasmid. The bacteria that form colonies should be correct integrants without the <partinfo>BBa_J72008</partinfo> helper plasmid.
Validate the loss of the helper plasmid by inoculating colonies in Cm (at 12.5 ug/ml) media and counterselecting them in Amp (at 50 ug/ml) media. Validate the correct integration position by performing colony PCR with primers P1/P2, P3/P4, P1/P4, P2,P3 and VF2/VR. Validate the phenotype (when possible).

Once the game started, there will be some golden coins suspending on the screen, and several kinds of RNA structures which are shown in pictures and rolling at the bottom. We hope that players can put the RNA structures on the proper position, use the certain keys to cleave the RNA and fall down, gather the golden coins and arrive the destination eventually.
Fig.21 Some small icons that we designed in our game.
Many different cleave sites random are generated from four different kinds of ribonucleotide. At the beginning, Csy4 only have the ability to recognize and cleave several sites. Players should get the ability to cleave at new site by passing more game levels or buying in the store using the money gathering during game.
Fig.22 Six kinds of RNA with specific structures.
In this part, we enact the game rules:
a. Csy4 cleaves the RNA by certain cut site instead of special structure.
b. Csy4 starts at one side of the screen, it's supposed to go the diagonal side.
c. Players should use RNA to help Csy4 reach the end.
d. The golden coins gathered during the game can be used to buy more skills (active cleave sites) to cut the RNA.
e. There will be several levels,and every time you pass a level you can get a new ability.
After discussing with the computer games designer Mingjie Shen, we started our design!
3.3.2 The first step of our game:
During programming, we designed 6 RNA with different structures carrying one or two sites on it. Players can choose the certain sites and cut it to help Csy4 fall. And Csy4 is designed as a little cute white devil in the game.
The game was divided into 6 parts on the basis of the properties of proteins: Immune, Secretion, Transport, Constitute, Recognition, Catalyze. The difficulties among those parts from Immune to Catalyze is in gradient.
We also designed many other widgets we need in the game.
In this part, we've done:
a. Designed the 6 kinds of RNA with specific structures.
b. Designed the cartoon character of Csy4.
c. Designed the gradient difficulties in game.
d. Designed other widgets in game.
Fig.23 The cartoon character of Csy4.
3.3.3 Meet some troubles
While programming, we found that the RNA rolling sidebar is hard to realize. And it's difficult for most players to control the movement of Csy4 and arrange the certain RNA at the same time."

Zeaxanthin
Zeaxanthin is a yellow carotenoid pigment, derived from the precursor ß-carotene through hydroxylation by the enzyme ”Beta-carotene hydroxylase”. Zeaxanthin acts as an antioxidant and can be found in for example peppers, yolk and maize. (1) According to studies zeaxanthin has positive effects on both undamaged and impaired vision and it may prevent age-related macular degeneration (AMD), an eye condition that could lead to blindness. Furthermore studies have also indicated that zeaxanthin may have skin protective activities (1,4).
Except for having beneficial properties the carotenoid the carotenoid zeaxanthin is one of the primary precursors for the production of the saffron metabolites picrocrocin, crocin and safranal. The production of saffron was inspired by the work of Washington team WashU iGEM 2012. Since the gene (CrtZ) that was used for the production of zeaxanthine was a eukaryotic version from Arabidopsis Thaliana, we decided to focus on finding a suitable gene to optimize the production of the above-mentioned metabolites. When searching for an appropriate gene we came in contact with Slovenia iGEM 2010 (lank) that had produced Zeaxanthin in E.coli. The operon that was obtained contained genes that were originally from the bacteria Pantoea Anantis.
Methods:
For the characterization of zeaxanthin in E.coli DH5alpha we put together a standardized method for zeaxanthin extraction and measuring. Since zeaxanthin in its pure form is extremely"

Stanford-Brown,2015,Team:Stanford-Brown#Cellulose_-_-_TEXT.html," protein of interest onto the bifunctional ligase/repressor (birA) protein attached to an acceptor peptide. BirA is found in E. coli and it catalyzes attachment of biotin onto the biotin acceptor peptide such as the Avitag [5]. Because the acceptor peptide is connected to the protein of interest, this protein can be extracted and purified from the cells and can then attach to Part I via streptavidin-biotin interaction. The overall second construct would be called protein of interest-birA (POI-birA)
Data and Results
Fig. 2 Unprocessed cellulose after drying
We made bacterial cellulose using G. hansenii and processed them into flat cellulose sheet. We also designed and cloned the mSA-cipA and POI-birA into NEB-5 alpha competent E. coli . Sequencing result was consistent for mSA-cipA; however, our cloning for POI-birA was unsuccessful. This was because of a PstI site within the gene that caused difficulty in cloning. We also did protein extraction of the mSA-cipA construct; however, the gel  did not show the presence of the protein band. We believed that this was due to a problem with the Flag affinity purification. In conclusion, we made bacterial cellulose and processed it into flat sheet. We also managed to clone and verify the sequence for mSA-cipA. Our future goal is to successfully clone the POI-birA gene and extract proteins from these two genes. Lastly, we will do functional testing by doing binding affinity assay of the cellulose binding domain and the streptavidin-biotin complex.

Place the appropriate amount of EDTA-trypsin and complete DMEM in the incubator (37°C), before handling the cells (about 1-2 hours before).
The U2OS cells are kept at -80°C until defrosted gently at 37°.
Exactly when defrosted, they are mixed with 12 ml complete DMEM in the pipette.
The cell suspension is transferred to a 15 ml vial and centrifuged at 280 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant is discarded.
The cell pellet is resuspended in 5 ml complete DMEM and transferred to a 25 cm2 culture flask.
The cells are kept at 37°C in a  5% CO2 incubator until the following day, where they are passed on to larger culture flasks.

Procedure
The appropriate amount of EDTA-trypsin and complete DMEM in the incubator (37°C), before handling the cells.
The filter of a 1 ml pipette is broken off, and the pipette is attached to the vacuum suction maschine. The medium is removed, and the pipette is put in a 50 ml vial for later use.
1 ml 0,05% EDTA-trypsin/PBS is added to wash the cells. Tilt the flask quickly, so the EDTA-trypsin covers the cells. Remove the liquid quickly.
1 ml 0.05% trypsin-EDTA/PBS is added and the flask is incubated for 3 min at 37°C and 5 % CO2.
9 ml complete medium is added to inactivate the EDTA-trypsin and to wash the cells of the surface. Make sure the cells are well resuspended, before you transfer them.
2,5 ml (depends on the concentration of the cells) cell suspension is transferred to a new 75 cm2 culture flask.
The cells are kept at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator until they are 80-100% confluent. This takes about 2-3 days. Then they are passed on to a new flask or plate.

Smoothness Index
For position prediction in virtual environments, jitter or noise in the output signal is not wanted though often present. Since discovering smooth areas is a similar problem to jitter detection, a simple method for determining jitter can be used to measure non-jitter, smoothness (Joppich, Rausch and Kuhlen, 2013). It is assumed that jitter-free areas of a position signal do not differ in velocity.
Smooth areas do not differ in intensity, and therefore only low changes in velocity (intensity change) can be recorded. For the reduction of noise, this operation is performed on the smoothed input image. Then the smoothness $s$ of a pixel $p$ in its k-neighbourhood $\mathcal{N}_k$ can be determined as: \begin{equation} s(p) = \sum\"

Presenting at TEDxTwenteU
 
At the 10th of October the University of Twente organized an independent TED event. The theme of the day was “find your creative spark”, and we were welcomed to share our idea of LactoAid. During the day there were several talks about many different topics. From music to cooking in a hot air balloon, from soccer to medical devices. Thomas Meijer represented us here, and told the public a more about the synthetic biology and LactoAid. An inspiring day where our creative spark was found!

RIVM: Responsible use of synthetic biology day
 
At the 17th of September all the Dutch iGEM teams went to the RIVM (the Netherlands national institute for public health and the environment) in Bilthoven to talk about the possibilities of synthetic biology. You can compare this institute with the FDA and CDC. The idea came from the RIVM to start a yearly information market about synthetic biology. They just started following all the Dutch iGEM teams more closely and want to close the gap between the teams and some companies. They also wanted to introduce iGEM to people who might be able to help the teams in several ways. Furthermore, this meeting gave an opportunity to discuss the possibilities of an iGEM application. The day was such a success, that the RIVM wants to make yearly event of it. This year it started small with only a few companies, and they hope to enlarge this in the next few years. We got some really useful information regarding our project and we liked the fact that the RIVM was willing to get to know synthetic biology. Until next year!

A composite part is a functional unit of DNA consisting of two or more basic parts assembled together. BBa_I13507 is an example of a composite part, consisting of an RBS, a protein coding region for a red fluorescent protein, and a terminator.
New composite BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts (like Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators, Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on)."
Edinburgh_UG,2018,Team:Edinburgh UG#Degradation Switch_-_-_TEXT.html," up the chromosome of our E. coli and form Maxicells we have obtained a strain from the Leach Lab containing a number of I-SceI sites within the chromosome. When I-SceI is introduced and Maxicells are formed pImm will also be cut 'turning off' expression of Imm2. At this phase in the model all equations are evaluated however rate of imm2 transcription is 0 and halflives for Imm2 and Colicin E2 are altered to reflect that replication is no longer taking place.
By modeling this simple killswitch we can determine the plausibility of the system as well as screen across different Anderson Promoters and RBS to find the killswitch activation time closest to the length of time for which Maxicells can continue expressing protein.
Mass Action Equations
Mass Action Equations are commonly used to represent chemical reactions and provide a starting point for mechanistic modelling of a variety of phenomena. The laws of mass action state that the rate of any chemical reaction is proportional to the product of the masses of the reacting substances, with each mass raised to a power equal to the coefficient that occurs in the chemical equation [2]. The mass action equations in Figure 1 can be used to represent protein expression when taking into account the effect of ribosome binding sites and promoters:
Ordinary Differential Equations
The model uses a simple set of ordinary differential equations derived from mass action equations:
pimm and pcol - Promoter Strength - The Anderson Promoter Collection [1] consists of 19 constitutive promoters that have been characterized by their relative strengths in E. coli.
trimm - Rate of Imm Transcription - Transcription proceeds at an average speed of 60 nucleotides per second [2]. Imm is 258 nucleotides in length [3] giving transcription rate of 60/258. In Maxicells imm is not transcribed and hence this rate is set to 0.
degmRNA - Rate of mRNA Degradation - Average mRNA halflife in E. coli is 5 minutes [4]. degmRNA = ln(2)/halflife [4].
trcol - Rate of Col Transcription - Transcription proceeds at an average speed of 60 nucleotides per second [2]. Col is 1743 nucleotides in length [5] giving transcription rate of 60/581.
rbsimm and rbscol - RBS Strength - The Community RBS Collection [6] consists of ribosome binding sites that have been characterized by their relative strengths in E. coli. We evaluated our model using RBS strengths"

Confirmation of Initial Value of GSR
We expect the lens to have some GSR in the lens naturally as part of the antioxidizing system. There will not be enough GSR to fully prevent cataract damage, however. Based on research, if H2O2 levels remain at 10 uM for 1 year, which is common after traumatic accidents affecting the eye, a moderately severe cataract will develop, expected at around the LOCS 4-4.5 level (Fraunfelder 2008).
Literature data estimates that the natural concentration is around 10 uM (Fraunfelder 2008). This corresponds to roughly a LOCS 4 cataract after a year, which confirms that our initial value of GSR in the cortex before any treatment. We will consider this as our starting point, and add GSR to reach this point.
Prevention: Prototype Function
Model 3: Nanoparticle Protein Delivery
To maximize delivery efficiency to the lens, we encapsulate GSR in chitosan nanoparticles (Wang 2011, Tajmir-Riahi 2014). From Models 1-2, we have found the necessary concentration of GSR that needs to be maintained in the lens. Now we design nanoparticles that will maintain those amounts. We build a model find how nanoparticles release GSR at appropriate rates to control the amount of GSR in the lens, and find the best engineered design for nanoparticles.
Single Dose: Change in GSR Concentration
In finding the best engineered design, we take into account variables such as nanoparticle radius and concentration. We build a differential equation model for the impact of a single dose of nanoparticles over time. To generalize the model, instead of using absolute concentrations, we use relative concentration, with respect to the natural amount, or initial amount of GSR in the lens. The full mathematics and details can be found in the collapsible.
We get two curves, the concentration of GSR outside nanoparticles subjected to degradation (Figure 4.4), and the release of GSR from nanoparticles (Figure 4.5), over time. This allows us to predict nanoparticle delivery rates before we perform the actual experiments   (Link)
Figure 4.4: Single Dose of Nanoparticles Concentration Graph. Model of how GSR concentration in the lens is increased as a result of one dose of nanoparticles releasing GSR. Each curve represents a different concentration of GSR encapsulated in the nanoparticle. The GSR concentration in the lens increases, then decreases back to the initial, due"

Potsdam,2017,Team:Potsdam#Protocols_-_-_TEXT.html," Measure 1g agarose and and mix it with 100 ml of TBE in a microwaveable flask.
Note:  Agarose gels are commonly used in concentrations of 0.7 % to 2 % depending on the size of bands needed to be separated -  Simply adjust the mass of agarose in a given volume to make gels of other agarose concentrations (e.g., 2 g of agarose in 100 mL of TAE will make a 2 % gel).
2. Microwave for 1-3 min until the agarose is completely dissolved (but do not overboil the solution, as some of the buffer will evaporate and thus alter the final percentage of agarose in the gel. Many people prefer to microwave in pulses, swirling the flask occasionally as the solution heats up.).
Note: gloves and glasses ! Caution HOT! Be careful stirring, eruptive boiling can occur.
It is a good idea to microwave for 30-45 sec, stop and swirl, and then continue towards a boil. Keep an eye on it as the initial boil has a tendency to boil over. Placing saran wrap over the top of the flask can help with this, but is not necessary if you pay close attention.
4. Pouring of the gel
1. Let agarose solution cool down to about 50 °C (about when you can comfortably keep your hand on the flask), about 5 mins.
Note:  Or cool down in water bath about 30 min.
2. Add ethidium bromide (EtBr) to a final concentration of approximately 0.2-0.5 μg/mL (usually about 2-3 μl of lab stock solution per 100 mL gel). EtBr binds to the DNA and allows you to visualize the DNA under ultraviolet (UV) light.
Note:  Caution EtBr is a known mutagen. Wear a lab coat, eye protection and gloves when working  with this chemical. If you add EtBr to your gel, you will also want to add it to the running buffer when you run  the gel.
3. Pour the agarose into a gel tray with the well comb in place.
Note: Think about witch gel tray size you need (a small one or a big one).
Pour slowly to avoid bubbles which will disrupt the gel. Any bubbles can be pushed away from the well comb or towards the sides/edges of the gel with a pipette trip.
4. Let the newly poured gel sit at room temperature for 20-30 mins, until it has completely solid"

August 01, 2018. Skype call with Lori Goff
She raised some questions to get us thinking about new aspects we had not yet considered, many of which are safety-related. Inspired by Lori, we researched upscaling, good manufacturing practices (GMP) and ways to replace the toxic chemical DMAP  by another chemical in the Dextran synthesis procedure. Furthermore, we checked the safety of E. coli and explored ways to keep our living material hydrated when using it as a plaster . Finally, we followed Lori’s suggestion to incorporate multiple bacterial strains with different functionalities in our material.
Insights
Safety and good manufacturing practice will be crucial in funding applications for the market launch of our design.
Follow-up
We researched GMP, particularly options for the substitution of toxic chemicals.
We researched the option to combine different bacterial strains into material.

When the concentration of AHL has reached the threshold value, AHL combines LuxR to form a compound, strongly inducing the promoter plux. This induction will continue to induce the expression of the luxR and luxI generator downstream, forming a positive feedback. That’s how our cyclic amplifier works.
5.
Thus, the whole process is as follows: When the AFP concentration has reached the LOD, it will combine the aptamer and release the complementary chain and lysine, which will express the fluorescent protein. With the help of the strong promoter and the cyclic amplifier, induced promoter will lead to a higher GFP fluorescence and a lower RFP fluorescence. Finally, we use the GFP and RFP fluorescence ratio, with a higher sensitivity, to be the output signal of our detecting machine.

Our tool allows us to reduce the required guide RNAs to detect gene doping from 10104 to only 12 guide RNAs.
*Due to the implementation of a machine learning algorithm the tool will develop even better abilities towards distinguishing these sequences in the future.
1. Sequence Classification Tool
1.1 Method
Database set-up
There is a wide variety of genes that are potential targets for gene doping. Our main focus is on the Erythropoietin (EPO) gene, which is one of the genes that is most likely to be used for gene doping, according to professor Hidde Haisma, gene doping expert at the University of Groningen. Our software tool can easily be extended to any other gene. Our custom database contains three groups of reference sequences: endogenous human EPO DNA, gene doping EPO DNA and DNA from endogenous sources other than EPO.
Type of DNA
The reference sequences for normal human EPO DNA are the actual human EPO sequence ( Clark et. al., 2016 ) together with 300 sequences that we simulated with 6% false reads, which has been specified as the accuracy of the MinION device in the case of a single read-through that we use in our method ( Loman et al., 2015 ).
We loaded many possible gene doping EPO DNA sequences. To start these include human EPO cDNA ( Clark et. al., 2016 ) and its codon substituted versions around the junctions. We also included animal cDNA EPO sequences from Genbank ( Clark et. al., 2016 ) as possible EPO doping based on a suggestion by Eli van der Sluis, technician at the Bionanoscience Department at Delft University of Technology.
Furthermore, we included sequences designed by our team which involve further codon mutations. We do not include all codon substituted versions, because there would be roughly 10104 of those, which is computationally impossible to generate and unnecessary. Therefore, we provide the algorithm with a basic set of sequences that contain all codon variations within 9 bps around the first three junctions, a set of 72 sequences. The code for the generation of these sequences is given at downloads .
Directed learning will take place after classification. The database is further extended with sequences that appear in athlete samples. As the detected sequences form a start for gene doping developers to continue development, the addition of these sequences to the database is highly valuable to improve our detection accuracy.
Additionally, we added 30 DNA strings of 150 bps as DNA from other end"

Our ligation of fadD to the pET29b vectors did not work last week. Therefore, we digested the C beta-oxidation gBlock and the pET29b vectors with KpnI and SalI once again. We ligated the insert and the vector and transformed competent DH5a cells with the ligation mixture and plated 100uL of the mixture on an LB-Kan plate. The transformation was successful because colonies were seen on the plate. Four colonies were used from the transformation plate to make overnight cultures and a master plate. We planned to use the overnight cultures for confirmation digests for the following week.

Chemically competent cells were then produced from overnight cultures following the protocol by Penn iGEM 2012
Furthermore we also performed PCR on our gBlocks in order to add additional nucleotides to the ends of our gene to allow for more efficient cutting. gBlocks PCR was then analysed via gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3) to confirm the presence of our genes. However, bands were only visible for TYR and CHAP and the decision was made to repeat the PCR reaction for TH and CYP2D6 using different conditions. Repeated PCR did not yield any bands for TH and CYP2D6.
Another PCR reaction was performed on mutAADC and CvATA in order to remove them from the pET-28a vector as well as adding the BioBrick prefix and suffix. Four reactions were set up for both genes under different conditions and analysed on a gel following PCR (Fig. 4).

Ran three PCRs, two colony PCRs and one attempt at a backbone amplification. One interesting note is that the 4 lanes on the left, the colony PCR for Nox, failed even with their control (lane 5). This was the last of the NEB master mix from that tube, which suggests that it was lacking something. The rest were run with the more full tube of NEB PCR master mix. Despite the negative results for Nox (again), it's worthwhile to run these again with the NEB master mix from the new tube.
IMG_3134.JPG
Lanes, left to right, are: 1) LD, Nox 1, Nox 2, Nox 3, Nox Control, iLOV+csiDp Control. 2) LD, iLOV+csiDp 1, iLOV+csiDp 2, iLOV BB 1, iLOV BB 2, iLOV BB 3
Unlike the Nox, the csiDp + iLOV construct failed outright. The control was successful AND the bands that showed up are at improper heights. It appears that the linearized backbone has somehow self-annealed. Unforunately, the iLOV BB was also unsuccessfully amplified. There is the faint appearance of a backbone band at the proper height, but it's overwhelmed by the large streaks of DNA running through the gel.
Going to re-PCR the iLOV+csiDp backbone with a fresh template. Also going to re-colony PCR the 3 Nox constructs, again with a positive control.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#Selection#Bacterial Two-Hybrid System_-_-_TEXT.html," The transformation from Gal11 to Gal11P results in a mutation in only one amino acid ( Himmelfarb et al. 1990 ), which allows the binding of Gal11P in the dimerization domain of Gal4 ( Hidalgo et al. 2001 ).
Figure 7: Comparison of Gal11 and Gal11P.The only difference of Gal11 and Gal11P is the amino acid mutation N342A.
In addition to the Gal4-Gal11P interaction a second positiv control should be tested. Having our library in mind we looked for a control that was very similar to our Evobodies. One protein with good structural similarities
is the antibody mimic or monobody HA4. This monobody was designed by a working group in Chicago searching for an antibody mimic, that can bind the SH2 domain of the tyrosine kinase Abelson with low nanomolar affinity ( Wojcik et al. 2010 ). The results of this work show an equally well interaction in vitro and in vivo, respectively. To validate the potential of the hybrid transcriptional activation system HA4 mutants are also necessary. Single amino acid substitutions change in most cases the structure of the protein and lower or increase the interaction affinity with other proteins ( Brender & Zhang 2015 ). In single mutation R38A in HA4 causes a reduction of transcriptional activation of the reporter gene of 35 to 40%. The mutation Y87A is even more detrimental leading to only 5 to 10% of the native binding affinity ( Badran et al. 2016 ).
These controls allowed a detail characterization of our system. It is possible to show that different binding affinities  result in differences in the reporter gene expression.
Design of the reporter
A selection system should be characterized based on different proteins with known mutual affinity values. A strong correlation between the binding affinity of the interacting proteins and the reporter gene activity is required. The selection of hogh affiniy Evobodies necessitates a reporter that confers growth advantage to the cells of interest. A good choice for such a reporter is an antibiotic resistance gene like bla against ampicillin ( Livermore 1995 ) or tetA against tetracycline ( Roberts 1996 ), respectively. Increase of the antibiotic concentration would lead to a decrease of a bacterial population. Finally, the best Evobodies should allow the survival of the cells.

Transformed with the overnight (Room temperature) ligation, using 1 uL ligation mix and 1800V. Joe then plated the cells after recovery.
Found a MetA biobrick colony on the appropriate plate from 2 days ago. Decided to grow it up in culture and run a PCR to confirm that it was successful.
Had previously grown up 10 mL of each fluorescent strain (GFP, RFP, YFP) to use for fluorescence calibration, but the plate reader became unavailable.
- Jacob Toth
We have been having issues with having no colonies grow on plates with cells transformed with PCR products ligated into vectors.  One possible cause is the transformation itself.  All of Joe's transformation resulted in a spark.  He had added 5 uL ligated to competent cells.  The high salt concentration may have heavily influenced the sparking.  So, I redid some of the transformations in a smaller volume of ligate.  I transformed Joe's ligated 3:3 dszB, 3:3 dszC, and 3:1 dszB plasmids into EPI300 cells.  Added 0.5 uL ligate to 40 uL competent cells and electroporated them.  The 3:1 dszB cells sparked during electroporation.  The cells were left to recover undisturbed at 37C for an hour before plating 50 uL transformants onto Chlor plates.

3. The second trial of RNAT testing
3.1 Introduction
The team suspects that the poor performance of RNATs in first round of the test was due to the inappropriate coupling of T7-Lac O regulatory part. The transcription of T7 promoter starts at CACTATAG (transcription start site indicated in bold). Hence, lac operators may also be transcribed and therefore interfere with RNA thermometers. To determine whether this assumption was reasonable, the team redesigned temperature induced transcription cascades by introducing three different promoters: pBad, J23119, T7 and three RNA thermometers (A1, FourU, U6) to the project and eliminating any loop forming sequence between transcription initiation points and the start points of RNA thermometers. The team thus has nine constructs indicated as W1~9, which are showed in detailed as following:
3.2 Methodology

Team FSU
Teams from both the University of Florida and Florida State University participated in iGEM during the 2017 competition cycle. Our collaboration last year consisted of video conferences and a joint YouTube channel. This year, we decided to step it up a notch and meet each other in person! The first team collaboration event was a Florida iGEM Summer Social hosted by the UFlorida team. We started off the day with icebreakers and team introductions. Each team then presented a project overview and future experimental goals. Aspects of community outreach, human practices, and future collaborations were also discussed among students. This portion especially provided insight about how the UFlorida team could expand our project. It also set the foundation for our future collaboration involving diagram modeling.
After all the technical and experimental conversations, it was time to eat! Everyone carpooled to our university’s Lake Wauberg recreational complex and had a grill-out next to the water. We spent several hours playing volleyball, chomping on burgers and hummus, and engaging in team building exercises. This bonded the Florida teams in a way the video calls could not accomplish last year.
Students from Florida State University drove for several hours to attend the Florida iGEM Summer Social. In late September, it was our turn to make the drive, and a small group of us made the trip to visit our partners in science. We spent several hours in a conference room at the College of Medicine where the FSU team has their laboratory. Dr. Cesar Rodriguez is the FSU team mentor and has been involved with iGEM since 2009. His advice was amazing to receive, and it gave us plenty of insight on how to go about styling our wiki and finishing up our collaboration.
The collaboration led us to integrate FSU’s approach to biological system design modeling into our project. An important aspect of synthetic biology is the creation and use of standard parts, much like puzzle pieces. Systems biology graphical notation is a standardized diagram format. This allows scientists to understand the entirety of an example biological system and visualize how"

LMU-Munich,2012,Team:LMU-Munich#Germination Stop#SuicideSwitch_-_-_TEXT.html,", Amitai 2005 ). Activation of PydfG therefore leads to the expression of MazF, a bacterial toxin from E.coli degrading mRNA.
The resulting time course of expression is as follows: Sporulation of the Sporobeads leads to Ecf41Bli aa1-204 production in the forespore at the end of the differentiation cycle, through the activation of either PspoIVB or PsspK. Subsequently, this would lead to the expression of MazF, due to the activation of PydfG. For our already matured Sporobeads , this would not be toxic, as they represent a dormant state that does not require translation any more. But in the case that a Sporobead escapes the GerminationSTOP based on the gene knockouts described above, a germinating cell will already contain or soon start producing MazF and therefore kill the vegetative cells.
See what Data we got when measuring a module with luxABCDE instead of MazF.
We are planning to model this system, but still need more quantitative, time-resolved data for it. We hope to get this data after finishing the cloning of PsspK and MazF into B. subtilis.

Intro: Today we designed the primer sequence for our codon optimized cage sequence from Yates' lab. I initially researched the iGEM specifics for the prefixes and suffix they require, so that we knew how to design primers for the sequence. Additionally, another set of primers with NdeI (prefix) and XhoI (suffix) sites will be designed for protein expression within the pET22b vector, since this plasmid was used by Dr. Yates.
We first spoke with Fasih to learn how to order gBlocks and to confirm our primer design methodology. This is what we learned:
1. select gBlocks gene fragments on the IDT (integrated DNA technologies) website
2. name the order
3. copy the gene from benchling into the sequence window
4. test the complexity to make sure its good to go
5. say no to all the questions asked by IDT
6. Notes: A. for payment, use oilgocard B. send to david attn. iGEM C. 1,000 ng is a good guaranteed yield
Remember to resuspend the gene at a concentration of 10 ng/microL.
Add a double stop codon.  Snap gene is a good place to look for plasmid sequences.

Introduction: During our downtime with either lab protocols or orders to arrive, we decided to do a formal journal club within the protein cages group. Our first journal club will involve PCR(procedure,theory, application) and site directed mutagenesis as these will be heavily used in the project.
1.I was preparing for this journal club by finding papers and preparing a powerpoint presentation for this. First I looked up PCR on google then I got titles of some of the original papers on PCR. I typed these papers into google scholar which led me to the source of the papers(Science, Nature etc.)
2.I attended the meeting with David and"
UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#HP rapport_-_-_TEXT.html," the funds given to NASA from 0.1% given in 1958 to 2.31% in 1969 of the total US spending hitting an all-time high in 1966 at 4.41% (Nasa budget, 2016). Because of the order given by the president of the United States as well as the pressure from the public, NASA was able to fulfil the ambition (Syskind, 2003).
From this, we can conclude that a key factor over the course of the space race was the political climate at the time. This was largely caused by division between two power nations following World War II. A driving factor in achieving the actual space mission might also have been the ambitious deadlines which led to large sums of money being spent on the respective space projects. Also worth noticing is the fact the public engagement was high.
It seems that an important element of landing a potential space mission on Mars could be a heavy motivation. It may not have to be an actual war, but demonstration of power and greatness could be a driving element. According to professor and chief consultant at DTU Space, Michael Linden-Vørnle, a Mars mission has always been ""30 years away"" - even today. He states that the extreme political conditions seen in the 60s, as well as the large sums of money that followed, were what made the moon landing happen. If a space agency got the command today to send a mission to Mars within the next 10 years for whichever reason, Linden-Vørnle believes that we already have the technology to make that happen. The final push may be down to motivation be that in the form of power, money, and support from the public.
Although we may make a qualified guess of how a manned Mars mission could be set into place, it is naturally impossible to predict the course of time - even when following the tendencies in society up until that point. A recent example of this could be the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States after the opposing candidate Hillary Clinton had been estimated to win throughout most of the period leading up to the election both by polls and news media's estimates (Zurcher 2016).
Imperialism
This chapter is related to the societal challenges related to sending an amount of people to habitats in space for longer time periods. Society is an ever-changing and fluent concept and can't be evaluated quite as easily as the concrete historical events of the space race. Therefore, this chapter will be largely based on historians', philosophers', and psychologists' opinions of why society is prone to expanding and even colonizing.

Current priorities for patients are:
Cleaning and immobilizing the site
Cooling the area to minimize swelling
Mainting Heart Rate and Respirations
Recognizing the type of snake if possible.

Sponsoring
Letztes Jahr hat sich Timo um dasd Sponsoring gekümmert. Die damals gefundenen Sponsoren sollten auf jeden Fall wieder angeschrieben werden (siehe iGEM Wiki 2009). DAAD sollte auch angeschrieben werden. Volker kennt evtl. noch weiter Sponsoren. 2009 wurden keine Verlage (Springer u. A.) bezüglich Sponsoring angeschrieben. Dieses Jahr auf jeden Fall anschreiben.
Wiki-Funktionen
Volker hat die verschiedenen Wiki-Funktionen und Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten erklärt und demonstriert. Das Wichtigste: Wenn man etwas verändern will, muss man eingeloggt sein, auf edit drücken und schon kann es los gehen. Kristian empfiehlt den HTML-Code zu verwenden, der Wiki-Code ist aber wesentlich schneller zu schreiben.
Vorträge
Adrians Vortrag bezog sich auf das AV-System und die Immunreaktion. Da wir uns entschieden haben mit AAV/rAAV zu arbeiten, sind die in seinem Vortrag genannten kritischen Punkte fraglich, weil vorerst nicht bekannt ist in wie weit sie die Probleme bei dem AV-System mit denen von AAV/rAAV überschneiden. Genannt wurde unter anderem, dass nicht alle Mechanismen und Bestandteile  bekannt sind, die eine Immunreaktion hervorrufen. Die Vorgänge in den Endosomen sind womöglich von Bedeutung, da diese letztendlich auch zur Antigenpräsentation führen können und somit zu einer Immunreaktion.
Patricks Vortrag bezog sich auf das Targeting/Tropismus-Modifikationen von (r)AAV. Die selektive Transduktion ist notwendig. Die besten Ergebnisse wurden dabei mit Hilfe von AK- oder AK-Fragmenten, welche an die Virusoberfläche gebunden waren, erzielt.
Dennis' Vortrag war sehr kurz ... es sollte um die Produktion von AAVs gehen

Results: Bands showed in all four wells on the gel, located at the expected length of 250 bp. Nanodrop showed some contamination, but a good DNA concentration of 345ng/uL. The contamination might be the entire plasmid, since elongation time was a little in the high end.
Analysis: The PCR product might be to contaminated still, and there's too little anyway. Therefore The PCR product will need to be further amplified.
Further amplification of PCR product
Date: July 14th
Methods: PCR of DNA in solutions
Protocol: CP1.1-PFU protocol
Experiment done by: Christian
Notes: 4 tubes were loaded, using one microliter of DNA template from the above experiment. Protocol was followed to point.
The same PCR program was used (PF1 on machine 2), elongation time once again set to 1 minute and 30 seconds.
Remaining PCR product was frozen as (White-2).
A 1% agarose gel was loaded with 5 microlitres samples of each tube and GeneRuler 100bp ladder from Fermentas as marker.
Results: Bands showed at 250bp for all tubes. Tubes 1-3 showed a strange band that was larger than the ladder could show. Tube 4 was free of this band, and also showed a clearer band at 250bp.
Nanodrop showed signatures for tubes 1-3 like in the samples of the above experiment. DNA was twice as concentrated in tube 4.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," provided interesting new challenges for our mathematicians.
Meeting with SYKE
The most valuable information from our meeting with SYKE, the Finnish Environment Institute, was that we learned what kind of solutions already exist for the blue green algae problem. It came up that all the present methods dealt with the problem causing algal blooms, eutrophication. There was thus a real need for solution like our that could be effective in a smaller scale. This convinced us that we were on right track with the degradation.
We also discussed current detection methods and according to them, all the available detection methods are rather expensive and hardly any of them is available for the public. They guided us to plan our detection device so that it would correspond to the current need - being available for the public and not be too expensive. If the use of GMOs was legal, our yeast based detection system could provide an easy and affordable solution.
It was also nice to hear that there was no available method for the present day to get rid of the cyanobacteria or the toxins. All the present methods dealt with the problem by nipping it in the bud, i.e. fighting eutrophication, but none tried to get rid of the toxins once they have been produced. They advised us that one measurement should cost less than 25 euros in order for it to be an improvement to existing methods. We used these considerations when choosing the best option for our preliminary detection methods to continue with. Their input greatly affected our choice of using modified yeast as the detection chassis organism.
We also talked about the possibility to use genetically modified yeast as a sensor in the natural environment and it was nice to hear that they didn’t turn this idea down even if it is not allowed by the Finnish legislation at the moment. This gave us additional courage to choose our GMO yeast sensor as our project idea.
Besides affecting our choice of topic, SYKE gave us information about how we could develop our project after establishing our proof of concept. We talked quite a lot about what kind of models are currently used to follow the development of algal blooms and cyanobacterial movement in seas. From this conversation, we got an idea to develop their Levävahti sensor app. This was supposed to be part of our project, but unfortunately time constraints prevented us from doing this. Perhaps after the Giant Jamboree we might have time for this.
Interviewing people on the streets of Helsinki
From interviewing people in the streets, we learned that public knowledge about synthetic biology was rather restricted. Most people associated it with man-made biology or just something that they need to know nothing about. Based on this,"

Ran the gel from PCR reaction from 08/08. Both TSH6 and TSHH2 showed successful banding.
Set-up sequencing reactions for 10/08. Had to grow up more plasmid. These mini-prepped and sent off for sequencing tomorrow.
Digest:
Level one digest completed using BSA1, the digest included TSH/H, 35S or LexA and NosT. The digest was done at 37 degrees for 3 hours.
The enzymes were then heat inactivated at 80 degrees for 15 minutes.
T4 ligase was then added and the ligation reaction was done at 16 degrees overnight.
Mini-prepped 5 out of the 10 level 1 colonies grown overnight, resuspending them in 30 µl of Elution buffer.
These were then digested using BsmB1 before running them on a gel. This gel was very inconclusive, so this digest/gel will need to be redone.

The shaker was observed to see if its malfunction one week ago was purely by chance; it appeared to be so, and thus, the following five treatments were placed into the shaker for overnight incubation: (i) LB control; (ii) LB, DH5alpha, ampicillin; (iii) LB, DH5alpha, chloramphenicol; (iv) LB chloramphenicol and K652001; and (v) LB ampicillin, and psb1A3.
A 1% agarose gel (made using the 1.2g agarose recipe discussed previously) was made, and the A. niger DNA prep was run. The gel was inconclusive, and must be run again tomorrow. The DNA primer melting temperatures were determined and posted for the team on Dropbox. A 100x Antibiotic-antimycotic solution, composed of amphotericin B, streptomycin, and penicillin was bought for use on the potted plants. The solution was aliquoted into 15mL Sarstedt tubes, placed in the -20°C. A few tubes were thawed, diluted ten-fold, and transferred to a spray bottle. The solution will be sprayed on twice weekly henceforth.

The K652001 and psb1A3 treatments from the shaker were miniprepped. The samples were stored in elution buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) in the 4°C. A shortage of QIAprep Mini Columns was discovered in the lab, rendering these minipreps more time-consuming than usual. The first successful (out of seven previous attempted) gel was run on the a. niger gDNA.

The day was devoted to running a PCR cycle in order to isolate the carrot extensin gene. In a 50µL reaction, the following volumes of reagents were used: 5µL 10X Standard Taq Reaction Buffer; 1µL 10mM dNTP mix; 0.5µL 20mM upstream primer; 0.5µL 20mM downstream primer; 7.31µL DNA template at 68.4ng/µL; 0.25µL Taq DNA Polymerase; and 35.44µL DEPC-treated water.

Sporovector
Our Sporovector is specially designed to give you the opportunity to easily create Sporobeads with any protein you can think of. The part between the EcoRI and PstI is available as BioBrick in pSB1C3 and can be cloned in any of our empty B. subtilis vectors. We also offer it “precloned” in pSBBs4S, which in this version lacks the NgoMIV restriction sites.
The Sporovector was created by ligation of three cut PCR-products with special overhangs (PcotYZ, mRFP and cgeA-B0014). It is designed to allow N-terminal fusions of genes in Freiburg standard ( RCF25 ). Therefore, the gene to be inserted must be cut with XbaI and AgeI and the vector must be digested with XbaI and NgoMIV. By this digest, the RFP cassette is removed from this vector to allow easy selection for the integration of the new insert. After ligation, there is a scar of six nucleotides between both genes but no restriction site left.
Expression of the gene fusion is controlled by the PcotYZ-promoter which was the strongest one in our promoter evaluations. The C-terminal gene part is cgeA, one of the two known spore crust proteins.
The vector is cloned but has not been tested with an insert, yet. We are working on further Sporovectors to offer also fusion with cotZ as well as C-terminal f"

Recall our memory to iGEM2009, Peking surveyed DIY bio, almost ten years later, we conducted a similar DIY bio-survey again. We tried to order materials for molecular experiments, using the delivery address to our home, the result was quite shocking that we can buy almost everything for the molecular experiment, from the internet. Then, we went through relevant laws and regulations throughout the world, which we found out that there are no laws related to the credit certification and the address certification about the people who book the biology reagent. Most of the laws are about the quality certification and how they would serve the user after they bought this. We interviewed the Director of the center for disease control and prevention. He said that within his experiment with the disease caused by the Bacteria leak, environmental pollution, the vast impact had been caused. Our country has been making all effort which is the highest effort that we have made in the history. He said it is not easy to solve the problem with hard work, it needs the cooperation between all the countries. He made an example of 731 army during the second world war two, the outbreak of pathogens can cause significant social harm. We are still on our way to win the battle, but the effort still needs to be put in.
Community and Future
Also, we hosted two major meeting in Beijing, a Biosafety Forum in October, we invited team leader who runs his high school lab, lab teacher from a university lab, and a former team member from Peking iGEM2009, who participated in that DIY bio investigation ten years ago.
We concluded that the development of DIY bio should be taken seriously, and the permanent way to solve it is through implanting Biosafety awareness into our academic culture. Also, as iGEMer, we should strive to be the considerable and responsible leaders in our community, to ensure the biosafety issue has been taken properly. Another meeting was with biology Olympians all around China, we discussed the future of biology community during the meeting, especially with more and more high school iGEM teams coming up in China, but lack of relevant instruction and education to the students. We came up with the idea of setting up a collaboration between school to share and overcome difficulties hand in hand. This kind of meeting will be continued after iGEM2018, since the community usually grows fast after every iGEM season.
Hopefully, years later, biosafety awareness and considerations can be seriously taken"

Presentation of Synthetic Biology in Lycée Montesquieu
IGEM Bordeaux also wanted to raise teenager's awareness of synthetic biology. On 2015, May, 21st, Jean, Savandara and Lily made a presentation of synthetic biology at the school ""Lycée Montesquieu"" in Bordeaux, showing its interest by giving some interesting applications.
Ethical aspects of synthetic biology
Before analyzing the ethical aspects of synthetic biology, it seems important to clearly define this new area of biology.[1]
What is synthetic biology?
Synthetic biology is a new field of research in biology which mixes science and engineering. It focuses on the conception and the construction of new reliable functions through the creation of biological systems or the re-engineering of organisms which already exist. The singularity of synthetic biology compared to traditional biology is about engineering live beings to have a predictable behavior. In order to do so, scientists focus on optimizing existing biosynthetic pathways or creating new ones while bypassing or suppressing inefficient pathways in order to increase productivity.
Three different approaches exist in synthetic biology:
✵ The metabolic engineering of the living beings by using biobricks (DNA sequences whose functions and assembly conditions are known). The biobricks are free of access on the WEB and can be synthesized on request.
✵ The production of minimal genomes and simplified organisms where new functions can be added to realize a task. This approach is often used for the optimization of existing processes.
✵ The synthesis of a whole synthetic genome that will be inserted in existing cell hosts or in synthetic cells. This field of synthetic biology may help scientists to understand how living organisms are created.
The organisms which come from these approaches can be used in both industrial applications (for example to produce drugs, biofuels, biomass or biopesticides) and in basic research as tools like biosensors ( E. chromi - Team Cambridge, 2009) or against pollution ( Physco Filter - Team TU-Munich, 2013). With these new tools emerging from synthetic biology, many possible fields conducting to different experiments in science permit the intellectual and technical expansion. Bioethics is necessary to prevent researcher about its ethical limits.
Researchers in synthetic biology
The advances in biotechnology techniques also lead to dangerous possible applications causing a general fear of modified organisms by the public. They may be afraid of the organisms that can be created by synthetic biology, afraid that these organisms will somehow grow out of our control or have unexpected properties and will become dangerous for"

FFpred_wrapper: reads in fasta files and creating models out of them through random forest (A big chunk is called by known_protein and the other bits by sequence data)
Sequence_data: Predicts cry genes from raw genome sequence using idba_ud, genemark, and then hmmscan, blast and running the ML model. Also writes the result to a final directory, and three less detailed pure lists for easy comparison.
Utility: Anything that might be shared by other scripts that isn't related to Machine Learning.
Metabolic: (formerly: ""testcode"") All of the code needed to run various tests on the metabolic model I was fiddling with. (and a call to the R script that produces the output?)
Week 26 (12th)
Blast and the hidden markov models were able to retrieve 2 proteins in my test set that my RF model was not. gene_5934|GeneMark.hmm|310_aa|+|3109|4041
gene_5931|GeneMark.hmm|119_aa|+|362|721
The purpose of my RF model however was to differentiate between proteins similar to cry proteins and those that are not. I think I'll make a consensus sequence of all the non-cry proteins and then see what that blasts against to know which supergroups to exclude. Consensus Sequence was built using hmmemit after hmmbuilding with a clustalo stockholm file of the sequence. In the end I blasted all sequences against all cry proteins, took the best hit and I can see that there is a limited number of super groups which it hits against
Also got pandas and tree interpreter so I can have a closer look at the randomforest and maybe make some kind of summary.
The new randomforest called Unbalanced_RF was made using all cry proteins, the trembl hits and a number of proteins that interpro scan said definitely said have non-cry products (only like 20ish or so)
This new RandomForest model however only hits 2, so now it's too specific. Trying to see how I can open it up using treeinterpreter.
Week 27 (19th)
I have decided to let go of the false positives thing and focus on analysing the modelling. The binsizes don't seem to matter and can probably be removed entirely, I compared the 200 random cry vs Trembl not cry with 0 bins, and that already had great scores.
More work on improving the entire pipeline, but also incorporating a  scoring function for the Hidden Markov Models.

Bioabsorbent Introduction
    As mentioned before, heavy metals including mercury and lead can cause significant damage to the environment and human health as a result of their mobilities and solubilities[1]. Present technology including immobilization and extraction relies upon chemical precipitation or chelating agents[2], both of which are commercially impractical, lack of selectivity or sensitivity and not eco-friendly[3]. High performance and inexpensive methods to decontaminate heavy metals in water body, therefore, are highly desired.
    There are natural proteins, which can immobilize heavy metals to reduce the toxicity, exist in eukaryote and prokaryote. Most"

The focus of my studies is the cellular response to obstructed DNA replication, and how disturbances to this process contribute to genome instability using the budding yeast model system. This is the third year that I have worked with iGEM but different from the past two years I am not an adviser, and the project is less about the bio and all about the business. It is has been a great experience for me to see the world from this perspective and I look forward to a future in research and development of a product I had a part in creating. The rest of my team and I hope that this is the launchpad for a successful business and we are excited about this opportunity to present our plan in this competition.
