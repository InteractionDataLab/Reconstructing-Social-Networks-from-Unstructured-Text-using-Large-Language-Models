Jun 7 ~ Jun 13, 2010 We find Antimony is a good way to translate SBML files into human readable form, so I read some documents on libsbml. Liao and I discussed on the project of PKU2009, we both agreed the simulation of it will be a tough job.
Jun 14 ~ Jun 20, 2010 I write a PPT on UI and give a draft of my design, the PPT focuses on input and output. The design of input seems pretty good, but we get stuck in output. How should we present the result to players? It is a hard question. We decide to add drag and drop features throughout the game to make it easier to use and play.
Shangyu Luo
Now we have two choices: developing the whole process of simulation and model by ourselves or learn from other existing software and utilize APIs as much as possible Start to learn some knowledge about SBML and libxml as we will use them as format of presentation and interaction.

Penn,2013,Team:Penn State#ButanolProject_-_-_TEXT.html,". It is also expected that GC-MS should be able to detect the PHB from  the leaf cuttings.
Discussion
The preliminary results were inconclusive primarily due to issues with staining. The dye used was  not very soluble in water and produced a colloidal suspension. This resulted in some of the dye binding to  the surface of the leaf indiscriminately giving us false positives. A better dye that can more readily  penetrate the leaf and have better solubility may be required to obtain a clear result.
Further Study
The future goals are to continue testing with the Castor and PhaC constructs in Nicotiana, and  expand to testing in Physcomitrella. We are going to work on getting clearer microscopy results and GCMS results.
Another goal for the Butanol project is to assemble and test the Pollux construct for the  production of n-butanol. At this time we could also complete a protein extraction on samples using the  His-tags and categorize the 2A sequence utilized in the project. This could help us to ascertain the  efﬁciency of the 2A sequence in the respected test organisms.
Further categorization of the submitted constructs and their products is an ongoing task.

Ordered primers that will clone out the pSB4K5 (a biobrick vector with a kan cassette, http://partsregistry.org/Part:pSB4K5 ) backbone with homology to the ZFB-wp-his3-ura3 construct. We will then connect the two with Gibson assembly.
To this end, we need to use the biobrick DNA sent to us to transform chemically competent E coli.  Unfortunately the 384-well plates that they are stored in could not be found because Andrew is out of town--hopefully they will turn up tomorrow.

Result of OZ052 and OZ123 Transformation
Last Friday we plated out the transformed bacteria for the two OZ controls in 10 ul and 50 ul volumes.  They both yielded colonies, but the 10 ul plates only had a handful while the 50 ul plates had around 15-20 colonies each.  We picked four colonies from each plate and grew them in LB/spec so that tomorrow we can perform a miniprep and send them off for sequencing.  We should know the final verdict by Wednesday regarding which ones are good or bad.

The images obtained by fluorescence microscopy, which are given in Figure 1, revealed that the weak promoter, BBa_J23114 , presented high variability in the expression of RFP between cells, indicating a high level of noise. Contrarily, RFP expression was more uniform in the bacterial cells containing the medium promoter Bba_J23106 . Similarly, another medium strength promoter BBa_J23110 , showed uniform level of RFP expression, although less consistent than the observed for BBa_J23106 . Expectedly, the strong promoter, BBa_J23102 exhibited high RFP expression in cells and a low level of noise was observed.

Figure 1. Fluorescence microscopy of RFP under the regulation of four members of the Anderson promoter collection, ( BBa_J23114 , BBa_J23110 , BBa_J23106 and BBa_J23102 ) on pSB1A2 in E. coli MG1655 at OD600=0.3-0.5. BBa_J23114 displayed a low and noisy expression of RFP, whereas both BBa_J23106 and BBa_J23110 showed a more uniform expression of medium intensity. The strongest promoter, BBa_J23102, exhibited a high level of consistent RFP expression
The noise levels observed by fluorescence microscopy led to the design of an experiment, by which the cell population could be quantitatively studied. The change in expression levels and noise during growth of cell populations were tested for the weak and strong constitutive promoters, for which flow cytometry was used to assess the expression of the RFP reporter system. First, the cell populations were studied in LB media with 50 µg/mL ampicillin, thereby maintaining similar conditions as for the fluorescence microscopy experiment. All cultures were prepared from overnight cultures, obtaining a starting OD600=0.005.
Figure 2. Flow cytometric fluorescence measurements in arbitrary units as a function of time. Left: Cultures were grown in LB medium. Right: Cultures were grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% glycerol. Fluorescence of RFP expressed by the weak and strong constitutive promoters were measured relative to the negative control WT E. coli MG1655. Samples where measured in technical replicates and standard error of mean is shown, but are in several cases indistinguishable from the graph.
The data obtained in this experiment revealed that the strong promoter displayed a higher basal level of RFP expression than the weak promoter. Moreover,"

Microtubule Model
Introduction
To achieve our goal of arming yeasts with microtubules, we plan to display tubulin monomers on the yeast surface and culture the yeasts in a buffer that is rich in tubulin monomers under appropriate conditions to allow spontaneous microtubule polymerization on the yeast surface.
One of the key dynamics in this process is the competition between the polymerization in the solution and that on the yeast surface. We obtain the tubulins in the solution from our secretion module, and they are a valuable resource, so we want to use them as efficiently as possible. Intuitively, we know that due to the dynamical instability of microtubules, as we increase the concentration of tubulins in the solution, the number of microtubules assembled on the yeast surface will increase at first, but will gradually reach a plateau where the additional tubulins added to the system mostly polymerize in the solution. We hope to verify this intuition, find where this plateau begins and obtain the minimal concentration of tubulins in the solution that satisfies our needs.
Another thing we are interested in is how some microtubule-stabilizing agents like Taxol® can affect the polymerization process. They inhibit microtubule depolymerization by curbing GTP hydrolysis (Elie-Caille et al., 2007; Mitra and Sept, 2008). A detailed analysis of this effect can help possible future efforts to use our system to screen these agents.
In order to address the above problems, we need to be able to describe and simulate the microtubule assembly process. Taking note that stochasticity plays an important role in the polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules, we decided to construct a stochastic chemical reaction model (Mcquarrie, 1967) and conduct simulations with Monte Carlo method.
Model Formulation
We shall first describe the background settings and some basic assumptions of our model.
We consider a solution of tubulin dimers with a certain initial concentration. The tubulin dimers have already combined with GTP, which is essential for polymerization to happen. The enzymes and ions needed for the polymerization process are all optimal and"

Meetings with institutional actors and experts in various fields
We also present the solution aether to a number of actors in the fight against pollution. We made them discover our solution based on synthetic biology and we benefited from their feedback to improve the design and scenario of our device. Thanks to these meetings, we truely improved our knowledge of the air pollution fight ecosystem.
The international conference on Atmospheric Sciences and Application to Air Quality (ASAAQ)
This conference was initiated in Seoul in 1985. Since then, ASAAQ has been held in Tokyo, Shanghai, Seoul, Seattle, Beijing, Taipei, Tsukuba, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Jinan, Seoul and Kobe. The ASAAQ Conference covers broad topics on atmospheric sciences from the observation, analysis, to the simulation of air quality on all scales (from urban to global), including emissions, transport, diffusion, chemistry, removal processes, impacts, and air quality management.
ASAAQ 14 took place in Strasbourg, France from the 29th to the 31st of May 2017, and fostered scientific discussions and exchange of information on the latest research and practical applications of atmospheric science and air quality issues. Three of our members attended the ASAAQ conference and presented the aether project to air pollution experts from around the world. After the conference, we were able to talk to researchers. Those conversations allowed us to confirm the relevance of targeting PAHs.
Breath Foundation The Breath Foundation aims to bring together all the actors involved at the national level in the fight against respiratory diseases. Its main mission is to encourage and support the development of research projects in the fight against respiratory diseases and their causes, thanks to funding from patrons and public generosity. We met the president of the foundation on July 5th. This meeting allowed us to receive expertise on pollutants and respiratory diseases. We also validate the relevance of our targets, and our choice to focus on indoor pollution. Finally, we got a feedback on the overall project.
Skype meeting with Mr. Rémi Pampin, electrical engineer
This meeting allowed us to make a lot of progress on the design of our device. Indeed, we were looking for a technical means to achieve our goals of designing an affordable, simple device, modeled on a kit ""Do it yourself"". In addition to recommending us to learn about printed electronics, Mr. Pampin has given us valuable advice about the electronic design of our circuit.

In the first part of BlueLeaf, we designed the conversion of CO2 to formic acid by electro-conversion to obtain precursors for formaldehyde production. In order to better understand the electrical conversion technology and the structure and function of micro-electric conversion device, we came to the Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry of CAS to learn electric conversion technology from researcher Kang Peng on September 27. Researcher Kang Peng’s main research direction is the rational design of carbon dioxide reduction catalyst and catalytic mechanism. He told us the principle of fixed carbon dioxide conversion, the benefits of using electricity to produce formic acid, the current status of research and future development prospects. In addition, Kang showed us the miniature electric conversion devices in their labs and demonstrated the operation of the conversion devices in the lab. We are(were) deeply surprised by the magic of electrochemical technology.
TIB Yeast Genomic Engineering Lab
In May of this year, when we were troubled in how to prepare for the Blue Leaf project, we had the honor to contact with Jiang Huifeng, a researcher at Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology and Chinese Academy of Sciences. Guided by Jiang, we identified a specific experimental program. At the same time, we were invited to TIB Yeast Genomic Engineering Lab, visiting the first-class modern biology laboratory, learning the specific laboratory practices and experimental procedures. Mr. Jiang gave us a lot of practical guidance and suggestions, which helped our young team grow rapidly.

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#SmallPhage#Cholera - Detection#Period4#Dailylog_-_-_TEXT.html," Today we made a plan of exactly what we need to do in the next week and coming months. Our biggest priority at this time is sequencing the plasmid from last years iGEM team. I was reading in the iGEM registry, and I saw that there is a pIG78 A and B. We tried A, but we haven’t tried B. On Monday we will try to transfer B into E. Coli and see if B works better than A. Next week our goal is to completely sequence the plasmid to see if something is missing or incorrect. I also need to do more research to understand better what last years team did and also the specifics of how we are going to set up our phage and how we are going to induce the lytic cycle in the presence of cholera.
- KK Today we set out some long-term priorities for what we should do from here on out. Our priorities: 1. Determine is the QS circuit working? We aren’t getting RFP right now … what’s wrong? a. We need to determine what primers were used to amplify the HapR and Qrr4 out of cholera b. What is the difference between pIG78 A and pIG78 B? There are two plasmids that are the same? We hope to KNOW the answers to these questions by Thursday 2. Clone CI behind Qrr4 promoter; determine where in plasmid and order primers order primers 3. Clone CRO behind HapR promoter DONE by Mid-May 4. Modify tails of phage (after C1 and CRO steps complete) DONE by summer 5. If possible, use selectable marker on phage to purify many E. Coli that have prophage incorporated into the genome. So these are the steps we set out, we need to discuss with Dr. Grose where we should be the C1 and CRO genes, because the plasmid is already very full. Personally, I need to understand the plasmid we’re using, the Lambda repression circuit, and the Lambda tail proteins better.

- KK The other cholera-subgroup is successfully growing biofilm. They have found that cholera biofilm grows best in a salty solution (their best imitation of seawater) at 37 C. Today we set up a quick experiment to see how our pIG78d+ E.Coli would respond to the presence of cholera.

What is Synthetic Biology
By Emily Taylor
Synthetic Biology is a new and developing field in biology that combines the areas of biology, technology and engineering. In 2005 the European Commission convened a high-level expert group to define and examine the development of the new field. The report begins by defining Synthetic Biology as ""the engineering of biology: the synthesis of complex, biologically-based (or inspired) systems which display functions that do not exist in nature. This engineering perspective may be applied at all levels of the hierarchy of biological structures – from individual molecules to whole cells, tissues and organisms. In essence, Synthetic Biology will enable the design of 'biological systems' in a rational and systematic way"". [1] The biological devices that can be utilised in Synthetic Biology include enzymes, genetic circuits and even the redesign of existing biological systems. Synthetic Biology draws knowledge from Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology in order to create this new field of highly-scientific engineering. The main focus of the field is in design and construction of things that can"

STEP 1: DIGESTION
For PCR products :
~ 3–4 µg of PCR product
2.5µL of restriction enzyme 1
2.5µL of restriction enzyme 2
10µL of buffer (i.e. NEB 4)
1µL of BSA 10X
xµL of H2O to reach 100µL
Incubate at 37C o/n. The day after add 1µL of DpnI at 37 deg C for 2 hours.
Please note that PCR product must be purified before digestion.
For plasmids:
~2–3 µg of vector
1µL of BSA
1.5µL of enzyme 1
1.5µL of enzyme 2
5µL buffer
xµL of H2O up to 50µL
The day after add 1µL of phosphatase (CIP or SAP) to the vector and incubate for 2 hours at 37 deg C.
STEP 2: PURIFICATION
Purify the digested PCR product and digested vector with a kit.
Follow the kit’s protocol.
Subsequently, check the concentration by UV/VIS or electrophoresis for quantification.
STEP 3: LIGATION
Find here our ligation calculator !
Prepare your reaction and incubate at RT for 2 hours. Transform half of the reaction into 200µL of “homemade” competent cells (DH5a, NEB10b, Novablue or other appropriate strains) following a standard transformation protocol. Plate all the cells.
STEP 4: SCREENING
If your reaction worked the control plate should have none or few colonies. If you are working with psB1C3 or other RFP containing plasmid, you can screen colonies by looking at the color.
RED: no success.
WHITE: ready to screen.
Grow 6 separate colonies, each in 10 mL of LB + antibiotic overnight at 37°C.
Miniprep and quantify.
Digestion:
DNA ~1.0 µg
10X buffer 2
enzyme 1 1µL
enzyme 2 1µL
10X BSA 1

Fudan
Although we are from the same school, we chose totally different projects and tracks, and worked in different labs. In wet lab, Fudan and Fudan_China discussed about experiments and debugging methods almost everyday! There was frequent reagent exchange between us, like competent cells, enzymes and antibiotics. For example, team Fudan received Tetracycline and Chloramphenicol from us, while we obtained DH5alpha competent cells from team Fudan. Also, we borrow experiment equipments in each other's lab when needed. In dry lab, Fudan helped us to meet the professor of biophysics, and get some enlightenment of the diffusion model. In the meantime, we taught Fudan how to make an interactive animation of their models on their wiki.
ShanghaiTech
We submitted our parts to the part library built by the team ShanghaiTech. We discussed the problem with team Shanghaitech and they helped us figure out an available algorithm in August. And we talked about the possibilities of dividing our circuit into smaller parts that can be delivered by their multilayer signal processing system, so that the load in each cells may be decreased.
We also worked together in dry lab work. There was an approximate process in the origin integrase model, the rapid equilibrium, which causes the difficulties in infinitesimal method for simulation.
Peking
We had a phone call with team Peking in late August. Due to the similarity of our system, we discussed about the integrase experiment details. Peking answered our questions carefully. It was helpful for us to modify our experiment on integrases.

One of the modelling areas in this metal sequestering project is to model the behaviour of our kinA sporulation system. This is a system which we hope to use to tune the frequency of sporulation.
This is a model which is being developed in CellML, via COR, and SBML, via COPASI.
This model has also been integrated into the population model, via JSim.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," biological sciences where tools are made freely available to enable new discoveries to spur innovation.
Oversight: Control and surveillance by an external authority, usually the government, in the practices of a certain professional group in society.
Professionalization of synthetic biology: A governance strategy for synthetic biology where regulation is combined with the advantages of self-governance so that scientific progress can occur in agreement with public values. This would mean that the synthetic biology community would be given delimited authority over synthetic biology practices, granted by statutory legislation. Practitioners would therefore have to be licensed in order to practice it. The concept makes an attempt to overcome the seeming dichotomy between a self-governing community of synthetic biologists ('bottom-up') and external regulation imposed by government ('top-down') (Weir and Selgelid).
Reductionism: A philosophical position which analyses and describes a complex phenomenon as representing a simpler or more fundamental level than the intricacies of the system appear to indicate. According to this position, the complexity of a system can thus be reduced to explanations of its individual constituents.
Reflexive modernisation: Process of modernisation that manifest itself in the risk society whereby reform and adaptations of already existing institutions (i.e. politics, science, economy) are essential to accomplish progress. The role of science and technology here is instrumental in re-evaluating such institutions like science itself, as technology is also considered to be the cause of the new hazards in this risk society. Science and technology are thus used in a reflexive manner to manage the risks of technologies developed in the process of modernisation. The adaptations and reforms are hence found in the way science, politics and business operate, thereby generating strategic concepts such as sustainability and precaution with which they can set out a new trajectory. On a political level, this reflexivity has expressed itself through subpolitical forms of non-governmental organisation and new social and environmental movements.
Risk: A situation of uncertainty in which some of the possible outcomes involves an undesirable outcome. In this case, the way a system operates and behaves is well-known so that one can anticipate the outcome and quantify the distribution of risk probabilities. As a result, assessing risk can be calculated objectively and rationally under conditions of controlled uncertainty (Gross 2010: 61).
Risk society: A society increasingly preoccupied with the distribution of (technological) risks, and ""dealing with hazards and insecurities induced and introduced by modernisation itself"" (Beck 1992:21). These risks differ from other times because ""(1) they are undetectable by direct human sensory perception; (2) they are capable of transcending"

• Anti-cancer yoghurt
• Zebrafish
• Alzheimer's disease
• Neural Network
Members of the group also held a probiotic yoghurt workshop for the anti-cancer project, where members of the public made yoghurt. The audience were informed about the project and opinions were gathered. Again, the fact that the porject was medical was well received, though some ethical concerns were raised so that we knew we would have to make bioethics a big part of our project from the start.
April & May
Exam period - iGEM work to commence full time after the slog through exams.
June
5th June
Group discussion concerning the project idea to be carried forward - favouring the 'Anti cancer project'. Roles were then assigned to team members present for intial research roles for the week:
Cancer research roles:
1. Ruxi Comisel - Proteins upregulated in cancer of the intestines. Specifically in the outer epithelial cell (enterocytes) – in microvilli. Also, what actually is... gut cancer? A general overview would be useful…
2. Khaicheng Kiew - Our chassis (bearing in mind that we will also build it in E. coli as a backup). We need to think what would make a good chassis in our case (ie. naturally found in the gut in an obvious one), and how well does the chassis fit.
3. Alex Bates - What will the killing mechanism be? A broad overview of cancer treatments is required, specifically detailing how a bacterium can administer the treatment.
Considerations:
a. The bacteria may secrete a toxin etc – how will we ensure that it doesn’t simply diffuse through the gut?  b. If it is a toxin, what sort of biosynthetic pathway is required? c. Does the bacteria trigger apoptosis in the cancer cells (ie. an intracellular killing mechanism)? How can this be done from an extracellular bacterium? Perhaps beta-arrestin? d. Are there any treatments which we can take advantage of specifically because we are using bacteria?  e. For example, a protein which creates holes in the cancer cells? Does using a bacterium open up the possibility of using a different cure that currently isn’t in use because we cannot target it to cancer cells – could the use of bacteria allow this?
4. Weiling Yuan - Targeting – do we use antibodies? What previous projects have used bacteria expressing antibodies? Are there any other ways of doing this? Perhaps the latching and initiation mechanisms"

It is important to mention that without the help of all our supervisors , the BananaGuard project could not have come so far. The combination of knowledge and skills of our supervisors was vital to build our project from the scratch. Some were previous iGEM members, others experienced molecular biotechnologists, bioinformaticians, modelers and plant scientists. Without doubt we can say that we were very lucky to have such a diverse group of people giving support to us and our project. Moreover, we highly appreciate all the Saturdays, Sundays and evenings that they spent in the laboratory to give us access and supervision.
Plant Research International
A special thanks goes to Gert Kema’s group from Plant Research International for supporting us from the beginning of our project. We would like to thank to Fernando Garcia Bastidas who was our main advisor for all aspects related to Fusarium infection and plant science knowledge. And also Maricar Salacinas who helped us with one of our interviews. The group was always friendly and very keen on providing us with anything that we needed - whether it was fusaric acid compound, greenhouse space, banana plants, Fusarium data or a GMO license for the greenhouse. We share the goal to save the bananas and together provide alternative solutions. To learn more, have a look at their wonderful website .

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html," Figure 4). ANY, represents parts on ONE chain and the number of represented parts can range from zero to infinity. For example, a DNA species with structure ANY - pTetR - ANY represents any DNA with part pTetR.
Figure 4: Template DNA species
A reaction with template species as its reactants, modifiers or products is a Template Reaction. A template reaction describes the core structure of reactant that causes the reaction to happen and provides a specification for generating reactions with the same mechanism. This could be understood more clearly by dividing parts in a species into functional groups -- a reaction template describes the interaction mechanism of these functional groups. For example, pTetR promoter is deactivated in presence of TetR dimer. The template species are pTetR DNA template and TetR dimer protein template (see Figure 5) and the functional groups are pTetR promoter and TetR dimer. All the parts of ANY should also be counted as a functional group, though they don’t have functions in this reaction. Any pair of species which partially contain pTetR DNA and TetR protein dimer respectively would bind according to the description of this reaction template. Modeling with templates allows users to define species and reactions only once for one certain family without rewriting them again in database.
Figure 5: Template reaction
We are still looking for more substituents. We are planning to have more detailed substituents that can replace certain number of parts on certain number of chains. Even the arrangement of parts and chains can be specified. We believe it will make our template modeling more powerful.
A Standard Language
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. We will discuss a few relevant topics in the following sections.
Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language
With plenty of information for automatic modeling needs to be stored, we design our database, and develop a standard language of describing the database. We call the language: MoDeL.
MoDeL (Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language) is a database representation format for synthetic biology automatic modeling. This project of MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models on a number of topics, including cell signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, biochemical reactions, gene regulations, and so on.
MoDeL is developed as a machine-readable format in XML fashion, programming languages with XML library API (such as libxml2 for C++) are strongly recommended for reading MoDeL database. USTC_Software has been devoted to the standardization"

98°C                  30sec   10X      98°C             10 sec      Annealing**      30 sec      72°C             x sec*** 72°C                  5min 4°C                   hold
** Anneal at Tm + 3°C. The Tm should be calculated with the nearest-neighbor method.
***The extension time is usually calculated according to the shortest piece with 15 sec /kb if the cloning is not complicated. For example, if there is only one insert and is shorter than the vector, say, 600 bp, then I will use 15 sec for extension. Refer to the published paper for detailed information.
DNA Purification
Back to top
Materials :
E.Z.N.A Gel Purification Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Cat No. D2500-02 )
Water bath equilibrated to 55-65C
Microcentrifuge capable of at least 10,000 x g
Nuclease-free 1.5 ml centrifuge bottles
Absolute (95%-100%) ethanol
Protective eye-wear
Isopropanol (for fragments < 500 bp only)
Protocol:
Perform agarose gel electrophoresis to fractionate DNA fragments. Any type or grade of agarose may be used. It is strongly recommended, however, that fresh TAE buffer or TBE buffer be used as running buffer. Do not re-use running buffer as its pH will increase and reduce yields.
When adequate separation of bands has occurred, carefully excise the DNA fragment of interest using a wide, clean scalpel.
Determine the approximate volume of the gel slice by weighing it in a clean 1.5 ml microfuge tube. Assuming a density of 1 g/ml of gel, the volume of gel is derived as follows: A gel slice of mass 0.3 g will have a volume of 0.3 ml. Add equal volume of Binding Buffer (XP2). Incubate the mixture at 55C-60C for 7 min or until the gel has completely melted. Mix by shaking or inverting the tube every"

Freiburg,2012,Team:Freiburg#Team2_-_-_TEXT.html," some time together away from the lab to strengthen  team cohesion. We had a barbecue in Nico´s garden, bike tours around Freiburg and the obligatory late night search trip for food between gel extractions. Our work together was not only on a professional level but brought us together as friends and we surely will keep it that way beyond iGEM.
In the following, the freiGEM team members will introduce themselves:
Who we are
Student Leader
Nicolas Wyvekens
I´m a third-year medical student and the student group leader of our iGEM team. What I like most about iGEM is the opportunity to work on a project that we, as a team, have come up with and planned ourselves. As a medical student, I hadn’t received much training in molecular biology techniques, so it was very challenging for me to plan the project. Besides learning new lab skills, it was an important lesson to deal with frustration when days (and nights) of intense work turned up no positive results. In the end, it is even more rewarding to see that our idea actually works very well and that it attracts great interest from ’real’ scientists.
Master students
David Siegel
I'm 25 years old and studying biology in the 8th semster at the Albert-Ludwigs University Freiburg. Currently, I'm in the master programm and preparing to start my master thesis in the field of syntehtic biology and biotechnology.
The whole theory of synthetic biology, the idea of organising the seemingly chaotic structure of nature thrilled me since the first time I heard of it. When I got news of a new iGEM team I instantly took the chance and joined. Through the iGEM contest I was able to follow a project from the idea on a piece of paper, all the way to proof of concept experiments and final evaluation. I experienced the ups and downs of being in a team with people of so many disciplines and I got the chance to take part in every step that was necessary to make something happen.
Lisa Jerabek
I´m studying biology in the 8th semester and will start my Master´s thesis in the research area of synthetic biology in October.  By joining in on freiGEM2012 I accepted the challenge of planning and realizing a self-made project in my research area of interest. I considered my participation in the iGEM team as an opportunity to broaden my expertise in many respects. For me, a really important experience was to face the difficulties of lab work in a large team of members with profoundly varying skills and to learn how"

THINGS TO TRY FOR NEXT TIME
Chop up the lyophilized silk into smaller pieces
I placed large chunks of silk into the HFIP today
Concentration Dialysis
Started at 3:00 PM
Aim for 17 hours on the concentration dialysis, so end it at 8:00 AM tomorrow
I'm doing 17 hours because so far, even 19 hours has caused the silk in the cassette to gel.
ANOTHER NOTE: I accidentally made the concentration solution 100 g PEG in 1000mL water, instead of 100 g PEG in 900mL water, as the protocol states. So I fucked up, this causes less osmotic pressure on the cassette, so honestly I won't be able to tell if it was the lower osmotic pressure or the shorter concentration time that makes a difference tomorrow.
ENDED at 8:10 AM the next day
Enormous differences!
The dope was so much easier to remove from the cassette
I believe that I removed most, if not all of the silk in the cassette (~3 mL)
It's not as viscous as the dope usually is when extracted from the cassette.
Pipetted 100 uL to test the concentration.
There was 0.014 grams in dried silk, meaning 14mg/100uL = 140mg/mL = 14% w/v."

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Best Basic Part Special Prize
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are *many* opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts. To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!"

BioBrick Parts to achieve each medal requirement
Bronze
We created 30 new BioBricks [1] for bronze medal criterion. And have documented and submitted them to igem Registry.
We introduce ispA ( BBa_K1653003 ) of them. This biobrick is Key BioBrics in ""Flavorator"" project. ispA encodes Farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Farnesyl diphosphate synthase can utilize both dimethylallyl and geranyl diphosphates as substrates, generating geranyl and farnesyl diphosphate, respectively. Therefore the enzyme can catalyze two sequential reactions in the polyisoprenoid biosynthetic pathway.
Silver
We created 3 new BioBrick devices for silver medal criterion.
Terpene precursor mass-production device( BBa_K1653024 )
To realize ""Flovorator"" we need to make E. coli produce a large amount of terpene precursor. Surprisingly, We have succeeded in its mass-production by terpene precusor mass-production device. Our new biobrick device worked as expected."

Michael Doerksen (Wet Lab Volunteer)
Michael is in his third year of Life Sciences. He saw QGEM as an exciting opportunity to see the process of a research project, and learn more about synthetic biology. He also hopes to learn valuable lab skills while working in a collaborative environment. Michael wishes to continue his studies, and pursue research once his undergraduate degree is complete.
Andrew Grebenisan (Dry Lab Volunteer)
Andrew is in his third year of Biochemistry. A few months ago, he had the chance to witness a QGEM presentation in his introduction molecular biology course, and since then, he felt as if his life was changed. He began researching synthetic biology, and realized that THAT was what he wanted to be doing in his life. Because of QGEM, he decided on pursuing a computing minor, thus giving him either bioinformatics or synthetic biology as career options after he graduates.
Julia Grein (Volunteer Liaison)
Julia is in Biochemistry with a Certificate in Business, away on a co-op placement in Business Development. Although away from the lab, Julia identifies herself with bacterial contamination, not just because she’s small but mighty, but also because she just won’t get away from iGEM! This being her third year with QGEM, she’s taken on a new role to help manage the team. When she’s not doing research, having too much fun with Microsoft Excel, or writing QGEM newsletters, she’s at the gym or lost in Toronto without data.
Christina Li (Dry Lab Volunteer)
Christina is in her second year studying computer engineering. She was introduced to QGEM through one of her engineering projects to create a blue-light transilluminator, and seized this opportunity to integrate the two things she loved: programming and synthetic biology. With high school-level biology, she found some concepts intriguing but difficult to grasp, nevertheless Christina is more than willing to sit down and crack some code or model some data. She appreciates QGEM in providing a team where she can collaborate with others and continue learning about genetics.
Deyang Li (Dry Lab Volunteer)
Deyang is in his second year of Life Sciences. He was drawn to QGEM because of its uniqueness as a student led undergraduate research team, as well as the potential applications of synthetic biology, from pharmaceutical applications to oil remediation. He currently helps with the dry-lab, and outside of QGEM, Deyang"

Help from BIT-China
May 2nd, 2018, we borrowed CEN.PK2-1c modified by Team BIT_China in 2017.Their work in 2017 altered a few steps of the pheromone pathway, which were
Knocked out Ste2 receptor in order to eliminate the probability of yeasts getting affected by native ligand-pheromone.
Knocked out Sst2, the GTPase-activating protein for Gpa1p, as a receptor-desensitizing factor in order to eliminate possible up-stream GPCR signal conductive decline due to incessant stimulation.
See resource 1 resource 2
Knocked out Far1, the cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitor in order to eliminate side effect to cells’ life circle and formation due to signal intensification in MAPK pathway of the pheromone pathway.
More information
Their modification work provide us with great convenience in our work in 2018.
In August, we borrowed original yeast CEN.PK2-1c from Laboratory Li Chun which Team BIT_China was attached to. The yeast did not undergo modifications below.
Utilizing α-yeast from the lab of Professor Li Peng as a signal source, we stimulated original yeast imported plasmid of report gene in order to test the function of report plasmid.
More information
We compared the result of ligand combination reaction before and after knocking out the relative gene in yeast, verifying the contributions the modifications made in the elimination of side effect.
How we helped BIT-China
In this year, we make a model based on our research of diagnosis model for Team BIT-China to help them construct the relation between Hydrogen peroxide input and fluorescence intensity.
Model Background
According to the share of team member in BIT-China, we notice that when the amount of probes are far more than the Hydrogen peroxide. The fluorescence intensity is probably proportion to the concentration of Hydrogen"

PICTURE
Additionally, katG-LAA was built into a PSB1C3 backbone. The construction and availability of all these parts will be critical in the construction of our overall circuit for biodesulfurization. Colonies which looked good on cPCR were used to prepare overnight cultures, and were miniprepped and sent in for sequencing verification the following day. On the side, M9 minimal media was also prepared to carry out growth experimentation and overall desulfurization capability of Rhodococcus when exposed to DBT. The various growth treatments were M9 Media and glucose only, M9+glucose+DBT, M9+glucose+MgSO4+/-DBT, M9+glucose+MgCl2+/-DBT. 0.008g of FeCl2.4H2O was also added to each of the tubes. Samples were then inoculated with colonies of the Rhodococcus.
Denitrification
This week we took our last readings from the experiment that we started last week. The OD600 readings taken at 117 hours showed minimal growth over the weekend for all strains except for environmental strain #29 (with carbazole) which increased from 0.086 to 0.313. No other strain showed an increase of 0.100 or greater. This shows that only strain #29 was able to thrive in the carbazole media, possibly indicating that it contains the pCAR plasmid enabling it to use carbazole as a nitrogen source. To verify this we used a new ammonia assay protocol to measure the production of ammonia in the different cultures and theoretically how much carbazole was degraded. Unlike the previous assay we were able to produce a standard curve with a consistent slope based on samples with known amounts of ammonia. However, the only samples that showed any elevation of ammonia levels above the blank were the LD1 samples that were cultured with ammonia chloride to control for the possibility of pseudomonas using ammonia as a nitrogen source. The ammonia levels in this sample were relatively constant which would indicate that the LD1 was not using ammonia as a nitrogen source. Unfortunately the fact that none of the test samples had elevated ammonia levels did not give us any evidence that these strains contain the pCAR plasmid.
Ring Cleavage
Since we could not obtain any positive colonies from last weeks colony PCRs we began the transformation"

We focused on possible application of self-assembling peptides (SAPs). SAPs have a self-assembling ability because they are amphiphilic peptides, that is, peptides composed of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. These electrically charged amino acids interact with one another to form spontaneously antiparallel β-sheet in a physiochemical environmental condition.
In this project, we used one of SAPs, RADA16-I (RADARADARADARADA) and P11-4 (QQRFEWEFEQQ).
Fig. 1. RADA16-I and P11-4 self-assemble under suitable physiochemical conditions
due to the polar amino acids and hydrophobic interaction and form β-sheet.
Fig. 2. Forming multiple GFPs ring (Self AssembRing)
RADA16-I has been established for 3-D culture of neural stem cells (NSCs) by creating nanostructures. P11-4 has been designed to form fibers at low pH and have a cytocompatibility.
Recently, SAPs have proved to be good biological materials. We investigated new application methods of SAPs through discussions. Finally, we decided to construct multi-enzyme-complex platform using SAPs and short linkers (SL). They are covalently linked with each other through disulfide bonds and may constitute circularized multiple enzymes (Self AssembRing).
In the future, we will construct a tool for making subunits of artificial multi-enzyme-complex by using this technology.
Self-Assembling Peptides
Recently, self-assembling peptides (SAPs) have been noted as biological nanostructures and hydrogel because SAPs are provided with biogenic suitabilities and don’t have cytotoxicity. SAPs have been used as a scaffold for cell culturing and drug delivering in tissue engineering and medical technology."

What is the Open Lab?
Genspace has a unique opportunity to expand its impact beyond its physical presence in New York and bring hands-on involvement with synthetic biology to schools and communities around the world. The Open Lab is the key step towards this vision; it is the complete set of knowledge, tools, and resources required to successfully develop a thriving community biolab, all created following open source principles. Enthusiast communities and organizations around the world can partner with the Open Lab to fill in key gaps in knowledge, tools, or resources to launch their own community biolabs.
What is currently being developed for the Open Lab?
Genspace is currently focusing on two essentials projects that will form the core of the knowledge and tool components for the Open Lab.
Open Lab Blueprint – visit OpenLab-Blueprint.org to view
The Open Lab Blueprint is an easy-to-follow guide to launch and develop a sustainable community biolab. The website is a work in progress and is hosting at OpenLab-Blueprint.org. This Blueprint is a holistic view of the community biolab and includes the following components:
Starting up a lab, including identifying the right space, acquisition of key equipment, and efficiently implementing safety standards and best practices.
Developing a community, including building awareness, developing programs of engagement for students, the amateur scientists, and the general public, and collaborating with the broader scientific and educational communities.
Creating unique content, including educational resources, using the Genspace curriculum and engaging activities, focused on tailored, site-specific explorations and experiments.
Operating a biolab, including a resource base of protocols for standard genetic engineering activities, geared towards a budget-constrained lab, operational best-practices ranging from procurement of reagents to proper storage of experiments, and financial sustainability models.
The Open Plasmid is a key tool for the community biolab. Genspace has partnered with Cathal Garvey, founder of Indie Biotech, to design an open source and IP-free plasmid for the community biolab. The Open Plasmid is a core platform on which many experiments in a community biolab can be built on, essentially the equivalent of an Arduino for the citizen science community. The plasmid is designed to be easily modifiable, and therefore approachable to everyone from weekend researcher to curious high school student. The plasmid is also designed"

Germany-wide SynBio Day
See the press release from the LMU.
The Synthetic Biology Day is an initiative by all German iGEM teams. It is a public event with the intention of explaining and opening communication on the field of Synthetic Bilogy to the general public. It was held on August 25, 2012 in the following cities: Bielefeld, Darmstadt, Frankfurt, Freiburg, Göttingen, Marburg, Munich, Potsdam and Tübingen .
In collaboration with the TU Munich, we organized and participated in the SynBio Day activities for the city of Munich.
People that were interested could fill out a an easy quiz to check how much they know about Synthetic Biology. The quiz was a good opportunity to explain basic stuff about gene technology. Especially in Germany, people are very skeptical about everything that deals with GMOs. However, almost all people that took the time to listen to us what Synthetic Biologist aims to do, were excited about the possibilites and didn't express any fears.
Children could take part in a drawing contest. Every child draws a picture about an animal with an extra ability of a different animal.
We think that was a very good way to get to talk with people that normally wouldn't get in touch with Synthetic Biology.

Executive summary
A concise document describing the team's goals, actions and achievements
iGEM Cambridge-JIC 2014
Working with the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, we are the first team with the privilege of being able to generate stable plant transformants, grown with little effort on agar plates.
As such, throughout our iGEM experience, we had two main goals. The first was to develop a project that had a real and valuable application and which would work ''with'' the complex multicellular machinery that nature hands down to us in Marchantia. Our second, and perhaps more important, goal, was to build a foundation for future engineering of Marchantia, both for iGEM teams and the wider scientific community.
mösbi, the Marchantia Open Source Biosensor, was a project that enabled us to bring these two together. The idea is simple: mösbi is made up of input, processing and output modules. These modules communicate by way of the transcription factors GAL4 and HAP1.  mösbi is truly open source: modules can be developed completely independently of each other, so long as they adhere to the simple framework. They can be 'installed' either in the lab, by direct Agrobacterium Mediated Transformation, or at home, by growing up plants with individual modules built in, and then simply crossing them.  A biosensor (which detects, for example, heavy metals in water) which can be shipped as spores, grown and propagated with virtually no resources, speaks for itself in terms of value to those without need for expensive equipment to assay their essentials.  Furthermore, the innovative use of Marchantia's inbuilt haploid reproduction machinery - that is, Mendelian crossing, provides a unique meeting point for synthetic biology in the lab and at home.  We think of mösbi as one of the first instances of consumer biotechnology.

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," emphasis as we designed our user interface, where we incorporated graphs and visually uncluttered representations of the analytics from the hydroponic farm, but also longer in depth reports if more analysis was desired.
JUNE 9, 2017
Helical Outpost
Helical Outpost is a military hydroponics outreach based in Louisiana which trains military veterans into hydroponics farmers in 6 weeks. We talked Kohlie Frantzen, who told us that they invest substantial time into creating standardized farming training using ideas from oil drilling sites. They also have invented a greenhouse that can be easily deployed in all climates and work as the village’s or town’s hub. They operate with the big theme of local sourced food. We hoped to learn which components of hydroponic farming are crucial to a successful setup and what techniques they found worthy of monitoring and standardizing. Helical Outpost's biggest concern is ensuring that the electrical components of their green houses do not fail and waste a full cycle of crops. They informed us that a way to see live data from hydroponic tanks would be extremely valuable. We hence ensured our user interface clearly displayed real-time analytics in an easy to understand format.
JUNE 15, 2017
Amhydro
We talked to Joe Swartz, VP of Commercial Sales and Technical Support at AmHydro, one of the largest hydroponic equipment distributors in the US. We hoped AmHydro could evaluate how marketable of a product OxyPonics is and whether or not OxyPonics would gain traction in the hydroponic community. Joe gave us insight on both the farming and technical aspects of hydroponics. We discovered that customers decide to upgrade their systems usually when there is a large return value, even with high initial costs. Currently, Amhydro is working on a way to effectively and easily keep track of data from crops using software. This would make growers' lives easier, since they need expensive documentation and certifications in order to produce food.Our software therefore provides longer term records of hydroponic conditions over time, in addition to real-time analytics.
Outreach Innovation
Overview
In our outreach, we aimed to improve our own methods and skills for communicating complex topics like synthetic biology effectively. However, we did not stop with our mission to “ learn to teach ”. We gained insight about the potential hydroponics has to meet the produce demands of large cities. According to research done by Columbia University’s Urban Design Lab, urban agriculture in cities not only address questions of food security, but also encourages social development, public health, and environmental education [1]."

And all the source materials in Synsketch are open. Other teams can browse and edit all our genetic circuits. Besides, our Synsketch system is a standardized and reusable education system. We will write a tutorial about our education system to help educators better understand our activities. Also all of our activities can be launched in most of the high schools, colleges and educational organizations. So both our Synsketch tools and Synsketch education system are reusable by other teams, educators and engagers.
Did the team learn from the interaction with the public?
Through the interaction with the public especially with students,we know about the public’s interests on synthetic biology and how much do they know.These data may help us perfect our promotion work in the future.Besides,we also learn about the problems that other iGEM team meet,and we think of how to further improve our project to help them solve the problems.More importantly,interaction help us know more about the market requirement and gap.Therefore we can develop a viable business model.
Best software tool
What was the overall quality of the tool?
Our cloud-based tool--Synsketch has three main functions: designing and editing genetic circuits, saving and sharing, learning more about synthetically parts involved. These three main functions may help synthetic biology lovers design a standardized genetic circuit easily and efficiently. And it has three features: standardization, adaptation and instruction. With other additional functions like personal account, multi-language interface and well-classified tags, Synsketch is able to inspire scientific curiosity among the public.
Has the team built a software tool that people would find useful?
Yes.We develop a cloud-based tool-- Synsketch-- to help people design a standardized genetic circuit easily and efficiently.Synsketch is easy to learn, modify and share,therefore it can help people to save lots of time creating a standardized genetic circuit.We have done a survey on how long it takes iGEMers to design a genetic circuit.And the answer was 30 minute on average.However,with Synsketch,people can design a genetic circuit within 15minutes.Synsketch helps people save time as well as draw standardized genetic circuit. So people will find it very useful. The most educative part about Synsketch is that all the genetic circuits designed by Synsktech include a direct link to the iGEM official data base about the information of synthetically parts. Such function save lots of time for users to look for information about all parts involved in a genetic circuit one by"

Complete the SPAM tool's oligo coverage designer and golden gate part packager - December 2009
Currently the SPAM tool is under development. There are two major pieces currently. The first is a oligo designer for sequencing which produces oligos for a sequence trading off the number of oligos produced with the confidence in the sequencing result. The second produces oligos to create parts using an alternate assembly method known as Golden Gate . This work is being done with the Joint BioEnergy Institute .

Valencia Survey Participation Gold Medal
For all of our projects, we worked with a number of different groups both to make our tools more visible, as well as get valuable feedback. This section discusses some of these collaborations.
UC Berkeley iGEM team - we worked very closely with our wet team counterparts to tie our Kepler based assembly workflows with the Beckman Coulter BioMek 3000 liquid handling robot that they used heavily in their work. In addition we beta tested our software with them, incorporated their feedback, and ran tutorial sessions on Clotho use and how to write Clotho plug-ins.
Stanford iGEM team - we provided early versions of Spectacles to the Stanford iGEM team so that they could test it out. In addition we worked with them to incorporate new iconography as they added it to the SBOL Visual effort .
University of Minnesota - Emma Weeding worked with us both in the development of Eugene as well as making sure the XML it exported worked with SynBioSS .
Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI) - we worked with Nathan Hillson, Will Holtz, and Tim Ham at the Joint BioEnergy Institute on our SPAM tool as well as discussing ways in which design flows for synthetic biological devices should be constructed.
Valencia iGEM Team - In addition to many other iGEM teams, we filled out their survey and received a gold medal (100% team participation).

Fig. 3-7-8. Comparison of N99 and JM2.300
4. Discussion
N99 cells (CI+) showed higher fluorescence intensity than that of JM2.300 cells (CI-). From this result, we assume that our RM/lac hybrid promoter was actually activated by CI. In addition, N99 (IPTG-) showed lower fluorescence than that of N99 (IPTG+). From this result, we can assume that our RM/lac hybrid promoter was repressed by LacI derived from the E. coli genome.

Part 2. Add anti-cold gene ( cspD2 )
    According to previous research, we know that cspD2 can express cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria. Therefore, we obtained the cspD2 fragment by in vitro synthesis, and constructed the cspD2 overexpression strain. Verify the cold resistance performance of the recombined bacteria with nisin as inducer.
Part 3. Demonstration
    Because we use nisA as promoter to express our parts, 0.5 ng/mL of Nisin is required to induce cell expression in all the following steps.
    Demonstration of msmK gene
    Copy msmK gene from Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 gene group with PCR. Construct msmK overexpression strain L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmK with electrotransformation. Take strains L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmK and L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149 from glycerin tube kept under -80℃, dilute 1/25 in 2 x 10 ml fresh medium (30 °C). Grow until the OD600=0.4. Count their number of colonies per ml at pH 4.0 (More details can be seen in protocol).
    We can get the following results:
Fig 3 Number of colonies at acid stress (pH 4.0).
Fig 4 Survival rate at acid stress (pH 4.0).
    The result shows that msmK is an effective anti-acid gene, which can make the recombinant strain has 213-fold higher survival rate than parent one.
    Demonstration of composite part msmK-cspD2
    It has been reported that cspD2 can effectively exert anti-freezing effect in the recipient bacteria. CspD2 was ligated to the pNZ8149/msmK plasmid by one-step cloning (seamless ligation), and the recombinant plasmid was introduced into the constructed L. lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmk-cspD2 strain using electroporation.
    The gfp gene was inserted as a marker gene, and cell viability was characterized by fluorescence intensity. The strain was tested for acid resistance and freezing resistance using a flow cytometer. The process of acid stress and cold stress is similar with the above demonstration process.

This would lead to all four components being dependent upon the production of the others, and we hypothesised that this pathway could be tuned so as to give different ratios of each fatty acid in the fatty acid profile seen. The ability to finely tune the ratios of the fatty acids produced would open doors to specialised oils, such as a high-oleic cooking oil for instance. Moreover, having the system essentially feed itself (after the initial input of glucose) rather than using exogenous stearic and oleic acid to feed the later pathways would hopefully reduce operating costs. This would only be the case if the fatty acids being added to the media worked out more expensive than the glucose needed to maintain the reactions. Whilst an exciting concept, we didn’t feel like we had the time during our project to properly attempt this. Maybe it’s a job for a future iGEM team!
The alternative to having all components produced within one batch of cells is to have each construct expressed in a separate batch of bacteria. This is a much more simple route, as problems such as plasmid conflicts would be eliminated. In essence, different ratios of oils could still be achieved by adding each component to the others at a specified volume after being extracted from the culture. After speaking with a representative of a company who uses palm oil in their products, they expressly said that producing the components of palm oil in separate batches would be the best scenario. This is because crude palm oil, once it has been processed from the fruit, is then fractionated to give separate fatty acids according to their physical properties anyway. Therefore, logic suggests that having separate batches producing each main component of palm oil would reduce the need for further processing down the production line.
Ultimately, the team decided that producing oleic acid and linoleic acid separately would be the best route to take, and so that’s what we did!
Homogenisation vs. exogenous feeding
Because we had chosen to produce our fatty acids in three different production strains, it was necessary to feed our transformed E. coli with fatty acids to produce the product we wanted. Without this exposure, the proteins would be translated but there would be no fatty acid for them to act upon. The ‘Delta 9’ strain had to be exposed to stearic acid to produce oleic acid, and the ‘Delta 12’ strain had to be exposed to oleic acid to produce linoleic acid.
We had two main options: breaking the cells open (homogenisation) or exogenous feeding. Both options had pros and cons associated with them. Homogenisation would allow the fatty acids and"

Interviews
The feasibility of any project ultimately depends upon the support of society. This year, Edinburgh tried to engage with actual participants in the debate around synthetic biology and genetic modification. To that end, we conducted interviews with people representing several organisations.
The questions we asked were partially prepared in advance, but also partially a response to what the interviewees said.
Some discussion of these interviews has been placed on the separate Interview Analysis page.

Friends of the Earth is an international environmental group.
Eric is based in the U.S. and has a background in sustainable agriculture policy but is increasingly involved in critical analysis of synthetic biology. He was interviewed via Skype video, by our team members Yassen Abbas and Fionn Tynan-O'Mahony.
Fionn asked what FotE thinks about synthetic biology.
FotE accepts the precautionary principle: we need proof that a technology is safe before proceeding with it. Proponents need to show a certain level of safety and the ability to mitigate risk. Such a regulatory system doesn't exist in the U.S. though Eric thought Europe was slightly better in this regard. But there are insufficient safety tests.
Furthermore, test data is being kept as confidential business info; so we can't see what safety research has been done. We go forward and hope nothing bad happens; if a problem does come up it may be too late to do anything"

How Much Do You Know about Antibacterial Resistance
Before our report, let me show you some information from World Health Organization. ( http://www.who.int/topics/drug_resistance/en/ ).
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change in ways that render the medications used to cure the infections they cause ineffective. When the microorganisms become resistant to most antimicrobials they are often referred to as ""superbugs"". This is a major concern because a resistant infection may kill, can spread to others, and imposes huge costs to individuals and society.
April 30th, 2014, WHO releases a latest report ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE Global Report on Surveillance( http://www.who.int/drugresistance/publications/infographic-antimicrobial-resistance-20140430.pdf?ua=1 ),which introduces the situation of antimicrobial resistance around the world. Based on the data provided by 114 countries, the report indicates that Antimicrobial Resistance in particular antibacterial resistance (ABR) becomes a global problem and every have to pay attention to it. No matter Who you are or Where you are.
On the basis of knowledge we mastered, the most effective way to cope with antibacterial resistance is to exploit new antibiotics, which is the inspiration of our project Programmed Polyketide Synthesis.
Therefore, we make the survey How Much Do You Know about Antibacterial Resistance, in order to have a general overview about how the public uses antibiotics and judge is it necessary to exploit new antibiotics. Besides, we also broadcast the concepts of Antibacterial Resistance and Synthetic Biology and teach the ordinary citizens how to use antibiotics exactly( http://www.sojump.com/jq/3851816.aspx ).
Utilizing the National Day Golden Week holiday, we conduct the survey around Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center through two main ways: Distributing on the street and Filling"

6th Cebitec Symposium
European iGEM teams meet in Bielefeld, Germany
A review on the 6th CeBiTec Symposium Genome-Based Microbiology: From -omics Research to Systems and Synthetic Biology
The annual CeBiTec Symposium, first held in 2006, deals with prospective topics in the broad spectrum of biotechnological research. Each year international scientists come together in Bielefeld setting the focus on current innovations, approaches and methodologies. The issues so far included Solar Bio-Fuels (2008) , bioIMAGING (2009) and New Frontiers in Microbial Genome Research (2010) . The 6th CeBiTec Symposium was held under the topic Genome-Based Microbiology: From -omics Research to Systems and Synthetic Biology took place between the 18th and 20th of July, 2011. As this year’s topic included Synthetic Biology, this offered the opportunity for the iGEM team Bielefeld to add an iGEM session to the symposium’s agenda. The students accommodated five teams from all over Europe to present and discuss their past and future projects in front of the international scientific community.
Starting with one of the last year’s finalist TU Delft’s 2010 iGEM project about the conversion of different hydrocarbon sources in aqueous environments, all attending teams presented their results and strategies. The team from the University of Southern Denmark, Odense , presented their 2010’s project Flow E.

Biosafety is the utmost concern of our experiment! To exactly prevent accidental or unintentional exposures to pathogens or other unsafety factors, we do our best to make sure our laboratory safety, from the aspect of individuals, equipments, procedures, organisms, environment and gene polutions.
Individual safety
Everyone involved in our experiment has passed the biosafety assessment of biological laboratory. Besides, during our experiments, we strictly obey safety operation rules.
1） Hands must be washed before leaving the lab area. And lab coats must be worn when working with bacterial cultures.
2） No foods or drinks are allowed in the lab.
3） All bench spaces are wiped with 75% ethanol before and after using.
Fig 2 All team members have passed the Bio-lab safety exam held by Department of Biology， and these are certificates
Fig 3 Team members under lab coat
Equipments safety
The safety of our experimental equipments is guaranteed by legal company’s security certificate. All instruments that have been exposed to the source of suspected infections must be sterilized after experiments. Different instruments are all placed in their suitable places. For example, the sharp instrument must be collected in a special tool box. Besides, solid and liquid wastes are treated separately.
Procedure safety
During our experiment process, we strictly obey the protocol of every experiment. For example, we follow the miniMos protocol to prepare our injection plasmids system, microinject worms and select genetic stable worms.
Organisms safety

Each protocol on the site can be commented on by users and other researchers, allowing you to receive feedback on the way you carry out a certain experiment, as well as solve problems with tricky protocols.  Further, each protocol can be ""forked,"" that is, you can make a copy of any protocol you like to customize for your own lab's situation.  Adding pictures and audio to your protocols is easy, and even videos can be embedded as part of your procedure.  You also have the choice of associating a ""cheat sheet"" type list with each protocol, so that you can have something to take with you to the bench in lieu of the full protocol.
Usage Ideas
We envision several groups of people using openProtocol in quite a few different ways.  Here are some examples to get you started thinking about ways you can use openProtocol in your own research!
Teachers teaching an experimental class can use openProtocols and allow their students to individually annotate and edit the protocols for future classes.  In this way, extremely clear and usable protocols can be developed for classroom use.
Researchers publishing a paper that involves several new methods can include a link to an openProtocol as a supplement to their Materials and Methods section.  Having easy access to a complete protocol online greatly increases the speed at which new and interesting methods can catch on and become popular.
Lab managers can place all of a labs protocols on openProtocol to make standardization within a lab easier.  Individual lab personnel can customize protocols to their liking, and can directly embed them in online lab-notebooks or use the beautifully formatted printed versions in a traditional lab notebook.
iGEMers can use openProtocol to clearly lay out new and interesting ways to manipulate biobricks, as well as to standardize protocols for the most commonly done procedures like enzyme digestions and minipreps.  Many common mistakes can in this way be eliminated (""with enough eyes, all bugs are shallow."")
FAQ
OK, so where can I get started?
You can sign up [ here ] . Additionally, there will be a demo of openProtocol at the iGEM jamboree during our workshop on Saturday!
Is openProtocol open source?
Yes, openProtocol is open source, and all protocols included on the site are by default licensed under a Creative Commons license.  However, if some labs desire to have a protocol be kept private or copyrighted, that does not preclude its inclusion"

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," encapsulate our cells and use a microfluidic chip. Therefore we will try to develop this possibility in parallel with the 3D-printed agar chip.
We have set up a modeling pipeline. We divided the modeling project into 3 parts :
diffusion,
parameter fitting,
modeling of the genetic circuit itself, which comprises
a deterministic model
a stochastic model.
We know that the modeling challenges will be to model how integrases work, and to model the delay between reception of a quorum sensing signal and production of a quorum sensing signal by the receiver cell. Indeed, a colony could switch itself OFF when it should be ON, if it receives QS1 and produces QS2, for example. If a delay is present between reception of QS1 and production of QS2, the colony will produce GFP before it is switched OFF, and as GFP is stable enough, it will stay visible during a long time and the self-switching OFF won't be observed. This delay should be modeled.

Week 1 : Project selected
Wednesday, May 28th
After more than one month of endless meetings and passionate debates, we finally chose the project that will keep us occupied in the next five months. From the beautiful pattern made by the Sierpinski triangles, we will focus on cellular automata and try to implement one.
Sierpinski triangles appear when the rule 90 is followed by every cell on the grid :
Pattern given by rule 90 if only one cell is switched on in the first row at the beginning. The pattern appears row by row.
Ideally we will use a microfluidic chip. We could also use a 3D printed agar plate like this one to load the colonies. On this grid we can implement the rule 6, which is the simplification of rule 90 considered as a rule with 2 inputs : each cell computes a simple XOR gate of its two parents.
Arrangement of p and q cells on the chip
Pattern given by rule 6 if only one cell is switched on in the first row at the beginning. The pattern appears row by row.
The logic part will be built with integrases and the colony-to-colony communication will use quorum sensing.
Every colony will receive two quorum sensing signals (QSp and QSq) from the two cells above it. These two signals trigger the production of two different integrases r and s in the colony. Integrases enable to build biological XOR logic gates by switching twice a terminator. Indeed, every integrase can switch the terminator only once. Thus if the"

2010: Gene Doping Detection: Evaluation of Approach for Direct Detection of Gene Transfer using Erythropoietin as a Model System
In two mouse studies, blood was positive for a plasmid in some animals for 1–2 days and up to 1 or 4 weeks after intramuscular or intravenous administration. The sensitivity of PCR methods used in these studies was 100 or 1000 vector copies per mg of gDNA. In another study with mice injected rAAV intramuscularly, 12 whole blood samples from a high-dose group tested positive foxr viral DNA until day 28, but viral DNA in plasma was cleared within 3–4 days. The sensitivity of the method for vector detection in this study is comparable to that for the assays developed here. ( Baoutina et al. 2010 )
2016: Officials Fear Some Olympic Athletes Might Be Altering Their Genes To Cheat In Rio
Sarah Everts reported for Chemical and Engineering News that officials planned to test 2016 Rio athletes' tissue samples for markers of gene doping. The most likely subject of a genetic hack appears to be the gene that codes for EPO. Therefore, this gene became what the officials planned to test for. ( Letzter et al. 2016 )
Athletes at Rio Olympics Face Advanced Antidoping Technology
According to the International Olympic Committee’s medical and scientific director, Richard Budgett, samples collected in Rio will be tested for gene doping at some point after the games, even though the test hasn’t been run during the Olympics itself. ( Everts, 2016 )
2017: Doping Control Analysis at the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games
The EPO gene is mostly expressed in renal cells, from where the EPO protein is secreted into the bloodstream. The identification of any concentration of EPO DNA sequences  in blood however, are considered a positive result for gene doping within current detection methods. Considering the growing concern over gene doping, as well as the EPO availability of new molecular biology tools, the Brazilian Doping Control Laboratory (LBCD) implemented, improved, and validated 2 amplification assays for EPO cDNA using the real-time PCR instrument QuantStudio12K (Thermo Fisher, São Paulo, Brazil). All work was performed with WADA-certified reference material for EPO gene doping within a range of 1 to 4000 copies of reference material spikes and EPO gene-doping-positive samples. However"
Minnesota,2010,Team:Minnesota#Judging_-_-_TEXT.html,". Fluorescence intensities of RFP with weak promoter
Figure 5. Fluorescence intensities of RFP with strong promoter
Figure 6. Comparison of strong and weak promoters
In vivo RFP fluorescence was measured using a Becton Dickinson FACS Calibur flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm argon laser and a 585-610 nm emission filter (FL2) at low flow rate. Fluorescence for all the samples was recorded 6 hours post induction. Flow cytometry allowed us to pick the population of living cells and determine the amount of RFP that each cell was producing. For each sample, 50,000 events were collected and analyzed using FlowJo software (BD Biosciences).
As shown in figures 4, 5 and 6, the inducer concentration has no effect on the fluorescence intensity. For all the different inducer concentrations, the fluorescence remains more or less same for the individual promoters. This indicates that these 2 tet promoters (submitted by the Berkeley team) are constitutive. We calculated the geometric mean for the red fluorescence by FlowJo software, it is interesting to see that J23105 on an average shows a mean fluorescence value of ~21.0 which is less than half of the mean fluorescence values of J23118 promoter (, ~51.0, Figure. 6). The difference in both the promoters was very visible by naked eye. It could be seen on plates and growing liquid cultures, we could not resist clicking photographs of this clean result (Figures 7 & 8). Therefore we conclude that the promoters from the combinatorial library have different characteristics, some of them are weak ( Bba_J23105 ) and some of them are strong ( Bba_J23118 ). It would be worth trying these two promoters in a system, which requires relative expression of certain genes in the same system. We hope that our characterization of these 2 promoters is useful to future iGEM teams as well as other users of the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.

In fact, many students witnessed the fresco, maybe called doodles more appropriately, made by iGEMers from Xiamen University. Some of them took photos and asked us about iGEM. It improved a good interaction between our team and these students and tourists to popularize iGEM competition and synthetic biology.
Collaborations
First
We collaborated with Purdue iGEM team to create a definitive characterization standard for the parts registry. All the teams participated required to fill out a survey which was about the important items in the registry page. Purdue iGEM team worked out a standard protocol which contains all of the details. The other teams need to complete it better or put forward some questions and problems. To make this work easy, we had a video meeting with the Purdue iGEM team and USP Brazil team through the GOOGLE HANGOUTS. It really helped us to exchange the opinions just like face to face.
As we know, the members of this collaboration are currently over 50 teams so that it is the biggest collaboration in the iGEM history. We feel awesome about what we did!
Second
On April 5th, 2013, Haoqian Zhang, advisors of Peking University iGEM team, a famous iGEMer who is keeping on developing synthetic biology and iGEM in China, came to Xiamen University in purpose of strengthening collaborations our two universities. During his visiting, Mr. Zhang took part in discussions between our two teams, XMU- Software and XMU-China 2013 and gave some good advice focusing on the feasibility，security，advantages and disadvantages of ideas raised by our team members. His words about teamwork were very impressive and educational. Finally, Mr. Zhang simply showed some interesting projects in the past as well as encouraged us all to try our best to perform this year's iGEM projects.
Third
From the June 24th to the June 29th, We provided parts BBa_C0061 and BBa_I0462 to the Toulouse iGEM team due to the high transform difficulty they described using this year’s distribution. Toulouse could directly use them for their cloning ,while we got some valuable feedback about our parts.

Figure 11: Scores resulting from the synthetase-test system. The negative score results from the emission quotient CFP(475 nm)/YFP(525 nm) when cultivated without the specific ncAA. The positive score results from the emission quotient YFP(525 nm)/CFP(475 nm) when cultivated with the specific ncAA. The mean rank allows the combination of the negative and the positive score to compare the efficiency of synthetases among each other.
The Prk-RS has a medium to low negative score of 0.66±0.11, which means that without Prk supplemented to the media, native amino acids are coupled to the amber tRNA frequently. The positive score of 3.34±0.02 is high in comparison, thus it means a substantial increase in the expression of the whole fusion protein. The mean score is 2.02±0.07, which is, as far as we can assess, appropriate for further work.
The 2-NPA-RS has also a medium to low negative score of 0.73±0.07, which means it is a bit more specific than the Prk-RS. The positive score of 1.60±0.06 is very low, as it is not half as high as the positive score of the Prk-RS. This leads to a mean score of just 1.68±0.07.

Conclusion [3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Even if we could not give the proof by our own experiments, many studies show that to bring a wild-type version of a tumor suppressor gene into a mutated tumor cell for this gene permits to launch the apoptosis. In vivo studies on Human in the framework of the prostate, ovary and lung cancers have already been hold and present convincing results.
The implementation of this study has been originally done to determine if the DVS , application in the fight against non small cell lung cancer, is feasible or not. Because we have not been able to conclude, the implementation of the study has been done by analyzing several publications. According to these publications, the application is first confirmed in the framework of the chosen pathology but it can also be reached to others cancers like hepatocellular carcinoma, on which the fact to bring a gene suppressor of tumor launch the apoptosis process. The only limitation is set by the tissue vector tropism.

Since in this case the protein itself is the product of interest, pathway engineering as we discussed in the meeting today wouldn't apply the same way, except that an adequate supply of ATP and amino acids would be necessary. chris 20:09, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
Recombinant Protein Production and Transport Outside of the Cell
A problem that is protein based drugs are not transported out of the cell, the cell must be destroyed to harvest the protein.  We could implant a transporter that can be found in a Gram positive organism into the membrane of the cell to transport protein across the membrane.
There are 7 or 8 secretion systems that are very widely studied that could be looked at for this.
Redesign Characterized Promoters into Environment-Responsive Promoters
Once we have a list of characterized promoters we could look at their design and find a similarity between them and a promoter that is responsive to either a chemical signal or an environmental trigger.  If we can redesign a promoter into a responsive promoter than we should do that for all of our characterized promoters and see if they have the same relative gene expression intensity after redesign.  If so than we could explore redesigning them to respond to a multitude of different signals.  If we do this than we would have a diverse toolbox of promoters that would be a huge step toward standardization and characterization.  - Bussingkm 15:50, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

Results as follows:
We also started our experiment. Created plates and tubes and let grow for four hours. Added xylene to tubes. We let the plates grow longer but ended up with overgrowth. We'll have to regrow plates and try again. Tried making alginate beads with Peking protocol. Didn't form beads. Will try again later.
Aug 29th: Today we made chloraphenicol plates. We did more alginate trials-experimenting with [CaCl2], temperature, speed and amounts of alginate. We found we could only make beads with straight LB and forming them with molds. The Peking protocol did not produce beads for us. We also got results from LB trials. When we came in the LB looked totally normal. We couldn’t see any difference. After spinning the colonies down, we did get results. Please refer to the lab write up to see analysis and pics. As we couldn’t see amilCP in broth; doubt the alginate beads will work. They are totally opaque. We also made more colonies for further testing.

However, when growth is restricted during dormancy, the half-life of RelE is increased to 2000 min, corresponding to approximately one day, as the dilution effect is no longer applicable. As the protein complexes are relatively stable, their half-life was set to the same as RelE.

Tsinghua-A,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#invertase_-_-_TEXT.html," used two test parts, Secretory invertase and Pcon_mRFP_TT. Each of them are transformed into E. coli MG1655. E. coli MG1655 with different plasmids are called Peasant and Civilian (Despite their similarity to Peasant and Civilian, we cannot call them in that way because their genetic circuits are different after all.) separately, which do not have any invertase genes in genome. Peasant and Civilian will grow in M9-sucrose culture media, a special M9 culture media in which glucose is replaced by sucrose. Then there are only two available carbon sources, sucrose, if hydrolyzed, and arabinose, if added.
III Methods
1. Cultivate a pipe of Peasants and a pipe of Civilians for 12h.
2. Adjust their OD600 to be the same value.
3. Take 2ml each, and centrifuged them at 12000rpm for 1min. The supernatant was removed and each sediment was resuspended with 2ml M9-sucrose culture media.
4. Add 5ml M9-sucrose media and 100μl bacterial liquid, in which Peasants and Civilians are mixed. The concentration of Arabinose was set by adding concentrated Arabinose solution.
The experimental groups and control groups are listed as follows. The number ""1"" and ""3"" in the boxes are the numbers of repeats.
5. All of the groups were cultured for 20h. The growth was measured by flow cytometry. The number of cells is averaged.
IV. Results
The number of cells were counted and illustrated in the figures. Figure 1 shows the number of living cells in each group. Figure 2 shows the number of cells expressing mRFP in each group. Figure 3 shows the ratio of the number of cells expressing mRFP to the number of living cells.
Figure.1 The number of living cells
Figure 2. The number of cells expressing mRFP
Figure 3. The number of cells expressing mRFP/the number of living cells
V.Analysis
Figure 2 tells us that when Peasants and Civilians coexist in the media, Civilians grow more than the group in which Civilians live alone in the media. Also, the number of Civilians becomes larger than the negative control group if the primitive fraction of peasant is larger. Contrarily, the number of Civilians does not become larger if the primitive quantity of Peasants is too big while the original number"

Intro
Events
Media
As a team of students from the biological sciences, the value and opportunities offered by synthetic biology were clear to us. So, to demonstrate not only the importance of our own project but also create awareness of this exciting field of science, our team reached out to the general public. We organized and attended events where laymen and experts in the field of biotechnology and pharmaceutical waste met, and were featured in traditional media and trade publications. On this page, you will find an overview of these public engagements.
Events
Netherlands Biotechnology Congress
On Tuesday 22nd May 2018, the Netherlands Biotechnology Association (NBV) organised the Netherlands Biotechnology Congress themed Biotechnology in Harmony. We pitched our iGEM project and discussed technical, ethical and social subjects around our project.
iGEM Biotechnology Conference
In collaboration with iGEM team Aachen, we organised the iGEM Biotechnology Conference on 20th September 2018 for students, scientists and companies. Our main goal was to educate the visitors about biotechnological innovations and how it impacts society. Furthermore, we wanted to introduce the iGEM competition in general and both of our projects. At the end of the day, attendees had the possibility to meet each other and make valuable connections. See More
RIVM Network Day ‘Medicine Residues in the Environment’
The RIVM Network Day is organised for everyone who is involved with medicine residues in the environment. Current events are discussed in order to gain new insights regarding the issue. We were present to contribute to the discussion, follow workshops and implement relevant information from this day into our project.
Weekend of Science
The ‘Weekend van de Wetenschap’ (Weekend of Science) is an annual national event in The Netherlands for science and technology. During this event, several companies, research institutes, universities and musea open their doors to present their work. As part of this event, we, iGEM Team Utrecht 2018, got the chance to show our project to all interested parties. For this we invented a short game in which children aged from 8-12 years old and their families can experience how it is to perform experiments in a laboratory setting. Furthermore, we taught the children what bacteria are, what they like to eat, and how they grow in a petri dish.
Media
We wrote or contributed to articles for multiple journals and newspapers in order to inform people and create awareness around biotechnology, the iGEM competition and our project.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," design.
The splitting of biosensor components into separate cells may have additional advantages besides ease of variant production. Goni-Moreno et al. (2011) have previously suggested that the use of synthetic quorum sensing circuits enables each cell to be considered an independent logic gate, which may rectify the “fuzzy logic” seen in some biosensors, where stochastic cellular processes may produce false positive results. Quorum sensing has also been previously used to synchronise gene expressions, leading to reduced variability within a population (Danino et al., 2010).
Preliminary Experiment
In order to support our theory that genetic assembly is the rate limiting step in biosensor development, we attempted to assemble a simple GFP producing system using three engineering techniques: BioBrick, Gibson and Golden Gate. Further information about this experiment can be found on our interlab page . Gibson was the only successful technique we trailed, however, Gibson assembly is not an ideal method for circuit variant production due the the specificity of the overlapping regions: For example, to assemble ten genetic parts into all possible orders would require the use of 90 different overlapping sequences (Ellis et al., 2011). Therefore, the ability to generate circuit variants without the need for further genetic engineering would be useful.
Design Stage
To modularise biosensor components, it was necessary to first confirm which devices types are commonly found in biosensors. An in depth systematic review was conducted to determine these components. Team seeker, a tool for keyword searches of iGEM team titles and abstracts for the years 2008 to 2016, was used to identify biosensor based projects (Aalto-Helsinki iGEM team, 2014). The search terms used to identify potentially relevant projects were “sense” and “biosensor”. 121 projects were identified by these search terms. In projects including multiple sensors, the most well characterised sensors were used for this review. Sensor designs, rather than constructed biosensors, were used for analysis, as time constraints in iGEM often prevents project completion. Ten projects were unable to be reviewed because their wiki was broken. Of the remaining 111 projects, 18 projects were deemed not eligible for further analysis. This was either due to a lack of information regarding biosensor mechanism provided by the team or their project was irrelevant. Three projects were excluded as the sensing component of their project was unchanged from a previous project, to prevent the overrepresentation of biosensors in our database. Therefore, a total of 93 biosensors were used for analysis in our systematic review (Figure 3 and Table 1). The systematic review revealed"

GROUP SESSION:
Preliminary Projects Group Presentation (2nd Round)
Discussion of Papers & Ideas:
Sprinzak & Elowitz, 2005.
Combinatorial experiment.
Three TF and 5 binding sites.
Combinatorial and phenotypes analysis.
With a few well characterized elements much can be done.
Things to consider:
Next steps, future models:
Protein level phosphorylation (example: Phytocrome found in cyanobacteria that get phosphorylated when activated with a specific wavelength and eventually trigger the activation of TF.
miRNA (only in eukaryotes, not found in yeast)
Sequence-specific Ribosomes. (few well characterized)
Repressilator: Three genes that repress each other.
Signaling cascades
Not exploited yet.
Response time delay.
It is mentioned as the simplest system.
The noise is accumulated in these systems.
Design a signaling cascade and see how noise affects and spreads throughout the system.
Compare the noise of a two element cascade with the one of a three-element cascade.
There is evidence that to reduce noise in a noisy system, noise is introduced into the noise, and as a result the system becomes ordered.
Increase copies of the elements and see how does the noise is affected. Theory says that noise should decrease, see if this system converges to a deterministic system.
Compare strains with different protein production ratios. *EXPLOIT MORE THIS POINT*.
See if it is easy to do. However in this system it is very unlikely to find multi-stationary states.
Measuring noise is a potential problem. Do we have access to technology to measure it?
Experimental Technique: Promoters recombination.
Suggestion: Use PCR to avoid direct recombination.
Investigate the difficulty to study the competition between the two enzymes for same metabolite in a metabolic pathway.
In positive circuits it is possible to see multiple states.
It is not enough to have the network topology, the context also influences the outcome.
We need to check whether the module works in the desired conditions. Two modules working"

Summary
This summer, our team has guided high school students in Beijing towards future participation in iGEM HS Division, by forming alliance with official organizations in Beijing to make it a long-term program, giving series of quality lectures introducing Synthetic Biology & iGEM to high school students, analyzing HS students' situation through quantitative data, and teaching three HS students from SHSBNU directly to prepare them for incoming contests in 2013, both theoretically & experimentally. We hope this HP project, which is entitled ""Sowing Tomorrow's Synthetic Biologists"", could promote intelligent young minds to contribute to the fascinating subject.

Motivation
Synthetic Biology possesses enormous potential for the applications in boosting a nation's economy and improving people’s lives, as well as enhancing people’s understanding of the origin of life. As an emerging field combining conventional biology with physical sciences and engineering principles, synthetic biology calls for more lively and intelligent young men and women to generate ideas with considerable potential. This was the motivation for our team’s human practice project this year, “Sowing Tomorrow’s Synthetic Biologists”. Based on this goal, we desired to motivate the young minds of high school students to study synthetic biology and guide them towards future participation in the iGEM high school division.
Achievement
1.We briefly made a survey regarding high school division iGEM in Beijing and distributed it to students at The Second High School attached to Beijing Normal University (SHSBNU) in order to learn about these students and their interests regarding synthetic biology. Click Here

We set up another biofilm assay with AmyA. In triplicate we are testing 25ul, 12.5 ul, and 5 ul to test for the biofilm degradation and are incubating it at 30° for 48 hours.
9/30/13
We ran our biofilm assay on the overnights we set up on 9/28/2013 but it was unsuccessful. The cv stain was not fully rinsed and the plate microplate reader displayed considerable error percentage. We will have to wait until after the North American Jamboree to continue this assay.

Glycerol stocks of yeast parts
Innoculate cultures of transformed yeasties.
Test #1 on parts Z0267, Z0277, and Z0415
--------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately it appears that two of the yeast cultures did not grow.  These are the ZifA + ZifA reporter strain and also the null + Gli1R reporter.  The second one is more sever, given that it was intended for use today.  It is likely that the colony was simply missed during innoculation due to its small size.  Decided to use Gli1A + Gli1A reporter instead.  This is simply a test run of our protocol.
Took out of incubator around 9:45 am.  Diluted by adding 150 uL of each culture to 5 mL of fresh media.  Note that this is simply to get them back into log phase, so that it may not be important to make sure that the cell concentrations are identical for all three.
Put into incbuator again at 10:18 am.  Took them out around 1:31 pm.  Observed some apparent growth, but not a significant amount.
OD measurements: GliR had a range between 0.004 and 0.011.  For five measurements (repeated measurements from two samples), it had an average of 0.0074.  Put 100 uL of these cells directly into each well devoted towards testing the Gli1 repressor.
For W3031_a, the range was between 0.012 and 0.030.  For five measurements (repeated measurements from two samples), it had an average of 0.0202.  Diluted these cells to match the concentration of the Gli1R cells.  Added 2.5 mL of this culture to 4.3 mL fresh culture.  Then added 100 uL of this mixture to each well devoted to testing W303.  For wells that contain media alone, we added an additional 100 uL of the respective media in each well.
First plate reading done at 3:15 pm.  Second reading done at 4:18 pm.  Final reading taken around 5:07 pm.  Discovered some interesting patterns in fluorescence.  Saved all plate reader results in the Plate Reader folder on the iGEM computer.  However"
