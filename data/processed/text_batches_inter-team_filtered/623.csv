Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. For 2015, we're removing the track and introducing an award for entrepreneurship.
Note
In order to be considered for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award , you must fill out this page.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2015 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!"

The coverage of Cas13a is measured by counting the number of immediate neighbours to all units in the Cas13a protein. If the protein is covered with TDPs more quickly, they can form the glass-like matrix supporting its structure earlier, preventing degradation of the protein. In Figure 11, the number of immediate neighbours of Cas13a is plotted against the number of iterations per chain. All TDPs display similar development of coverage, but SAHS 33020 and CAHS 94205 display a steeper slope than the other proteins in their respective families and a higher coverage at 800 iterations per chain. This suggests that they are better suited for drying Cas13a.
Figure 11: Number of immediate neighbours to Cas13a against the number of iterations per chain for TDPs CAHS 94205, CAHS 106094, SAHS 33020 and SAHS 68234 at a concentration of 1 g/L and in a volume fraction of 0.1.
This result is partly reflected in the interaction energies calculated in the different TDP simulations. A steeper slope of the energy graph indicates that the phase separation occurs faster and that the steady state is reached at an earlier stage. Thus, Figure 12 implies that the two SAHS proteins and out of these SAHS 33020 would confer the highest desiccation tolerance to Cas13a. However, when comparing within the protein families, CAHS  904205 and SAHS 33020 show the best results again.

While the energy and Cas13a coverage development showed slightly different results, we decided to use CAHS 94205 and SAHS 33020 to dry Cas13a in further experiments , to have TDPs of both families to test in the lab. Additionally, we experimentally determined that these two proteins also had the largest effect on desiccation tolerance of LDH, which further supported our choice. All in all however, we expect that SAHS 33020 performs best in Cas13a drying assays.

LegoRoboBricks for Automated Biobrick DNA Assembly
BioBrick-A-Bot Model C is the prototype of an extensible Genomic Lab Liquid Handling System. We build it using Lego bricks, and it can be easily replicated by other iGEM teams and by researchers in Molecular Biology who cannot afford a typical, $10,000, commercial system. The design is modular plug-and-play, so that we can easily collaborate with future iGEM teams to modify or improve on its design and to add new functionalities.
BioBrick-A-Bot comprised of 2 LegoRoboBrick modules (ALPHA and PHI), mounted on a frame (BETA). Here’s what the acronyms means:
ALPHA – Automated Lego Pipette Head Assembly
PHI – Pneumatic Handling Interface
BETA – BioBrick Environment Testing Apparatus
This project needs great precision to position the pipette head accurately in 3-D space, and to transfer a few microliter of fluids. In order to achieve the much needed precision, we have replaced the Lego NXT firmware with RobotC firmware which provide floating point representations.  RobotC also gives us the flexibility to develop sophisticated C programs needed to drive this project. The computations to reverse-triangulate any point in 3-D space is also non-trivial. We use 3x3 rotational matrix to simplify our mathematical modeling .
Due to a hardware limitation of Lego Minsdstorm, each NXT brick can only be connected to a maximum of 3 motors. We need 6 motors for this project, and use 2 NXT bricks. We designed and implemented a Master Slave Synchronization System using blue-tooth wireless technology.  ALPHA is the master and when it is properly positioned at the right location, it will transmit wireless messages to PHI to request the type of pipette operations that it needs (either aspirate, dispense or clean).

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get

Marketing Plan Synopsis
There exists a significant market opportunity for cataract treatment worldwide. Over 3 million cataract surgeries are performed in the United States every year, and cataracts have attributed to 51% of world blindness. Although cataract surgery is the dominant procedure in this market, we have developed a product which provides distinctive advantages, and created a marketing plan which serves as a guide for establishing a successful business.

Fundraising Efforts for Cataract Charity
Lastly, we wanted to make a real impact in people’s lives who were experiencing cataracts. Despite our project’s goal of delivering cataract relief non-invasively, we realize that surgery is currently the most effective way to eliminate cataracts. So, we held fundraisers (in the form of bake sales and club fairs) in order to donate to those who don’t have funds or access to surgery. We raised enough money for 14 surgeries through the Himalayan Cataract Project, which serves underprivileged cataract patients.

OLS_Canmore,2016,Team:OLS Canmore#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," difference between the control and the cells.  This is either from the dye coming (dye bleed) off the feathers at this temperature, or this means the cells can actually all break down the feathers as at this temperature(E.coli may have natural proteases active).  This is unsure as no obvious feather breakdown can be seen in the cultures yet.
At 30 degrees Celsius, both cultures containing the Keratinase genes induced with 0.1mM IPTG are more purple than the 0.5mM and the control.  It appears that at 30 degrees there is not the same problem with the dye of the feathers bleeding as there is more of a difference between the control and keratinase cultures.
While there is no obvious feather degradation the results are still promising because they were only taken after 18 hours and contained a lot of feathers. We will continue to monitor the cultures over the coming days.
Toxicity:
There seems to be a toxicity issue with expressing keratinase in E.coli.  This is inferred because of slow growth rate, low OD600 readings, and trouble culturing cells.  This issue is more pronounced with the KerA gene and this after transforming the plasmids containing the promoter (that is a bit “leaky”)  and KerA coding sequence, we were unable to plate any colonies.  Therefore, all experiments were conducted using KerUS as it appears to be less toxic.
In the future however, we would like to create a plasmid with the Keratinase coding sequences downstream from a weaker and less “leaky” promoter.  Cell free protein synthesis is also a technique that could be more effective to yield high amounts of keratinase while keeping the cells alive.
These results were also collected before discovering the mistake of antibiotic resistance.  The slow growth seems more likely to be caused by growing in the wrong antibiotic.  But, because of keratinases strong proteolytic activities, it is still likely that high expression could be toxic to E.coli.
Cell Lysis:
The protocol can be found on our ‘Experiments’ page.
The supernatant of the cell lysis was plated on skim milk plates, but due to our inability to use many of the reagents and chemicals commonly used to lyse cells the protocol had low success.  The supernatant on skim milk plates (shown in the section below) show some cultures still growing indicating the the lysis was not wholly successful.  The supernatant was also fairly viscous and this made it difficult to load into a gel for SDS-page.
Considerations for"
UCL,2018,Team:UCL#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," from MIT were the first ones who tried to address the issue by publishing a standard registry of biological parts which didn’t have considerable success [1]. However, Tom Knight, one of their colleagues, who at the time was working in an artificial intelligence laboratory, proposed in 2003 a new standard called Biobrick [2]. BioBricks are DNA sequences which conform to a restriction enzyme assembly standard, building blocks which can be assembled in larger synthetic biological circuits from individual parts.
Over the years the Biobrick assembly has shown various flaws. First of all, it doesn’t allow for assembly of multiple parts in one reaction and it cannot be used for fusion proteins. Secondly, it produces a scar sequence which can be harmful for E. coli [3]. Even though, some of these issues have been addressed by improved methodologies such as the Silver or the 3A [4], [5], they are unnecessarily laborious as they require additional pre-screenings or, in the case of 3A, three different antibiotics.
Our BioBrick2.0 construct integrates different cloning techniques, such as Gibson assembly and Golden Gate assembly, into the iGEM standard. When cloned into a backbone through BioBrick Assembly, it enables the other cloning methods to be used inside the BioBrick2.0 sequence. The Gibson overlapping regions allow for high-fidelity cloning of constructs up to thousands of kilobases, as shown previously [6]. The Golden Gate recognition sites allow for seamless cloning and, applying methods such as MoClo and Golden Braid, this procedure can be carried out with multiple fragments in one single reaction [7] [8].
The purpose of the BioBrick is not to create a new standard because, as it happened before in synthetic biology, an excess of attempts at creating new standards can become detrimental [9]. As a consequence, our brick is meant to be a platform to BioBrick standardize constructs cloned using different methods to accommodate different labs’ preferences and boost the iGEM workflow.
Intein Monomers
Intein Monomer 1 and Intein Monomer 2
Initially we planned to clone constructs that would allow us to produce long spider silk proteins which could then be functionalised with proteins of interest using SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology. We later realised that instead of restricting ourselves to just one protein - spider silk protein, we could develop a much broader platform  to polymerise any protein of interest. To achieve this we thought about using split inteins for  polymerisation. We designed two constructs ,Bba_K2842680 and Bba_K2842690 that could work"

Checked if there were colonies after UV sterilization. Colonies did appear. We figured that the UV light was not transmitted through the entire layer of 700 µL of cells, so I actually plated non sterilized cells. For that, a new method was used.
New method UV sterilization: Plating 30 µL BolA pBbA5C transformed cells directly on selective LB plates and sterilizing these with the recommended powersetting of 120000µJ and 240000µJ. As positive controls 500 µL cells were washed 3 times with ethanol or heated at 95 ºC for 10 minutes; as negative control living cells were plated. All were incubated at 37 ºC overnight.
Solar cell experiment preparation: First, all cell pellets were diluted as such that same cell concentrations were yielded. Afterwards, these cells were UV sterilized 3 times with a power of 240000 µJ.

Peking,2018,Team:Peking#Human Practices#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," may give the synthetic biology community some inspiration. To gain a deeper understanding of biology in the 21st century, we need to integrate knowledge from various disciplines while biology-based solutions to societal problems can influence the world more profoundly.  In the following sections, you will go through our human practice in details.  Investigation on the education background of iGEMers     Figure 1    Figure 1 shows the geographical distribution of the number of teams. (2007-2018)   Figure 2.A    Figure 2.B  Figure 2.A, B show teams attending iGEM from different regions. Figure 2.A shows the number of teams in each year (2007-2018) . Figure 2.B shows the proportion of each year (2007-2018). Different colors of columns represent different regions.  In 2007, only 61 teams from around the world participated in iGEM, but iGEM has now attracted more than 300 teams from around the world for three consecutive years(305 teams in 2016, 338 teams in 2017, 370 teams in 2018).  Especially since 2015, IGEM has teams from Africa every year.  Overall, it could be found that the number of teams increases with the year. Though teams mainly come from Asia, North America and Europe, we still find more and more African and Latin American teams participating in this important event in the field of synthetic biology. We have reason to believe that the influence of iGEM in developing countries is gradually increasing.  In addition, we find that iGEM's influence in Asia, especially in the Western Pacific, is gradually increasing. Asia has become an important pillar in iGEM that cannot be ignored.   Figure3.A   Figure3.B Figure 3.A.B show the proportion of track selections in 10 years. Figure3.A shows the proportion in 2009-2013 and Figure3.B in 2014-2018. Different colors of columns represent different tracks. In the 2009-2013 track selection, ‘Foundational Research’ entered the Top 3 tracks that were most popular in the past five times, followed by ‘Enviroment’ 4 times, ‘Health’ 3 times, and ‘New application’ 3 times. In 2014, iGEM officially made major adjustments to the track.

TU_Darmstadt,2018,Team:TU Darmstadt#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," is able to decay naturally and without harming the environment [8] . This differentiates us from many other plastics, for example the slow degradable polystyrenes or PET.
Another advantage is, that we do not have to use solvents during the polymerization. In some cases, there is a need to use cancerous and toxic fluids to solve the monomers before the reaction. In our case, there is no such need to use solvents, because we polymerize directly in the monomer melt.
Local and Global Impact of our Project
As mentioned before, we managed to produce an environmentally friendly and sustainable synbio way to produce polymers. Throughout the process, we managed to avoid many toxic substances and provide useful alternatives. But how does this affect our lives and environment? Referring to the Environmental Integrity Project, in the USA alone, there was an expected greenhouse gas production from petrochemical factories of 86 million tons in 2015 [5] .Since these gases cause global warming that impacts all of humanity, a decrease in the demand for petrochemicals could lead to less petrochemical factories and therefore a lower greenhouse gas emission. Moreover, with reducing the interest in petrochemicals, the demand for oil and natural gas decreases as well. This leads to a lower risk of accidents with oil refineries at seashore or with fracking, polluting the ground water on land or endangering sea life through oil spills. Furthermore, in not using toxic solvents for our polymerization, we lower the risk of chemical leakage and potential catastrophes during their transport. So, there is also a positive impact on the local environment and ecosystem in not risking any chemical contamination.
We are aware that there is still a high need for alternatives to petrochemicals and that our project is just the beginning, but we are looking forward to a world of green thinking and innovation, in which we reduce pollution, regenerate the environment and provide a healthy future for humanity.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Merging Model_-_-_TEXT.html,". To define the electric response of droplet coalescence system, we used the concepts of electrokinetic model described by Tan et al. This model determines the voltage at the tip of electrode:
(13)
Here i2= -1. CE and Cl are the electric capacitances in the chip which acts as an electric circuit. Next, we we have mathematically removed the imaginary unit from the equation (13).
The cross-sectional view of the droplet coalescence chip is shown in fig.3.
We can rewrite the eq. (13) as
(14)
Then we do a complex-conjugation to get rid of complex number
(15)
After this we can return to the previously-used ratio of voltages:
(16)
From this relation we might find the tip-voltage expressed without an imaginary unit.
From eq. (13) we find the voltage:
(17)
The electrical capacitances are expressed in terms of coalescence chip dimensions:
(18)
The energy density created by an electric field is released into the wider channel (chamber). Multiplying the energy density by a volume of chamber leads to the electric energy supplied by voltage:
(19)
4. Kinetic and dissipated energies
In this section we derive the kinetic energy for the two droplets reaching the coalescence site. We apply the kinetic energy expression, assuming the droplets move in channel with the same velocity as carrier oil. The energy is written as a sum of energies of two different-sized droplets. We write the kinetic energy terms for the energy-balance equation for droplets in a straight channel (HW1) and in the coalescence channel (HWch):
(20)
(21)
Droplets moving through a fluid are exposed to drag forces the same way as solid bodies. The drag force acts against the droplet movement direction. The drag force acting on droplets is expressed by using the Stokes law \(F_{drag} = -6 \pi \eta R v\). Here R is the droplet radius, η and v the viscosity and velocity of the carrier oil. With these arguments the drag-created energy loss is written for two sections analogically to the kinetic energy:
(22)
(23)
It was argued previously that the systems of multiple fluids are dissipative systems . This argument is strengthened for the systems of similar viscosities of two liquids. The coupling between the inner and outer flows around droplets arises and its impact can no longer be neglected [6-7]. The energy dissipated in a coalescence (merging) of droplets will be"

We succeed in updating the SBML Ode Solver 1.6.0 to support SBML L2V4, but some unfixed bugs was found, so we turn to a better ode solver copasi , which moreover can flexibly display the ode solver output data and modify parameter to adjust the simulation output data curve. Obviously, those open source library and tools convenient to our design and implementation and help us to focus on our  core working.

UESTC-software,2016,Team:UESTC-software#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," up lots of their time and energy.
So they sought for our support of programming expertise. We carried forward the spirit of collaboration to solve their problems relying on our skills.
Solutions
In the communication process, our team members joined the lab to have an idea of what we could contribute. Through the analysis of the process and the dynamic combination of the varied data number, we decided to design an algorithm for the fast simulation and solve the complex work with MATLAB.
1.  We batched import data collected in the experiment to MATLAB to generate a matrix, which can give the results they need quickly and accurately. Besides, it can generate EXCEL files automatically to help them do further analysis.
2.  Another function is that the system can find out large data errors and remove these bad data. In this way, they don’t have to manually check, greatly improving the efficiency even more.
3.  On this basis, we also provided a further function of curve fitting. With smooth curve instead of scattered data points, it makes the results more intuitive, easier to understand and analyze.
Some results are shown in Fig.4 and Fig.5:
Fig.4. Enzyme activity data simulation.
Fig.5. Enzyme activity data analysis.
The program we designed helped UESTC-China reduce the time of data processing, made them come to conclusions and start next step as soon as possible.
Wet-lab help from UESTC-China
We cooperated with the team UESTC-China to accomplish the validation of our experiments. We thank our collaborator for helping us with patience and making such strong contribution to our work.
We created a platform for information storage in synthesized DNA. This coding tool can create a convenient DNA storage information workflow, so researchers can choose any file they want to encode and focus on synthesizing DNA. And we wanted to demonstrate our tools’ capabilities under real-world condition. So UESTC-China mentored us on how to design the gene sequence which contains the suitable restriction site. They helped us amplify the genes and put the genes into the plasmids. UESTC-China also transformed the plasmids into the E. coli TOP10 and extracted them from E. coli for sequencing.

It’s hard for us to finish such a job. With their help, we finally validated the software we created can perform its intended function. Once again, we would like to thank UESTC-China.

By Figure.1 ,we see that in the linear feedback conditions of cGMP(i.e.: M = 1), different state of sGC changes with the time of change: D1 plummets in a brief period when the reaction started, and then reached a nadir in 8 seconds or so. After a short rising stage it tends to be stable finally; D3, the intermediate product of reactions of NO and sGC experienced a period of increase in the first time and then went to the attenuation and finally reached the stability; D2 (i.e.: high-active sGC) reachs the steady state as the same after a brief surge and small amplitude fluctuations. Figure.2 shows the production rate of cGMP experienced process of rising and falling and the degradation rate of cGMP changes from fast to slow and how they tends to be uniform eventually. Figure.3 shows the phenomenon that the production of cGMP experienced process of rising and eventually tends to be stabilized.
Therefore, the autoregulation of cells has the function of making every sector of NO-cGMP pathway tend to be stabilized.

figure.7
In order to discuss how the feedback inhibition of cGMP influences the desensitization of sGC and the degree, we use Matlab to make four images, namely, Figure.4 to Figure.7. Figure.4 and Figure.5 are images of no feedback inhibition (i.e.: m=0). The changes of D1, D2, D3, Vp, Vd with time are very simple, either increase or decrease to stabilization, and there is no volume fluctuate with time during the period. However, when the value of the feedback degree of m is 2, great changes have occurred. Fluctuation degree of each volume is more intense compared with all sectors when m=1. But without any exception, all the volumes tend to be stable, which shows that our model is consistent with the actual law.

figure.9
Figure.8 and Figure.9 respectively show the relationship between NO and cGMP along with sGC in the case of cGMP linear feedback inhibition (m=1). We find that in feedback inhibition of cGMP the volume of cGMP is always less than that with no feedback inhibition. Meanwhile, apart from appearing sharply rising in the beginning and is higher than that with no feedback inhibition, as time goes by, the amount of sGC of feedback"

Toronto,2014,Team:Toronto#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," It contains in one convenient package the minimum essential components to allow the CRISPR/Cas9 system to work, including the tracrRNA, Cas9 gene, and crRNA array. A useful feature of pCas9 is that the spacer in the CRISPR array has been replaced with a placeholder sequence containing BsaI sites, allowing it to be easily swapped out using the Marrafini lab pCas9 protocol Golden Gate assembly for any desired spacer sequence.
However, pCas9 did not fully meet our requirements because its components are constitutively expressed ( see emails from Jiang and Marrafini ). In addition, the location of the Cas9 gene in the middle of the sequence makes it difficult to swap out the constitutive promoter for an inducible one.
Re-engineering pCas9
In order to facilitate the inducible expression of Cas9 while retaining benefits of having the essential components of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in one biobrick, we decided to re-engineer pCas9 by rearranging the order of its components. Our new design ( BBa_K1559002 ) puts the Cas9 right at the beginning (upstream end) of the biobrick, so that it is removed from the control of the existing constitutive promoters originally from Streptococcus pyogenes, and is instead exposed to transcriptional control from promoters added upstream of the biobrick.
Figure 2: A schematic of the rearrangement of pCas9 to expose Cas9 directly to the control of an upstream promoter.
Conceptually, this new design could be constructed by dividing the existing pCas9 part BBa_K1218011 in two sections, one containing the tracrRNA and bidirectional constitutive promoter region ( BBa_K1559000 ) and another containing the Cas9 coding sequence and CRISPR array ( BBa_K1559001 ). By joining the Cas9-array section to the upstream end of the tracrRNA section, we would have effectively moved Cas9 to the front of the part (see BBa_K1559002 ). The expression of the tracrRNA and crRNA array are unaffected because they have not been moved relative to their original promoters.
Testing Cas9 expression with various promoters
In order to test the effect of various levels of Cas9 expression, we planned on putting our reengineered CRISPR/Cas9 system under the control of Anderson constitutive promoters of various strengths ( high , medium , low ).
We also planned on testing various inducible promoters ( pBad , pLac , pRha ) with our"

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," without having to make the beads and use them in a specific amount of time. This would cause delay in treatment and also a lot of waste of materials.
Our first idea was to freeze the beads, however when they are frozen the structure of the alginate is compromised and the skeleton of the beads begin to break down. Therefore, we looked at storing the beads at 4˚C and then investigated whether or not the bacteria would again secrete GFP after being warmed up to 37˚C.
From this we obtained some promising data. Beads stored in the cold room for 20 days were taken out and warmed to 37˚C. Then we measured the fluorescence of these beads every 15 minutes for 20 hours. The graph of this data shows that fluorescence does increase over time, indicating that the bacteria are growing inside of the beads and continuing to produce GFP.
An initial issue with our beads was that the beads had to be kept immersed in media in order to ensure a supply of nutrients to the encapsulated bacteria. To get around this, we tried making beads with our media as the solvent so the beads would have media encapsulated inside them, and thus the bacteria could still survive if the beads were placed into water/urine/etcetera. This internal nutrient supply would help to increase the longevity of the bacteria over the duration of the treatment, with the result that the catheter would have to be replaced less frequently - thus reducing the discomfort and risk of infection for the patient.
The beads were made up using 30mL of LB + Chl and 0.36g of sodium alginate. We then placed the resulting beads into the plate reader and measured the fluorescence of these beads every 15 minutes for 20 hours. We plotted the data on the graph below:
The graph demonstrates that the bacteria do grow inside of the beads, but they reach stationary phase much quicker than the beads what were surrounded by media. This could be due to the lower concentration of nutrients available.
We then took a bead and looked at it underneath a confocal microscope in order see into the bead. This gave us some incredible images of the bacteria fluorescing within the beads.
This photo shows clearly that GFP-producing bacteria are encapsulated inside the bead. This is our main evidence that we can get bacteria to survive in the beads.
Using confocal microscopy, we also took images of multiple layers of a bead and stacked them together to build up a 3D image of the bead and the bacteria encased within.
We then began to probe the edge of the bead with the miscroscope to see whether an bacteria had"

Meanwhile, we noted that some teams encountered some difficulties in finding the data they need. Therefore, our database helped them find it more easily. Via emails, questionnaires or WeChat, we received several feedbacks from iGEM teams or experts.
“The database is detailed and comprehensive, with relatively high practicability. However, it needs to be more aesthetically pleasing.
The search results page can add a description of the search terms. And the search results can be sorted in chronological order.
Database compatibility with browsers needs to be improved and some pages have Chinese words.” —NKU_CHINA

“BioMaster is of great excellence. It indeed provides us many useful statistics for us so that we can refer to it. BioMaster brings conveniences to our experiments. If some relevant references are provided and display biobrick information in a visualized way, it would be more user-friendly.” —UESTC-China
“Your information is comprehensive and the UI surface is user-friendly. However, the ranking of search results is to be optimized when searching with iGEM_ID, such as searching for BBa_K104000, the first display of BBa_K1040001, and BBa_K104000 in the back position. You’d better give out a guidance to each information, for example, new user may not know what EPD& RegulonDB contains of.” ” —USTC-Software
Final Release
With all the the feedbacks and adjustment, our final 1.0 version of BioMaster was borned. To promote it, we held a little release in our university with over 80 undergraduates attended. Simultaneously, we did a live show on the hottest live platform “Douyu” with more than 1600 people watching and comments.

Executive Summary
We, BioLens, are developing microlens arrays that can be used to increase the efficiency of solar panels. It appears that microlens arrays can be used to increase the efficiency of solar panels with 20% to 50%. However, they are not implemented in the solar panels industry, because currently it is too difficult and expensive to produce them in large numbers. Our biological microlens can be used as a cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternative for the chemically produced alternatives. In three steps we have written an extensive business plan, usable as blueprint for our future BioLens start-up company.
In the first step, we have implemented the Business Model Canvas start-up template to develop the business model of BioLens. We have looked into among other things the key values of BioLens, what our most important partners will be and how we can sell our product. In the second step we have interviewed potential customers as well as the final users of the solar panels. We have asked both stakeholders what the requirements are that our microlens arrays have to meet. This analysis revealed that most potential customers would be interested if our microlens arrays result in a higher return on investment, are strong enough and are not more expensive than chemically-produced alternatives. We have used the obtained insights to write the final business plan.
To obtain information about the intellectual property protection of our product, we have discussed the project with the Valorisation Centre of TU Delft and Delft Enterprises. We have concluded that the BioLens MLA is a novel and non-obvious product that is in our opinion fully patentable.
The market for environmentally energy is expanding worldwide and based on the governmental aspersions the market size will increase to about 5 times its actual size in the coming years. In the introduction phase we will focus upon the Dutch and German market. We believe that there is a potential market of 187.5 MW in the first 4 years. This is equal to 1% of the estimated market growth of the German companies. Based on these data there is an estimated market of almost 150.000 m2 in the next 4 years.
Taking into account the risks we obtained from our extensive risk analysis, we can conclude that based on a conservative estimate it appears that the costs are already covered at about 5000 m2. We are well aware of the many uncertainties in these calculations. However, since there is still a large margin between the breakeven point and the expected sales, we dare to say that the BioLens micro lens array will be profitable.

B: At low attractant concentrations, or when a repellant is bound, most of the MCPs are in the CW signaling state. Under these conditions Che A is activated, and Che B removes most of the methyl groups. In this state the McpS have high affinities for the attractants and are able to detect very low concentrations of these effectors. If the attractant concentration increases, the MCPs tend to adopt the CCW signaling conformation, Che A and Che B thereby lose their activities, and methyl group removal becomes progressively less efficient.With the attractant concentrations increase, the McpS are progressively converted into the fully methylated state with a low affinity for the attractants.

Estela Pineda-Molina, et al. reported high-resolution structures of the ligand- binding region of the cluster II McpS chemotaxis receptor (McpS-LBR) of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 in complex with malate and succinate (Fig.7 B& C) . The root mean square deviation (rmsd) between the malate and succinate cocrystal structure is only 0.2 Å indicating that differences in the nature of the ligand do not significantly alter the protein structure (Table 1). In a sequence alignment of McpS-LBR homologs containing McpS-LBR of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the amino acids involved in malate and succinate binding are conserved. R60 is almost fully conserved, whereas the remaining residues are conserved to between 30–80% (Estela Pineda-Molina, et al.)"

During the course of our iGEM project, we have developed three tools which we would like to share with the iGEM community. The first is an online tool which translates any given text in ASCII format into DNA, which we extended from a tool made by iGEM Aberdeen 2014 . The second is a gRNA generation tool that takes into account codon substitutions by generating gRNA’s for all possible DNA sequences given an amino acid sequence. The third is a toolkit for holding a bioethics workshop, which we have developed with advice from Mr Virgil Rerimassie and the tool he co-developed: the iGEMers guide to the future.
Barcoding Tool
We developed an iGEM barcoding tool by improving upon an existing iGEM DNA translation tool developed by iGEM Aberdeen Scotland, 2014 . Our purpose for this is to enable sample multiplexing by barcoding DNA samples. This tool is very versatile however and can possibly of use to other iGEM teams. The tool can be found here .
gRNA generation tool
We developed a gRNA generation tool that is able to generate all possible gRNA’s at a given position, including all possibilities for codon substitutions. It does this by searching for an overlap between regions that the user is interested in, positions where a PAM sequences are found and regions with very little possible codon substitutions. Our purpose for this is to exclude codon substitution as a way to circumvent our detection method. It can also be useful for any other application that deals with high amounts of synonymous mutations in the gene they want to find. A more detailed explanation of the functioning of the tool can be found here and the code here .
Guide to organizing a bioethics workshop
The best way to teach people is by involving them actively in discussions and workshops. We did this during the iGEM Eurasian meetup by discussing bioethics with the attendees. We designed this workshop with the active involvement of bioethicist Virgil Rerimassie and the tool he co-developed: the iGEMers guide to the future , frame reflection tool.  We would like to share how to develop a workshop like this with the iGEM community, so that teams of the future can use this guide to further develop awareness of bioethics. Are you interested in the experiences of the workshop we organized? Please visit our education and public outreach page .
We will discuss first how to set the goals of a workshop, then the general set-up, followed by the materials"
Wageningen_UR,2013,Team:Wageningen UR#Chromoproteins_-_-_TEXT.html," to the presence of a range of fluorescent and non-fluorescent pigments. Fluorescent proteins (remotely homologous to the famous Green Fluorescent Protein superfamily from jellyfish[ 1 ], see Fig.1) are an interesting family of proteins. Coral fluorescent proteins are small, about 230 amino acid residues (~700bp) long. They acquired via evolution the ability to synthesize a chromophore from their own residues in a couple of autocatalytic reactions. Chromophore structure and kinetics are highly significant to the optics of colorizing proteins [ 2 ]. These proteins lead to myriad imaging techniques that capitalize their unique physical, biochemical and spectral properties. Non-fluorescent pigments are made up by chromoproteins, which absorb light effectively but hardly emit it. They have intrinsic colour which is visible to the naked eye. This feature, as well as their relatively small gene size, make chromoproteins simple but favorable bio-reporters in molecular biology [ 1 ]. Most chromoproteins possess single absorption maxima around 560-590 nm. However, small shifts in the absorption maxima can already lead to compelling changes in the perceived color; the pigment might even appear blue. Among GFP homologs, chromoproteins are quite unique in having the natural potential of far-red fluorescence (590-640 nm). Furthermore, far-red fluorescent proteins can also be generated from chromoproteins via mutagenesis.[ 3 ] This property could lead to an interesting biotechnological application, as fluorescent near-infrared (650+ nm) reporters offer new possibilities for in vivo studies on biological functioning due to their ability of penetrating mammalian tissue via near-infrared light.
In addition, mutagenesis or amino acid substitutions in chromoproteins can lead to a huge increase (several hundred-fold) in their quantum yield and can influence colourization [ 4 ]. Chromophores in chromoproteins are usually characterized by a non-planar trans-conformation [ 5 ]. However, the differences in chromoprotein colour are thought to occur due to interactions between their chromophore and environmental factors such as pH [ 6 ]. This finding is highlighted by results that show that a chromoprotein chromophore, though having the same amino acid sequence as a fluorescent protein, adopts a different conformation (deviation in chromophore ring planarity) under different environmental conditions [ 2 , 5 ]. Chromoprotein structures are found in different lineages and have three independent origins, suggesting functional convergence [ 3 ] (Fig.1).

Exemple of sequences of base units.
From the modeling side, we calculated analytically the steady state of the integrase and terminator modules, and it  appears that the deterministic model gives a binary steady state corresponding to an XOR gate. This is what we expected, it confirms that deterministic model in our case is interesting for the study of dynamics of the whole system, and not for steady state calculations. So we are now moving to dynamic studies.

Week 4: Improving plasmid design, Modularization of the whole model
Wednesday, June 18th
We improved a little bit the plasmid design, determined which parts will be taken from the iGEM registry, and which parts we have to synthesize.
Second draft of plasmids. The repressors production genes have been moved to the sensor plasmid in order to distribute more evenly the number of kb.
Sensor plasmids will be approx. 9.3kb long, and logic plasmids will be approx. 5,2kb long.
From the modeling side, the whole model has been modularized and we have calculated and simulated steady state for the quorum sensing module.

Modularization of the system
Sunday, June 15th
The idea of our system is to associate a quorum sensing part, which should be able to react to a certain concentration of input, with a integrase-base logic part, which should be able to derive a computation given the transformed inputs.
From a modeling point of view, it seemed obvious that we had to consider these two entities separately. That is why we chose to have a modularized approach, where we regrouped, on one hand, the equations corresponding to quorum sensing and, on the other hand, the ones corresponding to the integrase logic phenomena.
As the integrase module is not that well known, we further decomposed it into two successive parts. The first one only models the path integrases go through in order to bind to DNA. The second one models the switch behavior of the integrases (after they are bound to DNA) and describe the XOR logic of our system.
As we see, these modules are successive. After the logic module, we added a production module, which is"

Rather than saying we started the newsletter, we would like to think that the newsletter idea came to us. In May 2014, before we officially started working on the project, we got an email from the Xiamen University iGEM team, looking for cooperation. The original idea was to translate our website. However, we wanted to have something more interactive and updated. “Why not doing a newsletter for iGEM” came naturally into mind. After talking to Xiamen University team, we decided newsletter is not only a good option to follow up with each other’s project, but also can develop into a system of peer review. To reach the goal of constant communication, networking among young synthetic biologists and establishing a real-time peer review system, we decide to publish one issue of newsletter every two weeks. The focus of one issue would either be team member introduction or project update. Each team can ask questions about their project that they want feedbacks on. Some of the questions are scientific, while a large portion of them is about ethical and philosophical discussions. We, as the organizer of the newsletter, collected the answers and distributed them to teams accordingly. Later, thanks to the contribution from other teams and continue brainstorming of cooperation, we did a student review session of the questions that iGEM judges use to grade teams.
In total, we had four regular issues, one special issue that includes interview of past judge and iGEMers, and one student review session of judging process. There are more than 30 teams involved through the process, from more than 8 countries and regions. Students have used the newsletter as a platform of pursuing"
TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#Appendix_-_-_TEXT.html,". Cluster bombs are large bombs with many small mines/bombs inside; these small bombs are spread around the site of impact.  Bergman: “About 10% of the bombs do not explode. In the case of a cluster bomb with 200 bombs in it, this means that twenty new landmine-like bombs are laid upon impact. In Iraq, where cluster bombs were heavily used, we usually found them by asking kids. They exactly knew where the bombs were, since the bombs marked the boundary of their football field.”
When telling Lt Col Bergman about our landmine sensor, he tells us: “The development of new landmine detection methods is a real business opportunity. Currently, there is no method that can say with 100% certainty that an area does or does not contain landmines. Therefore, a lot of new detectors are developed. We have an intensive collaboration with TNO (Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research) to test them and buy only the best of the best.” We explained our project in more detail, especially how it is dependent on whether TNT leaks out of the bomb. After the meeting with Mr. Lenz from the Kampfmittelräumdienst, where he showed us how thick the shells of the bombs were they usually encountered (aircraft bombs), we had some doubt about the fact if TNT would leak out at all. Lt Col Bergman told us that for aircraft bombs, this is probably true, but that most other types of bombs have quite thin shells in which leaks occur easily. “IEDs are often made of jerry cans, which will always contain traces of explosive material inside and outside. Also landmines usually have very thin shells. These will have leaks, especially when they are in the ground for a while.” Lt Col Bergman showed us a truly enormous amount of different bombs to corroborate his statement (see photos).
From this, it seemed like the bombs that pose problems for our method, namely those with thick metal walls, are quite easy to find, and that the bombs which are more suited for our method (thin-walled bombs) usually have low metal content and are hard to find with current methods. Bergman confirms this: “The methods seem quite complementary.”
We asked Lt Col Bergman how important speed was for the detection of bombs, since promoter-based biosensors like ours are inherently slow. “When on out-of-area missions, we have to clear a route before a patrol drives there, so if the detection method is slow, we’re halting the whole convoy. However, if you can somehow spray your bacteria on the area the night"

Description
HIV and its Diagnosis
The fundamentally necessary process of HIV diagnosis is something that can be fraught with difficulty. In various countries, although treatment of HIV can be provided by NGOs, testing can run into the thousands USD for an HIV positive test. This is something rather undesirable considering the average wages in these countries. Furthermore, HIV testing is done via CD4 count and confirmed by the presence of HIV antibodies. However, this testing method necessitates several months after initial infection
ZIKV and Zika Diagnosis
Current methods for testing for the ZIKV virus are as follows: RNA nucleic acid testing, Trioplex Real-time RT-PCR Assay, serologic testing, and Zika MAC ELISA. RNA nucleic acid testing is the least costly, however, it is also the least accurate means of testing as it looks for ZIKV RNA inside urine and negative tests do not rule out the disease. Furthermore, this test must be followed up by other more difficult tests. the ELISA requires cerebrospinal fluid while the other tests can be expensive.
Griffithsin (GRFT)
GRFT is a protien lectin that has broad spectrum glycoprotien binding capacity. In essence, it is something that is sticky. In particular, it sticks to particular glycoprotiens in the protien coating of viral particles. In the case of the HIV virus, it binds to the GP120 glycoprotein of the viral coating. This glycoprotein is specifically indicated the previous image of HIV.
The Design
Our project provides an optimal solution to these problems specifically geared towards developing regions. A rapdid diagnostic test (RDT) using our Griffithsin (GRFT) molecule to bind to the protien coat of viruses enables a much more sensative and accurate testing measure. Furthermore, the GRFT molecule used is a thermostable variant capable of standing up"
UC_Davis,2014,Team:UC Davis#Potentiostat Design Inspiration Iteration_-_-_TEXT.html," issues.
Version 1.2
Our next iteration fixed some of the power supply issues. We switch from our ICs receiving powering by USB, to routing the USB power through a linear dropout voltage regulator (LDO), then to the ICs. The solution was short lived, however, as it reduced the noise, but not completely. The next obvious issue was the analog and digital ground setup. All the ICs are being grounded on the analog ground pin. This also happens to be the pin that the main analog reference is grounded to, causing noise from the digital circuitry to bleed into our analog signal.
Version 1.4
The board and schematic for version 1.3 were designed, but never sent the PCB manufacturer. Before production we decided on more drastic changes. Our next iteration produced two major changes: we added a single channel op-amp with a PSSR of 140 dB for our main analog reading through the working electrode. We isolated this op-amp as the only IC connected to the analog ground pin, AGND. We then re-wired all the other ground pins to the digital ground, or GND. The results were rewarding, the circuit was finally starting to produce results with a significant reduction in signal to noise ratio. Combined with the digital filter our circuit was performing great, but we had already designed and ordered the next iteration!
Version 2.0
The final iteration made a significant change to the gain switch. The SP4T we designed was originally inline with the gain resistor of our transimpedance amplifier. The IC is a TS3A5017 Dual SP4T switch, where we had one of the SP4T's grounded. We found a method of rewiring the switch into the output of the transimpedance amplifier. It required use of the second SP4T switch and prevented the op-Amp from amplifying the leakage current inherent to the switch. The stray capacitance added by this method also helped to compensate the amplifier in the range required[2] by the high gain resistors.

GFP, BBa_E0840 in plasmid has beed ligated
LacP, BBa_R0010, was ligated with our C part in plasmid
Transformation is made and we will have the results tomorrow.
Thursday 10/7
The transformation from yesterday was successful. To examine if the digestion and ligation were a success, colony PCR was performed on all of the cultures. Four colonies were tested from each agar plate. The result showed that part B (Bba_R0010) and C (Bba_E0840) had been ligated successfully. Unfortunately nothing could be seen on the gel with regard to PCR1, PCR2 and PCR3. Therefor a new colony PCR was performed on the colonies with PCR1, PC2 and PCR3, but with VF2 and VR primers.
Friday 11/7
Today we realized that XbaI didn't work well when we used green buffer for fast digest of our products. This leaded to an experiment where we compared digestion with green buffer and a colorless buffer, which we ran on gel afterwards.  We saw that the green buffer didn't work optimally because the gel showed smear and there was very little of the disired product in general.  We puridied our PCR products 1 (Pcon_rbs_BBa_C0040(LVAtag_removed)_term) and 3 (Ptet_BBa_E0840) and digested these with the colorless buffer this time.
Saturday 12/7

Overview
According to the data from WHO, cardiovascular diseases are the main leading cause of death globally. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a critical second messenger molecule.It can transduce nitric-oxide (NO) and natriuretic-peptide-coupled signaling and remit the myocardial hypertrophy by relaxing the blood vessels. This summer, we tried to use synthetic biology to modify the cGMP metabolic pathway in a human cell line.We hope that our work would provide the proof of principle for future gene therapy.
Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is an enzyme that synthesize cGMP  from GTP. We up-regulate sGC by overexpressing its α and β subunits in a mammalian cell line. However, elevated levels of cGMP leads to the feed-back expression of PDE5a, a cGMP-specific phosphodiesteras that degrades cGMP. Thus, we further modified the pathway by silencing the PDE5a. To achieve controllable up-regulation of cGMP level in the cell, we designed a hypoxia-inducible operon, HRE, as a switch to up regulate cGMP only in hypoxia situation."

Function overview
After the effective Toxin was coated by CNC, we need a convenient device to place our poison in. One of our goals is to kill all termites in a house. In order to be easier for the users to clean it up for a second use the device is designed to be removable. Meanwhile, all units of the device must be standardized so that we can change the alluring part into the killing part directly. Here is our device and it works in three aspects.
Monitor
In fact, we made a big improvement about our device on the monitor unit recently. In the last version, we used a compressed spring which is connected to a thin wooden block. Once termites eat the block, the string will elongate and another wooden block will get out of the device to alert the users. Further more, we decided to design a digital circuit for customers so that they may discover the situation in a shorter time with less attention paid to the device.
However, when we talked about our device with Prof. Mo, an expert on termite control, he told us that when termites eat wood, their secretion flows out and sticks on the wood nearby. Termites will even plug the hole when they go through it. This makes it difficult for our monitor unit to work.

Die zweite Etappe umfasst das Einfügen aller fehlenden Enzyme, um den Stoffwechselweg für die Produktion von Biomaterialien zu ermöglichen und dabei schon einiges über den Promoter gelernt zu haben.
Weiterhin haben wir versucht die Bedürfnisse von verschmutzten Gemeinden zu verstehen, um mit ihnen zusammen eine Strategie für die Implementierung von Bioreaktoren voranzutreiben und zu bestimmen welche Biomaterialien die geeignetsten und nützlichsten für die Gemeinden sind. Der Puchuncaví Bezirk in der V Region von Chile ist einer der am schlimmsten von Luftverschmutzung betroffenen Gebiete im Land. Dessen Bevölkerung lebt mit thermoelektrischen Kraftwerken, Ölraffinerien und Fertigungsanlagen. Das ist der Grund, weshalb wir von Anfang an mit der Gemeinde und dem Rathaus zusammengearbeitet haben, um ihre Gesundheitsbedürfnisse zu befriedigen und dabei so schnell wie möglich einen Bioreaktor vor Ort zu errichten.

someone needs to contact Jordan about that
will it actually help in maxing out signal?
ChR2
Cotransfection with aequorin
added CZ, Ca and Gaussia in hopes that Gaussia would activate ChR2 (pcDNA3.1) and we would be able to see luminscence by eye under microscope. We didn’t see anything
May be hard to manipulate in luminometer (ChR2 is activated by white light)
Characterize ChR2:
Indo dyes with flow cytometry
the lab across from Sarkar’s has this machinery (Chocus) for ratiometric imaging with indo and fura dyes
cell permeable Indo dyes, add hydrolyzable esthers, etherases in cells cleave the esthers to prevent it from leaving the cell
look at Dan’s email on drugs for calcium
talk to flow cytometry core (calcium imaging). Penn has a great core!
how long does Ca stay in the cell so that we can image it?
will be hard to do by flow: decay is quick
samples will need to be in foil so they are not exposed to light
then you’ll shine light and it will sort cells
We now have this in pRRL-CMV-ChR2
can be sequenced (need to prepare!!)
ready to make lentivirus
someone needs to contact Jordan about that
Ordered primers for Quikchange PCR (mutate into CaTcH)

Cloning of rbs+fimE with a terminator, wrong electrophoresis profile.
Cloning of rbs-luxI with rbs-CI-ter. This cloning step was successful.
Transfer of xor2 synthesis from puc54 to pSB1C3. We did not get xor2 inside pSB1C3, but only the backbone vector.
Insertion of reversed RFP inside AND2 (with cla1/bamH1). Electrophoresis profiles were not correct, so the insertion was not successful. It was probably a problem of restriction time.
August 2013
Week 8 (29-04 August)
Cloning of rbs+fimE with a terminator. This time we succeeded.
Amplification of the fragment rbs luxI-rbs-CI-ter for the AND1 gate.
Insertion of rbs-FImE-ter inside the Xor1 gate. We made restriction controls with different enzymes (stu1,hindIII), but the results were not fruitful.
We tried again to introduce RFP inside AND2, still not working.
We succeeded to transfer Xor2 inside pSB1C3.
Week 9 (05-11 August)
Still lot of problems to insert reversed RFP inside AND2. The transformation does not work.  We needed to find a solution (strataclone? Infusion?...).
Insertion of reversed rbs luxi inside AND2. Same problem as for AND2-RFP.
Cloning of rbs-fimE-ter  into Xor1. It did not work because of a ligation problem.
Insertion of reversed RFP into XOR2, no insertion, only the backbone vector was present.
Week 10 (12-18 August)
As we faced lot of issues with the reversed RFP and reversed rbs-luxI, we decided to order new oligonucleotide in order to create new reversed fragments as we did during the week 6 PCR to invert RFP and rbs.LuxI with the restriction site ClaI BamHI, and purification.
We tested a wide range of elongation temperatures (60°C-75°C). We got the right fragments for the two biobricks with good size. But on the electrophoresis revelations we got one parasite fragment around 5kb.
Week 11 (19-25 August)
We amplified the reversed fragment RFP and rbs luxI with the new oligos. We did not find the solution to avoid the parasite fragment so we used PCR clean-up & gel purification.

Nowadays, fermentation industry is crucial for a country’s economy. In China, fermentation industry output reached 2,000 billion RMB in 2011, and till 2013, this number has increased to 3,000 billion RMB.(Figure 1.) Fermentation industry’s output accounts for about 3 percentage of GDP in China, and it’s predicted that the output will reach 10,000 billion at the end of 2015. As a result, optimizing fermentation process and improve productivity is important
However, problems concerning fluctuation of pH in fermentation is usually knotty. Firstly, enzymes produced by microorganisms can be tremendously influenced by environmental pH. The activity of enzyme will plummet at an improper pH, and eventually the fermentation effectiveness will decrease. Worse still, different pH can entirely change a microorganism’s fermentation products. For example, Aspergillus niger can produce citric acid at pH 2.0~3.0, while the product will be changed to oxalic acid at pH 6.5~7.5. As for corynebacterium glutamicum, the product is glutamate at pH 7.0~8.0 while at pH 5.0~5.8 the products are Glutamine and N-aceglutamide. Therefore, a suitable environmental pH is a key factor for higher fermentation productivity.
Figure1. Fermentation industry output from 2005 to 2013[1]
To maintain fermentation pH range, people have found some methods to regulate the pH of fermentation liquor, such as probe detection technique combined with computer programs, and adding acid and alkali into fermenters straightly. However, environmental interference can strongly interrupt probe detection, and increase reaction time. What’s more, adding large amount of acid and alkali may cause unbalance pH in different areas in fermenter. Those problems will decrease fermentation productivity and effectiveness. More importantly, all of these methods which heavily rely on electrical technology will increase factories' costs and energy consumption, but none of them considered function of microorganisms themselves.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Log_-_-_TEXT.html,"Log entry
A lot of today was spent working through past team’s projects to see what could be relevant to our project ideas, what couldn’t be completed in the past, what will be difficult, and what we could expand on for our own idea. There was a suggestion of using a delivery system, or developing a way to stick E. coli to the fungal cell wall to ensure delivery of PAF is direct.
We got our first card prototypes for the board game printed off today which we were all excited about. As shown below, there are four card types: promoters, ribosome binding sites, protein coding regions and terminators. We intend to make some rare and super rare cards.
In addition to this, we started developing an instruction manual to accompany the game.
We are working on how to “brand” the project by looking at different colour schemes so that when we start coding the wiki we have a general idea of what we want it to look like. Alan has put together a powerpoint introducing basic HTML concepts, so that the team members who haven’t coded before can learn.

We made some slight changes to the board game cards today so we can incorporate the concept of scenarios, where the cards played by a team have to be justified. This makes the game a lot more interactive and encourages students to actually think about what cards they play, as opposed to simply playing cards to earn points.
There was a lot of looking at past wikis so we could start forming an idea of what we wanted the layout of our wiki to look like.
We discussed the PAF further. We did some research into the use of a secretion system to get PAF out of E. coli and noted how the mode of action of PAF is currently not well understood. We looked at how our project can tackle this problem, for example attatching GFP to the signal peptide known on PAF would allow us to “follow” it.
It was the work experience student’s last day with us today so we him what he had learned about synthetic biology during the week, how his perceptions towards the topic had changed and if he had enjoyed the week.

Today was the first day with the majority of the team back together, so the key focus today was sitting down and re-brainstorming ideas before we settle on one. As can be seen in the mind map below, the PAF idea was fleshed out and developed in more detail.

Location: 712 Meeting Room, 5th Teaching Building, Beijing Institute of Technology and BNU
Since it has been the third time for us to join in the iGEM competition, we deeply appreciate the significance of communication and discussion. We had several exchange meetings with BNU-China. In the first communication, the two teams respectively introduced their project and the recent progress. Then we exchanged some ideas on how to guide new team members and discussed some problems in experiments. We found our own advantages and shortcomings in the exchange. At the end of this meeting, the two teams decided to establish a cooperation relationship and helped with each other.
The next two exchanges were mainly focused on cooperation. Discussions were processing both online and offline. We helped BNU-China to construct a part of the gene circuit, and meanwhile, BNU-China tried their best to help us with the characterization of our parts and also contributed a lot to our project’s modelling.

In August, 2015, BIT-CHINA participated in Conference of China iGEM Committee (CCiC) in Peking University. We had a good harvest during this conference. After a long time of experiments, this time we showed more results of our experiments. For this time, much more attention was received in virtue of our project, and many different kinds of questions about pH Controller were asked. Meanwhile, we had received some valuable suggestions. Surprisingly, staffs from some fermentation industry companies expressed great interests in our project, at the same time, they put forward a number of targeted issues, which made us think more deeply about our project.

Understanding the impacts of the process
Regarding the carbon sequestration in bioplastics, the net carbon footprint is less and bioplastic can function as CO2 storage, but however, it cannot help with the GHG problem in the world. Furthermore, he talked about the possible disposal scenarios such as composting, anaerobic digestion and incineration. Finally, he ended his presentation by emphasising on what needs to be developed to achieve the wide use of bioplastic. Some of his examples were: Plant science, biomass production, pre-treatment of the biomass, monomer treatment, and tests and scale up. Nevertheless, the market cannot go forward if the impact of bioplastics products to the environment and society is not understood.
The lecture reaffierded that ‘Human Practices’ aspect is crucial in every project design and not just iGEM. Through our Human Practices journey, we found LCA tool which assessed the environmental impacts of a product and/or process, which is in line with what Paul Mines mentioned."

AUC_TURKEY,2015,Team:AUC TURKEY#Catalase_-_-_TEXT.html," and hydrogen peroxide.7 This method of flammation will also be utilized for our project.
Structure and Regulatory Mechanism
The catalase coding sequences that are adapted to our project were taken from two different organisms. One is the common HPI Catalase of E. coli controlled by the katG enzyme site. The second catalase to be used in the project is the HPC Catalase of H. pylori controlled by the katA enzyme site.
HPI catalase is expressed in E. coli as a result of oxidative stress. The tetramic catalase of E. coli, as previously mentioned, is controlled by the katG enzyme site. This enzyme site is regulated by the OxyR protein, a member of the LysR family of autoregulatory transcriptional activators. OxyR is naturally inactive in regulation, but is activated under oxidative stress stimulated by hydrogen peroxide. It has also been observed that OxyR increases the transcription of the katG enzyme site by 100-fold. The oxyR has a self-regulatory effect on its auto-synthesis, through end-product inhibition, meaning that the only factor that can stimulate an increase in oxyR concentration would be an increase in oxidative stress. Therefore, the synthesis of HPI catalase in E. coli is regulated by katG and oxyR.8
The highly catalase reliant H. pylori has a similar catalase function to that of E. coli. The enzyme site responsible for the control of catalase translation in H. pylori is the katA enzyme site. Just like katG, katA is stimulated by oxidative stress through autoregulatory transcriptional activators.9 Fur and PerR are the factors maintaining transcriptional regulation in H. pylori.10 The catalase translation and activity levels in H. pylori are significantly higher in respect to E. coli.11 Both HPI and HPC catalase contain a heme group in their structure; however H. pylori has only one wild-type catalase, whereas E. coli has another catalase, which is HPII (produced only in anaerobic contiditions). Despite the structural differences in between H. pylori catalase and HPI catalase, both have the same regulatory mechanism.12 This gives them the applicability in similar conditions.
Energetics of Catalase
HPC and HPI catalase can both function as a catalase and a peroxidase. The factors that affect the peroxidase functionality, however, are not in correlation with the factors that affect catalase activity, thus the"
INSA-Lyon,2016,Team:INSA-Lyon#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," A molecule of fluorescein was grafted at the 5’ end of a DNA oligo carrying a molecule of biotin at its 3’ end.                                 This DNA oligo constitutes the reporter system. Such a modified oligo was mixed either with the engineered streptavidin-CBDs or with commercial streptavidin.                                 The resulting mix was incubated with microcrystalline cellulose in presence of PBS for 1 hour. The cellulose was then washed twice with fresh PBS.                                 Complexes cellulose/streptavidin-CBDs/reporter system were harvested by centrifugation and fluorescence was measured. Every experiment was done in triplicate.
Fig.9 Streptavidin-CBDs allows binding fluorescent-biotinylated DNA to cellulose. Cellulose shows no auto-fluorescence (bar 1). A small fraction of streptavidin can link the cellulose spontaneously (bar 2). Both engineered streptavidin-CBDs                                     allow the formation of complexes with the fluorescent reporter system and cellulose that can be detected by measuring the green fluorescence, as shown in figure 9 (bars 3 and 4).

OUC-China,2017,Team:OUC-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," OD600, we found a platform stage in the middle of the curve suggesting probably a secondary growth. We figure out a hypothesis that the accumulation of the glucose when making use of cellubiose might be the reason underlying this phenomenon because a substitution process of the carbon sources can exactly lead to such a plateau in the growth curve. [1]Therefore, we detect the glucose content of the medium after that to validate our assumption.
Fig 1.12
Fig 1.13
The result (left) shows that glucose content in the medium reaches a peak at about 40 hours and then decrease rapidly. At around 70 hours, the content reaches the minimum and stay steady ever since. Considering the ethanol content (right) that also present a largest amount at around 80 hours, we believe that the glucose in yeast may be transformed gradually into acetic acid and ethanol participated in further metabolic procedure with acetic acid called Glucose Glycolysis, thus was turned into lipid.
And for a more visualized display, we use plate streaking to show the growth condition of our two recombinative strains and negative strains in different carbon source. We make three plates with either xylose, cellobiose or xylose plus cellobiose as sole or compound carbon source, respectively and monitor the growth of each strain in three different plate after cultivating for 32 hours at 30℃.
As a result,yesat with pYC230-XYL1-XYL2 grows faster than the rest of two strains in 2% xylose as sole carbon plate, and cellobiose strain with pYC230-CDT-GH1 has a much faster growth rate than that of the other two strains in 2% cellobiose as sole carbon plate. These two recombinant strains also show a better growing condition than WT EBY100 with a medium of 2% xylose and 2% cellobiose as compound carbon source.
This phenomenon indicates that we can actually utilize xylose and cellobiose from algae residue and produce ethanol with our engineered yeasts!

The assembly plan of the Killing system.
Background
Bacteriocin
With the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, we decided to use bacteriocins as our antimicrobial agent. A bacteriocin is a peptide that is produced naturally by certain bacteria and targets its close relatives. Unlike general antibiotics, the targets of bacteriocins are very specific. The bacteriocin, colicin Fy is produced by Y. frederiksenii and it should mostly target other yersinia species.  Bacteriocins will either attack the cell membrane or a mechanism inside  the cell, such as gene expression or protein production. [1] One of colicins Fy main targets is Y. enterocolitica. It kills Y. enterocolitica by creating pores in its cell membrane. Y. enterocolitica is also one among the common pathogens that infects the gut and causes some serious symptoms [2] . These were some of the reasons to choose colicin Fy as the bacteriocin to express.
Spot42 sRNA
Our goal was to design a seek and kill system. This implies that we only want to express the colicin Fy when our bacteria is close to the target. We chose this strategy because the cell would stress out to express colicin Fy all the time, even when not in close proximity to Yersinia. In order to make our bacteria express the colicin Fy only when we want it to, we have designed an sRNA system. We have based our design on the system that Team Uppsala iGEM 2012 implemented. .
The sRNA, spot42, consists of an antisense region that recognizes a specific RNA sequence to interact with as well as another region that recruits the protein Hfq. The Hfq protein blocks and prevents mRNA from binding to the ribosome. We have redesigned the antisense region so it will specifically recognize our USP45. This will make it bind to our USP45 and recruit the Hfq protein to stick to that region. [3] USP45 is the secretion tag that we have coupled to the colicin Fy. The sRNA will stick to Hfq and bind to the mRNA of USP45-Colicin Fy gene and that will block the translation of colicin Fy. When our bacteria is in proximity"

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Project#FRET Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," the difference between an on and off state is more important for a clear and unmistakable signal than the overall fluorescence. Hence, the OD-adjusted fluorescence quotient for both double plasmid constructs and K731520 was obtained and plotted in the following graph.
Fluorescence was normalized to the cell growth. The fluorescence of induced cells was additionally divided by the fluorescence of non-induced cells to obtain the fluorescence quotient.
The graph clearly shows the faster response of the cut GFP-REACh fusion protein compared to a standard GFP expression. Both fluorescence signals of the double plasmid constructs achieve a higher difference in fluorescence signal between induced and non-induced state as well as at a faster rate. This proves the hypothesis made earlier about the kinetics of the GFP-REACh fusion protein combined with the TEV protease.
Summary
The kinetics of the fusion protein combined with the TEV protease exhibits the exact characteristics as predicted. The response is clearly faster than normal expression by accumulating a reservoir of fusion proteins which are not fluorescing due to the dark quencher attached to them. This reservoir is then activated by the induction of the TEV protease expression. Production of the protease results in the cleavage of the fusion protein, releasing GFP from the dark quencher and disturbing the interaction between the FRET pair. This results in the observed faster fluorescence reaction due to the amplificating effect of the TEV protease in which every one TEV protease can account for many fluorescence proteins being activated.
Characterizing the GFP-REACh Constructs in Sensor Chips
To further characterize the REACh construct, they were introduced into the sensor cells which were then induced with 2 µL IPTG with a concentration of 100 mM. Subsequently, we took fluorescence measurement read-outs (GFP, excitation 496 ± 9 nm, emission 516 ± 9 nm) roughly every 10 min in the plate reader. The results were plotted in the heatmap shown here.

The induced double plasmid systems K1319013 + K1319008 and K1319014 + K1319008 exhibit a clear fluorescence response in our sensor cells which in response to induction with 2 µl IPTG.
The heatmap shows an increase of fluorescence from blue (no fluorescence) to red (high fluorescence). It is clearly visible that the induced chips are exhibiting a significantly higher fluorescence than the non-induced chips. This"

UAM_Poznan,2016,Team:UAM Poznan#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," frame. We build our experimental model on sfGFP and mRFP – two soluble fluorescent proteins. We compare expression rate of contrasting variants of their coding sequences – optimized and the most deoptimized codon usage, codon adaptation usage, codon contexts and the highest or the lowest GC content. This simple comparison should allow to evaluate which method of ORF optimization does really make sense.
Strong, tight promoters
Our multipromoter expression system for E.coli contains four sets of pSB1C3 vectors with promoters induced by non-toxic compounds - sugars: arabinose (Ara promoters), rhamnose (Rha promoters), xylose (Xyl promoters) and melibiose (Mel promoters). Promoter is induced by a specific sugar and starts the expression of a gene. One can exchange the ORF of sfGFP to any other coding sequence of interest.. AraC, RhaS, RhaR, MelR, XylR are transcription factors- they bind specific sugars, by which they are activated, and start the transcription. These factors are dependent on the binding of the catabolite receptor protein (CRP)-cAMP complex to the promoter. In the presence of glucose, cAMP levels are low and CRP is unable to bind to the promoter, which results in blocked transcription.
Our multipromoter system provides differential levels of protein expression, so one can choose either stronger promoter, or the one ensuring lower levels of inducible expression. Since all four sets of promoters are tightly regulated, they can be useful in production of proteins toxic for E.coli cells. It is also worth taking under consideration that E.coli cells behave differently on different carbon sources, which results in contrasting bacterial growth rate and indirectly influence protein production. E.co-Factory ensures independent induction of expression of at least two different genes and efficient blockage of all promoters by glucose. Moreover, cellular RNA polymerase is more accurate and introduces less mistakes in the transcribed sequence than that of phage origin from pET system, which is important if one’s aim is to produce recombinant proteins for crystallography and medicine.
Our group modified arabinose, rhamnose, xylose and melibiose promoters, from which AraC-pBAD arabinose promoter is commercially available. All promoter sequences were copied from E.coli K-12 genome. Modifications of promoters include sequence size reduction with full functionality maintenance, because shorter promoters = smaller biobricks, which are more convenient for molecular cloning purposes. We have substituted original 5’UTRs of genes located downstream these"

Toronto,2013,Team:Toronto#Project#Nodes_-_-_TEXT.html," as opposed to the methods used in past literature that only measured the effects of genetic engineering on just one manifestation.
Defect in the Biobrick Paradigm
The Biobrick paradigm is that gene parts are necessarily additive, due to the mechanics of the Biobrick Assembly method. Consequently, apart from by using “additive” exotic methods such as RNAi to disrupt gene expression to achieve functional gene silencing, gene deletions from a genome (negative “additive” modifications) simply cannot be submitted to the Gene Parts Registry. Modulating and Measuring the Biofilm Response
The focus of our project is to characterize the physical and chemical manifestations of the biofilm response in cells where key genes in the biofilm response (for both structural and regulatory aspects) have been either overexpressed or deleted. The numerous assays that need to be done drove us to develop a standardized battery of assays, so that the cell can be studied as an entire system, as opposed to the methods used in past literature that only measured the effects of genetic engineering on just one manifestation.
Defect in the Biobrick Paradigm
The Biobrick paradigm is that gene parts are necessarily additive, due to the mechanics of the Biobrick Assembly method. Consequently, apart from by using “additive” exotic methods such as RNAi to disrupt gene expression to achieve functional gene silencing, gene deletions from a genome (negative “additive” modifications) simply cannot be submitted to the Gene Parts Registry.
The spectacular success of the metabolic engineering field eminently shows the defect in this paradigm. Successful engineering of model organisms is based on using chemical kinetics and metabolic networks, where metabolite flux is directed by both gene up-regulation and deletion. (Insert examples here...)
Since deletions from a cell's genome is another means to engineering the cell as a system, we have also characterized the biofilm response of a set of knockout E. coli. Unfortunately, these systems cannot be submitted to the biobrick registry because they do not conform to the Biobrick paradigm, an issue we hope that the iGEM competition can address.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"s, new types of antibiotics cannot be expected to overcome this problem (10).
During visits to several wound clinics and medical specialists (see Integrated Practices ), we learned about other treatment options. In addition to antibiotics, doctors use range of antiseptic bandages and creams. However, most of them are ineffective according to Dr. Peters, a specialist in diabetic wounds. Mechanical cleaning is still an important part of (burn) wound treatments, but it is painful for the patient and labor-intensive. Furthermore, doctors often resort to systemic antibiotics, especially before the type of infection has been diagnosed. Dr. Dokter complained that non-specific antibiotics are often ineffective. In addition, their use contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. Moreover, it negatively affects patients’ gut microbiome, which in the case of diabetic patients is already frequently disturbed. Other side-effects such as Karel’s kidney and liver problems are also commonly reported (14).
Requirements
Considering the problem of antibiotic resistance and the ineffectiveness of alternative treatments, we need a treatment which is specific, local and does not use antibiotics.
Specificity
The specificity requirement leads us to bacteriocins. Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides naturally produced by a large variety of bacteria. They normally target closely related strains. The bacteriocin comes with an immunity mechanism which protects the producing strain from the bacteriocin’s activity (15). Specific bacteriocins are already used as preservatives in the food industry, others are tested for use in pharmaceutical applications. Thanks to the rise in (multiple) antibiotic-resistant pathogens, bacteriocins have gained renewed interested over the past two decades (15). Interestingly, resistance against bacteriocins is not common, especially in comparison to conventional antibiotics. The resistance frequencies however differ greatly per bacteriocin (16).
As we had recognized S. aureus as the most common cause of wound infections, we searched for a suitable bacteriocin targeting it. A constraint in the search was that the selected bacteriocin cannot be not toxic to E. coli. Lysostaphin is a bacteriolytic enzyme which cleaves the cell wall of Staphylococci (18). Previously, it has been demonstrated that lysostaphin treatment eradicated regular and antibiotic-resistant S. aureus in bone fractures (18). It had already been shown that lysostaphin can be safely produced by E. coli (19). Importantly, resistance against lysostaphin is not commonly detected and there are indications that it comes with reduced fitness and increased susceptibility to other antibiotics (20). We thus selected lysostaphin as our main bacterioc"
SECA_NZ,2017,Team:SECA NZ#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," allow for a frost intolerant crop to be covered by a taller, more frost tolerant crop. This method has limitations in terms of crops that can be grown in unison and are not overly competitive. This can also reduce radiation absorption from the sheltered plants so there is a balance of when to use this and when not to. Coverings are another noted way that heat loss through convection. There are large labour and supply costs associated with the implementation of this method so tends to be used on smaller plants and gardens. At the Mitre10 website a frost cloth 1x20m is $8.98.  Protein sprays are a recent innovation developed by students in Canada (Ali, 2017). The protein coat, when sprayed over crops will temporarily insulate the crops while allowing sunlight to enter the plant. A second different spray application can break down this initial spray into nutrients which can be absorbed by the plant and soil. There are no quotes currently on how much this product would cost.
Active forms of frost resistance vary in cost and effectiveness. Sprinkler systems are used by many growers to combat frost due to their low running costs (Snyder, Melo-Abreu, & Matulich, 2005). A small labour cost is required to turn the valves for these mechanisms on, with a relatively small amount of power consumption, and most farmers implementing this system having access to free (or very close to it) fresh water. Implementation costs are relatively high but can be earned back if the same system is used over multiple seasons. Exact costs were difficult to source so further market validation is required. Heating systems operate similarly, being switched on just before frosts occur. According to one sprinkler system developer, the expenses for each acre are $495 USD  (Fontela, 2013). Independent analysis is required to assess whether this is accurate.
Fig1. shows a Négociant in Bordeaux, France lighting candles to protect his grapes from frost. This shows the lengths growers will go protect their livelihoods. Source
Similar to this, Candles are sometimes used to protect grapes from frost. This is a traditional method used in some areas for generations for striking effect. It is not clear how effective this method in comparison to more modern methods but there is a large labour cost associated with its implementation. Frost fans are another commonly used method for combating frosts. Permanent fans are often placed in orchards where the same crop is grown year on year. These are expensive to install and maintain and have been known to cause controversy in some communities due to the large amounts of noise they generate early in the morning"

Badge Design

Overview
Badge
The design of the badge has been a significant part of our work. It must be small, practical and bio-secure, preventing our bacteria from escaping into the environment. As our badge is specifically made to be used outside the lab, the biosecurity aspect needed careful attention. To respect these specifications, we decided to set it up as an assembly of three separate pieces, all of which can be 3D printed. Some parts are also safely reusable, so you don’t have to replace the entire badge when it is used.
The first one is the support, that can be attached to a bracelet by simply pulling it through the gaps on both edges. This part will never get in contact with the bacteria and is thus reusable. The middle part of the support contains a hole, allowing the second part of the badge to come in and to be secured, thanks to the groove on the side and on the bottom.
The second part is the heart of our system, we call it the capsule. It’s the piece that holds the medium containing our UV sensitives bacteria. Therefore, it is completely sealed, except for a small hole left on the side which allows us to fill it with medium and bacteria. This hole will also be used to ensure the biosafety of our badge, in cooperation with the last part. Regarding the top of the capsule, it is covered with a transparent polymer, that lets both visible and UV light pass through. There are also two smalls teeth on the bottom which fit into the support grooves to secure the capsule in place. You can finally find a small bump on top of the hole which will be used to secure this piece into the support using the final part.
Last but not least, the next part is called the safety ring. It will act as one of our biosecurity features. It’s a hollow cylinder that contains bleach, connected to the outside only by a small hole on the inside. Similarly to the hole in the capsule, this one serves as an opening to fill the ring and as the second cooperating part regarding the biosafety mechanism. You can also"

If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.
