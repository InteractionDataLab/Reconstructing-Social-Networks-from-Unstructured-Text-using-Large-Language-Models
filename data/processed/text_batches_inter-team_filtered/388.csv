Before the shovel trucks there was a conveyer belt system that needed maintainance every hour for every two hours it worked. The conveyer belt system moved . System is so large that cars can go under the ‘vehicle’ . The system even has a red light and green light.  Muskeg the rich part of the soil that contains seeds / nutrients etc . When land reclaimation occurs then barley is planted over the Muskeg to prevent soil erosion. Barley holds the soil until the seedlings can grow then the Barley dries out. –which is a good thing or else the seedlings would have to compete with barley to grow.  Oil sands history – underground oil reserve brought up by the formation of the mountains and caused the oil to mix with the sand Oil sand – part oil / sand/ water When oil sand is boiled the oil (bitumen ) becomes less denser than water and floats on water . This is how the oil is separated.  When oil sand is too deep and can’t be dug or someother reason . Pipelines are drilled – slant drills- until oil sand reservoir is reached then steam is pumped into the soil. The steam seperates the oil from the sand and makes it possible to collect the oil from this underground diposite.  Sweet product – without sulfur , sour product – with sulfur . The removed sulfur is used in fertilizer – Syncrude has a fertilizer plant on site.  Housing in Ft Mc is very hard . Companies sometimes give employees 1000 extra for living expenses. Reclaiming the land and water -  The water  ( the polluted fine tails ) are made fit for living organisms through applying a thin layer of pure water periodically . The pollution is supposed to settle at the bottom of the pond while the pure water remains above. Over a 20 year period Suncore hopes to achieve reclaimation of the land. Some of the land that’s been currently claimed can’t be fit for human visitation until it has been certified that the land is safe.  During land reclaimation , the landscape is made to be hilly and not straight . consideration is placed on water drainage .

Approach
In order to engineer E. coli in the outer chamber to turn atmospheric CO2 into cellulose, the carbon first needs to be fixated by the bacteria. This requires the heterologous expression of the genes encoding the three enzymes RuBisCo, SBPase, and PRK. Furthermore, the implementation of the carboxysome from the cso operon can increase the levels of carbon fixation. The 2014 Bielefeld iGEM team had worked with a similar approach in their project. In an endeavour to optimise the carbon fixation process, our project build upon their experiences. The assembly of the individual parts into a composite part, BBa_K2449030 , was achieved, however, the cloning of these parts with a promoter emerged problematic. Consequently, it was decided to prioritise other aspects"

Q1：Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
A: All of our team members had safety training and our operation is according to the safety instructions. We use E.coli and Caulobacter crescentus in our lab and both of them belong to Risk 1 Group, so it's safe relatively as long as we follow the rules in our lab. The protein we expressed is also innocuous. Even if it's mishandled accidently, any negative effect upon researchers, public or environment would be neglectable.
Q2：Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
A: The fluorescent proteins and the chromoprotein are widely used, so none of the new biobrick parts that we made this year raise any safety issue.
Q3：Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
A: Professor Zhi-Gang Tian is responsible for biological safety at our institution. Yes,we have been discussing the possible risks like gene pollution and the healthy of people in the lab. Professor Tian had suggested us that we make a duty report to supervise the regulation in our lab to prevent the possible risks and it works well.
Q4：Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
A: The resistance gene of our E.coli may cause genetic pollution. As antibiotic-resistance genes are commonly used as markers during plasmid construction, there is therefore major concern that their presence in environment released GMMs could contribute to the generation of antibiotic-resistant 'superbugs'. So we think maybe we could use auxotrophic bacteria for our screening in the future work.
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today

Yale,2014,Team:Yale#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," much sooner generate any of ~2314 other partially recoded strains before the fully recoded strain, and running enough MAGE cycles to obtain that strain would allow time for spontaneous point mutations to accumulate unchecked by the knocked-out mismatch repair system. To construct the strain we will use 32 separate strains were generated, each with a different recoded sector, and those sectors were assembled by hierarchical conjugation. The recoded strain was validated by sequencing, and its RF1 was deleted to free the TAG codon for reassignment to an orthogonal translation system.14
Orthogonal Translation Systems
An amino acid can be assigned to a particular codon by a two-part translation system: a tRNA with its anticodon loop complementary to the codon, and an aminoacyl synthetase (hereafter called a synthetase) able to charge this tRNA with the amino acid. This system is orthogonal to endogenous translation systems if and only if this synthetase aminoacylates only this tRNA and endogenous synthetases cannot aminoacylate this tRNA. Usually, an unnatural amino acid thus assigned should also be sufficiently dissimilar from naturally encoded amino acids that endogenous synthetases would not charge endogenous tRNAs with the unnatural amino acid, to avoid partially reassigning other codons and disrupting cell function.15
Many synthetases include a nonconserved loop specific to their associated tRNA’s anticodon, preventing them from binding a tRNA reassigned to CUA, but the archaeum Methanococcus jannaschii’s tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (MjtRNAs) and its associated tRNA translation system still bind after the anticodon is mutated, and is an amber suppressor when transformed into E. coli.16 This MjtRNAs was still aminoacylated by endogenous synthetases, so its specificity for its synthetase was improved by random mutation at eleven positions not directly interacting with its synthetase, followed by negative selection against nonspecific acylation and positive selection for specific acylation. 17
This orthogonal system has since been engineered by directed evolution of its synthetase to incorporate nonstandard amino acids, in place of tyrosine. 18 Diverse synthetases were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of five residues in the amino acid-binding pocket, and screened by positive selection, for incorporation of the amino acid into a protein conferring antibiotic resistance, and a negative screen, against mutants resistant to the antibiotic even in the absence of the nonstandard amino acid (by treating colonies on a replica plate lacking the amino acid"

sgRNA woth switchable crRNA sequence and RFP reporter       Bba_K2654002 in pSB1C3
This biobrick was created to ease the creation of new sgRNA of your design. The invariant tracRNA is already in there, all you have to do is cut with the restriction enzyme BaeI and incorporate the nucleotide (crRNA) of your           design. The clones whit your new sgRNA will appear white and the others red (because of the RFP).
Strong promoter J23119 Bba_R0010 : This promoter is the strongest from a big combinatorial family : (J23100:J23119).
Strong RBS B0034 : Strongest RBS from the family B0030:B0034
Modified mRFP E1010 : Engineered mutant of the red fluorescent protein of Discosoma striata. We performed two silent mutations to avoid two forbidden restriction sites in the RFP               gene: the codon 197-199 TAC was mutated in a TAT, and the codon 527-529 GAA was mutated into a GAG. After those mutations we verified that the RFP was still expressed and that there was no effect on fluorescence.
TracRNA: We based the sequence of these gene on a review (Jiang et al., 2015), this sequence is considered mostly invariable.

This LacI regulated promoter was used in our reporter plasmid to promote the experession of the GFP coding cassette (See Composite parts ).
Where does this biobrick come from and how to use it:
The idea was to make a Biobrick where the variable region of the sgRNA could easily be modified by an assembly with two oligonucleotides. The next step would be to assemble multiple modified biobricks to obtain an multiplex of sgRNA’s in           a cloning vector. Finally, this cassette can"

Slovenia,2012,Team:Slovenia#SafetyMechanismsTermination_-_-_TEXT.html," We also demonstrated that even if some cells do not express mGMK:TK30 (GFP was used as a control of transfection), ganciclovir affects practically all cells in a culture (Figure 5). If transiently transfected therapeutic cells would be microencapsulated and used for therapy, the bystander effect ensures that all cells in a microcapsule would be killed upon addition of ganciclovir even if some of them would not express the HSV-thymidine kinase.
Figure 5. Ganciclovir kills cells expressing mGMK:TK30. Cells were incubated with GCV for 5 days. Cells were transfected with 100 ng plasmid PCMV_mGMK:TK30 and 20 ng GFP (depicted green). Cells depicted on (A) were not treated with GCV. Image (B) depicts cell death after incubation with 10 µg/mL GCV and image (C) shows drastic decrease in cell survival after incubation with 100 µg/mL GCV.
Trypan Blue and SytoxGreen514 only stain cells that are already dead. We also wanted to determine the number of cells that are still in the early stages of apoptosis. To do this we stained the cells with Annexin V and analyzed them with flow cytometry. Annexin V binds phosphatidylserine, which is located on the inner side of the plasma membrane. When apoptosis is initiated phosphatidylserine is translocated to the extracellular side of the plasma membrane which enables staining with Annexin V.
Figure 6 shows the percent of Annexin V positive cells 65 hours after ganciclovir addition. The percent of apoptotic cells increases with higher ganciclovir concentrations and higher amounts of transfected pPCMV_mGMK:TK30. Even though only around 25 % of cells stain with Annexin V we must keep in mind that after 65 hours ganciclovir already killed a large amount of cells which were therefore not included in the analysis.
Figure 6. Apoptosis triggered by ganciclovir is mGMK:TK30 dependent. Analysis by flow cytometry was conducted on untransfected cells and cells transfected with 500 ng and 1000 ng plasmid PCMV_mGMK:TK30, after 65 hours of incubation with 0, 30 and 100 mg/L GCV. Cells were gated according to the intensity of Annexin V-PE (channel FL2) compared to unstained cells.

Above is model's parameters from past published documents: these parameters' values are all determined under the condition of NO's amount of substance is 220nH, at this time，D1=1，D2=D3=0，cGMP’s initial concentration is  0，VsGC,max, KPDE, K4is constant.
2.3 Innovation analysis of cGMP combined with PKG
In our modeling, we assume that, compared with the synthetic rate of cGMP, PKG was activated by cGMP and the target cell phosphorylationis is relatively a fast event. The regulation of cGMP can be evaluated by the normalization function of the concentration of cGMP, A ([cGMP]): when the available amount of cGMP reached the minimum (i.e.: [cGMP]→0, namely: no impact), A→0 ; when the available amount of cGMP reached the maximum (i.e.: the greatest impact), A→1. Therefore, we consider cGMP as a molecular switch of adjusting start and termination of the reaction. We use the Hill Equation to approximate the function:
Km and the Hill coefficient(nH) relatively represent the value when variation tendency of model changes and the step degree of switch. This is only an approximate empirical formula, we can get the precise equation by experiment data. Considering that the reaction rate of cGMP combined with PKG is fast, we assume that the regulation process is reasonable. Therefore, any value of target number Q which is generated by the changes of the amount of cGMP can be generally described by the following algebraic equation:
Q=Qbasal+AcGMP(Km,nH)Qchange
Qbasal represents the basic situation of cGMP, Qchangeepresents the biggest change of which is induced by cGMP. Q can represent the rate constant of enzymatic reaction, conductivity of ion channels and so on.
But due to the restrictions of our students’ own level, we can’t make mathematical reasoning for the complex process deeply, so we can only write the main idea as above. As to describe this process by mathematical model language completely and to draw a conclusion which is consistent with the actual situation, we can complete it only to wait until after we improve ourselves.

We reasoned that the idea of asRNA.  If we design and prove that is functional we will repress the fage infection easier. The idea is that infected bacteria will send HSL to alarm their neighbors about the infection, afterwards the bacteria close to this place will express the asRNA, so if lytic phase of phages is faster than the transcription machinery and the toxin’s action  time (This implies that the first infected bacteria will “lose” even when contains the construction), the bacterial population next to the infected will express an antisense that if the lytic phages infect one of the alerted bacteria, it will be already prepared with the antisense.
Sept 8th – 18th Design of the antisensense RNA
We looked for any target that was mentioned as essential in the literature. We decided to attack phages in their replication process, because of the targets we found, so we reasoned that if the phage tries to replicate it’s genome the asRNA is going to block the process reducing dramatically the burst size or if the efficiency is high, there wont be any new phage. The target is NOT the RNA polymerase because we want it to express the kamikaze device.
The design included literature reading of examples to block the translation of proteins in bacteria, and particularly to those in which the target sequences were phages’.  The 5’ of the transcript should be blocked. The replication is a good target, in some articles some of the components of the replication were targeted and the efficiency of plaquing diminished as well as the size of the plaques.
We met Dr. José Luis Reyes Taboada who is expert in the field of RNAs. With his guidance we looked for structures in RNAFold with high Gibbs energy values (the less negative, the better), we also checked that the structures were not blocking the RBS.
We planned to include a marker such as mRFP in the 5' side of the antisense, but we though that the translation of this protein would interfer with the function of the antisense, thus we will include this biobrick induced by the complex LuxR-HSL (as well as the mRFP), but in different cistrons.
Why not to use the same target mRNA for both phages? Because the upstream sequences of the essential genes are not conserved more than 90%, and the efficiency of silencing would decrease dramatically for one if we take the antisense sequence of the other. Why not use the two different sequences but for the same target in the two ph"

""LACTOBACILLI are considered to be catalase-negative1, or occasionally to produce very small amounts of catalase2. The lactobacilli isolated from dairy products have always been found to be catalase-negative3,4. During recent work on the microflora of Cheddar cheese, we have encountered strains of lactobacilli which possess both strong and weak catalase activity. Three strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, originally isolated by Sherwood3 from New Zealand Cheddar cheese, were found to be catalase-positive. Two of the strains gave strong catalase reactions whereas the other strain was much weaker (see Table 1)."" - http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v178/n4535/abs/178700a0.html
Nina: This information is good, since we thought that there would not be any chance lactobacillus would express catalase.
""Even though our activated engineered cells will eventually die from their oxidative burst, we want them to survive long enough to produce large amounts of the oxidase so they can produce large amounts of hydrogen peroxide. If the cells were left to produce hydrogen peroxide without any protection, they would produce just enough H2O2  to be cytotoxic and then fissle, killing only themselves and little else. To avoid this problem, an E. coli catalase will be expressed by default, and then turned off shortly after pyruvate oxidase expression is triggered. We are accomplishing this regulation by putting katG (on of two E. coli catalase genes) behind the TetR sensitive promoter (pTet) and having TetR co-transciptionally expressed with the oxidase. The time it takes for TetR to accumulate in the cell provides the delay in repressing KatG expression. To ensure KatG is rapidly cleared from the cells, it has a C-terminal ssrA degradation tag, which should reduce the protein’s half life to the order of minutes. In this way, the cell can be temporarily protected from hydrogen peroxide, but large amounts can accumulate before the substrate is exhausted. The final strain will have deletions of both catalases, ensuring that we have complete control over catalase expression. "" - https://2008.igem.org/Team:Caltech/Project/Oxidative_Burst

Figure 6 shows the maximized growth flux generated by FBA model for aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Aerobic condition is set as oxygen flux=0, fumarate flux lower bound=-20.42mmol/gDW/h,acetate flux upper bound=3.134mmol/gDW/h, pyruvate flux upper bound=0.872mmol/gDW/h, and hexane flux ranges from -5mmol/gDW/h to zero. Aerobic condition is set as oxygen flux lower bound=20.42mmol/gDW/h
In this part, we used FBA to generate the maximized growth flux of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 when providing hexane as energy source. Reaction constraints were set based on literature [5] values and genome database was adjusted to suit our engineered construct by adding the alkane degradation reactions. Results show that the maximized growth under aerobic condition is around 0.513 h-1 , while the anaerobic growth flux is around 0.298h-1 , both enough to sustain growth. This means theoretically, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is able to grow in a hexane-containing media without provision of lactate or glucose under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
 
 
 
 
Maximum current generation and power output
Current is given by the derivative of the electric charge over time. The electron flux can be converted to current using Faraday’s constant 96485 C/mol
Given the maximum DET flux is 81.68mmol/gDW/h, therefore, the Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is possible to generate current up to 2.189A/gDW.
The upper limit of MFC cell voltage is calculated based on the difference of standard cell potential in the anode and cathode. The standard potential are summarized in the table.

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Proof#Directed Evolution_-_-_TEXT.html," can be controlled simply by varying the initial amount of target DNA in the reaction or the number of amplification cycles performed.
Mutation frequency is the product of DNA polymerase error rate and number of duplications. In the GeneMorph II kit, a sufficiently high error rate is achieved through use of Mutazyme II DNA polymerase. A low, medium or high mutation frequency is produced by adjusting the initial target DNA amounts in the amplification reactions. For the same PCR yield, targets amplified from low amounts of target DNA undergo more duplications than targets amplified from high concentrations of DNA. The more times a target is replicated, the more errors accumulate. Therefore, higher mutation frequencies are achieved simply by lowering
input DNA template concentration. Conversely, lower PCR mutation frequencies can be achieved by using higher DNA template concentrations to limit the number of target duplications. Mutation rates can also be decreased by lowering the number of cycles to achieve fewer target duplications. For targets that produce high product yields after 30 cycles, lower mutation rates can be achieved by amplifying lower target amounts for 20–25 cycles. This table below shows the relationship between mutation frequency and initial target quantity.

iGEM Bulgaria
iGEM Bulgaria also responded to our collaboration request that was posted on the iGEM collaboration hub. In this instance, we were actually able to help them by sending materials for use in the wet lab. Specifically, iGEM Bulgaria wanted to try new means of chromosomal integration, so we provided them with the Serine Integrase Bxb1 and the recombineering plasmids pSIM7 and pSIM9, so they could attempt various methods of chromosomal integration in E. coli should any method not work. They were also very obliging in helping our team with human practices as well, answering our detailed skill-exchange questions, which helped us gain a better understanding of communication between biologists and engineers in particular.
Edinburgh OG
As a collaboration, we have helped the Edinburgh_OG team by giving them the E. coli BL21(DE3) and C600, essential to work with T7 and P1 phages respectively. We provided them the electroporator, used for the λ phage work to electroporate their constructs into the phage. Finally, we did a join presentation at the for 30 people through the Synthetic biology society at the University of Edinburgh to raise awareness and interest about iGEM by explaining the competition and our projects.

The analysis revealed that the native signal peptide is formed by amino acids 1-30, which means that Zhang et al. removed more than the predicted native signal peptide for their experiment. The results of the prediction are shown in Figure 1. Analysis of the transmembrane topology of the transporter, which is integrated into the plastid membrane in its native algal cell, shows iterative non-cytoplasmatic, transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. The topology might indicate, that the transporter will be integrated into the inner membrane when expressed in E. coli.
Figure 1: Results of the analysis of PtNTT2 using Phobius.
The 30 first amino acids are clearly recognized as a signal peptide. Ten transmembrane domains are predicted.
Plasmid Design
For the analysis and characterization of PtNTT2, a total of eleven plasmids were designed and cloned based on initial research and the computational analysis. The coding sequence of PtNTT2 was codon optimized using the IDT Codon Optimization Tool and ordered as two gBlocks. Using overlap extension PCR, the two gBlocks were put together and inserted into pSB1C3 using Gibson Assembly. The truncated versions of the transporter as well as the versions with new signal peptides were constructed using primers and Gibson Assembly.
Figure 2: Schematic overview of the design of the different transporter variants. The lacUV5 promotor was used together with a strong RBS ( BBa_B0034 ) for all parts. All variants except for pSB1C3-PtNTT2 were also tagged with GFP ( BBa_E0040 ). cMyc was used as a linker ( BBa_K2201181 ).
All plasmids except pSB1C3-PtNTT2 were tagged with the same cMyc-GFP construct for imaging and Western Blots. cMyc was used as a linker to allow the targeting of the fusion protein with two separate antibodies, an anti-GFP antibody and the anti-cMyc antibody. The GFP part was taken from BBa_E0040 , while the cMyc fragment was taken from BBa_K2201181 . The fusion proteins were assembled using Gibson Assembly. A schematic overview of the design of the different plasmids is shown in Figure 2.

In the previous iGEM competitions, human practice was always the vital and indispensable element. As a group of creators, we devoted ourselves to producing a practical and effective Bio machine. To achieve that tough goal, we need to not only spend a ton of time in the lab but also do something relative to the society who will be our target consumer and real beneficiary. Therefore, we took some actions.
We designed the questionary and gave them out on the website and different communities to see whether people were interested in our project. To find out the existing questions among the sweeteners found already and to improve our project, we interview some relevant authoritative experts. Besides, market demand and trading policy are also significant for us and that’s why we went and discussed with Sixin Wang, the chief engineer of Sdic Zhonglu Fruit Juice Co.,Ltd (the NO.1 company that focuses on producing concentrated apple juice) and some of the bosses in the COFCO (the one of the top 500 corporations and the most advanced food supplier in China) right after we finished our original plan. In later period, we organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University to have a large scale conference to popularize iGEM and collected the critical advice to improve our project. On the final stage, we met the bosses of COFCO again and we were proudly encouraged by them and they believed that we were likely to be successful in the future market.
QUESTIONARY
After we were sending out the questionaries on the website and communities, we realized that different people prefer various flavors, but most of them are still fans of sweetness which makes people feel happy and warm. According to what we found，there is an excellent opportunity for us to research the sweeteners. Prior to we design the specific plan, it is necessary for us to learn about the existing questions relevant to the sweeteners that been observed already.
We mainly have two questions:
Which sweetener do you prefer?
What are your interesting features of sweetness?
Through these two questions our questionary got the information about the market demand. We knew that people might be more acceptable to natural sweet"

But iGEM is also a means of building relationships, especially orchestrating cooperation among various people from many different backgrounds.  This summer, all three Albertan teams (University of Alberta, University of Calgary and the University of Lethbridge) met once in each hometown and participated in workshops.  This allowed us to effectively exchange ideas and work together towards our individual project goals. aGEM, one of our regional workshops that was held in Edmonton, served as an arena in which we could present our projects to the other teams and the field's professionals.  We are grateful to AITF for putting on aGEM and our other workshops.

Our First Priority
Perhaps one of greatest developments in the modern era is the value of safety, a value which iGEM celebrates and upholds firmly. As part of this forward-thinking competition, the members of Team UAlberta have made the consideration for safety a foundation upon which all decisions are made. In the different aspects of our iGEM 2017 journey, we ensured that the pertinent safety concerns were thoroughly addressed.
Safety Training
A large component of any iGEM project is the wet lab. Before any exciting iGEM work commences, the members of Team UAlberta fulfilled the necessary laboratory safety requirements. These included completing five online courses called Laboratory Safety, Chemical Safety, Concepts in Biosafety, WHMIS 2017, and Fire Extinguishers, as well as attending the corresponding in-person seminars and training sessions. The University of Alberta’s Environment, Health and Safety Unit administered these courses which adhered to Canada’s and Alberta’s Occupational Health and Safety regulations.
Beyond this, our members received tours of the laboratory spaces we were to use to highlight the locations of safety equipment, such as the eyewash station and fire extinguishers, as well as the fire exits. Our mentors , Rochelin Dalangin and Abdullah Farooq, also provided rigorous instruction regarding protocols, standard operating procedures, and the safety precautions related to our duties in the lab.
The members of Team UAlberta were involved in setting up a new iGEM laboratory space, where we would eventually do some of our project work. As we were the first group to work in the space, we were responsible for setting up much of the safety support structure in the new lab. Without the safety skillsets imparted by the courses and from instruction, we would have never been able to accomplish such a feat.
Laboratory Safety
The extensive safety orientation Team UAlberta received prepared us for all aspects of our laboratory work. Both lab spaces which our team used were Containment Level 2, while our chassis of choice, E. coli BTH101 and DH10B, are both Risk Level 1 organisms. During our summer, we were diligent in:
Wearing Personal Protective Equipment: All work in the lab was conducted while wearing long pants"
Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Labjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," some bases prior to the recognition sites. But after there is little time left until wiki freeze and the new primers need some time until they are here we started a last trial for cloning this 'wrong' PCR products in the shuttle vector. The idea was to phosphorylate and ligate the ends of the PCR product from tvel5 together. Then the problem with the missing bases at the end would be solved and AarI can digest the end of the PCR product. We digested the shuttle vector with AarI and dephosphorylated it. After ligation we transformed the approaches in E. coli KRX cells.
The ligation of the parts in pSB1C3 was not successful. So the Parts and the plasmid have to be digested with EcoRI and SpeI restriction enzymes.
Team Cellulose Binding Domain:
Designed a lot of primers to cope with the expression problem. E.g. inserting a long S3N10-Linker via blunt-end-cloning between the CBD and the GFP, also primers to get rid of the His-tag on the GFP and a last set to easily change the order of CBD and GFP (via assembly but with no linker in between).
Plasmid-isolation of <partinfo>BBa_K863104</partinfo>-transformation clones
Colony-PCR of CBDcex_Freiburg and CBDclos_Freiburg colonies. All CBDclos_Freiburg -colonies are positive and half of the CBDcex_Freiburg -colonies.
Colony-PCR of CBDclos_F.+GFP with no positive result
Colony-PCR of const.GFP_His : 2 positive (one fluorescend); Plated both positive and one additional fluorescend.

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#SinceAmsterdam_-_-_TEXT.html,". Afterwards, the reaction mix was transferred to a NAD+ bioassay and the fluorescence intensity was monitored. In Figure 21 the normalized initial fluorescence enhancement rates for the employed pyruvate concentrations are indicated. The calculated initial velocity was then plotted against the pyruvate concentration (Figure 22).
Figure 21: Fluorescence enhancement rate after addition of LDH reaction mix with various pyruvate concentrations into a LigA-dependent NAD+ bioassay. 50 ng/µL LDH was preincubated with 100 µM NADH and different pyruvate concentrations for 2 min at 37 °C. 1 µL of the LDH reaction mix was then added to a NAD+ bioassay, composed of a nicked DNA substrate (250 nM molecular beacon hybridized to a split target) and 6.5 ng/µL LigA, and the fluorescence intensity was monitored. For illustration the fluorescence intensity is normalized for each measurement series to the first measured fluorescence value after LDH reaction mix addition (n = 4).
Figure 22: Initial velocity calibration curve for pyruvate. The initial velocity, calculated from the average fluorescence enhancement rate in 100 s after LDH reaction mix addition into a LigA-dependent NAD+ bioassay, is plotted versus the employed pyruvate concentration. Data is fitted with linear regression for pyruvate concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 µM (R² = 0.951, n = 4).
The addition of the LDH reaction mix resulted in a characteristic fluorescence enhancement rate depending on the employed pyruvate concentration. The existing correlation between both parameters seemed to be a linear. That the signal for 0 µM pyruvate was remarkably high could be the result of an pyruvate-independent transfer of electrons from NADH to the active site histidine of LDH under formation of NAD+. The limit of detection for pyruvate seemed to be near 1 µM pyruvate. That this value was not in nano molarity scale is firstly caused by 100-fold dilution of the LDH reaction mix after addition to the NAD+ bioassay and secondly by the fact that LDH does not necessarily converte 100 % of the pyruvate to L-lactate. Nevertheless, for the LigA based NAD+ detection system it has been proven that it can be coupled to NADH-dependent"

We submitted a new gene to the registry to assist in the production of PHB: the phaJ gene that codes for PHB enoyl-CoA hydratase. This part contains both the phaJ and phaC genes and was shown to produce PHB on its own in E. coli under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter. HPLC was used to identify and quantify the PHB produced. Results can be found on our part's Registry page.

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2015,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Human Practice#Desalination_-_-_TEXT.html," the use of semipermeable, ion-selective membranes operating in a DC electric field. The major method in the Middle East is thermal desalination because of it rich oil deposits.
Ion exchange - A chemical process involving the reversible exchange of ions between a liquid and a solid.
Multiple effect distillation (MED) - A thin film evaporation process where the vapor formed in a chamber, or effect, condenses in the next, providing a heat source for further evaporation.
Multi-stage flash distillation (MSF) - A desalination process where a stream of brine flows through the bottom of chambers, or stages, each operating at a successively lower pressure, and a proportion of it flashes into steam and is then condensed.
Reverse osmosis (RO) - A method of separating water from dissolved salts by passing feedwater through a semipermeable membrane at a pressure greater than the osmotic pressure caused by the dissolved salts. RO operates via a solution/diffusion mechanism whereby the water dissolves into and diffuses through the nonporous membrane, leaving the majority of the salts behind in the concentrate. RO membranes are also capable of removing some larger organic contaminants. Small uncharged species can pass through the membrane. Water that passes through the membrane leaves the unit as permeate or product water; most of the dissolved impurities remain behind and are discharged in a brine or waste stream.
Vapor compression evaporation (VC/VCE)—Thermal desalination processes that utilize heat from compression of water vapor for subsequent evaporation of feedwater, either with a mechanical compressor (mechanical vapor compression, MVC) or a steam ejector (thermal vapor compression, TVC). Vapor compression processes are particularly useful for small to medium installation.
Reverse Osmosis Method
Which desalination method will be the key to this industry?
In 2008, membrane and distillation processes equally share current desalination production capacity worldwide (Greenlee, 2009). We can’t find the current information, yet, RO technology can produce fresh water (from seawater) at one-half to one-third of the cost of distillation in 2008 already (Miller, 2003).
The Middle East holds approximately 50% of the world’s production capacity (and 2.9% of the world’s population) and has forged ahead as the leader in large-scale seawater desalination (Greenlee, 2009). In 2005, Israel opened the world’s largest seawater RO desalination plant, with a production capacity of 330,000m^3/day"

UCL,2013,Team:UCLA#Project#mrnaDisplay_-_-_TEXT.html," an in vivo system (the BPP-1 phage) and using it as the scaffold in our in vitro protein selection system.  We know that in that native system of the BPP-1 phage, a large library of phages are generated with unique variants of the Mtd protein on their tail fibers.  Out of this large library, some phage are able to effectively bind to a certain target using the Mtd protein.
A major concern is that the Mtd protein may not behave the same way in vitro as it does in the natural BPP-1 system.  Although we are theoretically able to generate more variants of Mtd than in the natural phage system, it is possible that isolating it from the phage could seriously affect its binding capabilities.  For example, the native phage has several tail fibers, each with a copy of the Mtd that could potentially bind to a target.  It may be that one isolated Mtd has a very low binding affinity and that it is necessary to have several in order to create a strong enough binding interaction with the target (Dai).

As one of the ten teams who were awarded an OT-2 Opentrons robot, we used the interlab program written by Team Stony Brook, modified for our labware set up.  The results demonstrated the potential for reprodicibility and standardization of protocols.  In addition to replicating our interlab work, we also wrote a more intricate program for the OT-2 to perform our device testing.  We used the robot to prepare our dilutions, and dispense our chemicals and our samples into 96-well plates.  By implementing this structure over testing our biobrick devices, we were able to achieve true replicate testing, and ensure accuracy and consistency of all paradigms being tested.  We maintained confidence that the samples and concentrations reflected in our data were accurate representations of our planned experiments.  We eliminated the outliers of hand pipetted plates where single wells might have missed application of a single reagent or sample."

UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Medals_-_-_TEXT.html," the implications that science can have on the broader world, in a variety of creative ways – and with a range of creative outcomes. We have considered the intersection of our project and the law, and how the law impacts both funding and protection of ideas. From this, we have produced a policy submissions guide and submission, in order to prompt further discussion on the correct balance of protection and stimulating innovation in science. We have also considered how our system may translate commercially, and how we can facilitate its use in practical industries like pharmaceutical production. Finally, we taught and presented our project (and synthetic biology) to a variety of people across society, including 120 people at a symposium we ran, students on a high school excursion that we organised for them, in Arts courses, and science academics. This was important because we realised that you cannot do research in a bubble – you need to engage with both the next generation and the people around you who rely on and engage with your inventions.

Description
Model
Our modelling work was used to inform the design of our system, verifying that our choice of a prefoldin scaffold lends itself well to enzyme clustering. Our model is simple to operate and can be altered for different enzymes based on the specific kinetic parameters of an enzyme's reaction. We modelled the effect that distance between enzymes has on final production yields in an enzyme reaction. Our results showed that clustering enzymes improves reaction yield, and thus justified our experimental hypothesis. In designing our model we engaged with industry and academic sources to verify the underlying assumptions and feasibility of validating our model with experimental data. The final model employed the finite element method to solve a numerical solution of Fick’s diffusion equation, with rates of substrate production and consumption at enzymes in the system controlled by Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
Integrated Human Practices
Our project's human practices elements have informed the direction of our scaffold design and experimental methodologies. Industry visits and consultations led the team to consider the modularity of the scaffold, and how this was a great advantage. Modelling work was then undertaken to allow us to model different enzymes to assess if they would be commercially viable. Talking to industry also meant that we saw the need for a thermostable and chemically stable scaffold that would self-assemble, so that it would be easy to use and apply in many different contexts, which was implemented with the choice of prefoldin. We also decided on our covalent protein attachment mechanism after human practices research into the legalities of using the mechanism determined that there were no legal issues with using that mechanism in Australia - otherwise another mechanism with more cross-reactivity would have been used."

There are only 20,000 people can enjoy the ease brought by CI due to the high price. As a result, we need people to focus on this issue. We hope people can devote to take part in research, charity or simple spread this idea, to make more people able to enjoy the sound.
At the same time, he believes that though hearing aids and CIs are the most direct and efficient way currently, they cannot solve the problem of hearing loss thoroughly. Protect our ears to prevent more hearing impairment cases, together with elaborate studies on hearing using biological methods, tend to be the profound and lasting resolution. He mentioned that our project idea is good to solve the root of the problem.
Medication
After consulting with otologist, we learnt some knowledge about treatment for hearing-loss people.
Ear is composed of four main parts. Outer ear is the entry of sound waves. Middle ear amplifys sound waves. Inner ear is responsible for the transduction of sound energy to electric signals. Acoustic nerve transmits the electric signal to the nerve center. All parts are important for the ability of hearing and any damage will result in hearing loss or disability.
The treatment for hearing loss involves reconstruction of the ability of each component. Normally there are five major approaches, external ear reconstruction, tympanic membrane repair, ossicular chain reconstruction, hearing aids, and cochlear implantation. Those surgical cure methods generally recover the structures in the ear for normal function, and hearing aids create the sound vibration with engineering methods.
New therapies (e.g. electrical devices, medication) are also keeping coming up year after year, including Hearing-aids, Cochlear implant, traditional Chinese medicine, and peration. Yet, the majority of people that have hearing impairment still cannot be fully cured with limitations.
Sensorineural hearing loss is a hearing loss the most difficult to cure. At present, for mimicking function of cochlear, cochlear implants (CIs) are used to create special electric signals responding to different sound signals it catches. However, ear can sense more than 100,000 kinds of sound frequencies, while the manufacture we made can only generate about one hundred kinds of sound frequency. As a matter of fact, the signal generated by CI is also different largely with natural cochlear.
For the most important part, CI is more than expensive for a normal family.
Apart from those function and cost issues, CI is potential to lead to immune response and other problems for the body as an artificial equipment in a human’s body.
To deal with these problems, firstly, we believe that we should advocate people"

Silk assembly
Insertion of MaSp gene fragments into pSB1C3 ( Top )
Figure 5 shows the cPCR products of MaSp gene fragments with overhangs. GeneRulerTM 100 bp DNA ladder were used.
The MaSp gene fragments were synthesized by IDT. In order to achieve a renewable source of the genes a key step was to ligate each gene fragment into their separate pSB1C3 vectors. Recall that the MaSp genes contain 3 gene fragments, which together make up one monomer and thus a functional MaSp protein. The individual ligated gene fragments in pSB1C3 were transformed into E. coli. Successful ligations were verified by colony PCR (Figure 5). The expected length from cPCR is ca. 400 bp, which corresponds to one MaSp gene fragment with cPCR overhangs. The ligations were verified by sequencing.
The ICA technique allows us to ligate different pieces of DNA together stepwise due to matching overhangs. Eco31I recognizes four nucleotides, but cuts four randomly base pairs at the location + 1bp upstream from the recognition site. By making specific primers that add restriction sites, we were able to create compatible overhangs between silk fragments. This approach was inspired from the iGEM UCLA team 2015 .
Ligation test ( Top )
Figure 6 shows a ligation test. Bands at 106 bp are the unligated silk genes. Bands at 212 bp are the ligated product.
We tested the ability of the gene fragments to ligate by performing a ligation test. The digested gene is 106 bp. The bonds at 212 bp verified that the gene fragments could be ligated together (Figure 6).
Preparing silk by the ICA method ( Top )
Figure 7 shows a monomer of MaSp1 and MaSp2 made by ICA.
It was possible to prove the concept of preparing silk from the ICA method . One monomer of MaSp1 and MaSp2 was made by the ICA method (Figure 7). The monomer is expected to have a length of 406 bp as one monomer of a MaSp gene consists of the gene fragments AB, BC and CA with the respective lengths of 106 bp. Additional base pairs originates from primer overhangs.
We tried to make constructs containing 4 MaSp gene monomers."

How do you think we could use synthetic genetic circuits to control metabolic pathways? - GMcArthurIV 18:57, 10 June 2009 (UTC)
We could use a genetic circuit to switch the metabolic pathway on or off using an external signal.  This would be useful to minimize the stress on the cell and colony while it is growing, then once the colony is at the desired size all of the cell's resources could be used for the metabolite.  We would also have to down regulate the replication function within the cell. - Bussingkm 15:38, 11 June 2009 (UTC)
The article mentions using synthetic genetic circuits to produce a series of metabolic proteins ""at the precise time and amount required for the maximal synthesis of a drug or energetic compound, while diverting the flux from competing pathways"" (pg 554).  Using the information-processing common to electric circuits, a cell can be programmed to perform a series of coordinated tasks such as maximizing certain metabolic pathways. -"

By changing the whole set-up and not including the second quorum sensing system, we can regulate one enzyme and not a whole pathway. If we change the system such that L-DOPA is the only product, we get the following circuit (Fig. 13).
Figure 13 Simbiology overview of  the changed genetic setup
The simulation gives us a high L-DOPA yield of 415.14 µmol/h/L or 81.86 mg/h/L (Fig. 14).
Figure 14 L-DOPA production and yield in the environment.
The 81.86 mg/h/L we determined from the molecules we get from the simulation are a promising result. Current Parkinson’s disease treatment involves either relatively high doses of L-DOPA by taking pills at a time or a constant flux of 20-200mg L-DOPA per hour using the Duodopa ® therapy [15]. Since our project is designed to replace currently used treatments it is really promising that one day our DopaDoser is being used in modern medicine as a treatment.
The modeling of the Dopamine and L-DOPA pathway showed a wide range of possible application for the expression system. It is feasible to control single and multi-gene pathways and by its modular design it is easy to get exactly the results needed.
In collaboration with UCL iGEM and Norwich iGEM we also introduced other single and multi-gene pathways into the model and observed the production of the corresponding products.

The most common isotopically labelled peptide used for diagnosisis a 111In-labelled somatostatin analogue, known as OctreoScanTM, which is used to diagnose a variety of tumors. Other peptides under   develompent are cholecystokinin/gastrin analogues, glucagon-like peptide-1,   bombesin, chemokine receptor CXCR4 targeting peptides, RGD peptides, exendin,   Substance P, LHRH, neurotensin, α-M2, α-M2H and VIP.
Following the same rationale, our artificially selected peptides can be modified and optimized to increase their binding affinity and their half-life. The peptides can then be tagged with radionuclides to enable the diagnosis by imaging techniques. The results of such a diagnostic method will give more information about the localization and spread of the fungal infection inside the patients body than any of the currently available diagnostic methods.
Therapeutic Applications
The peptides we developed have significant applications from a clinical standpoint: they can be modified with molecules that modulate the immune response against fungi and they can be attached to an anti-mycotic drug to increase specificity and potentially reduce the drug's adverse effects.
We don't expect our peptides to be part of a one-drug therapy. Patients with invasive fungal infections are very often immunocompromised and measures have to be taken to strengthen their immune system for a therapy to be effective. As for the stimulation of the immune system in case of individuals with immunodeficiencies, the use of adjuvants (immune response enhancers) to augment the response is one strategy. In addition to this, natural immuno-modulatory molecules called cytokines (such as Interleukin-1 and Interferon-gamma) to stimulate the appropriate branches of the immune system can be employed as well.
Fungal Infections and  the branches of the immune system that deal with them
It has been observed that individuals suffering from deficiencies in antibody and complement mediated cytotoxicity are less vulnerable to fungal infections than the ones suffering from phagocytic defects. Moreover, studies have shown that neutrophils are pivotal in fending off fungal infections.  This is further supported by the fact that many cases of fungal infections were following a period of neutropenia (low neutrophil count in blood).
Two vital principles can be gathered from the aforementioned information:
- Phagocytes (especially neutrophils) play a very important role in the resolution (clearance) of the fungal infection.

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," wall structure better results. Alternative to the Cutinase, another enzyme (Esterase) was tested. With this enzyme the degradation activity on PET could only be shown in theory until today. A realization in the desired targeted organism Eschericha Coli is therefore difficult, but eventually feasible with more time.
a2)  Transport
In the transport group the challenge is to integrate a membrane channel that can transport the produced degradation product Terepthalacid inside the bacteria. Like this the substance is available to be metabolized by the organism. A trimer from Comamonas testosterone KF is used for that purpose. The different subunits of the transporter will be explored separately to be able to localize the desired function. The goal is to build a transport system that can work in a ph range that is optimal for E-coli.
a3) Metabolism
The goal of the group metabolism was to convert the imported Terephtalat to Catechol inside the bacteria. Catechol is as an important starting substance in the pharmaceutical and chemical industry.  It serves for the generation of pesticides, colorants and medicines and can therefor used well economically. There are five enzymes needed for the conversion. The gene sequences of these enzymes will be incorporated into the genome of the bacteria. These are: TPHA1, TPHA1, TPHA3, TPHAB and AROY. TPHA 1 and 3 together build an enzyme complex, which utilize the reaction from Terephtalat to a relatively unstable intermediate product. This is than further converted to Protocatechat by TPHAB.  Theoretically it would be feasible to convert the Protocatechat over a two-step enzyme reaction to Shikimiacid. Further steps would then produce amino acids. However, these steps are very complex since the chemical equilibrium tends to go in the other direction and end products would need to be directly skimmed or exported. Therefore, due to practical reasons, the aim is to convert Protocatechat to Catechol with the help of AROY. The other ingredient of PET, Ethylenglykol, could be used as a food source for the bacteria if further genes are incorporated.
a3) Combination of elements
After all single biobricks had been integrated in the bacteria genome the next step was to combine the single biobricks to one unit. Until now this goal is not achieved because one biobrick was not compatible with e-coli and was therefore inserted in yeast. One chance to built one complete organism for degradation, transport and metabolism is that all"

These technological advantages contribute to a strong position within the identified markets.
SWOT analysis
For the commercialisation of CINDY Seq, the strengths and weaknesses of our product were considered. We did this via a so-called SWOT analysis. SWOT stands for ""Strengths Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats"", and is frequently used by companies to determine how its objectives can be accomplished, and what obstacles must be overcome or minimized to achieve desired results. It allows to see where our technology CINDY Seq is today, and where it may be positioned in the future.   The SWOT analysis is further divided in an internal and an external analysis. The internal analysis is done to identify the values and the weaknesses that should be covered to achieve a stronger market position. The external analysis is done to clarify the opportunities we have to grasp and to acknowledge the threats against which we have to protect CINDY Seq.
Internal analysis
Strengths
:
We already have a proof of concept and a strong IP position.
CINDY Seq is a versatile tool to obtain both simplex and multiplex results.
CINDY Seq is rapid, cheap and meets all safety requirements posed by the iGEM competition.
Weaknesses
:
CINDY Seq relies on other techniques, for example in our applied design Cas13a is required for detection
Because CINDY Seq relies on other techniques, the values rapidity, low-cost and on-site are highly dependent on other steps in the detection method. For example, in our applied design the detection of genes takes a few hours due to the steps during sample preparation. In addition, lab equipment and expertise till a certain extend is required
External analysis
Opportunities
:
There is a high demand for frontline diagnostics.
The market is predicted to grow (see market analysis).
Cas13a is currently discovered and has a great potential to be a key player in rapid genetic material detection. Cas13a requires a techique to optimise the visible output
Threats
:
CINDY Seq is versatile and can be applied broadly. However, the versatility of the tool can be a bottleneck for finding a niche and outcompete more specific and specialized frontline diagnostic tools.
Lack of optimized techniques on which CINDY Seq relies will stop the development of the CINDY Seq.
Cas13a is patent-pending and therefore the owners of the Cas13a patent have time to develop their own on site detection methods"

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#SYNENERGENE#Application Scenario_-_-_TEXT.html," pipes or at chokepoints in the ditches and waterways would allow collection of the runoff phosphorus before it was able to spread further into the environment.
Floating Phosphorus Reclamation Module (PRM): While it may be useful to concentrate efforts of phosphorus collection as close to the source as possible, that is sometimes impossible. To counter this our team designed a floating PRM which could be placed on buoys in lakes and rivers to steadily decrease the phosphorus load in the surrounding water and help decrease the chance of algal blooms.
Methane Digester: A novel use for our system would be in combination with methane digesters. These digesters use bacteria to break down organic matter and produce methane which can be used for energy. The resulting effluent (broken down nutrient mash) can be placed on the field to act as fertilizer. While some nutrients in the effluent are effectively used and considered limiting (nitrogen), others can build up in the soil over time (phosphorus). Eventually the built up phosphorus will leach from the soil to nearby bodies of water. This problem may be avoided by extracting phosphorus out of the effluent before being applied to the field, using a system similar to our PRM.
Production & Costs
Our current working prototype costs around $40 to produce from easily obtainable parts (Two 5-gallon buckets, 3 canisters, 3 filters, tubing, pump motor). The final design will require either a power source or solar panels, which will drive up the initial cost. The biggest cost however will come from bead construction and filter replacement over the lifetime of the device. The filtration is done in two parts, a physical filter for larger particulates, and a packed bed of beads with our genetically modified E. coli inside, both of which are housed in a plastic cannister attached to the holding tanks. This filtration system will need to have both parts replaced once a month, which will cost approximately $2 per filter. Bead replacement will cost approximately $2-$3 per cannister including costs for E.coli propagation and silica bead production. If the final design contains 4 cannisters, monthly maintenance will be $16-$20. Ultimately, these monthly costs will decrease as economies of scale begin to work in our favor.
Risks
Biocontainment: As with most iGEM projects, biocontainment is a serious risk. Our even more so since the primary use of our technology is directly in the environment we are attempting to protect. Our first line of defense would the build of the phosphorus reclamation module (PRM), the beads"

The goal of the outreach part of our project was thus to interface with a variety of different audiences both within our city and outside it. We also wanted to do this in a more interesting and engaging way.To help more Chinese students get familiar with iGEM, we write an iGEM handbook with Chinese.We also created our network platform such as Renren (Chinese face book), Micro-blog, Douban, which have significant influence on the public. Our team members recorded the audios of 60-Second Biology for promoting popular science.We translate some papers in biologic area to make sure our target population could get all the information efficiently in China.  Our team aims to make the public gain a strong knowledge of molecular biology lab techniques as well as a solid understanding of the IGEM competition.
Collaboration
Figure 3. Collaborate with four universities
To help students of Engineering and Science learn from each other, we organized our iGEM team members to communicate with students from other teams. We worked with BIT 2013 iGEM team this summer on the development of both projects. And participated in the 1st Model IGEM, communicating with several universities including Peking, OUC-China and NJU-China and so on. In particular, we established deep friendship with TJU-IGEM. Both of sides appointed regular communication in the future IGEM team.We discussed our projects with others and listened to their advice, which enabled us to solve bioengineering problems from a different perspective.

The logic behind these two choices was that, in order to truly be a universal standard as set out by our design goals above, given that response elements, both promoters and riboswitches, can act to turn a response on or off, our system had to be compatible with both. Further details on each riboswitch can be found on their respective pages: Fluoride page and Magnesium page Having identified the riboswitches and designed the constructs to test them we had to obtain the hard DNA to test them. The Magnesium riboswitch is a naturally occurring B.subtilis gene and so was amplified from a sample of genomic DNA previously extracted by PJ Steiner using primers we designed ourselves. The fluoride ribsowitch, however, is a B. cereus gene. Given that this organism is pathogenic we were not permitted to handle it. Therefore, plates of B.subtilis transformed with the gene, as well as a sample of the gene in a shuttle vector, were generously prepared and shipped by members of the Breaker laboratory at Yale University. The Bacillus they sent us lacked the fluoride efflux pump usually turned on by the riboswitch, they found that this greatly increased its sensitivity to fluoride.
We then transformed E.coli and wild type 168 strain B.subtilis with the plasmid they sent us and these three strains were used in parallel for subsequent characterisation. Having obtained the DNA, the first step was to check the construct the fluoride riboswitch was currently in before we eventually would combine it with our own output. For details of these experiments, please see our Results page .
Ratiometrica
We decided to investigate the potential advantages of using dual-channel reporter systems. We anticipate that the inclusion of an internal control signal to which the induced signal can be normalised may significantly reduce variation between results. This would allow more accurate characterisation of the response of a promoter to an inducer, and subsequently would also allow more accurate quantification of an inducer with a readout from the same promoter.
We decided that we would design and assemble two constructs.
The first reporter construct is a dual fluorescence reporter using eCFP and eYFP as the inducible and constitutive reporters respectively. We were advised on this choice by James Brown, who has previously worked on similar constructs. eCFP and eYFP have similar maturation times and stability, and their spectra do not overlap significantly, making them comparable but distinct signals.

Edinburgh_OG,2016,Team:Edinburgh OG#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"Marles-Wright 2016).  For instance, the European Union has regulations regarding the exposure chain of potential hazards of genetic engineering applications to human health and the environment (Scientific Committees 2015). Specifically, the European Directives 2009/41/EC, 2001/18/EC and (EU) 1829/412 relate to the contained use of GMOs, their deliberate release to the environment and their possible restriction by Member States. Of special importance is the Directive 2001/18/EC, which states that a way to assess the potential adverse effects of a GMO, they should be compared to the ones from non-modified organisms (European Commission 2016).
Furthermore, in the United Kingdom (UK), the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2014 document states that the risk assessment of the contained use of microorganisms and GMOs must identify the potential hazards of their activities and the level of severity (HSE 2014). Its complement, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Genetic Modification (SACGM) Compendium of Guidance, mentions the regulations of risks presented with the insertion of exogenous DNA sequences in host strains and the need to identify all probable hazards that stem from GMOs (HSE 2004). On the other hand, in the US the NIH Guidelines on the Use of Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules specify the practices regarding their construction and handling (NIH 2016). Moreover, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) Approved List of Biological Agents have a globally accepted classification of microorganisms according to their risk levels called the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations, such as the one presented for the iGEM competition to label different microorganisms (HSE 2004).
However, the existing biosafety and biosecurity framework pertaining to molecular biology was created before the fast-paced developments in SynBio, such as DNA synthesis, sequencing and high-throughput assembly, took place. Moreover, risk assessment methods are usually limited to paperwork that is completed and signed off by senior members while other laboratory members do not contribute in a relevant manner to those assessments (Marles-Wright 2016).
PREVIOUS RISK ASSESSMENT PROPOSALS
Accordingly, numerous improvements to risk assessment methodologies can be made to ensure that biosafety and biosecurity are guaranteed while the benefits of SynBio developments are not compromised, such as having better communication and cooperation between the SynBio community and society in general (Schmidt 2009)"

Load about 5µl of your sample (this quantity varies with the thickness of the comb used and DNA concentration) and DNA ladder onto gel, taking care not to diffuse it and not to displace the gel
Place the cover, red wire to red side and inversely, plug it into the tension/current generator
On the generator set for voltage: constant mode 80V and time: 60min   (faster run with higher voltage as for example 150V may affect the quality of bands separation)
After run is over, take the tray out on some plate, and bring it to visualize DNA bands to a UV lightbox or gel imaging system
Gel can be disposed in a normal biological waste or kept covered in an aluminum foil

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html,"; our spears in line and our backs to the wall, because we could find no way to provide scientific assistance to each other, we decided to aim at the Human Practices. iGEM IONIS wanted to reach out with their project to local communities around the world, both to inform them about synthetic biology and SofterShock, and to gather opinions on the effects their project could have on the world. We took their message to Greece. We engaged the local agricultural community in Krini Trikalon, where viticulture is a major economic activity, and discussed the pros and cons of such a system with farmers, answering iGEM IONIS’ survey. We did the same with a winemaker from our city, Thessaloniki. On their part, IONIS provided us with a missing link on our human practices campaign OSIRIS: opinions from regulators. They presented our work to their own contacts in French bioethics regulatory agencies, at the same time forwarding our questions. They did the same with 3 synthetic biology experts. Thanks, IONIS!
INSA-UPS-TOULOUSE
The team INSA-UPS France created a survey regarding the disease of Cholera, which we forwarded to our university’s student community during a Team Fair Day (presentation of students’ teams). We managed to collect enough answers in order to analyse them statistically and send them back to Toulouse. In return, the Toulouse team supported us with our OSIRIS initiative by forwarding our email to their PIs and Instructors according to the OSIRIS Protocol.
UPV-VALENCIA
Our team’s collaboration with the team Valencia_UPV was very fruitful. They were working on a transgenic situation world study and we answered a few questions regarding the current situation of transgenic consumption in Greece in order to support them with their study and for our collaboration to be bidirectional. From their part, our collaborators participated in our Human Practices Campaign - OSIRIS Round 2 Quantitative survey. The sent the questionnaire to an advisor and an instructor.
EPIPHANY-NYC
Our OSIRIS Quantitative Survey was a stepping stone and a guidance for the EpiphanyNYC team as they adopted our OSIRIS Protocol and used it in their own Human Practices Campaign by modifying its content.
OSIRIS iGEM Teams We kindly thank the following iGEM Teams that participated in our Integrated Human Practices effort that implements OSIRIS Protocol. Specifically, they forwarded our OSIRIS Round 2 surveys. UNAMBG, Lund, Westminster UK, SSTi-SZGD,"

Peptide Processing
To enable The E.ncapsulator to produce peptides without inhibiting their functionality, we have developed a removable linker region that starts with the amino acid methionine. Following the release of the peptide in the intestine, a naturally occuring enzyme (enteropeptidase) removes the linker region from the front of the peptide releasing the remainder in its functional form. The use of this linker region can be extended to any polypeptide that does not begin with methionine.
This image shows the universal template for peptide production. The methionine start is shown in RED, the protease recognition site is shown in BLUE and opiorphin is shown in GREEN. The RED & BLUE sections make up the removable linker region cleaved in the gut.

It uses the fundamental information in biology to create molecules and systems for biochemical reactions and pathways, and the entire thing is a technology that we may use to invent the solution for the problems we have on Earth.
iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines):
Origin: the competition was developed from a student project during a month-long course in 2003. The students designed a system to make cells blink! More university joined the competition aft wards, and iGEM eventually become a worldwide competition in 2005. In 2011, there were 165 teams.
Foundation: Through the competition, the knowledge of synthetic biology is broadened, and
Competition: It is a synthetic biology competition for undergraduate students to design biological system by making and modifying biobricks, and more importantly, students can creatively solve problems and invent solution by applying biological technology appropriately. iGEM also aims to arouse public ‘s awareness about biological technology and engineering, so the world could be a better world with the change we make.

8 tubes were prepared for colony PCR, containing isolated plasmid as template DNA (isolated from colonies inoculated on 10/7/2018). Vector pACYC was used as positive control template. The thermocycler programme was installed to have an extension time of 6.5 minutes and an annealing temperature of 60 °C. After the programme was finished, samples were kept at 4°C.

DNA Gel Electrophoresis
Colony PCR samples were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer. 5μL was pipetted into each lane. The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.
This gel showed all of the plasmid isolate templates result in double bands, which is corresponding to the pACYC-DUET control (lane 9). Compared to the Tn5 insert (lane 10), this indicates all of the plasmid isolates are pACYC-DUET and contain no insert.
