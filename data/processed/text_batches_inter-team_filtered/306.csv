In this case, the plates and culture tubes were glowing red, which is in agreement with our expectations. However in preliminary tests (data not shown), the addition of IPTG to the medium did not lead to the change of fluorescence from red to green as expected. These preliminary results indicate the lack of function of the plasmid 2 when the both plasmids are present. This conclusion is only accepted if the presence of the two plasmids in one cell is confirmed, however we could not confirm it; thus it will remain as another potential explanation.
Figure A. LB agar plates with E. coli carrying: A) Plasmid 1, B) plasmid 2 and C) both plasmids.
Derived from the results in other sections of this subproject (see Lock/Key results ), the plasmids were also transformed in (K12) electro-competent cells. 250 µL of the E. coli (K12) cells carrying either the plasmid 1, plasmid 2 or both were plated in an LB agar Petri dish adding the proper selection antibiotic and incubated at 37ºC overnight. As the previous results, the plates with cells containing the plasmid 1 and the colonies carrying both plasmids glowed red and the cells with the plasmid 2 glowed green (Figure A). One colony from each plate was inoculated in a 4 mL culture tube with minimal medium and the appropriate antibiotic. The tubes were incubated overnight at 37°C and 175 rpm. Once again, the expected results were confirmed as shown in the figure B.
Figure B. A: Plasmid 1 (right) and 2 (left), B: Cells containing both plasmids.
The tube containing cells with both plasmids were used to perform a simple kinetic in order to have preliminary results for the delay time. 1mL was transferred to a tube with 4mL fresh minimal medium and incubated for 1 h at 37°C and 175 rpm. This procedure was done twice in order to have a control. After 1 h one tube was induced with 0.2 mM IPTG and the glow was followed for 9 h.
As appreciated in figure C, no change in color was noticed and the red glow was increasing over time indicating the growth of the culture.

1.3 The plasmid backbone
The plasmid carrying the detector probe has to meet at least the following conditions:
have a red fluorescent reporter: RFP or mCherry (necessary for the final detection)
have no restriction sites used for probe activation
To find a correct plasmid, the iGEM 2017 DNA distribution kit has been fully screened and different parts have been tested in the lab. The perfect backbone appeared to be the biobrick J04450 . The process to find this biobrick is explained right below.
2. Construction of the detector in practice
Figure 4: Schematic overview of the construction of the DNA detector. The system has been inspired by iGEM Cork Ireland 2015 BaseHunter.
2.1 Tests for the choice of the plasmid backbone
2.1.1 Screening of DNA Distribution kit 2017
So, among all the biobricks proposed in iGEM 2017 kit, plasmids were screened in the following precise criteria.
Red fluorescent reporter
Plasmid had to carry a RFP or mCherry gene, because red fluorescence is necessary for the final detection. Finally, all the plasmids retained were carrying RFP gene.
“All-in-one”
That means the reporter system (promoter, ribosome-binding site (RBS), gene, terminator), which codes for RFP protein, is delimited by restriction sites XbaI and SpeI. Thus, the probe can be inserted in the prefix or suffix. In this case, the probe is inserted as a prefix: the first version was inserted in EcoRI site, while the second version was inserted between EcoRI and XbaI.
Figure 5: Scheme of the “all-in-one” biobrick, delimited by 4 specific enzymes
No restriction sites should be used for probe activation, at least for the double strand enzymes BmtI and BglII. The risk would be to cut the plasmid backbone, then making transformation and detection impossible. Thus, each plasmid map has been digested in silico with BglII and BmtI via Labgenius Mapper, to check the digestion profile.
High level copy, allowing an easier plasmid production.
Properly sequenced, in order to be sure of the genetic content used.
Consequently, a few interesting biobricks were selected.

--CB MM TR-- Designing the auxotrophy feature: Lysine, aspartic acid, serine
Lysine:
Has three pathways for lysine: Biosynthesis 1, 3, 5.
http://metacyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=ORGANISM&object=TAX-323848
Don’t bother with lysine. Too many biosynthetic pathways, can’t find one gene that would knock out all three pathways definitively.
Aspartate:
Has only one biosynthetic pathway, which is good.
This is the gene we want to knock out: http://metacyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=GENE-IN-PWY&object=EG10096&detail-level=2
Unfortunately it seems this gene, aspC, is also used in making phenylalanine, tyrosine, and kynurenate. Those are not very present in the bioreactor, so aspC would be a bad gene to knock out.
Also, it seems there is a metabolic mechanism for changing arginine into aspartate, so if there is arginine in the effluent it would likely be able to survive: not a good auxotroph. (Unfortunately, studies show arginine to be detectably present in sewage effluent, don’t use arpartate).
Serine:
Christian has had a lot more luck with serine. He has found there is one enzyme made from serA that is definitely needed to make serine, it doesn’t seem to be important to any other metabolic pathway. Should look up the gene sequence (probably for E. coli) and blast it against the N. multiformis genome so we can find the location in the genome and the exact nucleotide sequence. Christian had a crash course in bacterial gene knockout from Desi, should be in the slides for this week.

SCUT-FSE-CHINA
        We mentored a new team SCUT-FSE-CHINA. We shared with them                     the experience of how to form an iGEM team, and guided them in the rules, timelines and precautions of                     the competition. Besides, we mentored them how to standardize the genes. In return, they assisted us                     the design of modeling and help us write some parts of code of the MATLAB.

SYSU-Software
        We met SYSU-Software in April on a meet-up meeting among                     teams in Southern China. This year we use the Mer-merr bi-direction promoter to sense mercury (Hg) in                     the environment. If the concentration of Hg transcend a threshold, Hg can repress the repressor of cds                     of SRRz protein, which will lead to the expression of SRRz protein. Cells lysis process could be detected                     because the release of the beta-galactosidase which is not able to spread cross the cell membrane at                     a normal situation will trigger the chromogenic reaction of oNPG whose tube will turn yellow. Since we                     were not aware of whether the design could work and the approximate range of expression level of the                     SRRz gene before the experiment, we reached out for them to do a simulation for their genetic circuits.
Solution & Results
        They built a model for our project using the same algorithm                     that utilized in their software simulation section. The following is the circuit we designed for our                     project redrawn by their design platform.
        For a preciser measurement of the expression of their                     gene, SRRz gene, we used GFP as a reporter in this case alternatively. Their model simulated the concentration                     of the GFP expressed in our system. The mathematic formula and parameters' and the results are as follows:
        The simulation result is as follow:

Integrated Human Practices
IRB approved survey was sent to various types of people by using Amazon Turk. This survey allowed us to determine confusing components and other factors to be improved on the paper-based assay. From there, changes were made to the design to incorporate feedback about concerns. Labels were added to reaction zones. The layers of the assay was labeled. Other things were brainstormed to be included in the device, such as a way to check the ""freshness zone"" and a small electronic equipment to analyze the results and do a quick numerical comparison. Device steps were limited to what professionals in the field had said was the general requirements for an over the counter diagnostic.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioMembrane UV_-_-_TEXT.html,".
On Earth, the main source of concern for radiation damage is ultraviolet  radiation (UVR). These wavelengths are between 290 and 400 nm when they  hit the Earth’s surface, and do more damage the shorter they get. UV wavelengths between 320 and 400 nm are called UV-A, and are the culprits behind sunburns and cataract formation. UV-A radiation creates indirect DNA damage through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), forming strand breaks in DNA and DNA-protein crosslinks. [1] Shorter wavelengths from 290 to 320 nm are called UV-B wavelengths. UV-B is absorbed directly into DNA and causes damage to DNA at the molecular level. [2] Excessive UV-B exposure can induce significant DNA mutation and cell death, and our bioballoon will be exposed to dangerous amounts of radiation due to its high elevation during flight. Ideally, our balloon coating would have included an interweaving of zinc oxide, a white pigment that excels at blocking and reflecting UV-A and UV-B rays. [3] Zinc oxide is used in many commercial sunscreens, as a solution with as low as 25% zinc oxide content results in protection of at least SPF 20. [4] However, we wanted to produce our UV protector entirely biologically rather than attempting to incorporate an inorganic compound into our membrane. As such, we decided to focus on creating a method of UV protection for our balloon that utilizes a melanin incorperated via a binding agent directly into our membranes.
Our Solution
Figure 2: Chemical schematic of melanin.
Designed by team member Taylor Sihavong in Adobe Illustrator
To install radiation resistance in our biomembranes, the team investigated the absorptive properties of melanin and designed a novel binding mechanism to incorporate the pigment directly into materials. Melanin is the primary source of naturally-occurring UV protection in human skin. In response to human skin damage through UV exposure, keratinocytes release cytokines to stimulate melanocytes’ production of melanin, which functions as a UV absorbent and generates the phenotypic response of darker skin. [5] Melanin when used as a sunscreen has been shown to absorb between 50-75% of UVR.

The RData file was extended and now also includes the meshterms within the data-list as well as the information content and the track in the data-frame.
Topics app
Implementation of Topics app started
For the topics and the methods app we had several ideas on how to structure them. Besides a timeline of the hottest topics or histogramm view of the topics distribution the most important feature we had in mind was the direct search for the meshterms we extracted.
Pseudocode for the corresponding filtering functions and a draft of the interface were written, but the workload in the other projects was too big to actually create a functional app.
Bug fixes
Data completion
Filters fixed
The drafts for most of the filtering functions had already been implemented, but ended up non-functional. This was due to data removal using empty vectors, which produces a severe error in R. Table 18.1 gives an overview of the different parameters and their basic filter design.

Michael's entry
PEG Dialysis
Protocol according to Rockwood et. al (2011)
100 grams PEG in 900 mL ultrapure water
mix with stir bar. Solution should be clear.
add 10 mL of dilute silk to the dialysis tubing
dialyze for 20-22 hours. Cover the solution with aluminum foil.
remember to use the silk within 3 days after this concentration dialysis!
Observations
Our solution that we put into the tubing is 5.2% w/v.
the PEG solution is too dense. The dialysis tubing is essentially floating on top, buoyed by the dialysis clips.
I think this might slow down the diffusion of water out of the tubing. Maybe more dialysis time will be needed?
PEG dialysis start: 4:25 pm
should end the dialysis at like 2:00 pm tomorrow.
PEG dialysis start: 2:00 pm, May 21
the concentration dialysis does not look promising
most of the solution was unsalvageable -- it gelled up inside the dialysis tubing
solution is too difficult to retrieve from the dialysis tubing
ended up squeezing out about 100 uL of solution from it
pipetted 10 uL onto a weigh boat to determine concentration (uncertain if our milligram-sensitivity scales will be able to determine an accurate dry weight)
Dry weight is 2 mg. That is 20% w/v, very close to what we had expected.
solution looks extremely cloudy
after about 2 hours, the 100 uL that we had was completely gelled up. I think I exerted too much shear force when removing it from the dialysis tubing.
Lesson learned: the concentration dialysis must run for less than 22 hours
Also, use the dialysis cassettes instead of the dialysis tubing
What might have gone wrong
the dialysis tubing was horizontal, rather than vertical in the PEG solution. As such,"

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Conclusions_-_-_TEXT.html,"ceI homing endonuclease. Construction of this part was done by assembling more basic parts. But the gene for the I-SceI enzyme turned out to have an LVA degradation tag attached to it. This shortens the life time of the protein inside the cell considerably and possibly prevents normal folding. It is hypothesised that disfunctional I-SceI is the reason that the expected Self Destruction did not occur. However, a contribution to the registry was made by documenting the anomalies in the biobricks containing the I-SceI homing endonuclease.
Time-Delay Device
Synthetic Transcriptional Cascade
In nature, a fundamental “device” in gene regulation circuits is time-delay responses to internal or external stimuli. In the present work, one important feature performed for our system is the reset of the signal once the message is received. The time between when the signal (or self destructive plasmid/conjugation plasmid) has been received and the reset (or destruction of the plasmid) is an important parameter which will allow the signal to be sent to the next cell (receiver) through the consecutive conjugation system before “losing” the message. Therefore, it is necessary to construct a device which will give enough time for the two subsequent events happen. This device is termed as the time-delay genetic circuit in this project.
A functional time-delay device was designed, constructed and delivered to iGEM registry. This device is based on transcriptional regulation and has the capability to integrate an input signal, IPTG, and trigger the expression of GFP after a delay from the initial detection event. The device is formed by two new functional biobricks, this division not only allows the transfer of the helper plasmid in TUDelft 09 's project but also allows other teams to construct larger or shorter cascades which will deliver, after proper design, longer or shorter time-delay behaviors.
The plasmids constructed in this work were proved to work individually as expected and once they are transformed together within the same cell, they perform as a delay device. In the experiment performed in this project, the expression of GFP was substantially increased at 600 mins after induction with 0.2 mM IPTG.
From the observation K12 positive control strain used in experiment glowing GFP, makes us to hypothesize that the lack of enough LacI did not allow performing a better characterization of the device due to a lack of proper control. However, in relative measurements, the device was proved to work.
Biosynthetic AND gate
It was expected that post-transcriptional regulation,"
Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 4_-_-_TEXT.html," is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

The Final Month
Monday
Scandal in the lab! It appears that someone at Caltech has edited our wiki, initially inserting the word 'chicken' into our project page. Then they broke our Java script - potentially accidentally. Easily rectified, but still irritating, especially since the project description deadline was yesterday. Have we been the victim of a not-so-droll ivy league-ish prank? Or is some oddly minded person co-opting this student's account? We've emailed their project supervisor, so hopefully it shouldn't happen again.
One night seems to have been too little time to accurately determine if the transformation worked, as we now have lots of e.coli colonies on the plates. The bacillus plates"

Solution: The plaster will be convenient to apply. The gel is biocompatible, free of toxins and E. coli is non-malignant.
More information
Good working conditions are conditions which ensure that people can work healthily and safely (6) . Therefore,                             it is important to make an inventory of the possible existing hazards. Thinking about our “hydrogel patch”,                             possible hazards are the dextran material, the diffusion of lysostaphin and pyocin and the bacteria that are                             inside the gel. As we discussed above under patient safety, both of theseboth molecules seem safe to humans.                             The same applies to the E. coli strain used. Obviously, it remains important to wash hands before and after                             handling the patch or touching the wound.
Moreover, to work healthily and safely, is it also important that the gel can be applied easily. Therefore,                             it should not require much physical work and should not be harmful for the nurses. It would be beneficial                             if the plaster looks normal, something that feels familiar to the patient and nurse. It should not give                             them the idea that there are living modified bacteria inside the plaster itself to prevent scaring patients                             or medical professionals.
From our conversations with medical professionals, we learned that the plaster will need to be replaced                             regularly. To prevent pain or inconvenience to the patient or nurse, the plaster must thus be easy to                             apply and to remove.  As the plaster will be delivered in a sterile package ready for application, the                             application should be straightforward and easy. This requirement is thus met. Overall, it can be                             concluded that our plaster will not make the work of nurses or doctors any more difficult or dangerous                             than it currently is.
Infiltration
Problem: We want to prevent foreign bacteria from invading the gel to avoid them from competing with E. coli for resources.
Experts: Dr. Sandra Hoffman, iGEM Düsseldorf 2018, PAMM, Dr. Edgar Peters
Solution: The risk of infiltration is relatively low thanks to the secreted                         bacteriocins. We may lower the risk by means of a quorum sensing system and the                         regular replacement of the plaster.
More information
Several experts and stakeholders asked us whether the risk exists that foreign bacteria infiltrate Gelcatraz.                             Infiltration would form a serious safety hazard. What if malignant bacteria colonize the material and use it to secrete                             toxins to patients? We thus researched this issue and consulted several experts on the topic.
In principle, we do not think that the risk of infiltration is high, as"

Hangzhou-H14Z,2015,Team:Hangzhou-H14Z_-_-_TEXT.html,"- A.D. 1279). Not only do those lithic relics represent the cutting edge of stone carving technology in contemporary time, but also they provide historians and archaeologists with solid historical evidence.
        There are three main types of lithic relics in Hangzhou; they are stone sculptures, stone towers also known as Dhavaja, and stone inscriptions. The stone sculptures are primarily represented by Feilai Peak (飞来峰), Ciyun Ridge (慈云岭), and Statue of Mahakala in Baocheng Temple (宝成寺麻曷葛剌). Stone Towers are primarily represented by White Tower (白塔). Stone inscriptions are primarily represented by Hetingwuhe Fubei on Lonely Mountain (孤山放鹤亭舞鹤赋碑).
        Plus, Feilai Peak and White Tower are National Key Historical Relics.      Most lithic relics encounter physical, chemical and biological interaction, resulting in weathering corrosion, pulverisation lesion, cracking, contamination, and colour mottling. Those phenomena jeopardise the value of lithic relics and even lithic relics themselves, and the lithic relics in Hangzhou are not of exceptions.
        In 2002, some of the classic lithic relics were inspected and it was found that the surface of Feilai Peak Sculpture was greatly ruined (Figure 1), and there is leaking on Ciyun Ridge Sculpture (Figure 2)..
    Meanwhile, Cultural Relics Department of China has been trying to maintain and recover the lithic relics. Since 2002, Cultural Relics Department of China mainly has been removing surface deposit, depleting pounding, strengthening crag, and changing flora; the government washed Feilai Peak Sculpture for many times (Figure 3).Government built a top above the Ciyun Peak Sculpture, this relic no longer had to expose to sun and rain henceforward (Figure 4).
    White Tower was comprehensively cleaned and strengthened by silicone by Zhejiang University of Technology (Figure 5).
     The power plants and railways were removed. During the washing, the staff intentionally left part of this tower intact, and made an contrast for further research of anti-contamination and anti-weathering (Figure 5-3, 5-4)
    However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage. Some even have distraction"
Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKU#project#surface_-_-_TEXT.html,"omers: EutS, EutM, EutN, EutL and EutK. Luckily, we find EutS monomer is suitable for tagging at its N terminus because:
1. EutS monomer N terminus is extruding out of the EutS hexamer’s surface.
2. Studies showed that convex side of the EutS hexamer is the exterior side of Eut MCP.
Hence, we hypothesize fusing a designed targeting peptide to the EutS N termini will be presented on the exterior surface of the MCP, at the same time, pose little steric effect on the MCP assembly.
To our surprise, a study in 2012 (doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033342) showed that EutS alone is necessary and sufficient for the formation of shells in vivo. Hence, homogenous EutS MCP might offer a simplier strategy for engineering of cell-specific targeting capsid, and potentially having higher specificity and affinity.
Hence we can study surface decoration affinity of two version MCPs:
(1) EutS MCP
(2) EutSMNLK native MCP
In our project, we use short tagging peptide – 6 Histidine tag – as a proof of principle. Since Histidine tag is conveniently used for protein purification, we will try purifying the Histidine tagged MCP through Nickel affinity column.

It is the second year in a row that our team together with Paris_Bettencourt publishes Newsletter for iGEM Competition. With the addition of Pasteur_Paris, there have been several changes and updates. Last year, Newsletter was mainly composed of Team Introduction and Project Update apart from the special issue-interview with SYSU. However this year, not only do we offer a communication platform among teams, we also turn to long-term relationship between teams and relevant figures in the form of interviews, surveys, argues and so on. Teams all around the world introduce their programs, share details of experiments, ask for help, and reply to requirements from counterparts. We excavate the quintessence of past work as the shoulder standing on which the following teams could see further. There are seven issues this year, among which are three special issues.
5.15
Issue 1
The first issue-the first special issue at the same time, which was released on May 17th, is about how to set up and operate an iGEM team. Many teams were at the beginning of the establishment at that time, so we drew our inspiration from that. We really appreciate the contributions from Professor Wayne Materi and eleven experienced teams. Though each situation differs, there is still some important reference value to both old and new teams.
5.31
Issue 2
The publication of the second issue contains two parts: Project Introduction and Ethical Discussions. Eight teams showed their projects and sixteen teams expressed their opinions on a controversial research in April based on ethics. The researchers, headed by gene-function researcher Huang Junjiu at Guangzhou's Sun Yat-sen University, modified in human embryos a gene responsible for beta thalassaemia, a blood disorder that can be fatal.
6.15
Issue 3
On June 15th, we released the third issue only about projects with the participation of twelve teams.

Issue 4
The fourth issue-the second special issue came out in late June. This special issue is about the present situation of synthetic biology in different countries. Twelve"

Strategy 1 Bacterial Based Microarray
Outline of screening desired antibody by bacterial based microarray
Microarray technique is a kind of pretty mature biomedical technology applied to diverse areas from pharmacology research to clinical use, such as genetics diagnose. Due to the advantage that large amount of various substances can be screened in microarray, microarray can be used for selection of desired antibodies with specific affinity in our project. However, current existing microarray technology rely on specific DNA or protein attached substrate and our project lean on bacteria expressing specific surface protein used for screening for desired antibody. Therefore, traditional protocols and materials used in microarray will be adjusted in our project. We believe that our adjustment will improve the efficiency of antibody screening and help our project achieve its ultimate goal.
Specific description of the details of the experiments
In this part, we want to transform two batches of E coli with vectors carrying specific genes expressing various kinds of antibody achieved by the recombination methods in our project and specific antigen or some other protein used to select antibody from the aforementioned mix of antibodies. By fusion antibody and antigen gene with the genes of membrane integral displaying protein called OmpA, we can manage to display our protein to the surface of the bacteria. Therefore, the selection will process through interaction between antibody and antigen at the surface of the bacteria. Then, by linking the gene of display protein to the gene of one kind of protein called cellulose binding domain which can bind to cellulose, we are able to anchor the bacteria expressing CBD to the surface of the specific microarray coated with cellulose substrate. The whole process is illustrated in the following figure.
Information concerning the specific proteins
Cellulose binding domain
The protein used in this part comes from CipC gene found in Clostridium cellulolyticum. CipC gene encodes a protein called cohesion which participate in degradation of cellulose for the benefits of the bacteria Clostridium cellulolyticum. The protein encoded in this gene contains a specific domain called cellulose binding domain which bind to cellulose with pretty high binding affinity and thus facilitate the degradation of the cellulose. The structure of CBD has been resolved shown in the figure below. Our purpose is to utilize the ability of CBD to bind"

Overview
The expression of interacting genes depends on the structure of gene regulatory networks (GRN). In order to figure out optimal biological networks that can function reliably when faced with fluctuation of DNA template amount (copy number), it is important to do some simulations in advance to narrow the screening scope and theoretically discuss certain functional regulatory motifs that are significant in showing adaptation. Therefore, it would be easier for us to search for and verify adaptive and robust networks in wet lab. In our project, we abstractly analyzed gene regulatory network topologies and computed all possible three-node network structures by enumeration. We modeled, calculated, tested and made comparisons, and finally screened 2 core optimal network structures out of 19683 network structures, which show great adaptation to DNA copy number. In order to verify the correctness of our screening result, we introduced an optimal testing case and simulated. Based on our screening results, we analyzed and concluded 9 key motifs that may be essential to adaptation. We respectively simulated these motifs and tried to explain their characters with mathematical proof. Finally we figured out that these key motifs can be combined to obtain better effects.
Construction of Networks And Mathematical Description -- ODE Equations
We based on the Michealis-Menten Equation and Hill Equation to describe the kinetics of gene regulatory networks. The M-M Equation and Hill Equation describe the relationship between the production rate of products and the concentration of substrate. M-M Equations of activation (monotone-increasing) and inhibition (monotone-decreasing) are defined as:
Hill Equations of activation (monotone-increasing) and inhibition (monotone-decreasing) are defined as:
(C is a constant, K is called half maximal effective concentration and n is called hill coefficient.) In our project, we aimed at all three-node network structures, and each contains 4 nodes (1 input node, 2 regulatory nodes and 1 output node) and vast possible regulatory edges among them.
So we formed ODE equation sets to describe the mutual relationships and form networks. The ODE equation sets involve two 4*4 matrices to respectively bring in the activating effect and inhibitive effect, and a column vector for self-decomposition.

MG1655 in M9M with plasmids EV and phaCAB. There is no growth inhibition when comparing the empty vector with the phaCAB vector in minimal media. M9M shows the least growth growth of all the media as it has low carbon and amino acid content. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 5h.  Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
M9 Supplemented
MG1655 in M9S with plasmids EV and phaCAB. There is no growth inhibition when comparing the empty vector with the phaCAB vector in supplemented minimal media. M9S shows a lag phase in growth but quickly increases due to increased amino acid content, nearly reaching LB after 5h. Growth was at 37°C with shaking.  Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Conclusions: No difference between any of our phaCAB promoter constructs (native, hybrid, constitutive) when grown on LB compared to empty vector. In addition, there was no marked difference for native phaCAB in M9 minimal and M9 supplemented media, although the E. coli grew very well in supplemented idea.
pBAD characterisation
Characterisation of the strong pBAD promoter was a necessity to our project. We wanted to know whether or not it was inducing a significant increase in fluorescence of our constructs. We also wanted to know whether arabinose at the concentration we were inducing with (6 μM) was sufficient. Finally we wanted to look at whether or not glucose has an effect on growth. In order to address this we performed assays with pBAD in intracellular bdh2 in M9 minimal media. To tie it in with our project, we also used M9 minimal waste conditioned media (M9MWCM) to compare growth. Bdh2 is responsible for the synthesis of acetoacetate from 3HB and tagged with sfGFP.
Glucose inhibition  on growth in minimal media on bdh2. The outcome of this growth assay shows that cells grow more in M9WCM but that increasing glucose concentration influences growth in M9WCM while it is unaffected in M9 minimal media. Characterisation was done in M9 and M9WCM. Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. The arabinose concentration was kept at 6 μM for all samples. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6"

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html,", that was strived after in this experiment. Moreover, the difference between the measured fluorescence levels for the two reporter systems was notably lower. This could indicate, that the reason behind the difference in expression levels between the weak and strong constitutive promoters, is due to the fact that bacteria cloned with the weak constitutive promoter are more prone to plasmid loss. However, it was observed that the bacteria expressing RFP under control of the weak promoter, did in fact fluoresce with a lower intensity.
To verify the hypothesis regarding the plasmid loss, the cultures were plated on 50 µg/mL ampicillin LA selection plates as well as LA plates without antibiotic, 12 hours after incubation start. For comparison, cultures containing either chloramphenicol and kanamycin resistance cassettes, were likewise plated out after similar treatment. The average plasmid loss measured as non-resistant CFU as a percentage of the total population is seen Figure 3.
Figure 3. The average plasmid loss measured as non-resistant CFU as a percentage counts for the ampicillin resistance of the weak and strong promoter, as well as for chloramphenicol and kanamycin resistance controls. Samples were obtained for spread-plating at 12 hours after incubation start.
From this test, it is evident that antibiotic resistance is reduced for the ampicillin-resistance carrying bacteria, compared to chloramphenicol and kanamycin resistant cultures. This consolidates the hypothesis, that the bacteria transformed with the weak and strong promoter controlling RFP expression lose their plasmids throughout growth. However, it was further observed, that the plasmid loss in bacteria carrying the strong constitutive promoter was markedly higher than for bacteria carrying the weak constitutive promoter. This could be due to the fact that RFP in high concentrations is toxic for the cells, resulting in an increased pressure to lose the plasmid.   The photocontrol device genes were, on the basis of the above mentioned promoter experiments, placed under control of the strong promoter BBa_J23102 . However, the observed plasmid loss should be taken into account, and compensated for, e.g. by continuous supply of antibiotic or substitution of the ampicillin resistance cassette. Furthermore, as a result of the irregular expression levels controlled by the constitutive promoters, it was decided to place the relB gene under control of a tightly regulated uniform promoter, as the modelling had established the necessity of this.

Team Amsterdam among favourites
Team Amsterdam has been pointed out as one of the teams to keep your eye on during the competition, says Christian Lund, a medicine student from Denmark. He participated in last year’s iGEM competition, and is now following the different teams.
Lund wrote a previous blog about the teams of Cambridge and Bielefeld, but in his latest blog he wrote solely about the Amsterdam team. He called the project very ambitious and impressive. “The project has the wow-factor; imagine E.Coli growing at freezing temperatures, that’s impressive!” Although the project has already partly been done, the team has a new and exciting approach. Using the results of previous teams and elaborate those results is following the iGEM spirit. “Some guys have created bacteria that can grow at low temperatures; let’s drop the temperature another couple to degrees to freezing!”  The expectations for the Amsterdam team are high and the competition is enormous, but the team is confident about the project and is looking forward to the jamboree.

Collaborations with other iGEM Teams
Being the first team at the University of Stuttgart we were confrontated with a lot of starting problems.  But we were welcomed so friendly! Everone gave us good advice, shared their experiences with sponsors, iGEM itself or solving experimental problems.  We met a few german teams to exchange information and to just have a good time with each other. All in all it was a very valuable experience to us.  So – big thanks to all iGEM-Teams for the support and helpful hints. It made the start much more easier and we are happy to be part of that great iGEM-community now.
iGEM-Team Cologne-Duesseldorf
One of our big mentoring teams this year was the iGEM Team Köln/Düsseldorf 2017.  As they were the first iGEM Team of their University in 2016 they knew excactly what problems we faced.  Not only taking us by the hand and giving us great support and advices during the whole time, they also invited us to their SynBioDay in Düsseldorf.
Check out the project of iGEM-Team Cologne-Duesseldorf! See their wiki page
iGEM Team Heidelberg
The project of this year’s iGEM-team in Heidelberg is about accelerated evolution using phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE). This is a very fast method to insert a desired mutation into bacterial cells. In their case, they used the method to evolve three mutagenesis plasmids developing different antibiotic resistances in E. coli cells. We were asked to perform a mutagenesis plasmid activity assay to analyze their function and mutagenesis levels. In return they supported us developing our biosafety part.(see safety ).
All in all Team Heidelberg gave us continuous support and we are very thankful for that.

BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", we sent the plasmid dry powder to HBUT-China and UCAS-China for different experiments. The experimental results of HBUT-China showed that the expression of mcherry fluorescence was not significant under the induction of low concentration of salicylic acid, and there were peaks of red fluorescence under the induction of 0.3 and 0.5 mg/L. Further experiments showed that the optimal induction time of salicylic acid was above 4.5h. Next, UCAS-China helped us to carry out experiments using high-concentration salicylic acid. After 6 hours of induction, the amount of mcherry fluorescence in the experimental group was significantly different from that in the control group, and the higher the salicylic acid concentration is, the red fluorescence intensity is stronger.
The optimal concentration of salicylic acid was above 40 mg/L, and the protein expression of the vector after the modification was significantly increased compared to the previous vector (Fig. 17A).

Survey
In order to find out the people’s mainstream views to transgene, a survey consists of four parts which are basic information, acknowledge about transgenic technology, attitudes towards genetically modified food and perspective of genetic therapy is designed and distributed through internet.
Based on static from basic information, it is confirmed that the investigated people are selected randomly in terms of sex, living city, most of which are highly educated adults.
Referring to transgenic technology, the majority of people have general knowledge of it from traditional media more than daily conversation, who support study in transgene.
Management of drug and label is considered necessary for genetically modified food, because it may contain latent danger without precedents.
Upon genetic therapy, there is a tendency in believing that it will be applied to patience soon, even be able to repair cells, prolong life or accomplish organ transplantation without rejection. However, in consideration of privacy and social ethics, 20 percent of people under investigation are unwilling to possess a “gene ID card” for illness prediction.
Resolutions to present prejudice against transgene： 1. For government，it should strengthen supervision on genetically modified food, which will eliminate public’s worries and detestation on it.   More specifically, first, a series of detailed laws ought to be written for ensure of consumers’ rights.   Then, it had better increase their coverage on the positive influence on genetic technology for social atmosphere. 2. For press media, a positive lead is indispensably to be set, as it plays an important role on influencing mainstream views towards transgene.   Most importantly, any one-sided reportage aiming for catching eyes should be eradicated so as not to deepen misunderstanding. 3. For the medical industry, it is obliged to present an implicit elaboration of genetic therapy to public, rather than different viewpoints from many different so-called experts.   It can make"

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Resistance
Summary
Antibiotic resistance is an important part of evaluating the success of a synthetic biology experiment.  This test is usually performed after transforming your plasmid into your chassis organism. The resistance is due to selection markers that are placed within the plasmid that contains your biological part(s). The cells that were not transformed properly will die to their lack of resistance. The remaining cells can be utilized to perform subsequent experiments.

Project Description
As an autoimmune disease, celiac disease is sensitivity to grains such as wheat rye and barley that have gliadin which is a glycoprotein complex rich in proline and glutamine, especially alpha-2-gliadin. Alfa-2-glaidin basically binds to a specific receptor called HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8. This is because tTG alter the alfa-2-gliadin’s charge density which results in highly negative charges. This negative charge density creates significant binding effect to alfa-2-gliadin to HLA-DQ2 OR HLA-DQ8. This receptor is an important key component of the  immune system, which has loci at chromosome 6. Epitopes of that receptor create cellular signaling pathway which results in increase of T and B-cells. These important immune cells eventually kill the specific antigens presented cells. Thus, in order to prevent  this autoimmune disorder, our project aims to destroy these specific subunits of gluten before the intake of food. This will be accomplished by adding specific enzymes’ genes to E.coli’s genome. Then, E.coli will be added into dough while it is in fermentation process. So during the process of fermentation, specific enzymes’ genes will be transcribed and they will break down the gluten. To sum up, with the specific enzyme, which is expressed by E.coli, will alter and brake down the specific protein subunit which is a key component of celiac disease, .  In addition, we would like to improve the consistency of gluten-free bread by letting bacteria secrete additives. For the efficiency of the gluten destruction process, the homogenization of dough will also be improved by the bacteria secretion of additives. Last but not least, receptor complex within E.coli is going to be designed and this  will enable the bacteria to express a receptor which is like HLA-DQ; in order to detect whether there is a gluten or not.
Project Summary
People with celiac disease have to consume gluten free food because gluten creates an auto-immune response in their body. However, gluten free food is a lot more expensive than normal food. That is why, we decided to find a solution to this problem by taking kumamolisin and putting"

Visualizations
We spent the first few hours today making cool visualizations and graphs of the data we found on the 9th: heatmaps turned out to be an annoying limitation of Python, so a Python/R hybrid was used, and bar charts were made exclusively in Python. See the dropbox for our pretty (and hopefully informative compared to spreadsheets) charts/graphs.
A heatmap of the pairing data. The darker the blues indicate that the pairing occurs more often.
We then started work on TNN and GNN properties specifically (essentially repeating the June 9th work, but confined to smaller data sets). There are some differences between TNN and GNN: see graphs in dropbox. We decided that there was not enough data for fingers that bind to ANN and CNN triplets to perform significant analysis on it.
A heatmap of the GNN pairing data.
A heatmap of the TNN pairing data.
Overall, similar color clusters are found in the heatmaps. In all cases, L and N are often placed consecutively on the helix. There are fewer clusters of high frequency when looking at TNN binders.
We then, using the theorized framework from a paper (2011 Persikov [1] ), tried to match amino acid binding to each base pair to see if there was a pattern. See dropbox document .../bioinformatics/Binding Frequency for that data. There's a lot of it.

Prioritized autoclaving YPD media, YPD plates, 1M LiOAc solution, 0.1 M EDTA solution, and 10mM Tris-HCl 1mM EDTA solution.  Note that there were some issues while making the 0.1 M EDTA (i.e. spilling some of the volume before the EDTA had been completely dissolved), such that the estimated molarity is less than 0.1M.  Thus, since this EDTA solution was used to make the 10mM Tris-HCl 1 mM EDTA solution, the concentration of EDTA in the latter solution is also lower than specified.
Also note contamination in the LB left over from making LB + amp last night.  One must thus be wary about using the LB + amp produced from what ended up being contaminated media, especially if it is to be used for a glycerol stock.
Added 20.5 mg of ampicillin to 200 mL LB from a different batch of LB from 6/25/08 that had been sitting out and was most certainly not contaminated.
For parts that were listed yesterday as requiring a miniprep, they were innoculated in 7-10 mL LB + amp (almost all parts were in around 8 mL of culture except P0520, which was in 10 mL).  For parts that had sufficient amount of DNA from yesterday's miniprep, they were cultured in 2 mL liquid in preparation for making glycerol stocks tomorrow.
Placed in incubator set to 250 rpm, with tubes slanted at an angle, at 1:12 am on 6/28/08.  Will check on them tomorrow at 3:12 pm.

Gold Integrated Human Practices
Our integrated human practices are the result of each and every single human practices activity that we carried out throughout the iGEM season. We truly believe our work, in every section of our project, including wet lab, has significantly changed towards the implementation of our relevant communities feedback. Since the first day we engaged with beekeepers, our project has been shaping and improving towards an effective, responsible, safe and ethical work.
After the video call we had with Maria Mercedes Roca, Ph.D, where emphasis was placed on the three pillars of the UN for sustainable development, we saw the importance of these three areas and decided to exploit them in our integrated human practices: the economic, social and environmental area of our project, as well as a section showing how the design and execution of it has been, molded thanks to our silver human practices.

Project Basis
The foundation of the project was evolving, improving and solidifying thanks to the interactions we experienced in our human practices. There were fundamental changes such as the production chassis of the peptides and the application method of the product, as well as recommendations for the experimental plan and insights about the risk factors we should consider.
Excretion of antimicrobial peptides in Pichia pastoris for Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius inhibition. The initial plan was to apply genetically modified yeasts engineered to excrete AMP’s and surfactin in a solution with hexane extract of the plant A. satureioides; surfactin has a synergistic effect with the hexane extract. This solution would be applied to the bee bread we knew larvae ingested in their diet.
Learned obstacles regarding the method:
Presence of genetically modified yeats would complicate the exportation process of honey to the European Union increasing the risks of having the product rejected.
The hexane extract of A.satureioides is oxidized by exposure to air; therefore, it may lose its efficiency.
An overdose of yeasts would cause fermentation of the honey and an alteration in the microbiota of the bees which could be counterproductive since this would cause diseases such as Nosema and American foulbrood to arrive.

Since the metabolic flux of the original metabolic pathway is quite stable,                                          the relative metabolic flux of CO2-utilization over that of the original metabolic pathway could                                          show a quantitative understanding on the CO2 utilization efficiency.                                          This relative value was MFICO2[1], a term as metabolic flux index of CO2-utilization pathway in heterotrophic engineered E. coli.                                          This is the percentage of xylose that we mentioned above.

a：3PGA generated from the central pathway
b：CO2 fixed by the CO2 bypass pathway
c：mole of 3PGA0 into downstream
d : mole of 3PGA’ into downstream
To define the MFICO2, we use CO2 fixed by the CO2 bypass pathway,                                          noted as b, divided by the 3PGA generated from the central pathway,                                          noted as a. We also assume c is mole of 3PGA¬0 and d is mole of 3PGA’ that channels into downsteam metabolism.                                          After metabolism, (a+b) mole of 3PGA0 and b mole of 3PGA’ are generated.
Besides, X and Y represent the actual 3PGA detected from the original pathway and CO2 bypass pathway,                                          which show in 3PGA0 and 3PGA’ in the Fig 1., respectively.                                          In the experiment, we use 13C-labeled CO2 and unlabeled sugar to get the amount of 3PGA0 and 3PGA’.                                          However, it was reported that 3.45% of unlabeled 3PGA, which is noted as 3PGA’,                                          will convert to its isotopic during the culturing E. coli strains in medium.                                          Eventually, we concluded these situation into two equations.
$${y = b + 3.45\% \times (a+b) - d ......(1)}$$
$${x = (1-3.45\%) \times (a+b) - c ....(2)}$$
Since d/c = y/x under a metabolic steady-state,                                          we derive equation (1) and (2) into a final relationship between a, b, x, and y.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#ImprovePart_-_-_TEXT.html,"ynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi"

We research the impacts acted by various concentrations of α factor to the amount of expression of mRFP as well as the growth of engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains △far1+△sst2、△far1+△sst2+△ste2，△sst2 containing the detection circuit.
Plan and method
We set the concentrations of α factor as 0umol/L，1 umol/L， 2.5 umol/L， 5 umol/L，10 umol/L，15 umol/L. We sampled 5ml culture liquid of each of them at 0、4、8、10、12、14、16、18、20、22、24、26、28、30h respectively after shake culture. Afterwards, the red fluorescence intensity was measured in microplate reader (584/607) which was calibrated by pure liquid medium. We set red fluorescence intensity/OD600 as Y-axis and time as X- axis for the coordinate system.
Results and discussion
Fig.6 fuorescense curve of CEN.PK2-1C under different concentrations of α factor.
Fig.7 fuorescense curve of Δsst2+Δfar1 under different concentrations of α factor.
Fig.8 fuorescense curve of Δsst2+Δfar1+Δste2 under different concentrations of α factor.
For the strains △far1+△sst2 and CEN.PK2-1C, the red fluorescence intensity increased with the concentrations of α factor increasing, and almost none of the red fluorescence of the strain CEN.PK2-1C was detected. Moreover, the red fluorescence intensity of △far1+△sst2 is stronger than that of △far1+△sst2+△ste2 and CEN.PK2-1C.
Conclusion：According to the results above, the expression intensity of mRFP was induced increasingly by the increasing concentration of α factor. Because of the genes sst2, far1 knockout the strains △far1+△sst2+△ste2 and △far1+△sst2 could amplify the signal which was induced by the inducer. The stain △far1+△sst"

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Implementation#lasso_-_-_TEXT.html,"ry components that we were already using. In order to execute the design, the L.A.S.S.O. was 3-D printed and the design came to life with three parts: one for the electronics, one for the sample, and the last one for a waste compartment. Since we wanted to make sure the device remained user-friendly we inserted ridges and corresponding depressions into the connecting parts on these three compartments. It meant that the whole L.A.S.S.O. could fit together easily and a new user would be able to see instantly how the three parts slotted together.
There are two major safety purposes why the device was designed to come apart - firstly for ease of access to the electronic equipment and secondly to implement a safety feature for the use of genetically-modified bacteria.
We envision the device being serviced every 12 months. This will ensure that the device is working to the highest standard. For this to be possible an engineer will need to have easy access to the detector’s circuit without damaging the L.A.S.S.O. To allow this we designed the lower section, where the electronics are housed, to be detachable from the top section. The electronics will then be housed under a platform which will have the photodetector positioned within so it is flush against the top. This will stop the lights on the Arduino from interfering with the detector readings and stop any wires from covering the diode.
The second reason is to create a safe enclosure for storing the sputum which has been exposed to The Lung Ranger. We want to minimise contact between the user and the biological devices as much as possible. To do this we have implemented a safety protocol for dealing with the samples. Once a user has finished reading the sample they are able to use a plunger attached to an arm to move it from the main device to a side compartment. This compartment houses a platform on a spring. As more samples are passed through they stack on top of each other and held in place, stopping them from moving around. Nine samples can be stored this way, meaning the L.A.S.S.O. can be used multiple times before it needs to be emptied. Once it does, the waste compartment can be removed from the rest of the device, and the samples emptied into special waste disposal. More information on safety aspects with regards to the L.A.S.S.O. can be found here .
We collected a preliminary set of results for the L.A.S.S.O. based on luciferase samples of increasing brightness. These samples were made through serial dilutions from a 5 ml overnight culture of Vibrio fischeri. A simple eye test"

This year, despite our relatively ambitious project, our team achieved goals in several different areas.
We successfully modelled, designed, characterised and entered our sporulation tuning kinA BioBrick ( BBa_K174011 ) in the parts registry.
We also improved an existing BioBrick part ( BBa_K174004 ) rendering it tightly regulated.
Futhermore, we helped the UQ-Australia iGEM2009 team ( Helping other teams ) by building a template model for their system and sending it to them.
We developed a bacterial population simulation , primarily to assist in examining the affect of our removal of germination in the 'sequestering spores', which combines distributed computing, biochemical models and agent based modelling.
We also modelled all the components of our project's system, and we designed and entered 16 other BioBrick parts and devices, ranking from a degradation controller system to a tightly regulated metal sensing promoter. We believe that several of the BioBrick parts we designed, in addition to our three favourite parts, are novel and can be used not only in the context of our project but in a variety of different systems.
Our degradation controller device is arabinose inducible and should be useful beyond our own project, to tightly regulate the levels of protein in a range of synthetic systems. Our device allows us to exert a third form of control over the expression level of a protein of interest, in addition to the transcriptional and translational regulation already widely used in Synthetic Biology.
Our cadmium sensitive promoter BioBrick is novel since there is no previously available cadmium specific promoter. Our combinatorial approach, using two different transcriptional repressors is a"

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html,"We modeled the nootkatone biosynthesis pathway using ordinary differential equations in order to optimize nootkatone production. We found two hard and an easy problem, all of which we could find a solution for. The easy problem is optimization of the enzyme concentrations of the biosynthesis pathway. According to our model of the Nootkatone pathway we found that overexpression of Valencene Synthase is necessary to maximize the Nootkatone yield, while both alcohol dehydrogenase and p450-BM3 have only minor effects on the yield.
One of the hard problems, as shown in our penalty model is the toxicity of nootkatone and nootkatol. Since the toxicity most likely stems from both nootkatone and nootkatol clogging up the cell wall we present our peroxisome as a solution for this problem. When comparing the cytosolic model to our peroxisomal model we found that, if our assumption that neither Nootkatone nor Nootkatol are able to pass the peroxisomal membrane holds up, we can greatly increase Nootkatone production.
A further  problem is the influx of the pathway precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). We used OptKnock analysis to design yeast strains with optimized FPP production. With this analysis we got hints that growing the yeast cells on a fatty acid medium might be a simple alternative to  knocking out the desired genes.
Violacein
Working on a project is a process of well planned steps. It starts with an idea and theoretical research to create a design. When finally demonstrating the mechanism of the project it is important to point out the benefits with a suitable application.
Synthetic biology offers countless numbers of new opportunities, especially in the field of metabolic engineering. To testify some main parts of our artico project, we decided to relocate a metabolic pathway into yeast peroxisomes. There are several reasons why this approach fits perfectly as a proof for our concept.
Based on described of advantages of violacein this pathway was chosen. Violacein is naturally produced in numerous bacterial strains, most popular in the gram-negative Chromobacterium violaceum . It is related to biofilm production and shows typical activities of a secondary metabolite (Seong Yeol Choi et al., 2015).
Figure 8.1 The synthesis of Violacein requires five enzymes encoded by the VioABCDE operon. VioA, a flavin-dependent L-tryptophan oxidase and VioB, a heme protein, work in combination to oxidize"

Beadzillus: Fundamental BioBricks for Bacillus subtilis and spores as a platform for protein display
We chose to work with Bacillus subtilis to set new horizons and offer tools for this model organism to the Escherichia coli-dominated world of iGEM. Therefore, we created a BacillusBioBrickBox (B4) composed of reporter genes, defined promoters, as well as reporter, expression, and empty vectors in BioBrick standard. B. subtilis naturally produces stress-resistant endospores which can germinate in response to suitable environmental conditions. To highlight this unique feature using the B4, we developed Sporobeads . These are spores displaying fusion proteins on their surface. As a proof of principle, we fused GFP to the outermost layer. Expanding this idea, we designed a Sporovector to easily create any Sporobead imaginable. Because the Sporobeads must be biologically safe and stable vehicles,"

SHENG Zi Wei Amy
I am senior biology student of Hong Kong Baptist University. Mainly working on wet lab, I, together with teammates, take responsibility of measuring the swimming speed and categorizing the trait of polar expression after bacteria being modified. When James, one of our members, introduced me to this group, I had zero knowledge of what synthetic biology means or what we suppose to do. However, had gone through papers and handled wet lab work, I have started to understand the significance of this subject and its bright future and moreover exhibit great interest to it. I attained from this experience not only practical laboratory skills and knowledge of synthetic biology but also friendship and teamwork spirit. Other interests of mine include traveling, reading, growing vegetables and eating them.
SIN Sheung Man Alexander
When I first heard about iGEM and the idea of synthetic biology, it really caught my interest. This is a chance where I can combine other’s work and findings and make the best out of them. This is what I have learnt recently from object-orientated programming – breaking ideas down into objects, manipulating and assembling them into one working machine.
Being in the second year of the Bioinformatics Programme, I am in the middle of learning how the knowledge of computer science can be applied on biochemistry. By participating in the iGEM competition, one would be able to gain hands-on experience on what biochemistry research is like, how the knowledge learnt from lectures can be applied to practical laboratory work, and the wisdom to work as a team – sharing results, joys as well as deadlines and pressure. I am glad and honoured to be a part of the team HKU-HKBU, and it is a wonderful opportunity to be able to work with students from another university in Hong Kong.

I'm a second year student studying Chemistry at the University of Hong Kong. It is my first time to take part in an international competition about synthetic biology. After acquiring information from my other iGEM members, my strong interest drives me to participate into iGEM in summer. At the very beginning, I think this is just another means to kill my time in summer. However, after attending several meeting and assisting others to do different kinds of laboratory work, I find myself immersed in this competition. Some of the laboratory work like western blotting, PCR, electrophoresis and the like are very new to me and I never come across this stuff from Chemistry laboratory. Though repeated failure in the genes knockout, I never felt frustrated since I could learn new things from each failed experiment."

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," to detect the siderophores of pathogenic bacteria, we came up with the idea that we could provide the team with highly pure Lcn2 protein. This was a fruitful collaboration as our team's main PI, Prof. Dr. Arne Skerra, is one of the leading experts in the field of lipocalins [1] . For this reason, the expression constructs and the protocols to produce this recombinant protein are well established our affiliated lab. The main challenge in producing the recombinant protein was that the Sheffield iGEM team required the apo form of the protein without the bacterial siderophore as they aimed to scavenge siderophores from samples and then determine the siderophore content. Thus, we produced the recombinant protein in E. coli such that it was free from the siderophore generated in conventional E. coli strains.

The iGEM team from FAU Erlangen was working on the development of a biological photovoltaic cell, for which they aimed to use fluorescent proteins to harvest the photons. We saw their presentation at the iGEM Germany meet-up in Marburg, and as we used the purified recombinant eGFP for our own project in any case, we proposed to provide them with eGFP for their experiments. Luckily, at the ""Biotechnikum"" of the TUM, an annual lab course for bioprocess engineering students produces a large batch of eGFP in E. coli at a bioprocess scale of several hundred liters of culture medium. For our project, we were provided with ≈50 g of eGFP that we subsequently purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation as well as immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), and eventually dialyzed the protein against PBS. At the beginning of October, we provided 1.4 g of purified eGFP to the FAU Erlangen iGEM team.

Survey: ""Supporting Entrepreneurship""
For the creation of this survey, we had a special Instructor, Philipp. He is a PhD student an the Chair of Technology and  Innovations Management. He supervised Hallie, an exchange student from the USA who joined our team to create this survey and elucidate how we can make iGEM more productive concerning its output in successful start-up companies.
The Wiki
The Wiki was programmed by Peter, a student in Media Informatics (LMU). As we encountered some problems finding someone to program the Wiki, he joined the team 4 weeks before wiki freeze. As he also works in web design and completed his bachelor's thesis in parallel, he was quite busy and did not have overly much time (which is why we finalized our CSS on the last evening). In the end, though, he successfully completed the work.

In the second stage of the project, recombinant IF protein is aimed to be secreted into the extracellular matrix of E. coli cells. With the help of 3A assembly strategy, gif gene transferred into a new vector system which contains a T7 promoter, strong RBS, and transcription terminator. ImmunoBlot will be used in order to examine efficiency of secretion.
Result
In order to examination of secretion of GIF protein with OmpA signal, a composite part which contains T7 promoter, RBS (B0034), GIF gene with OmpA signal sequence(OmpA-GIF) and double terminator (B0015) has been planned to ligate. First step, GIF-OmpA and doubled terminator (OmpA-GIF + B0015)  were ligated (Figure 1). Second step, OmpA-GIF + B0015 planned ligated into B0034 part. Therefore, B0034 was cut with S and P; also, OmpA-GIF + B0015 was cut with X and P. Unexpected 300 bp DNA fragment was observed in B0034 double cut. Bands that observed in lane loaded with DNA from OmpA-GIF + B0015 double cut were expected (Figure 1).

Module 2
Introduction
Purification of a protein is required prior to investigation of its structure and action mechanism. However, it is not an easy task to separate single protein from other  10,000 different proteins (approximately) in the cell. To overcome this, there are different methods and strategies were developed.(1)
Usage of recombinant fusion proteins is a widely used strategy for purification of proteins. In this strategy, a tag with a known size is used as the tag for the protein of interest and allows its efficient purification and detection by affinity chromatography. Two commonly used tags are glutathione-S-transferase (GST) tag and 6 x Histidine residues (His)6 tag. (2)
GST tag is a protein that is composed of 211 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 26 kDa. DNA sequence that encodes GST is transferred into an expression vector in order to produce recombinant fusion proteins. GST tagged fusion proteins involve a GST protein"

About our Project
Our project
The iGEM team Goettingen 2015 is currently developing the “Flexosome”.  It is our enzymatic penknife: a customizable complex for more efficient and synergistic multi-enzymatic processes. It consists of a scaffoldin, dockerins and exchangeable enzymes. The enzymes of interest can be attached to the scaffoldin via the dockerin stations and once attached complete the reactions.
The first step
Right now the team is working on a proof of concept. Our first Flexosome will contain phosphatase, esterase and cellulase found in metagenomic libraries along with RFP, a fluorescent reporter gene. Once our E. coli is able to express and produce this functional Flexosome, this will open the door for more complex and specific applications.
The inspiration
We studied the natural cellulosome structure, in which different cellulotytic enzymes are assembled into a bigger scaffoldin via dockerin stations, leading to optimized cellulose degradation. The interaction between scaffoldin and dockerins has been proven to be strong and stable, this gave us the ideal platform to design our ""Flexosome” device.  Traditionally cellulosome engineering is thought for optimization of cellulose degradation, but we don’t have to stop there! A much broader range of enzymes are actively being discovered every year. That is why we intend to combine the scaffoldin protein from cellulolytic bacterium with varying and exchangeable enzymes. The result: a very versatile, stable and innovative tool!
The goal
We want to achieve a protein construct which will be able to ensure a high local concentration of enzymes and catalyse multiple enzymatic processes at one site, making the product of one process the substrate of the next on the scaffoldin. Ultimately, the construct will not only increase efficiency of the reactions but also be fully customisable for any kind of enzymatic process.
BioBricks
As our flexosome is built from multiple different domains, we decided that our BioBricks would also consist of these building blocks. Therefore we created     BioBricks containing the dockerins alone, as well as in conjunction with a protein. The original plan was to add the enzymes we were using for our proof of     principle.
In addition, we decided to use BioBricks from previous and current"

When we tried to construct Apa-const-Promoter + TetR cassette + TetR promoter + RBS-PezT + Terminator-Bam-Hind, we had severe problems to isolate the right fragment size of the TetR Cassette (BBa_P0440) and the TetR Promoter (BBa_R0040).
We first used the BBa_P0440 and BBa_R0040 parts from the distribution kit of 2016 which are in the pSB1C3 plasmid. While the part TetR cassette should only have 57 bp long fragment we could clearly see a band larger than 500 bp. We therefore transformed the BBa_R0040 part from the distribution kit of 2015 but reproduced the same results (see figure 7).
BBa_P0440 should be detected as a 866 bp long fragment but showed no other band as the one of the Backbone. When we used the BBa_P0440 part of 2015 we had again the same results. Therefore we decided to amplify the BBa_P0440 and BBa_R0040 part of 2016 in the pSB1A2 vector via PCR and used the suggested VR2 and VF2 sequencing primer. This provided us with correct PCR Products.
Restriction analysis of the TetR parts from the 2015 and 2016 distribution kit after ligation into pSB1A3.
We purified the PCR products of BBa_P0440 and BBa_R0040 from the gel and ligated them. The ligation product was afterwards amplified via PCR using specific primers which bind the biobrick suffix and prefix. Again, the amplified products were too small and we had no further time to repeat the ligation steps."

Size Verification for M1-12(1C3)
Digested 1 ug of each  of the sequence verified plasmid from yesterday with EcoRI and PstI in a 50 uL reaction.
Used NEBuffer 2.1
Digest at 37 C for 1.5 hours, heat kill at 65 C for 20 min.
Run 15 uL of digest on 1% TAE gel, with 2 uL of NEB 1 kb ladder.
Fig. 1 Size Analysis of Putative M1-12(1C3). The expected size for a digested 12-mer is 1324 bp. The expected size for a digested 9-mer is 1018 bp. The expected size for digested pSB1C3 is 2029 bp. The slight size difference ins sequence sample 4 is due to the inclusion of the T7 promoter-RBS sequence from BBa_K525998.
Results indicate that what we believed to be M1-12(1C3) is in reality M1-9(1C3). This results is most likely due to contamination during the transformation process, possibly from the glass beads used to spread bacteria.

Always satisfied to be a menial reseacher(Not exactly).
Yi is a sophomore majoring in physics in UCAS.
During a couple of months spent on IGEM competition. She came across many outstanding teammates, from whom she harvested many new pieces of knowledge and experience. Though she may not continue the research work in the biological field, the precious experience thought she what ""scientific research"" really is.
Her summer vacation was spent in the laboratory where she served as an assistant. Out of lab she also did some paperwork such as translation and collecting some materials. She did some trivial works in HP and Hardware.
Although most of the time she acted as a ""manual worker"", she is willing to contribute to the team.

In order to induce the expression of ampR N-3-butyryl homoserine lactone was added to a final concentration of 10 µM. Samples were taken at appropriate times depending on the growth phase until the induced culture reached the stationary phase. OD was determined at 520 nm to avoid absorptions by chromoproteins.
To verify production of HSLs by our constructs the pre-cultures containing the finale constructs as well as the negative controls were centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 rpm and 4°C. Supernatant was transferred to a new Falcon tube and sterilized by filtration.
Dilution series of the supernatants and the synthetic HSLs as standards were pipetted in 96-well microtiter plates. Wells were inoculated with the corresponding reporter strain and grown for 3 h at 37°C. Bioluminescence produced by the luxCDABE of the reporter strains was detected by a microplate reader. We were able to show that our constructs produced the specific HSLs. However due to the high background especially in the N-3-oxododecanoyl-HSL producing strain we might need to modify the experimental layout in order to get a stronger signal.

Image below. shows an example reaction catalyzed by amidase. The enzyme hydrolases the functional group and disconnects the linked product molecule in one step forming a native dCTP nucleotide.
4. Lyases
Lyases catalyze the elimination reaction of various chemical groups by breaking C-C, C-O, C-N and other bonds. As a consequence of bond breakage, lyases allow the substrate nucleotide to lose a part of linked substrate, therefore newly formed product nucleotide becomes accessible to Phi29 DNA polymerase and in turn is incorporated into a DNA sequence. Additionally, lyase catalyzed reactions can be linked with simple chemical conversions, leading to removal of whole substrate as depicted below. Image below visualizes the cleave of C-C bond leading to a product nucleotide, which spontaneously undergoes beta elimination reaction, leading to native dexocytinine nucleotide.
5. Isomerases
Isomerases catalyze the conversion of one isomer to another. Combination of isomerases with other stereospecific enzymes, such as hydrolases, can be employed to change the configuration of nucleotide linked substrate molecules which are in turn removed by secondary enzyme, thus recording the activity of rate limiting enzyme. Image below shows a substrate bound nucleotide. The stereospecific amidase only catalyzes the removal of S isomer substrate. Introduction of isomerase enzyme allows to record the catalytic activity of this enzyme in a form of amidase hydrolyzed nucleotides."

SUGGESTIONS:
I wouldn't buy a detector, as I never had problems with spoiled food not being identifiable as  spoiled. as a food technologist I haven't heard about this. If food processors can put expiry date then what   different can GMO do? why will consumers pay extra? Consumer acceptance can be a big   problem in India. Be specific in detecting fungal/bacterial spoilage. Because most of our food of acidic nature is   damaged by fungal partners and food with high water activity by bacterial members. So, target a   specific group that covers wide food products. First of all would you pack the spoilage detector in the food packages before being purchased by   consumers? Or would you have a spoilage detector for individual consumer's detection for   example after opening of the food package? Would it be safe to use? How about disposal? Regarding the iGEM Groningen design in 2012: How would you make an applicable, useful and   simple detector for food e.g. in the fridge? If you put your detector into the fridge at time 0, how   fast would you know if the food is spoiled or not, regarding the design of your detector. E.g.   bacteria based detector needs bacteria to grow and produce certain compound resulting in the   detectable colour. Would the lower temperature have an effect on the time of compound   production and therefore the spoilage detection? For the best results at the competition, rethink   and discuss your application strategy with as many people as possible. Take the"

Today I got the sequencing results in which we found that the LacI generator I assembled was not correct, hence the experiments I did with attaching it with controls are waste. Hence I planned to do it next weekend (since I started my thesis officially from yesterday) with redoing the positive control assembly alone on thursday since its sequence too got failed.

UChile-OpenBio,2015,Team:UChile-OpenBio#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," team invited us to participate in a survey for their policies and practices work for researching how reporting of results is viewed in the iGEM community to discuss the concept of negative results; a negative result is one that indicates that your system does not work as you intended. Also they wanted to investigate the experience iGEM teams have had with reading older wikis this 2015 as a source of inspiration. The team was very worried about how scientists and iGEM teams emphasize some parts of a project and play down others to its convenience, occulting important information about a negative results that could be useful to other, for example, to next iGEM teams.
This survey incentive us to include a section of negative results in our wiki as a valuable report to a next iGEM team of our university; we are the first one!
Nankai iGEM Team from Tianjin, China
This team invited us to participate in a survey as a part of his human practice, where they hope to set up an all-round resource sharing platform called iShare. The survey had only 11 questions on the questionnaire. Its principal motivation was during the summer, where they ran into many problems working on their experiments. The lack of materials was one of the major difficulties for they, who had to acquire those materials from other laboratories. So they suggest a special webpage or a section on wiki for iGEM teams to list the materials they use in their experiments they are willing to share.
We had some similar problems when our enzyme digestion (EcoRI, SpeI) was lost. We guess this platform could be very useful to guide new teams. It had been helpful to us if this platform would have been implemented before.

Genetic circuits are often difficult to engineer, requiring months to design, build, and test each individual genetic device involved in the circuit. SBiDer, a web tool developed by the UCSD Software iGEM team, will leverage existing devices to construct a database with consideration for the function of each device interpreted as boolean logic. The data can be queried by the user through SBiDer's visual interface to explore circuit designs. Users can search for existing circuits that can be used to assemble a complex circuit. The displayed circuit's literature reference, characterization data, and images of included devices can be viewed through the built-in table. We also provide a standalone modelling Python package that can be used to model circuits given by our online webtool. SBiDer's web of information can be expanded through user-generated additions to the database to improve the efficiency of the application and the accuracy of the models.

Klebsiella spp.: Klebsiella spp. is a group of environmental pathogens that are significant causes of bovine mastitis, with rising incidence rates in recent years. Klebsiella species are known to stay dormant in the udders and spread through cattle quickly. Infected cattle often die within days, and evidence suggests increased antibiotic resistance [10].
Lactococcus lactis: Lactococcus lactis is a Gram-positive bacteria.  It was not identified as a mastitis-causing pathogen until the start of 200,7 when five New York state dairy herds were infected. It is often hard to identify in laboratories, and as a result is often misidentified as Streptococcus or Enterococcus. The treatment of these organisms is difficult because they have the ability to transfer genetic material of resistance to commonly used antibiotics. These bacteria can be spread from cow to cow through milking, but most often, it is spread environmentally, such as through bedding [11].
Pseudomonas spp: Pseudomonas spp. is a genus of bacteria that are mastitis-causing pathogens. Its infection rate in cows is around 1-3%. Using water supplies of all kinds, such as parlor water hoses, or using contaminated teat dips and contaminated infusion equipment for cows are all sources of Pseudomonas spp. infections. This genus of bacteria often attacks weak or injured tissues in the teats or mammary glands, and it can cause non-clinical cases of bovine mastitis, but exposure to large numbers of it can lead to an outbreak of clinical cases [12].
Streptococcus agalactiae: Streptococcus agalactiae is a Gram-positive bacteria that infects the bovine mammary gland.  Presence of S. agalactiae is associated with increased somatic cell count and decreased quality of milk. It is present in 11% to 47% of cow herds [13].
Staphylococcus aureus: Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive coccal bacteria, and is one of the most devastating mastitis causing pathogens.  This is mainly because of its ability to form biofilm. As a result, S. aureus is very difficult to treat with antibiotics as drugs are often rendered ineffective due to transport mechanisms, even if effective at killing the cells.  Thus, it is one of the worst pathogens for dairy farmers [14].

Melbourne,2014,Team:Melbourne#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,". Together, these mutations allow SHuffle to fold disulfide-bonded proteins in the cytoplasm at a higher success rate compared to non-mutants. We aimed to take advantage of the disulfide bond forming capabilities of this strain of E. coli to synthesize star peptides in cells. As shown in the figure below, the synthesis steps may proceed as follows:
 
Express a short peptide containing two cysteine residues either to the E. coli periplasm or the cytoplasm of a trxB gor mutant.
E. coli disulfide bond forming enzymes fold the peptide into a hairpin loop structure.
Cut the loop at a protease recognition site engineered into the peptide. This may be done by extracting the folded peptide from the cell and treating it with the protease in vitro. Alternatively, the protease may be co-expressed in the cell to allow for in vivo cleavage.
 
 
This synthesis approach has several benefits over purely in vitro approaches. Firstly, the exact peptide sequence can be precisely programmed into E. coli using recombinant DNA synthesis. Secondly, by performing the disulfide bond formation in cells and optionally the proteolytic cleavage, several synthesis steps which would need to be performed in vitro are eliminated. From a scale up perspective, this would eliminate entire unit operations which would otherwise be required to produce this product. Given these benefits, in the current study, we aimed to express a star peptide precursor to the cytoplasm of SHuffle cells, which would later be extracted and externally digested with the star-forming protease. In order to achieve this, we first designed several star peptides which might be amenable to this synthetic strategy. These peptides are described below.
 
Rationally designed peptides
There are two approaches to functionalising star peptides. In the first, the identity of the arms can be chosen to be bioactive peptide molecules. This is the simplest approach to producing a biologically-relevant star. In the second, the arms can be functionalised by ligating molecules to them at any point. We used both of these approaches to design two separate peptides.
Magainin 1 star and linear peptides
Our first strategy was to make a star peptide using antimicrobial peptides(AMPs) as building blocks. AMPs are small, approximately 50 residue peptides secreted by some bacterial and eukaryotic cells which selectively kill microbial cells. It is thought that AMPs work by forming pores in the membrane of prokaryotic cells (Brogden, 2005). AMPs have been recombinantly expressed in a number of organisms,"

Gene Cassette
The final component needed was a gene cassette. The template for the cassette was a gBlock based of the sequences of aeBlue-aacC1 GmR and half AttC sites on either end. A PCR of the whole template gave a linearized cassette and an ELAN reaction circularized the cassette, giving a full gene cassette with colour and selective markers for antibiotic resistance. This cassette was inserted into the pSC1B3 backbone and this plasmid is reference to as pUS204 throughout the wiki.
