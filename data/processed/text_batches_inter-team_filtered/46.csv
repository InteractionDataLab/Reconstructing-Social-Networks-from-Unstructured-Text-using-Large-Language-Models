Amsterdam,2011,Team:Amsterdam#Human Outreach#Collaboration#Kick-off_-_-_TEXT.html," contest. In order to get ahead of these problems they warned us againt some of  these pitfalls and told us how to fix these problems. For example: They had some trouble working as a team when there were no people appointed to be responsible for certain tasks.  We also talked about how they experienced the entire competition and what they learnt from it. After the presentation we had a clearer image of what being in iGEM actually means.
Discussion
In the afternoon we got together with the teammembers and supervisors of both teams and we talked about our experiences so far. How did we start the brainstorming? Where did we find the sponsors to write our letter to? How does Delft arrange their labwork? Both teams come from different backgrounds and consist of very different students. By talking with each other the teams can come to ideas they would not have thought of by themselves, and this definitely happened this day. This discussion led to an interesting exchange of experiences and insights. We feel that both teams exploited the opportunity to learn from each other. The two teams definitely made progress and came up with good ideas on how to finish the different projects.
It was a very interesting and inspiring day.

NAWI_Graz,2017,Team:NAWI Graz#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM Projects at Universities of Graz
Since donations to non-official associations can lead to some difficulties for many companies, we decided to found an official association called “NAWiGEM - association to support the projects of the Graz iGEM team”under the auspices of the DIY electro- and biohacker scene in Graz, the Realraum3 and the [OpenBioLabGrazAustria].
To increase the degree of popularity of iGEM and everything connected to it, we promoted all iGEM related topics at our events. We constantly received new inquiries from interested students on how to participate in the competition. Through the interviews with various experts, we were able to increase our awareness in different institutes. This made it possible for us to appeal to students from different fields.         The first meetings with the new participants already showed a huge interest of engineering students for the competition."

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#chemotaxis_-_-_TEXT.html,"/3 seconds.
As the bacteria are attracted to a chemical, in our case aspartate ions - which diffuse from a source into the surrounding water - modelling the diffusion is also important. As the diffusion in all our cases is from what can be considered a point source and equal in all radial directions, the following solution to Fick’s Law can be used:
Where x is the radial distance from the source, t is the time since diffusion began and erfc is the complementary error function , D is the coefficient of diffusion and C(0) is the concentration at the source at time zero. The diffusion coefficient of the aspartate ion, or aspartic acid, was calculated from [5] as the diffusion coefficients of the amino acids correlate strongly to their molecular mass. The concentration at the source is assumed to be the saturation point of aspatic acid, as the boundary layer of water closest to the dissolving solid would be saturated.
In the chemotaxis model this is used to calculate the concentration at any time in any location. Here however, is where another series of simplifications and assumptions are made. The above solution of Fick’s Law is for a static fluid in which there exist no eddy currents. As there will be small temperature fluctuations there will also be convection currents mixing the fluid, and as the bacteria themselves swim around they will be further mixing the fluid. Estimating the eddy diffusion coefficient is very difficult to do accurately. For the purposes of the chemotaxis model in most cases eddy diffusion has been ignored as the fluid is for all intensive purposes static. However; in the case where we were performing experiments, a greater level of turbulence and mixing exists as samples are taken from a channel of water every five minutes.
E.coli is only capable of sensing our signalling chemical, aspartate, at levels above 10-8 M according to ‘Chemotaxis in Bacteria’ [1]. This has been accounted for in the model and can be shown by the video below in which aspartate is diffusing out (without eddy diffusion and with data from [5]) from a source in the middle of the bacteria. The black circle represents the point where the concentration is 10-8 M, and everything inside it is greater than 10-8 M:
Our model, unlike many chemotaxis models, is not agent based, and so collision behaviour of correctly shaped E. Coli cells has not been included. In our 2-d model tumbling of bacteria due to collisions and stopping of overlap are included. However if we implement this effect and count how many"

Glenn
Glenn is 24 years old and studies physics on his fourth year. He is one of the modelling guys and he and Eddi have done an incredible job batteling the math that wouldn't allow our system to exist.
Glenn has a fantastic ability to convey really complicated information in a way that makes it sound interesting and relevant. No matter how tired or hungover we were at our weekly update meetings, we always woke up and paid attention when Glenn spoke. He is an excellent presenter and is always enthusiastic and truly catches his audience.
Glenn is always very busy but he still has a big smile on his face, even when he's frustrated. We would love to illustrate the correlation between his level of excitement and the number of hand gestures per minute, but the only one who knows how to do the math is probably Glenn himself.
Lars Christian
Lars Christian is 21 years old and one of our medical students. Originally, his lack of lab experience caused him to take the position of Maria's lab bitch. Over the summer, though, he has learned fast during his work with the photosensor part and is now ready to spread his wings and fly out into the world as a real boy.
Despite his tendency to whine, he is a highly valued member of the team, as he has also done an incredible piece of work on the digital part of the project. He is responsible for the awesome layout of the wiki and he has almost singlehandedly kept the blog updated over the summer. During the conference in Paris in the spring, he live-blogged incessantly, and his efforts were rewarded with a call from the Danish radio program Harddisken.
In the long hours spent waiting for PCR reactions and gels, he has enjoyed racing against Sheila and Christian in MarioKart on an old-school Nintendo 64. These races revealed him as a very sore loser. If you beat him in a game (any game), you've certainly cheated!
Louise
Louise is 23 years old and studies biomedicine on her fourth year. She was one of the founders of this year's iGEM team, and it was only due to the efforts of her, Christian and Lars Christian that the existing team was broght together in the first place.

We then used standard BioBrick construction methods to clone the EcoRI-SpeI promoter fragment into the EcoRI-XbaI sites upstream of the cyan fluorescent protein cloned into pSB1A3 ( BBa_E0422 ). The putative construct was verified by restriction digest analysis and sequenced in both directions using primers VF2 and VR to validate the expected sequence.
NEB5alpha cells harboring the reporter construct were spread on LB plates supplemented with 100 mM lithium lactate and incubated at 37 C. The plates were monitored over a 36 hour period and showed no fluorescence. Similar experiments using liquid media and a spectrofluorometer for measurement also indicated no fluorescence.

Basic Part
We added four basic parts to the registry: the ion channels mHCN2, hERG, Kir2.1, and α1G. We used these ion channels to build our project and to validate our model, but other teams might find them useful, too!
A detailed description of the biobricks created for the project can be found here
But what do we think about our biobricks ourselves? Here's our top 4:
The favourite: Kir2.1 ❤
Our favourite biobrick is the inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir2.1. This protein is a mammalian ion channel, and has some interesting electrophysiological properties. For example, (over)expression of Kir2.1 in HEK cells leads to differences in membrane potential.
In our project, we used this protein to verify the added value of our model . According to this model, the oscillating system could result from a combination of the mHCN2, hERG and α1G ion channels. We tested the modelled system in HEK cells, and obtained the oscillating system! However, the model1 suggested that the specific characteristics of the ion channels in the system are crucial for the system to work. Therefore, we were curious whether the oscillations would result from just any combination of polarising, depolarising and hyperpolarization-activated channels, and we tested a system consisting of mHCN2, Kir2.1 and  α1G. As expected, this combination did not result in any oscillations, validating the importance of our model.
We tested the system containing mHCN2, Kir2.1 and α1G with two Kir2.1 variants: The wildtype gene, but also the carefully designed biobrick-compatible variant we have presented to the registry. This biobrick-compatible variant was then cloned into the standard pSB1C3 vector, verified using sequencing, and sent to the registry.

The iGEM competition demands a lot of work in terms of project planning, research, programming, fundraising, human practices and wet lab experiments. Because we are a team with a diverse background, we divided tasks to best match our members' experience and interests. Sometimes, that meant doing what we do best; other times, it meant learning something new. When difficulties arose, we turned to our supervisors for help and guidance. Here, we would like to credit our team members for the specific roles they played into making CascAID. Also, we would like to thank our supervisors and external helpers for their important contributions to our project.
Organization
As our team was composed of people with different lab experience, there were some members who instructed the others in the use of lab equipment and methods. Our master students, Max , Ludwig and Sven taught the other team members and coordinated work distribution. Our supervisors Lukas and Aurore took over responsibility, supported the team in each point of this project and invested a lot of time in and outside the lab.
Molecular cloning
Due to our biochemistry background, most of us had experience in molecular cloning and thus almost every student helped with it in some way. However, most of the work for the Cas13a cloning was done by Ludwig and Christoph . The BioBricks were done by Rob and Max , who also cloned the constructs needed for the Intein-Extein read-out. The parts for the aeBlue read-out were done by Florian and Christoph . All the gene and primer design was done by the above-mentioned students and reviewed by our supervisor Aurore .
Protein purification
Our three Cas13a proteins: Lsh, Lwa and Lbu, were purified thanks to the hard work of Ludwig , Max , Sven and Milica . Dr. Sandra Sagredo, a postdoc at Prof. Simmel´s group, introduced them to the Äkta Purification System.

One hope is that synbio can be self-regulating. The same advances that will expose us to new forms of danger will also allow us to respond to them quickly.  The 2014 Ebola outbreak revealed just how spotty our rapid response protocol is, as current methods still took months to produce a viable vaccine. Similar issues exacerbated the H1N1 pandemic just 5 years earlier. Traditional vaccine production has a turnover time of approximately four months.  In 2009, Swine Flu took over 150,000 lives as vaccine stockpiles were emptied. Large scale outbreaks or engineered pathogens could easily render us defenseless. Fortunately, more efficient production methods are on the rise.  Transgenic plants can form products in a matter of weeks with no drop in quality. Engineered platforms such as microalgae have the potential to perform the lion’s share of the world’s vaccine production. However, it is critical that the development and standardization of these methods begins now.
Altogether, synbio is left unchecked by governmental policy, allowing it to thrive free from federal interference, but also opening the door for misuse and abuse. The field, along with its associated dangers, is still nebulous, yet will quickly permeate many aspects of life. The time is now, though, for us to ask ourselves, “Should we?”
Open Source Biology
David Adams considers the implications of open source biology
Many analogies have been drawn between biology and computing. DNA itself is a type of code which is read and processed to create the proteins that make up all living organisms. Theoretically, the logic used by programmers to build computers could be used in biological applications, albeit a different medium. The international genetically engineered competition (iGEM) is based around the creation and usage of standardized biobricks. These bricks allow bioengineers to apply logic to the design of genetically modified organisms. New bricks and the techniques needed to implement these parts are constantly being developed. As this continues, another association with computing is becoming apparent. That is the idea of open-source access.
In the software industry, open-source refers to functioning code that can be used freely by individuals. This freedom also gives the public free reign to modify the source code for their own purpose. A sense of community often develops around popular open-source software. Members of that community may test the code for bugs or security vulnerabilities.

TU-Eindhoven,2017,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Team#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," got a very enthusiastic response and they were happy to help us. He forwarded our mail to the person responsible for the model, Salman Rosen, and he send us some functions together with an explanation. The functions were a nice source of inspiration, but unfortunately we had to develop functions of our own.
May - New Insights
In the next period we had conversation with the modeling captains of the TU Eindhoven team of 2016 and 2015 and asked for their experience. We explained what we were thinking about and how we wanted to execute our plan and got some feedback as response. Furthermore, we were inspired by the course “Molecular Modeling” that let us simulate lipids by using a Atomistic Molecular Dynamics Simulation method. Here we had to apply Monte Carlo and Glauber dynamics, of which Monte Carlo also seemed to be useful for our designed constructs.
June - First Attempts
As the lab was preparing for the delivery of the gBlocks, we started with working out the formulas we wanted to use and developed our first model. The first model was based on concentration dependent reaction rates by using an ODE solver. Here we had to define all the possible reactions that could occur in the system. When looking critically to this method, it appeared to be insufficient, as it was impossible to define all the possible reactions.The second attempt included a Molecular Dynamics simulation based on Monte Carlo, followed by investigating the possibilities of a Gillespie algorithm.
July - 2D Glasses
After having some discussions with experts of the Gillespie algorithm, we could conclude that it had the same problem as the ODE solver. This meant we had to continue with expanding the Molecular Dynamics simulation. The first step was to define the molecules and let them move and rotate separately. Also all the other constraints and interaction between the molecules were added, leading to a simulations that showed network formation. The drawback was that it only was a 2D simulation, while in reality it will be in 3D. Additionally, the scale was too low and the constraints needed to many approximations to use it for a useful prediction and verification of the designed system. The simulation yielded a nice short movie, but we had to continue with searching for a different approach, which we found in the BioNetGen Language in combination with NFsim.
August - Virtual Reality
Every (coding) language is different and has its own way of functioning and needs certain requirements. We discovered that when we started with the installation of NFsim, advised by one of our supervisors. He himself hadn’t used it, but knew someone who did, and he needed to use Linux to get it functional. We"

MODEL
MODELLING
The evolution of our bacteria-phage dynamic model helped us gain a better understanding of the interaction between a bacteria population and a phage population and its impact on the viability of our design. After defining a variety of parameters and making several assumptions, we showed that it is possible for our system of bacteria and phages to be self-sustainable. Comparing our model with our experimental results, we developed a second model where we accounted for additional factors such as a possible mutation in the bacteria’s DNA that results in resistance against phage infection. Furthermore, we modelled the copper-binding efficiency of CUP I (our copper-binding protein) to estimate the optimal ratio of enzyme and copper concentrations that would result in the most efficient binding in the implementation of our system.
DISCRETE TIME MODEL
Purpose: Given an initial Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) and infection onset point (during a bacteria lifecycle), determine how the populations of bacteria and phages change over discrete time intervals.
Assumptions:
There is no delay in infection
All bacteria are susceptible to infection, and all infections are successful.
All bacteria death is caused by infection (i.e. there is no natural death)
Definitions of Parameters and Variables:
1. Multiplicity of Infection (MOI): The MOI represents the initial ratio between the number of phages and number of bacteria at the time of inoculation. It is a decisive factor in calculating the probability that a bacteria will be infected by at least one phage particle. The equation that relates the MOI to this probability is:
where P is the probability, and m represents the multiplicity of infection. Although it is possible that a bacterium is infected with more than one phage particles, a research study conducted by Ellis and Delbruck suggests that bacteria infected with multiple phage particles had similar burst sizes than bacteria that were infected with only one phage.
2. Burst Size: the number of phages produced per infected bacteria.
3. Lysis Time:  the time it takes for a phage to infect and lyse a bacteria host.
Both the burst size and the lysis time depend on the point during a bacteria lifecycle when inoculation begins. One research study conducted by Zachary Storms and Tobin Brown shows how the"

Promoter Assay
Title: Promoter assay for Timp1 and Steap4 promoters in reactive astrocytes.
Conducted by: Nitzan Keidar and Mor Sela
Date: 24.9.18-28.9.18
Aim: Our goal in this experiment is to assess the strength and the specificity of the promoters Timp1 and Steap4 by quantifying the amount of luminescence produced by the Luciferase enzyme cloned downstream of these promoters, under our experimental conditions.
Importance: Our project is based on the assumption that reactive astrocytes can be targeted based on specific genetic markers (e.g Timp1 and Steap4). Non-specific expression can lead to off target activity such as healthy resting astrocytes, microglia or other neighboring brain cells.
Experiment 1: Promoter assay pTIMP1 and pSTEAP4 in reactive astrocyte cell line (C8D30).

Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#Applications_-_-_TEXT.html," it is produced in bioreactors from sucrose and other sugars derived from plant biomass. P(3HB) can also be produced in the stems of plants, however this requires large inputs of fertiliser and large areas of land for crop growth. Interest in the production from the fermentation of organic waste materials is increasing. P(3HB) and related polymers are being investigated for uses in many things from food packaging to discount cards to replacements for current plastics. Extensive research is taking place into the properties of blends of different bioplastic polymers.
Polylactic acid
Poly(lactic acid) production is usually a chemical process, building up the monomers of lactic acid or lactide. It can also be produced by certain organisms. Biological systems of PLA production are also possible. This is what our collaborators at Yale are working on. PLA already sees use in the packaging industry and plastic bottles. Future uses as with many ‘biodegradable’ plastics will expand to include tasks where increased durability is needed (8) .
Bioplastic applications
Bioplastics, such as poly-3-hydroxybutyrate and poly(lactic acid) can be processed in very similar ways to petrochemical plastics such as injection moulding, extrusion and thermoforming. To improve their tensile strength, bioplastic polymers can be blended or electrospun with their co-polymers or with other polymers. These bioplastics can also be 3D printed with.  The most exciting property of these bioplastics is that they are very biocompatible, as they break down into monomers that are normally found in the body and environment. They are, therefore, ideal for medical applications. Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate has been used to make devices such as surgical meshes, sutures, screws & plates for bone fixation, cardiovascular patches, nerve guides, periodontal membranes, wound dressings and microcapsules for drug delivery.

This shows a SEM micrograph of the P(3HB)/PHB-co-PHV mesh fibre seeded with human stem cells.  This work demonstrates how P(3HB) and other similar bioplastics are great materials for bioscaffolds, as they provide enhanced vascularisation for the developing tissue.
Bioplastics are certainly fantastic materials, with many desirable properties and possible applications. In the"

During the allergic response, the concentration of histamine in the extracellular fluid of the nasal cavity increases. To initiate a response; therefore, a histamine sensor is necessary.
Because natural histamine receptors exist only in eukaryotic cells as G-coupled protein receptors, they are unusable for our prokaryotic system. Therefore we have set out to engineer our own receptor. This novel receptor will sense extracellular concentrations of histamine and initiate an intracellular cascade, signaling cells to respond appropriately to the increase in histamine concentration.
To engineer a novel histamine receptor, we are mutating two existing prokaryotic chemoreceptors so that they bind histamine rather than their wild type ligands.
Re-engineering Chemoreceptor #1: Ribose Binding Protein
We modified ribose binding protein (RBP), which normally binds ribose in the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli, to bind histamine. Our computational approach to accomplish this task was modeled after that taken in Looger, et al., ""Computational design of receptor and  sensor proteins with novel functions"", Nature (2003). Using Rosetta macromolecular modeling software, we modified the program's existing Enzyme Design Function (such as that used in Röthlisberger, et al ""Kemp elimination catalysts by computational enzyme design"", Nature (2008)) to enable the re-design of RBP, a non-enzymatic protein. The successful modification of RBP would result in its ability to bind histamine.
The native E. coli ribose-binding protein
Protein design:
1) Took the PDB file for the crystal structure of RBP cocrystallized with ribose (2DRI). Removed water molecules and added missing hydrogens.
2) Used UCSF Chimera to geometrically search for all van der Waals interactions between ribose and RBP in the crystal structure. Identified the amino acids responsible for these interactions as those most likely present in the ligand binding pocket of RBP.
3) Used UCSF Chimera to mutate all the identified residues in RBP"

Then we used centrifuge to make them separated at 4 centigrade (In this temperature, we can prevent protein from denaturation for a little longer time) at the speed of 3500rpm (8000g and 3500rpm both worked) working for 10 minutes. We got the lower phase, and it contains our target protein. We did this twice in order to increase the purity of our target proteins. We used technology of SDS-PAGE to test if this system works.

Results of this experiment
Figure 3. In this picture of gel, the first lane is the original solution of protein. We can see that it contains many other proteins. The second lane is the lower phase (water phase), we can see that the target protein have been removed and some bulk proteins stay in the water phase. The third and fourth lane are the water phase got in the reverse extraction. We can see that the target proteins have been concentrated and some other proteins have been removed.
Figure 4. This picture was shot in ultraviolet, we can see clearly that our target protein stay in the detergent phase because of the blue fluorescence.
Figure 5. We used Bandscan5.0 to analysis the gel. We can see that target proteins have been purified by ATPS. In this process, other proteins stay in the water phase and our target protein stay in the detergent phase. When extracted by saturated butanol, target protein was concentrated in the water phase. The picture of gel shows that when used it twice, the purity will increase again
We calculated the efficiency of this experiment. It is 67.54% in the twice and fourth lane and 75.06% in the fourth and fifth lane. The efficiency of it is high to some degree, but we want get a higher separation rate and increase the purity of our target protein. In our next experiment, we used many buffer and different detergent to achieve it.

The DIY-BrewKit
The Motivation
We want to introduce a whole new group of people to the DIYBio community using the exciting products of synthetic biology. The DIYBio community is still a nascent one, and we believe it has the potential to become a big thing (hopefully a really big thing). The SynBio Brewery DIY Brew Kit is therefore designed to get members of the home-brewing and micro-brewing community interested in DIYBio and synthetic biology - who better to get involved, than people that are already familiar with manipulating biology to do their bidding?
Our project is not about increasing crop yield or increasing shelf life of crops. We are trying to make synthetic biology and genetic modification easy to understand by making the changes  ""easy to see"" in the product. We believe that without given the opportunity to learn what synbio is all about - the public wouldn't be able to decide whether they want to use this technology in the future or not. We aimed to involve the public in synthetic biology in a fun and engaging in way!
What is the Synbio Brewery DIY-Brewkit
The SynBio Brewery DIY-Brewkit is a package containing everything an established home-brewer or micro-brewer needs to start making beer with a synbio twist. Each basic package contains six GM brewing yeast strains - each of which adds one novel property to the beer brewed with it. We hope brewers will start to experiment with different combinations and quantities of our yeast strains to produce truly unique beers. Each kit also contains a simple explanation of what each strain does and the science behind it as well as resources to help the brewers dig deeper into how to go about making new strains themselves as DIY-biologists. More about the design of the kit.

The Strains
We have designed a number of strains as a starting point for the yeast library that brewers can use to easily enhance the flavour, smell, colour and nutritional content of their beer:
Miraculin expression
Miraculin is a protein found naturally in the fruits of the Miracle Berry plant Synsepalum dulcificum and has been found to make sour foods taste sweeter. The taste altering property of Miraculin therefore means it has potential use as an artificial sweetener and makes for a healthier alternative to natural sugars found in most products.

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Safty_-_-_TEXT.html," the mating switcher can be presented in kinds of yeast with different forms. This proves that our Mating switcher is fast, flexible and efficient.
Meantime, we cultured the transformed yeast in several 5mL liquid SC-Leu at 30℃ and 220 rpm for 12 hours ( Take three samples at a time). We used one sample for centrifugation to precipitate the yeast and the remaining two remained unchanged. The difference is the fluorescence value we need, then we calculated the value of average them. The excitation wavelength is set at 540nm and the emission wavelength is set at 635nm. Hereafters, we measured the yeast concentration at OD600. At last, we divided the fluorescence value by OD600 to normalize the value and the result data is as follows.
Fig 2-9. Normalized fluorescence value was calculated by dividing fluorescent value by cell concentration(OD600)
Fig.2-9 Normalized fluorescence value was calculated by dividing fluorescent value by cell concentration(OD600)
From the data we can find that the successful transformation of the yeasts' fluorescence intensity is more than twice that of the wild type, there was low red fluorescence was detected after mating, which was considered the influence of β-carotene.
DISCUSSION & FUTURE WORK
Our mating switch plays an important role in many respects, such as including heavy metal treatment and cell signal switching. And we created a novel method to prove the effectiveness of the switch in an intuitive and effective way. The terminator of the first part (PVUVC) terminates the expression of the downstream gene, proving the validity of the switcher, and the second part (PVRVC) creates an evident method of color conversion to determine the state of the switcher.
Aiming to increase the Vika-vox system efficiency, we let Vika enzyme saturate expression, but the efficiency was still relatively low. We hypothesized that this phenomenon was caused by degradation of the Vika enzyme in the YPD culture medium. We’d better change the composition or proportion of YPD ingredients to find out the best culture conditions. We are looking forward to more research in this field so that we can make this system work better and even perfectly.
We use the RFP as the reporting protein. But there exists a drawback that it’s detected with an expensive device. A more intuitive reporting strategy need to be developed, maybe it can be seen by bare eyes like E.coli in the near future.

The world with Edible coli
The design of our system. Hunger and malnutrition all over the world must be stopped - every single child as well as every single man and woman should have access to sufficient amounts of carbohydrates, fats and proteins.  To achieve this aim, we designed Edible coli - the untapped food resource of the century.
Edible coli is an edible nonpathogenic bacteria that produces all the essential and nonessential amino acids in proper ratios, as well as ω3- and ω6 fatty acids. In addition to this it tastes delicious with a touch of lemon.
We wanted to design a new food source, that can cover the daily needs for both under- and malnourished  people all over the world. As mentioned in ""Facts and Statistics"" these people mostly lack proteins and fats,  which is why Edible coli became a protein and fat producing bacterium.
The protein that Edible coli produce contains all the essential amino acids in the right ratio recommended  by WHO, Source: WHO/ FAO/ UNU Expert Consultation: Protein and Amino Acid Requirements in Human Nutrition, 2002. Vol. 935. as well as all the nonessential amino acids. In this way Edible coli can also be a great supplement for vegans and vegetarians, as well as for pregnant women,"

Research and Development
In order to develop our flagship product as well as further generations of the system, our research and development group will require individuals with backgrounds in a diverse array of scientific disciplines. For work on the biosensor component of the system, personnel with expertise in biochemistry, genetics, and microbiology will be required. Expertise will also be required in the fields of electrochemistry and analytical chemistry in order to continue work and development on the output of the system. Our team has extensive formal training and experience in these areas which will facilitate the development of this aspect of the technology.
Individuals with expertise in the fields of chemical, software, and hardware engineering will be required in order to develop the field-portable prototype device and the data transmission, management, and processing components of the system. As such, after the first research and development milestones are achieved, it will be necessary to bring on individuals with these skill sets in order to compliment our existing technical knowledge. During the initial stages of product development, our Chief Technical Officers, Robert Mayall and Maggie Renaud-Young will take the lead. Over the three years of our financial plan, we have budgeted to bring on additional individuals as skill sets are needed; namely an additional geneticist and electrochemisty in 2014 as well as an electrical engineer and a software engineer in 2015. These positions will all be compensated with salary, as outlined in the budget. As for all hired employees, we will target young, bright, recent graduates with demonstrated proficiency in order to keep costs affordable during our first five years.
Production and Quality Assurance
Once the development of our technology is further along, we will need to obtain skill sets in quality control and manufacturing. In order to develop our prototype and products, we have established a partnership with a group with expertise in manufacturing and industrial design here in Alberta: ACAMP. A not-for profit group, ACAMP is well established with a mandate of helping small technology-based businesses overcome hurdles related to manufacturing and quality assurance. As such, ACAMP will help design and implement the production strategy for our product. We feel that a strong partnership with ACAMP will help to ensure that our product will be developed in a cost effective manner and still meet the needs of our customers. Additionally, it will allow us to focus on other aspects of the business as the founding members so not have substantial experience in manufacturing design and operations. Our research and development team will work closely with the manufacturing team, in order to ensure that the required product specifications are incorporated into the final"

Santa_Clara,2015,Team:Santa Clara#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," tremendous amount of energy and involves working in a variety of different fields. As demonstrated by our survey, aside from a capstone senior design project or research thesis, few science and engineering curriculums provide opportunities for students to obtain the skill set required for organizing their research into a an ongoing commercializable project and pursing the relationships with technical advisors, financiers, and other entrepreneurs they need to succeed. As a result, many students with the time, passion, and technical capacity to develop technologies to improve man kind lack the ability to breathe credibility and legitimacy into their projects by writing a business plan and developing formal research milestones. This in turn impacts their ability to recruit fellow students to collaborate with in lab and find mentors and investors in the community. As a result, most student groups rely on the organizational framework of iGEM student groups to develop technology for the competition but struggle to develop infrastructure for continuing to develop their ideas after the competition. This is unacceptable because giving students opportunities to apply technology in ways that solve real world problems provides the best preparation for professional life and the industries and societies of the world have an acute need for technologies which make life cleaner, less resource intensive, and more sustainable.
Our project seeks to encourage student groups to continue developing the technology they created for iGEM by presenting the student research collaborative. This entity is an organizational solution for student groups that have an idea they would like to research, but have not developed it enough to invest in a full fledged startup operation.
Case study 1
Anaerobe Systems is a company that specializes in finding ways to maximize anaerobic culture techniques and is also the only company in the United States that produces the only true Pre-Reduced Anaerobically Sterilized (PRAS) plated and tubed culture media. After connecting with Mike Cox, the CEO of Anaerobe Systems, students from Santa Clara University’s iGEM team analyzed the fermentors utilized by Anaerobe Systems to degrade organic waste and realized there was room for improvement.
The primary issue that the Santa Clara University iGEM team identified was the constant acidification of the culture which compromises cell vitality.  Anaerobe Systems adds a large amount of base to neutralize the acid but this process greatly damages the cells and slows the growth kinetics, while also adding extra costs.
Therefore, Santa Clara’s University’s iGEM team set out to create a system that will allow the cells to be able to survive in the increased acidity so that no or, at the very least, less base will need to be added. This new system could hypothetically lower operation costs while also decreasing culture run"

Stefan - Hardware Manager
As the Hardware Manager of this project my task was to gain an overview of current bioprinting literature in order to design and lead the experiments in the wetlab connected to our prototype. This included identifying relevant parameters and continuously optimizing the conditions under which we could achieve the best results with our prototype 3D printer using bacterial bioink. The printer prototype itself was built by Samantha, Anne and Marit. Characterisation of movement and performance was my task again. In the design phase I was largely involved in developing the project idea and designing the biobricks required to meet our goals. Following this, I mostly spent my time in the wetlab working on the Interlab Study and cloning the devices for our biobricks. Finally I was partly involved in modeling and policy and practice, but most credit must be attributed to other team members there.
Michelle - Policy and Practice Manager
As the Policy and Practice manager I was responsible for finding all interesting applications for our project. For the data collection, required for the “Business Plan” and “Expert’s opinion”, I searched for, contacted and interviewed researchers, scientists and managers. I really enjoyed working with Tudor writing all the content on the Policy & Practice part. Furthermore, I was responsible for organizing our stand during ‘A Day of Wonder’, the business case and designing the workshop for the Science Centre Delft. During the RIVM/Rathenau event, Max and I presented and discussed our project. Next to this, I was responsible for the idea and design of the P&P tool and for setting up the P&P collaborations. I supported Marit also with PR activities, such as talking with the press advisors of the TU Delft and the communication advisor of our faculty. Additionally, I have helped with the financials and lab journal reporting, although most credits go to fellow team members.
Tudor - Wiki Manager
Designed and supervised how the wiki was built. Helped Liana with implementing website functionality, layout and adding content. Based on literature review, market analysis and data collection (questionnaires and interviews), wrote the “Business plan” and “How to write a business plan” sections. Helped with designing questionnaires and sending them out to researchers, scientists and managers, and contributed to analyzing responses. Helped Michelle with policy and practice efforts and wiki content writing, including ethics, regulations, outreach and overview.

5)Transgenes are expressed in the germline at high frequency.
How to get the worms?
As a classic model organism, C. elegans has many advantages.It is one of the simplest organisms with a nervous system. Research has explored the neural and molecular mechanisms that control several behaviors of C. elegans, including chemotaxis, thermotaxis, mechanotransduction, learning, memory, and mating behaviour. Therefore, C. elegans is a suitable model organism which we can easily manipulate and observe.
In our program, we aim to change the physical behaviour of C. elegans by using the two specific optogenetic traits. Through microinjection and selection, we are able to get two strains with two phenotypes of the preference to blue light and the aversion to red light, and the next step is to obtain the single worm with the combination of these 2 different traits.
To achive our objectives, we choose a mating method, because it is less time-consuming and easier to operate than microinjecting the other array to the existed strain.
In general, mating is the pairing of either opposite-sex or hermaphroditic organisms. However, for C. elegans, mating can hybridize two different traits on the next generation by the paring of the hermaphrodite and the male. Besides, one of the greatest advantages of C. elegans is that it can either autocopulation or hybridization, which means that after hybridization, the hermaphrodite can self-fertilize and guarantee to produce a large number of offsprings with identical genetic characteristics.
Here is the mating procedures:
1.Heat shock to get males(30℃,8h).
2.Parents mating to get the first filial hybrid generation(female : male = 3 : 4).
3.Single out each hermaphrodite in a small plate.
4.Test the fluorescence of F1.
5.Single out F1 and self-fertilizing to get F2.
6.Test the fluorescence of F2.

Science Generated Fashion - Malene
Reported by Thomas
Departing the bus near South Tottenham Station, North London, Cassie and I were walking into an industrial area consisting mainly of piles of tires, half torn down warehouses and the odd metalworker and mechanic. We weren’t expecting this on our trip to a designer-studio, but we weren’t about to meet an ordinary artist.  Malene Oddershede Bach is a rather exotic fashion designer.  Her distinct prints are described as articulate and intellectual. Apart from features in Vogue, ELLE, Marie Claire and Grazia the award winning artist (‘Ones to watch’) has acquired a loyal industry fan-base on her professional journey. Born in Denmark, she chose to live in the UK, successfully designing and marketing her collections.
She struggles a little moving the heavy metal-gate leading to her overgrown courtyard which unexpectedly is speckled with flowers and greens, and a fruiting hawthorn at the back and the morning sun remember of the British country side rather than on an industrial site in London. She leads us into her studio which is covered with prints and samples of her work – designer dresses, handbags and various other accessories.
Here prints are inspired by nature she says, pointing at a piece of fabric with a print of red blobs on black background. “These are sun dried tomatoes and these are the cells of the intestines of a rat” she moves on, showing us two dresses from her collection recent collection. Made from images taken from various sources, she creates repeatable patterns on the computer which are printed onto the fabrics for her designs. Her designs remind me of autumn-leaves and fireworks, not dried tomatoes and cancer cells. After we sat down and discussed the design of the team t-shirt for the iGEM competition (which she is going produce), we explained that our work is aimed at stem-cell research and therapy, she got very interested: “Looking at the potential treatments stem cell therapy offers, it could be a very useful tool in future.” Stem cells have the ability to develop into any cell required. “I like this ‘bottom-up design’ approach”; starting from an image (for example a fluorescent image of mKeima ☺) she works the whole process from designing to marketing.
Malene pointed out that she is marketing"

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportBiosafetyBiosecurity_-_-_TEXT.html," complexity of the reality of human relationship, forms of exchange, discourses, etc. I think the Steve Kurtz case has to remind us that boundaries between scientific and uninitiated fields, interests and motivations, identities have to be considered as complex and moving. In that perspective, we can focus on how human networks expressed themselves with more fluidity than every procedure previously described. As mentioned, human connections, confidence or even friendship between people blur the picture we've tried to draw of the academic world. In fact, human connection and motivation are complex and unpredictable too and even if the MTA existed between Pittsburgh University and ATTC, it doesn't prevent Kerrel from giving bacteria to Kurtz, because of friendship or any other motivations. We also have to notice that the gap between academics and uninitiated persons seems blurred too, numerous kind of links and connections exist between all the social actors, leading to numerous kind of material and informational exchanges or practices.
I wanted to use this biosecurity case to show how it is possible and rich to use ethical approaches to learn about how people are related in science, now understood as a complex social world. That complexity, now visible and in a feedback loop, has to be taken into account in our ethical process, notably about certain proposals that now can appear to us oversmoothed regarding social reality of how synthetic biology, and life science in general can be actually practiced.

Chromoprotein Constructs
Design
Aim of the construct
Chromoproteins represent ideal reporter genes. Unlike fluorescent protein, from which chromoproteins were originally derived, they require no specialised optical equipment for detection. Our aim is to use a selection of such proteins, donated by the iGEM 2012 Uppsala team, as our most basic and main output in regards to the Marchantia framework.
We decided to test the following chromoprotein constructs:
35s - eforRed - nosT
35s - eforRed - N7 - nosT
35s - amilCP - N7 - nosT
35s - tsPurple - nosT
35s - tsPurple - N7 - nosT
35s - asPink - N7 - nosT
35s - aeBlue - N7 - nosT
By expressing the chromoproteins in the pGreen vector with the 35s promoter and the nosT terminator, we control for the possiblity of the promoter/terminator not functioning in our chassis.
The N7 fragment allows for the selected constructs to localise chromoprotein to the nucleus. It is believed by Bernardo Pollak that this may end up increasing the likelihood of detecting the chromoproteins with the naked eye.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

Adding Biobricks to the Parts Library of Shanghaitech
We provided our three promoter parts constructed this year for Shanghaitech, helping to build up their parts library of input and output biobricks. Shanghaitech is aiming at creating an intercellular connection between bacteria containing different input/output circuits. We are looking forward to more data showing the performance of our input elements working with their system.

Offering Biobricks to RDFZ-China
Biobricks to an iGEM project is like bricks to a skyscraper, without which a project cannot even start. This is why when RDFZ-China asked us for some essential biobricks, we offered without hesitation. This year, RDFZ-China is paying attention to helping solve the petroleum leakage issue in the soil. Rather awesome!

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Following this part is our modified PET-ase part that was originally the construct used by the Tianjin IGEM team. PET-ase is the construct that is used to degrade PET plastic, but we are using it for its binding properties to PET plastic. Finally, we the other transcription terminator which cuts off the whole process.
BBa_K2650004: BslA
Our final DNA construct is essentially the same as our first construct with the exception of BsIA (BBa_K2650004) included in this construct. The construct starts off with the first transcription terminator followed by the B.subtilis promoter and the ribosome binding site and the SSLipA secretion tag. Following this is the composite part BsIA. The BsIA is essentially a hydrophobin. Its reason for being in the construct is to act as an adhesive of binding protein to ensure that our construct binds with the PET plastic. Also, it helps enhance the PET-ase enzyme to stick to plastic more effectively as well. Following the BsIA is the second transcription terminator to ensure this process stops. It should also be noted the Bacillus Subtilis, the bacteria in which our DNA will be secreted in naturally produces hydrophobins as well.

Kyoto,2012,Team:Kyoto#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," compared the relative RNA expression of each gene. However, there was not significant difference between experimental group and negative control.
Checking FT protein purification by Western Blotting
We could not confirm FT function though enough quality of RNA was extracted. Therefore, we questioned about FT protein quality, and performed western blotting to confirm FT protein is successfully purified.
Unfortunately, the band of FT was not detected. Because of the time shortage, we could not conduct further experiment. We have to reconsider about FT purification and now we are trying.
Achievement
1.Expression
Mutate FT sequence
Standardize FT as an iGEM part
Confirm expression of FT protein in E.coli
2.Secretion
Modify TorA signal to be easy to use the signal more
Construct Tat secretion cassette that contains Constitutive promoter, RBS, TatABC, pspA, double terminator
Standardize kil gene
Multiply TatABC in order to strengthen Tat secretion system--not yet
3.Penetration
Keep GFP in or around plant cells using R9 peptide
Introduce FT in plant cells using R9 peptide--not yet
4.Activation
Get high quality of RNA
Amplify genes successfully
Check the function of FT--not yet
At PENETRATION step, GFP::R9 fusion protein connected at GFP’s N-terminal was not expressed. However, if GFP is tagged with R9 at C-terminal, that fusion protein may be successfully expressed. This is because there is an example where proteins tagged with arginine at C- terminals were correctly expressed whereas proteins tagged at N-terminals were not( BBa_K249005 ). By using GFP::R9 fusion protein connected at GFP's C-terminal, we might improve the efficiency of macropinocytos, a type of endocytosis.
At Activation, in order to see whether FT is usable or not, we measured the relative RNA expression of FUL and SEP3 by qPCR. However, there was not any significant difference between experimental group and negative control. We found that FT was not successfully purified and there is the room for improvement in that. In addition of this, several reasons can be considered.  The cause of failure may be that FT protein was not active or decomposed in the cell or even that FT protein didn't enter plant cells. If we perform Western blotting of FT in plant cell after putting FT into it with R9, we will be able to understand whether the problem was FT protein or R9 peptides.
If the cause was that our FT protein was not active though FT had entered the cell, FT will be confirmed."

Afterwards, 750 μl Buffer PE were added, incubated for 2-3 minutes and centrifuged for 1 min at 3800 x g (6000 rpm). Flow-through was discarded and the column placed back into the collection tube. The column was centrifuged for an additional 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm) to remove residual buffer. Finally, the column was put into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and 20-30 μl water (55°C) was added to the center. After 1 minute incubation the sample was centrifuged for 1 minute at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm). The 1.5 ml tube now contained the eluted and purified DNA.
Purification of PCR products
To purify PCR products the QIAquick® PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) was used. Therefore, all solutions were prepared as recommended by the manufacturer. Five volumes of buffer PB were added to 1 volume of the PCR reaction before mixing. Since no changes in color were observed the pH was not adjusted. A QIAquick column was put into a vacuum manifold and the sample was decanted to it for binding the DNA. Vacuum was applied until all liquid residues were drawn through the column. Afterwards 750 μl buffer PE were added to wash the column and vacuum applied. Te remove residual wash buffer the QIAquick column was put into the provided 2 ml collection tube and centrifuged for 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm). Finally, the column was put into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and 20 ml water (55°C) were added to the center to elute the DNA. After 1 minute incubation the tube containing the column was centrifuged for 1 minute. The microcentrifuge tube now contained the eluted DNA.
For small amounts of DNA PCR products (cleanup of up to 5 μg PCR product (70 bp to 4 kb)) the MinElute® PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) was used. All steps were conducted and solutions prepared as specified in the protocol. Five volumes of buffer PB were added to 1 volume of the PCR reaction and mixed. Since no changes in color were observed the pH was not adjusted. A MinElute column was put into a vacuum manifold and the sample was decanted to it for binding the DNA.

Dr. Kyle Watters
P.h.D
In the Doudna Lab, Kyle began by winning a grant in conjunction with labs from UCSF and Sandia National Labs as part of the DARPA SafeGenes program. As part of this effort, Kyle is researching new methods to discover anti-CRISPR proteins which has culminated in a paper in Science describing three new anti-CRISPR proteins capable of inhibiting Cas12a. He continues to search for additional anti-CRISPRs and study their mechanisms of action. With the help of Ask a Scientist program from innovative genomics institute  (IGI) , iGEM team was matched with Kyle who took time to mentor us throughout the project. iGEM CMUQ team met with Kyle over skype and communicated via email to discuss and confirm our gRNA sequences and to share the idea of our project as whole. We gained invaluable insight and tips from his expertise in Cas12a and CRISPR in general. Website.
Dr. Anan Haffar
American Board Certified Pediatric.  Specialist in Immunology and infectious diseases
The interview gave us significant insight on how unaware people in the region are of genetic diseases and an overview of the degree of relative consanguinity. We also learnt that there are very few laboratories, and almost no hospital that conduct neonates genetic screening. Hence, many suffer from symptoms for so long without knowing the underlying reason. For more details check the write-up.
Dr. Jason Ford
American Board Certified Pediatric.  Division Chief of Hematopathology at Sidra Medicine in Doha, Qatar, and Associate Professor of Clinical Pathology & Laboratory Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine – Qatar
The 45-min long interview with Dr. Jason served as our baseline for the project this year. We were given an insight on the current methods and tests to detect sickle cell anemia carriers (as well as SCA in babies, where the phenotype is often not present). The statistics from his experience as a practitioner in Sidra medicine further enhanced the purpose of our project and the need for a field-ready, non-invasive and affordable genetic (and bedside) screening. check the interview.

As fluorescence is proportional to the amount of ROS  being produced, up regulation of native E. coli enzymes that mitigate the effects of ROS may be the cause of the increase  in cell survival. Future transcriptome analysis could provide interesting data on the mechanism of this change, this was  unfortunately beyond the scope of this project. This shows that there may be many ways for bacteria to circumvent the effects of a kill switch given the high selection pressure they pose.
Enzymatic Kill Switch: Lysozyme
The Enzcheck fluorescence assay used to determine lysozyme activity produced values that were not consistent  with the CFU count of the plated sample. The HGT experiment we conducted showed that 50 µl of 500 U/ml lysozyme C normally  used in the EnzCheck assay to produce a standard curve would effectively kill all the cells in a 50 µl sample of DH5α.   The assay showed that 20x diluted sample produced near 500 U/ml activity readings yet this culture would still produce   a lawn of bacteria when 200 µl was spread plated. It is noted that the standard curve was of poor quality.   The samples of lysozyme were assayed in the same way after continuous culture and did show a decrease in lysozyme activity over time, however the original readings that were used as a comparison have an error of sufficient size that this is not conclusive.   The CFU count for lysozyme showed no difference from the control. Lysozyme added to a sample extra-cellularly was shown to   lyse all the cells in our HGT experiment, even though Gram-negative bacteria are partially protected from its action due to   their outer membrane (Callewaert, 2008). Yet lysozyme produced intra-cellularly and targeted to the periplasm was not   effective. There may have been issues with translocation of the protein to the target area, however this seems unlikely   due to the effectiveness of its extracellular action. Another explanation may be that lysozyme as a kill switch mechanism   is inherently ineffective, as any cells that are resistant will proliferate and a population that are not affected by its  production very quickly develops. Regardless of the ability of lysozyme to kill cells effectively, we have shown that HGT  is a concern with using this form of kill switch; antibiotic resistance markers commonly used in synthetic biology can be   transferred to a different strain of E. coli and in principle any wild type organisms outside the lab. Therefore kill switches that"

In this case, the equation for node <math>B</math> generates the condition under which the steady-state value <math> B^*</math> would be proportional to <math>A^*</math>: the first term in <math>dB/dt</math> equation should depend on <math>A</math> only and the second term on <math>B</math> only. The condition can be satisfied if the first term is in the saturated region region
<math>((1-B)\gg K_{AB})</math>
and the second in the linear region
<math>B\ll K_{F_{B}B}^{^{\prime }}</math>,
leading to
<math>\begin{align} B^{\ast }=A^{\ast }\cdot k_{AB}K_{F_{B}B}^{^{\prime }}/(F_{B}k_{F_{B}B}^{^{\prime }}) \\ \end{align}\,\!</math>
This relationship, established by the equation for node <math>B</math>, shows that the steady-state concentration of active <math>B</math> is proportional to the steady-state concentration of active <math>A</math>. Thus <math>B</math> will negatively regulate <math>C</math> in proportion to the degree of pathway input. This effect of <math>B</math> acting as a proportioner node of <math>A</math> can be graphically gleaned from the plot of the <math>B</math> and <math>C</math> nullclines (Figure feedforward). In this case, maintaining a constant <math>C^{\ast }</math> requires the B nullcline to move the same distance as the <math>C</math> nullcline in response to an input change. Here again, the sensitivity of the circuit (the magnitude of the transient response) depends on the ratio of the speeds of the two signal transduction branches:
<math> A\longrightarrow C</math>
and
<math>A\longrightarrow B-|C</math>,
which can be independently tunedfrom the adaptation precision.

All this considered, responsible science should reject the technological imperative: the mere fact that something new can be done does not mean that it ought to be done. Nonetheless, we believe that our project can have a great deal of positive impacts on the environment, society, economy and science, thereby outweighing the risks.
Survey Analysis
Following our meetings with François and Dr Sénéchal, we realized that we could not have a truly objective opinion only by interviewing two individuals. We concluded that it would be best to conduct a survey in order to obtain the opinion of a larger public to answer our questions.
The majority of respondents are undergraduates from Canada and Europe and are millennials.
Most of them have a high level of knowledge in biology and connected fields. This answer was expected since the survey was mainly shared on the social media pages of the members of our team and sent out to other iGEM teams. However, we were glad to see that there was still a considerable portion of the respondents who only have a basic knowledge in biology because we constructed our survey in order to educate people about synthetic biology.
Of all respondents, about 80% already knew before taking this survey that adrenaline was an essential medicine, even if only 56% knew at least one person who owns an EpiPen® (including themselves). Less than 10% thought that adrenaline is only used in EpiPen® to treat allergic reactions or did not know what it is used for.
Biological VS Chemical
At the beginning of our survey, before giving any information on biological and chemical synthesis, we asked respondents what they would prefer between adrenaline synthesized biologically and chemically.
At first, most people answered that they had no preference as in both cases the molecule is the same and in times of need they would not mind which one they are injected with.
After the survey, some people found out that they were wrong about what “biologically made” means and realized that it is not as natural as they thought. Therefore, they switched for “No preference” instead of “Biological” since they felt that they needed more proof that synthetic biology is safe for the health and environment.
On the contrary, some people who first answered “No preference” switched for “Biological” as they realized that synthetic biology can have many advantages.
No significant changes were observed within the other two categories.
Our survey had an important impact on our respondents’ opinions. Some learned about potential benefits they did not know about and some were not convinced of the safety aspects, but in the end they all learned something about synthetic biology and maybe we piqued their"

Problem: Fluorescence was measured every 10 minutes while measurement of Absorbance occured only every 100 minutes. This led to spikes in the diagram.

Cloning
To be able to test the optogenetical AND-Gate in CP919, we need to transform the desired reporter part into a low copy vector. Therefore, BBa_ I746907 will be ligated into pSB6A1.
Digest
The following digest was performed:
After this, the samples were separated by electrophoresis using a preparative 1 % agarose gel. The correct gel bands were cut out on the transilluminator at 365 nm (keep irradiation time as short as possible). After this, the following photo was recorded:
The bands match the expectations.
Samples - : The cut out band around 4 kb is the cut vector pSB6A1, which is 4022 bp long. The band visible at around 1 kb is the RFP coding sequence (1069 bp).
Samples - : Part I746907 is 924 bp long. This corresponds to the cut out bands. The vector pSB1A2 can be seen at 2 kb (it is 2079 bp long).

Samira:
Do you know whether there are any laws for using GMOs in Malawi?
Prof. Kalua:
Yes, there are very strict laws. If you mention in any study „genes“, you get a lot of rules. […] As long is it has a rapid turn-over of samples in the lab it’s fine, because when we are collecting the samples we collect close to 8000 samples a day. That’s why we end up freezing them and store them for many months. But we can’t let the patients wait, so we treat the patients and then a year later we find out it was not chlamydia. You know it’s too late. So if somebody would have at least a test that would take even a week [but have high throughput]. All the current tests – for example extracting the DNA – it takes time. […] The specimens we collected last year, they are all frozen. And even if we ship them to the US, they still say they need 6 months to look at the specimens. So that’s why I say it’s encouraging. People are trying [to develop] rapid tests.
Daniel C.:
We are still trying different reporter systems. Some take a few minutes, others take up to an hour. But it still is much faster and also cheap. We can grow the bacteria unlimited and these [microfluidic] devices are not expensive. They go for 10 [Euro]cents a piece.
Prof. Kalua:
Yes. How much work has been done into this device?
Daniel C.:
We are almost finished. We should have finished, until we went to Africa but in the lab not always everything goes according to plan.
Prof. Kalua:
I would like to ask you about the epidemiologies, the sensitivity/specificity of the test.
Daniel C.:
We weren’t able to validate yet.
Prof. Kalua:
One of the questions I would like to ask is if the test would be specific for chlamydia or react with other bacteria.
Daniel C.:
Yeah, so that’s actually something that we have to look into. The target of chlamydia – other bacterias have it too, but they build it into the cell-wall. So we can’t for example use urine samples, because the microbiome in the gut. The [bacteria] get degraded and then you have the degraded bacteria in your urine, so you also have a lot of the mDAP, the target in your urine. So [the test] would"
British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#Human Practices#Industry_-_-_TEXT.html,"drotreater at Chevron Burnaby treats 18000 barrels of diesel fuel every day, removing 99.5% of the sulfur and taking it from around 500 ppm to less than 15 ppm sulfur at a cost of about $2 per barrel.
Sulfur content in fuel is regulated by governments because sulfur-containing fuels lead to acid rain. As time has gone on, the permitted sulfur content has decreased. The kinetics of conventional hydrotreatment cause the cost of treating 100 ppm sulfur fuel down to 15 ppm to require more extreme process conditions and thus be substantially more expensive than treating 500 ppm sulfur fuel to 100 ppm.
From our correspondence with AITF-OSLI, we learned:
In Alberta, upgrading and refining processes aim to reduce viscosity and desulfurize crude oil to facilitate transport by pipeline.
Presently, the industry does not possess infrastructure for the utilization of biological systems such as bioreactors or emulsifiers. However, this is an area of interest for them and could be implemented in a time span of approximately 5 years. There is also an interest in screening tailings ponds for new organisms or genes encoding parts capable of refining crude oil.
Our AITF and OSLI collaborators are currently looking into the economic and environmental costs of refining oil, as well as our project's potential impact on industry and applications other than desulfurization. They will get in touch with us within a few weeks once they have this information.
Biocatalytic desulfurization of dibenzothiophene: Hypothetical Bioreactor Design After talking with our industrial collaborators we had a good idea about what the industry was looking for in terms of bio-desulfurization. The next step was to devise a hypothetical design for a small scale bio-desulfurization plant. The general schematic of this plant can be found below (Diagram 1):

Tsinghua,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#fluid game_-_-_TEXT.html," you win this round. If you win three rounds, then congratulations, you win the game!
    OK, Let’s Begin to learn how to play it!
    Before each game begins, You can input the number of each bacteria.
    Then you can press “Start” to begin this game.
    Now, they begin to kill each other, and the number of them is displayed at the top.(The numbers are showed logarithmically. For example, when the length is 10, the number of bacteria is 1010. If you do not want to wait for too long, you can press ""Fast"" to accelerate the process)
    After each round, you can click the button ""OK"" to play the next round or you can click the button ""Quit"" to exit the game.
III Game strategy
    Although we cannot figure out exactly how the initial numbers determine the result, we do find out some rules. Here are some of them and hope that they can help you to win.
    Because farmers provide nutrients for both sides, they have no effect in each side in terms of nutrients. Farmers only play a role in counting the total number of bacteria. Take this into consideration when you are placing farmers.
    Warriors can attack enemy, which is beneficial for their own side.  When the number of our warriors is bigger than AI's, and the number of our beggars is less than AI's, we will be more likely to win. The mechanism of winning is that our bacteria will keep growing faster.
    Because beggars do not have any production, they grow the fastest. When the number of warriors of both sides is closer and the number of our beggars is bigger than AI's, we will be more likely to win. The mechanism of winning is that the number of our beggars will be far greater than AI's.

PhD student, Genoscope , Université d'Evry
After my bachelor in Bioinformatics, I did the Master Systems and Synthetic Biology at the University of Evry. During the master, William and I decided to create the iGEM Evry team in November 2011, quickly joined by Cyrille. One year after the iGEM Evry team (with 15 people) got 2 prices in Amsterdam (Best Model and Best Human Practices Advance) and was qualified for the final in Boston! Now I am beginning a PhD in environmental systems biology. I study the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose by Clostridium phytofermentans in the French Sequencing Center under the supervision of Andrew Tolonen .
Pierre Parutto
Master2 Bioinformatics and Modeling student - UPMC Paris
As a retired modeler of the 2012 Evry team, I accumulated some experience on how to build models for biological systems. After graduating from the engineering school EPITA and an internship in metabolic network modeling in the BioRetroSynth group, I decided to do a master in bioinformatics from the UPMC university. I followed this year's project because it provides interesting challenges with the use of different modeling methods(FBA, ODE, probabilitiy) at different scales - the same kind of problems we faced last year. As a good IGEM fellow"

Integrated Human Practices
From our initial idea, the design of our toehold switches and our model to the future applications of our project, the opinions of specialists have been vital in influencing our work.
Here, we have broken our project down into its different parts. For each, we explain the role feedback played in improving the aspect of the project, and why we changed what we did.

Dr Kirsten Jensen
Our initial constructs used a constitutive promoter. After cloning our construct in pSB1C3 plasmid, we attempted to amplify them in E. coli. However upon sequencing the amplified inserts, none of the sequences were what we expected to find.
We asked Dr Kirsten Jensen, an expert in synthetic biology at Imperial College London for advice. She inspected our sequences and suggested that the transcripts from our constructs were toxic to E. coli. She therefore suggested that we switch our promoter to an inducible promoter to avoid synthesis of the transcript during amplification in E. coli.
Following her advice, we used an arabinose inducible promoter, which resolved the issue for the 15b-5p switches and allowed us to continue with our experiments. However, the 27b-3p switches were still toxic.
See the results page for more details.

Dr Alex Green is an expert in the world of synthetic biology – and in particular toehold switches. He confirmed that our existing design should work and suggested looking into the design of his B-series of Zika virus toehold switches to improve our existing switches. We did so"
BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Engagement-Hande_-_-_TEXT.html,". Maybe when someday it becomes clearer, we ‘ll think about it.
Q: Now there are many companies in China synthesizing taxol, so which do you think gave you more pressure, domestic or abroad?
A: Mainly come from abroad. We faced more on global market. In the late 1970s, American started to extract taxol from natural materials. In 1990s, European extract 10-DAB from Taxus baccata, and 10-DAB can easily chemically synthesize to taxol. These technology are very mature in Japan, India, Czech, Netherland, and the most pressure comes from the restrict supervision and quality control in other countries.
Q: How many times is a yew tree harvested a year? How long can it be used? And is it true that we can just harvest afer two years and take profits every year?
A: It’s a complex question. We can harvest after we plant trees 2 years. They accumulate biome between March to October and people harvest in autumn and winter, that is from September to November in Yunnan. For small plant we harvest every twice years, and for larger plants people can harvest every year. The profits to plant yew is relative with yew’s environment. Generally if the natural material have taxol less than 0.01% or the CAD less than 0.05%, then they are waste. Sometimes farmers plant trees with no guide and no plans, as a consequence, they suffered great loss. What’s more, the yew tree are mainly planted on crop field. Then this kind of disaster had great effect to society and economy. So it’s very important to unite company and farmers."

      Nowadays, collaboration between                                 researchers plays a critical role in the process of making important breakthroughs in                                 scientific fields. It is more and more difficult to finish a research project by                                 individual group of researchers. As for us, helps from other iGEM teams were vital to                                 our project improvement, experiments and human practices. In the other hand, we tried                                 our best to gave support to those iGEMers in need as well.                                 This year, there are totally 5 iGEM teams, SCU-WestChina, Peking, SiCAU-China,                                 TMMU_China and Purdue collaborated with SCU_China, either through one directional help                                 or mutual collaboration between each other. The formats of our collaboration are                                 variable. The details of our collaboration are listed below:
01.  SCU-WestChina
      As two teams from one                                     university, we collaborated with Team SCU-WestChina closely and in depth in                                     different aspects such as team building, project design, experiment and human                                     practice etc.

      SCU-WestChina is the newly-formed and the second                                     team in Sichuan University, and                                     with our help they got the “Multiple Team Discount” when registered.
Experiments
Materials
      Because SCU-WestChina didn’t have the 96-well                                     plate with black background for fluorescence measurement and trypsin for artificial                                     intestine fluid, which we happened to have some surplus, thus we provided them with                                     these materials for experiment.
Microplate Reader
      Because of regulations of microplate readers in                                     College of Life Sciences, SCU, we cannot do continuous measurement in our                                     laboratory. We asked SCU-WestChina for help and they found us a reader which could                                     do continuous measurement in State Key Laboratory"
Chalmers-Gothenburg,2017,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," in Cas9:gRNA dimers compared with the controls. This increase will in turn promote deletion of the ADE2 gene, causing the cell to turn red. Although this can be modeled, since there were not any parameters at all for the ADE2 pathway in the literature, we decided to only model up until the Cas9:gRNA dimer formation.
From this we can conclude that it might be possible to differentiate between lung cancer patients and controls since we get a 50% higher level of Cas9:dimers after 24 hours.

How much do we really need to know about antibiotic resistance? Is it really relevant to our everyday lives if we can’t understand half the information we’re reading? (What does methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus even mean?) Our team believes that everyone from the age of eleven to seventy seven should have the same understanding of the medications they’re taking as the food that they eat- and by extension the medication going into the food that they eat. In many circles synthetic biology has been given a bad name- it’s time to show what we can do for good!
Bexley School Visit
We organised a symposium for the year eleven pupils of Bexley Grammar, to teach them a little about what iGEM is and does, but mostly to extend their knowledge and understanding beyond GCSE requirement of synthetic biology. We set up different stations, using everyday objects to explain the complex science behind genetic engineering. We built DNA out of sweets; explained cell biology with LegoTM, and separated strawberry DNA with mango juice and alcohol. The final debate we staged was easily the star of the show. The pupils took on the attitudes of different peoples affected by genetic engineering: farmers, doctors, and scientists both for an against GM products. It was a great exercise in concisely and clearly communicating your point and we could see first-hand exactly how much they had learned from us. We asked them to fill out a survey about their experience, and the responses were encouraging.

Work In Kenya
""The reality of life in Kenya is, unsurprisingly, very different to life in the UK. The local wild life is much more exciting for starters, trading in sheep for lions and leopards. The cuisine is more exciting than “bangers and mash”. The healthcare expenditure per capita in Kenya is approximately £2700 less than in the UK (looking at statistics from 2014). I realised that the situation was worse than I was expecting. The knowledge about [antibiotic resistance] is very poor. Most people don’t know which medications are classed as an antibiotic and that use must be controlled. The control of medication within the food industry is rudiment"
UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," of the work that has been done within the iGEM framework and enable the students expand or ‘open up’ their views on the decision-making process (Balmer and Bulpin 2013). This has especially been the case with regard to an addition to the interdisciplinary nature of the competition. Since its inception in 2008, considerable attention in iGEM projects is now given to ‘human practices’, or ‘policy and practices’ as it is now called, to bring together natural scientists with social scientists. As such it is now part of the competition as a significant competitive element:
""The most successful teams often work hard to imagine their projects in a social context, and to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies. Increasingly, they also work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, biosafety or biosecurity issues related to their work. Consideration of these “Human Practices” is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest"". (iGEM 2014j).
This promotes the concept of ‘reciprocal reflexivity’ as a form of collaboration that creates the added value of scientists becoming more reflexive through their involvement with wider social assumptions (Calvert and Martin 2009; Wilsdon et al. 2005). Sociological Imaginations is, in fact, one of the outcomes of the human practice efforts of UCL iGEM 2014, in which such a collaboration took place. In the process of getting acquainted with the team in June, there was a genuine interest from the team to know what kind of contributions this section could bring to the project. They were always very open and they acknowledged that a social scientist could help significantly in the competition. However, attempting to bring forward a more inclusive strategy to my study, I was challenged by the workload that existed in the team to gain progress on making the scientific side of things work. Making an ethnographic analysis of the team preferably requires the involvement of the whole team. The team, however, was seldom together in the same place at the same time as most communication occurred via the Facebook group page and to collective e-mails between the group and the team coordinator. Many suggestions were made by team member Alberto and myself to work out an ambitious 'human practice' strategy but time constraints and other engagements made the collective effort rather difficult. We were the only two social science students who would have to get the attention of many more natural science and engineering students. This would almost give the impression that there was a divide between the social scientists and the natural"
