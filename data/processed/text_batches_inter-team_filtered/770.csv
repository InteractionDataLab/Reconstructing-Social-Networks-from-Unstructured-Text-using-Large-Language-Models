Once we confirm Biotic Blue is accepted for protection, the trademark will consist on a figurative mark containing word elements (Figure 7). Although our target market is Sweden, we would like to expand our business to other Baltic countries in the future. That is why we will apply for the EU trademark from EUIPO which will give us protection in all the EU Member States. The application will indicate our product class based on the Nice Classification, which is class 1 “enzymes for use in water treatment” [29]. It will be filed in just one language, and once it is registered and reviewed, we will be able to renew it indefinitely every ten years [30].
Figure 7. Biotic Blue logo.
Regulations
In order to fully comply with the specific regulations, it is necessary to analyze the Swedish directives and codes that are relevant to Biotic Blue.
The Swedish Environmental Code Ds 2000:61 is a major piece of legislation that promotes sustainable development by fundamental environmental rules [18]. In addition, the Swedish EPA, responsible for advising county administrative boards, municipalities and plant operators on sewage systems and treatment facilities designed for more than 200 people [10], clearly presents two of the most critical directives in this area:
Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC) concerns urban wastewater treatment and discharges from domestic and industrial sectors [31]. It has been incorporated both in the Environmental Code and in the Swedish EPA’s regulation.
EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), whose two main objectives are getting cleaner water in Europe and having the citizens more involved [32].
The EU’s Water Policy emphasizes the need for environmental assessments for specific projects planning to produce significant new changes to water bodies [17]. The Environmental management ISO 14046:2014 also provides guidelines for a water footprint assessment [33].
In particular, the purpose of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is to identify, predict, evaluate and mitigate the direct and indirect impact of a planned activity [18]. According to the Environmental Code, in an EIA, “manufacturers of chemical products or biotechnical organisms shall ensure that an appropriate investigation is carried out as a basis for assessment of the damage to human health or the environment that the product or organism is liable to cause”. The assessment shall specify the substances or organisms, the nature and degree of dangerous characteristics and any necessary measure in order to protect human health or the environment [18].
Lastly, the following acts, ordinances, regulations and directives are also important to consider:

Went to Second symposium on the origin of life at UCL ( http://www.ismb.lon.ac.uk/origin_of_life.html ) Useful things happened there: Met Vitor Pinheiro and some people from his previous lab, had a chat with Alex Taylor. Interesting to see the opinions of “truly synthetic” biologist (life out chemicals) on iGEM (standardised parts of DNA) side of synthetic biology. Met Adam Rutherford, he wants to keep in touch with iGEM teams (wrote two chapters on iGEM in his book) and particularly with UCL as it is his Alma Mater. Invited him for our debate (reconfirmed later in the week for the 26th). He coming.

CRISPR-Cas9 Implementation Pathway
Growth
Cyanobacterium
The growth rate of PCC7002 was found to be highly sensitive to growth conditions, particularly light saturation and CO2 content of air. PCC7002 samples grown in CO2-supplemented conditions grew significantly faster (as measured by OD 730 nm) than samples grown in atmospheric conditions, and samples supplemented with 10mM glycerol grew to a much higher saturation than non-supplemented samples in the same period of time (glycerol supplement = top graph; no glycerol = middle graph). We also measured the ratio of chlorophyll content (OD 650 nm) to cell saturation (OD 730 nm) for cell populations grown in glycerol-supplemented versus nonsupplemented conditions. The glycerol was also found to not shunt cells away from photosynthetic pathways, as populations grown in glycerol had the same chlorophyll content per cell as nonsupplemented populations (bottom graph, PCC7002 grown in A+ medium is shown in green).
Sinorhizobium
Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 and our Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 strains were incubated at 30C. We conducted growth assays on each strain we worked with in order to determine mid-log growth phases and doubling times; this was important in optimizing our transformation efficiency.

Safety
We aim to create an engineered E. coli which capable to measure the concentration of glucose in honey by calibrating the color of E. coli medium using android-based mobile phone. In our project we create a novel circuit without producing any biosynthesis product. So, there’s no risk in commerce or industry. In this safety page, we divided our safety procedure into 3 general title, which are:
1. Safety Rules in Laboratory
2. Safety Project
3. Safety Form
1.Safety Rules in Laboratory
The basic rules in our laboratory are:
a. Everyone has been trained before participate the laboratory experiment. The training covered several topics, such as basic information of IGEM and synthetic biology, technique of DNA isolation and handling, cutting and joining of DNA, plasmid transformation, handling the synthetic biology waste and basic rules of laboratory safety.
b. Everyone who works in the laboratory should follow the basic standard of laboratory safety, such as wearing safety cloth (lab coat, rubber gloves, and surgery mask).
c. In order to minimize the contamination, we do the experiment in laminar air flow (clean bench), following the standard procedure.
d. Laboratory activities were done by the students under supervision of instructors.
2. Safety Project
We are working with 2 types of E. coli strain; they are E. coli BL21 (DE3) and E. coli DH5α. Both of strain are classified in biosafety level 1 and including to risk group number 1 (low risk).  It does not cause disease in healthy of adult humans and also does not have any additional safety"

DNA Gel Electrophoresis
The PCR amplicons for construction of the BioBricks Tn5, T7p-Tn5-T7t and Linker into pSB13 were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer. 4 μL was pipetted into each lane. The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.
The gel image shows that the pSB1C3 BioBrick backbone is succesfully amplified. However, when the extra nucleotide is incorporated for non coding sequence BioBrick construction, this resulted not in the desired amplicon. The Tn5 was correctly amplified as well as the T7p-Tn5-T7t expression cassette. The Linker sequence is not correctly amplified as there is no band seen at 143 bp.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"FP in Bacillus subtilis & sfGFP in Escherichia coli
In the Netherlands, high school students choose a     specialisation when they are half way into their six year program.     This can be economical or focused more on technology and health. At     the end of their studies they work on an end project for about half     a year. Herein they demonstrate the knowledge and skills they     acquired over the years. For the more beta oriented students, this     includes experimental work.
Student Celine about her experience:
“I worked a week during the summer for my high school thesis at     the RuG. One of my questions in my thesis was which bacteria is     better for inserting a plasmid. To research my question I worked     with two students of the iGEM Team and cloned a plasmid with GFP in     both bacteria. We grew B. subtilis overnight and then transformed     it with the plasmid. With E. coli we first had to make competent     cells and after that we did a heat shock transformation.
My time in Groningen was very interesting. I saw and learned a     few new things, where I normally not get in touch with. The     students were very nice and answered all of my questions. It was a     successful week!”
Students Mayra & Robyn:
Mayra and Robyn are doing their high school thesis on     cryptography in bacteria and they also followed a few days in our     lab to experience working with bacteria, especially inserting a     part in bacteria.
“Thanks to the iGEM Team we got further in our research for our     high school thesis. We learned a lot in these three days. It was     very nice to work in a lab.”
Students Marco, Jarko & Daniel
Marco, Jarko and Daniel also did their project about     cryptography in bacteria. They already discovered that there are     several ways in order to leave a message in a bacterium. For     example, they have read that you can make a color-coded bacteria,     when they come in contact with a substance, such as an antibiotic.     By allowing bacteria to change color through a certain substance,     you can use the bacteria as a secret ink. They also found that      combinations in the DNA itself can give a meaning, such as a letter     or number. By then to put this combination in the DNA you get a     kind of secret language in the genome, which you can read by     mapping the DNA and translate.

Future Plans
Specifications for the next version of IMP tools
The Illinois software tools team has explored into several new ideas that could potentially become projects for next summer’s team and other future teams.  These ideas have focused on adding several new features that improve the present program and expand on what the current project accomplishes.  There are several options that the team is currently considering.  The user input and feedback that we receive will be taken into much consideration, and based on that, we will decide which changes should be implemented first.  In order of importance, the main focus of expansion will be on incorporating the biobrick database, improving graphical representation of pathways, adding more constraints and improving the weighting system, and adding additional helpful features like displaying pricing information on compounds and biobricks, as well as navigational and aesthetic features such as searching compounds directly by name.
One of the main areas of focus for the future teams will be the inclusion of biobricks and how to make use of the biobrick registry in a better way.  This year’s team was able to convert the nucleotide sequence for the genes responsible for a particular pathway into standardized biobricks by cleaving restriction sites, and assigning appropriate prefixes and suffixes.  Next year’s team could focus on creating better biobricks that could actually be tested out in an experimental lab.  They could research into dividing the biobricks into genes that code for single proteins and enzymes, and ones that code for a series of enzymes that are used in the same pathway. Then, these biobricks can be put together on a single plasmid that contains the code for an entire pathway.
Another part of the project that can be improved is the graphical representation of the pathways generated.  The pathway maps can be provided in a variety of different formats and programs.  Some features that could be added are zoom features that could allow users to zoom into pathways and be able to see several alternate paths to a desired compound.  This would involve being able recreate and put entire existing databases into one huge map.  These interactive maps could be designed by members who are proficient at using software programs like Adobe Flash and Cytoscape.
Furthermore, next year’s team can improve the pathway generating algorithm by adding more constraints and developing a more efficient weighting system.  Global computational studies can be used to evaluate immense numbers of possible input and output combinations"
Duesseldorf,2016,Team:Duesseldorf#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," two days was to explain the concept of the synthetic biology in a simple and intelligible way to the general public.
Fortunately, we succeeded due to the audience being very interested in what we are doing. Some kids were so fascinated, that they visited us another time the next day.
For the second day we invited other iGEM-Teams from North Rhine-Westphalia to present their projects on an hourly basis. We are very happy that every North Rhine-Westphalian team - Aachen, Bielefeld and Bonn - managed to come. The presentations were very interesting and the visitors asked for more details afterwards. All in all, the weekend was a full success.
We had very interesting conversations with the visitors, sparked interest in the younger generation and were able to exchange ideas with the other iGEM-teams.
Seeking expertise from Barbara Diventura (former DKFZ)
On Tuesday, the 20th of September, we had the great opportunity to discuss our project with Dr. Barbara Diventura and sought her professional opinion.
Barbara Diventura is an expert in the fields of cell biology and cancer research, her work focuses on signaling pathways and gene regulation, currently exploring the optogenetic control of nuclear protein export. Her team uses LOV, which is  one of our main optogenetic proteins. She is the head of Molecular and Cellular Engineering group at BioQuant, Heidelberg and formerly worked for DKFZ (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum aka German Cancer Research Center)
During our Skype meeting we presented our project in detail. The following discussion focused especially on our two-light-component and all of the activation processes we had and still have to consider before implementing the genes in humans to expressing the proteins.
Additionally, we talked about the reachability of light through cells as well as the safety aspects of viral gene transfer. In the process of our discussion, Barbara asked many helpful as well as challenging questions, thus helping us in further developing and shaping our concept.
Coming to a conclusion of our conversation, we spent the last minutes talking about the future of synthetic biology in cancer research. She told us that recognizing cancer cells from the inside of them using mRNA is a promising field of research.
All in all, talking to Barbara helped us immensely with rounding up our project and we carefully implemented her input. We are very thankful to her for taking time for us.

ULB-Brussels,2011,Team:ULB-Brussels#Debate_-_-_TEXT.html," Just to remind you, DNA contains instructions to construct every molecules of your body. It is as a plan that every organism has inside all of his cells.
Actually, the major intention of synthetic biology is to manipulate DNA of unicellular organisms (composed of only one cell) to make them able to produce useful molecules for therapeutic or industrial matters, among others.
Sadly, it’s not as easy to do as it is to explain. In fact, manipulate DNA consist in two fundamental acts: insert and delete fragment. It is exactly similar to Legos, when you put and withdraw brick to build; except that difficulties appear because biologists don’t handle plastics bricks. They handle living matter in living organism. Therefore they have to exploit natural mechanisms to manipulate DNA.
For instance, the iGEM standards use a “cut and paste” system. But, in that sense, you need to have the right scissor, which cuts at the right place and it is often problematic.
The most effective and appropriate mechanism is called “homologous recombination”.
To explain it simply: if you have two little regions that board a fragment of DNA and if those regions are the same than two others in another fragment, we say that those regions are homologous and there exist a mechanism that switches those fragments: recombination.
It is already used in yeast, which is a unicellular mushroom. Therefore, to do every complex assembly easily, biologists have to use yeast. But yeast is bigger and grows slower than bacteria. The problem is that E.Coli, our favourite bacterium, doesn’t allow constructing anything because it has an enzymatic system that removes every linear DNA.
We found the solution in a virus of E.Coli, the lambda phage. It has a molecular gadget to save linear DNA and to allow homologous recombination. We took the plan of this gadget and we constructed an entire plasmid around it, that we called Pindel.
We designed Pindel to be removed after use and to express his genes when we want. We also constructed an additional plasmid and wrote a protocol that allows insertion or deletion leaving no resistance to antibiotics.
In conclusion, we build a tool that allows every searchers, druggist or industry, to do manipulate easily, properly and precisely, DNA in E.Coli. It will be a fantastic tool to produce molecules in large quantities or to study E.Coli genome, manipulating one gene without any impact on neighboring regions.
To ensure a high quality of work, we build our project on three complementary and parallel axes: a first group called “wet lab” which"

As for controls, strains secreted CsgA–Histag and ?CsgA both are unable to specifically attach to SpyTag thus no distinct localization highlight of red fluorescence on E.coli. That to a large extent prove the specificity of our desired linkage between SpyTag and SpyCatcher system.
Fig 14. The first figures of each sample are snapped under green laser of 558 nm wavelength and mCherry-SpyTags emit red fluorescence. The second figures of each sample are snapped under bright field of fluorescence microscopy and we can clearly see a group of bacteria.. The third figures are merged by the first and second ones. All photos are taken by Zeiss Axio Imager Z2.
Results and Optimization
The new CsgA mutants we obtained or newly constructed, and applied in our Solar Hunter project are as follows:
CsgA-Histag
His-CsgA-SpyCatcher-Histag
His-CsgA-SpyCatcher
We cultured all E.coli mutants in multi-wells with increasing inducer gradient. The result demonstrated in accordance that 0.25 µg/ml of aTc will induce the best expression performance of biofilm. The possible reason for higher concentration of inducer strangely leading into low production of biofilm might lie in that aTc, a kind of antibiotic, can be harmful to protein synthesis in bacteria. We speculate there’s an antagonism between the effect of promoting expression and impeding growth brought by aTc and 0.25 µg/ml of aTc just reach the optimal point.
Crystal Violet Assay of the peptide fusion mutants library transformed into ?CsgA strains. Firstly, we apply 0.1% crystal violet solution to all mutants to gain quantitative data about their relative expression and secretion performance. The result was read and exported by BioTek CYTATION5. CsgA-His mutant stands out as the highest peak in absorbance after washing. (See protocal ) The reason why His-CsgA-SpyCatcher-Histag and His-CsgA-SpyCatcher mutant doesn’t perform as well as CsgA-His might be ascribed to size hindrance of SpyCatcher, which impedes the transport process of CsgA mutant subunits from inner area to extracellular environment by CsgG outermenbrane exporter, whose pore size is around 2 nm. Yet, the differences between induced C"

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice"

iGEM IIT Delhi follows a high standard of safe and responsible biological engineering. We completely understand that we are responsible for living up to the trust placed in us to design, build, and share biological devices safely.
About the lab and Safety Training
Following issues were discussed in the training for safety of lab:
Lab access and rules (including appropriate clothing, eating and drinking, etc.).
Responsible individuals (such as lab or departmental specialist or institutional biosafety officer).
Differences between biosafety levels.
Biosafety equipment (such as biosafety cabinets).
Good microbial technique (such as lab practices).
Disinfection and sterilization.
Emergency procedures.
Chemicals, fire and electrical safety.
The issue of transport rules was not covered and therefore, we didn’t have enough idea about the same in the beginning. Later through the collaboration on GMM Legislation we got a good insight of the transport rules in various parts of the world. Here is the link:

Secondly, after decomposition by our genetically modified yeast,, some of the useless kitchen waste might be efficiently changed into biological fertilizers. This type of biological fertilizer not only enhances crop production, but also can help the soil maintain a high fertility.  Last but not least, burning of kitchen waste can be replaced by our decomposition method, which will effectively relieve the current unpleasant situation of air pollution.
Economic impact
Our project is aimed to increase the tolerance of yeast in hypertonic environments during food waste decomposition. With our modified yeast, survivability of yeast and their decomposing efficiency can be greatly increased. Currently, most of the companies have to add new yeast periodically to keep the decomposition rate. With the help of our yeast, the companies can save more costs by reducing the needs of large amount of yeast and increasing the decomposition efficiency.
Humanity
Because of the effectiveness of our modified yeast in food waste decomposition, people will be able of enjoy a safer and more comfortable life in a fresh and clean environment without the negative effects caused by the food waste.

Tsinghua-A,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," a stochastic vector as the initial input distribution and then use an optimization algorithm to iterate the function and maximize $I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ . The final result is the channel capacity.
Do our circuits work?
Yes, they do sense the input level of Dox concentration. The transfer curves of all seven groups are illustrated below. All values are in logarithm space. Note that for the convenience of plotting, the points where Dox=0 are plotted at Dox=0.01. (or the point will fly out far to negative infinity)
In the leftmost figure, EBFP2 without intein sequence show relatively low affinity and thus low expression level. Nevertheless, their leakage level is low as well, and Dox induction leads to approximately  fold change. As for the middle and right figures, both split EBFP2 with intein and intact EBFP2 have about  fold change when induced by Dox, but split EBFP2 have lower leakage level.
Meanwhile, if one half of EBFP is driven by constitutive promotor CMV, the leakage level remains the same but the induced multiple suffers. This is expected beforehand because with one constitutively-expressed part, the circuit can only sense the input with one half of the split proteins, thus becoming slightly less inducible.
Normalizing the curves lead to more interesting discoveries. Even though TRE-EBFP2N + CMV-EBFP2C leads to poor fold change, the transfer curve is significantly steeper when the dimerization process is reversible. This means better switch-like properties. With the presence of intein, the effect is weaker but still visible.
Normalize transfer curves to the range of 0 to 1, we can find that the shapes are different. Lines representing split proteins are later to rise and steeper.
If we normalize the initial EBFP2 level to 1, split EBFP2 with intein displays better properties than the other two settings. From fig. we can clearly see that it has the highest multiple among the three, even significantly higher than that of the intact EBFP2. The result shows that split proteins, with high binding affinity, can defeat original undivided proteins for their low leakage level and high induced multiples, that is, high sensibility to inputs.
How well do circuits perform as evaluated by channel capacity?
Seven circuits are evaluated in our experiment. Calculated channel capacities are displayed in fig.
Come on, this not as dizzying as it is at the first glance. Let’s look at it step by step.

Amplification of pBC1-CrGFP in E. coli DH10B chemically competent.
Repetition of the last lab. Because there was no growth on the plate, the amplification was repeated. However, now the transformation was made in the E. coli top 10 chemically competent strains with more care and caution. After a thermic shock and incubation TB medium for an hour and a half, the cells were transfered to several plates with LB and ampicillin, and they were left incubating at 37°C.
The plates were checked and there actually was presence of transformant colonies with resistance to ampicillin, two of them were inoculated in Falcon tubes with LB and ampicillin medium at 37°C.

Additionally, the combination of a short text and a picture, representing explanation and    visualization, enables a simple understanding of the subject, even to people without any    background knowledge. Thus, we decided to take part in this campaign.    For the front side of the postcard we chose a depiction of the 3D-structure of the    SpyCatcher/SpyTag System for it plays a key role in our project. Also, since we believe that    many people do not exactly know how to picture a protein because these structures are often    illustrated differently, this should give people a basic idea of real protein molecules. Together    with a short explanatory text on the back, we printed our postcards and sent 300 of them to    Düsseldorf. A few weeks later, we received a package with the postcards from every    participating team. All these cards looked amazing and seemed very thought-through,    showing how successfully all teams visualized parts of their projects. We were happy to    distribute all these cards at the Long Night of Sciences and in our universities.

Card Game
This year, as one of our Human Practice projects, we developed a card game called „Pathologia“ . The game consists of cards that represent human pathogens, cures, vaccinations and other special effects that affect human health. The aim of this was to educate about health and disease – with a special focus on the pathogens that cause the disease and their characteristics – in an easy and fun way. As we construed the game in English to enable it to be played all over the globe, we came to realise that a game is best played in one’s native language. This especially applies to our game since most of the cards contain special medical expressions that are not included in the general vocabulary of a foreign language. Additionally, aiming to educate about human health, we tried to include the – in our opinion – most important or most dangerous pathogens. But since many thousand human pathogens exist and different people think of different ones as important, it is nearly impossible for one team to make the game all-embracing. Also, to emphasize the influence of synthetic biology within the game, more new methods or ways to treat diseases using genetic engineering or similar approaches could be added. To address these problems, we decided to invite all teams to collaborate with us on making the game more international, more understandable and as comprising as possible. Thereto we personally asked other teams at the Germany-wide and European Meet-Up as well as posted a collaboration request on the official iGEM Collaboration Side looking for other teams that could translate"

We have characterised two synthetic devices: the Secretion of RNA Device (S.O.R.D.) and its partner RNA silencing agent, spiRNA.
S.O.R.D. is a fusion protein consisting of Hfq and OsmY. Hfq is an RNA binding protein found in many pathogenic bacteria. OsmY is a protein readily secreted by E. coli. By fusing these proteins we can theoretically create a device that secretes RNA from the cell. Our spiRNA is made from the expression systems, Ec-sRNA using an Hfq binding site from E. coli and Sma-sRNA using one from Serratia marcesens. Once the spiRNA is outside of the E. coli we want the target bacterium to take up the sRNA so that it can block a vital DNA sequence from being translated. In our proof of concept experiments detailed here we have targetted the flagellar subunit gene fliC. So in order to see if RNA interference would work in the treatment of bacterial infections, we ran some experiments on our BioBricks. First of all we ran numerous western blots to characterise SORD and see if they can be secreted. We then performed motility assays to see if our spiRNA works as we expect it to.
Western Blots
Figure 1: Western blots of our whole cell (A) and supernatant (B) samples of rhamnose induced OsmY-HA (C) expressing cultures.
We ran a western blot on our rhamnose induced OsmY-HA expressing cultures. We used OsmY-HA as a positive control to make sure OsmY is being secreted. First we added 500 ul overnight cultures into 50 ml of LB, we incubated the cultures at 37oC until we reached an OD600nm of 0.4. We followed this by adding different concentrations of rhamnose; 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4% and 0.5% (v/v). We took a 1ml sample from the"

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

Procedure #3 : High Transformation Efficiency of B. Subtilis with integrative DNA Using Glycene Betaine as an Osmoprotectant - Fatma Meddeb-Mouelhi, Carlos Dulcey, and Marc Beauregaurd. Theory: High electroporation efficiency (up to 5 x 10^5 cfu/microgram) was obtained using 7.5% glycene betaine. This 2011 protocol claims to substantially improve on the transformation efficiency of existing techniques. The electroporation technique relies on electric pulsation to induce a membrane potential for cells for competence and transformation.
Procedure #4 : A modified electro-transformation method for Bacillus subtilis and its application in the production of antimicrobial lipopeptides - Theory: A modified electroporation method using trehalose is presented for the transformation of Bacillus subtilis. The new method improved the transformation efficiency of B. subtilis nearly 2,000 - fold compared with the usual method, giving 4 x 10^5 transformants/micro-gram DNA. Trehalose is a non-toxic sugar which protects biomolecules against environmental stress.
Procedure #5 :Groningen Method - Preparation of competent B. subtilis cells and transformation with plasmid DNA - Theory: No electrocompetent preparation used for this protocol, solely starvation medium and minimal-growth medium solution.
Procedure 6 : Paris Method - Preparation of competent B. subtilis cells and transformation with plasmid DNA - Theory: Specially formulated transformation and inoculation procedure to induce competent preparation without electroporation.
Results and Future Directions
With our experimental design in place our team began assembling the genetic construct and was able to complete it until the following structure:
However, due to PCR malfunctions, time constraints, and a issue in the core RBS sequence we were unable to proceed further with this portion of the project. In the future, our team would like to use complete our partial genetic construct. Then this segment could be integrated into the pHCMC04 vector and subsequent competent preparation and transformation protocols could thereby be enacted with the three strains (Wild type, protease knockout, wall associated knockout) to examine if successful holoCph1 protein (GAF domain expression) was possible.
If our future transformations and subsequent expression of the GAF protein in B.subtilis is successful, our goal is to express multiple GAF domains in this organism and quantify whether expression is comparable"

Bert Berla
Hi! I'm Bert- a PhD candidate in the Pakrasi lab. I am working to apply techniques developed to optimize the operation of chemical reactors to get more useful stuff out of our favorite micro-reactors: cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria created most of the organic material that time and geological forces turned into the fossil fuels we rely on to meet our energy and materials needs today. I believe that engineered cyanobacterial strains can play a major part in meeting those needs in the future. I am working to create those strains. In my life outside the lab, I like to build things, ride and race my bicycle, and hang out with my wife Jenny, our baby girl Evan, and the handsomest dog in the world, Monster.
Dr. Deng Liu
I'm Deng, a postdoc researching in the Pakrasi lab. I am interested in the research on cyanobacteria, especially on the synthetic biology and transcriptional regulation in cyanobacteria. At present, I am responsible for the nitrogen fixation project in the lab. Because of the various species of cyanobacteria, it is possible to make the non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria to fix nitrogen under the control of circadian clock as some diazotrophic cyanobacteria show in nature. In this work, many experimental approaches are used, such as molecular biology, biochemistry, genetic engineering and so on.
Cheryl Immethun
Hi, I’m Cheryl, a PhD candidate in the Moon Research Group.  I am developing synthetic biology tools for cyanobacteria, mainly utilizing transcriptional regulation.  Through their millions of years of evolution, cyanobacteria have developed amazing capabilities that I would like to employ for societal needs.  By unlocking the secrets of nitrogen fixation in a photosynthetic cell, we could one day transform agriculture to keep up with the demands of our ever expanding population.  My passions are solving puzzles (in and out of the lab,) as well as exciting students about the mysteries of science and helping them develop the tools to become society’s problem solvers.

Results of mathematical demonstration (1: 9: 81), calibration (13: 100: 978) and simulation (1: 10: 80) are consistent with each other. This shows that the model is feasible for estimating the shear force that generated by microfluidics on cell membrane. In order to obtain the exact shear force, we inputted the experimentally used flow rate as a boundary condition (6.25μL/min,50μL/min) in our model. The shear stress was also calculated.

Detailed Protocol
Data Analysis Method And Software
Because most MS channels are permeable for calcium ion after activated, here we used a genetically encoded calcium indicator, R-GECO, for real-time and quantitatively measurement of intracellular calcium level. R-GECO is an artificial calcium indicator derived from GCaMP. After binding with calcium, it will emit red fluorescence at around 600nm [9] . Living cell imaging system (Nikon eclipse Ti) was used for time lapse fluorescent imaging recording the R-GECO fluorescence change when shear stress was applied on cells in microfluidics chips.
We chose five groups of cells in each observation channels (fast, mid and slow) and traced the changes of their mean fluorescence intensities of pixels over time. To reduce background noise on the analysis, we also chose a region with no cell as noise region to subtract the background fluorescence intensity for each image. In order to accurately and intuitively compare the fluorescence values changing over time, we normalized fluorescence intensity at the starting time to 0. Thus, we showed our data in the form of ΔF/F0. (ΔF: Increasing fluorescence value that relative to F0; F0: fluorescence value in the starting time point)
Result and interpretation
We obtained fluorescence images for Piezo1 channel, Piezo1 is a functionally diverse mechanosensitive cation channel. It plays significant role in multiple physiological processes, including sensing touching and shear stress of blood flow for proper blood vessel development,"

The Recombinase Team ! When we decided to use recombinase systems at the beginning of our project, we found that an iGEM team in the US ( Michigan University ) had worked last year on FimE, a specific recombination system. We established contact with them in order to get some relevant information about the recombinases and understand better how they worked. After several mail exchanges we planned a videoconference between our teams to discuss about our project and the different biobricks that could have been interesting for us or them. We received their improved fimE system from last year with the IRR and IRL sequences. In counterpart we send them our riboregulation system, but unfortunately it was too late for us to use it in their system.

Function Test of E7 Lysis system
The construction of E7-pUHE21 contained strain w3110
BBa_K117000 which contains E7 lysis gene is found out from iGEM 2014 registry and primers are design to PCR the target gene(the sequence of the primers are shown below) BBa_B0034 is contained in the upstream primer, which is a strong RBS.The plasmid pUHE21 is a commercialized one that can be extracted from a modified strain of E.coli(part of its sequence is shown below). EcoRI and PstI are used to cut both the PCR product and the pUHE21 backbone. After purification and ligation with T4 ligase, the reconstructed E7-pUHE21 plasmid is transformed into competent E.coli strain w3110. The positive clone with right DNA sequence inserted is screened out and referred to as strain E7

Week 38
At our second meeting with Greta we have presented our results and discussed possible improvements upon our system.
More
Greta has pointed out that our system might suffer from immense sequencing bias, as our system was then based on discriminating different biomolecule activities depending on phi29 amplicon amounts, which in turn was connected to how many Product Nucleotides has the particular biomolecule produced. If the molecule variant was highly active we had a good amount of DNA to sequence. But, if the activity was low, there was a high chance to lose that information, for example, due to low read count.
Close
Week 39
The meeting with Greta has pushed us to innovate our system even further. Soon after that we have came up with the idea of Reference Nucleotides.
More
These were specially modified nucleotides which phi29 could incorporate into DNA easily. Also, the nanopore sequencer could detect those nucleotide modifications at the same time as reading the full sequences. We have added a specific amount of reference nucleotides to amplification droplets used for enriching droplets with amplification mix.
After the merging, each droplet now contained reference nucleotides, which have helped to balance the overall amplified DNA amount, even for the mutants which had extremely low activities.

Week 41
We have presented our finalised design and results at Science Days event which was organized by our sponsor Thermofisher Scientific. After that, we had a session discussion about further development of this project after iGEM and have received offers to collaborate with bioinformatics from Life Sciences Center in order to start using the immense amount of function to sequence relationship data in Artificial Intelligence algorithms.

ULaval,2018,Team:ULaval#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"ide to pregnant women[25], or other cases like the mad cow disease[26] are good examples. While healthy scepticism is important, it must not be confused with anti-intellectualism. In the US, there is an increasing group who mistrust experts[27] on important matters such as global warming and the general unequivocal consensus by the scientific community that global warming is man-made. Public scepticism is one of the factors delaying the much needed development of more environmentally sustainable technologies[28].
To counter this slowdown, education is critical. In order to communicate about and debate sensitive topics, scientists need to popularize their work. Popular science is closely linked to the acceptance of scientific progress, and is part of researchers’ missions[29]. It represents the bridge between scientific literature and popular knowledge. Meaningful citizen participation in deliberations regarding synthetic biology requires familiarity with general concepts in the science of this particular developing field. In other words, scientists should taken it upon their personal mission to increase the public’s knowledge on and objectivity towards these kinds of matters.
A recent study examined perspectives of Millennials regarding GMOs, specifically GM foods[30]. Being a very large generational group, their perspectives are expected to have a major impact on acceptance of GMOs. Overall, Millennials have somewhat unfavorable views toward GM foods. In an attempt to understand that attitude toward synthetic biology, we made our own survey, which we distributed to a large public. It was answered by 381 persons, whom were mostly Millennials attending a university, from Canada or Europe. We asked respondents how they feel about GMOs and most of them seemed to feel safe about them, depending of the use that is made of them.
After that, we asked them a few more precise questions about GMOs on the market:
1. Would you trust a product synthesized by a genetically modified organism (GMO)?
2. Did you know that several products (cosmetics, food, drugs, etc.) are already produced by GMOs or are GMOs themselves?
3. If these products were labeled as GMOs, would you still buy them?
4. In your opinion, would it be necessary to specify the origin (chemical or biological) of adrenaline sold in pharmacies?
5. Considering that adrenaline is a drug and not a food product, does the fact that it comes from a GMO make it any different for you?
For each answer given to the previous question, we analysed the answers for the 5 following questions. Charts 1 to 3 (see appendix), which represent the majority of respondents (88%), show the same results: these people would trust a product synthesized by"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#DateRapeDrugs_-_-_TEXT.html,"fluence of γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) on expression of sfGFP in our standard CFPS reaction (t = 60 min). Positive control: PT7-UTR-sfGFP ( BBa_K1758102 ) Values are normalized to cell lysate containing sfGFP. n=3
The results of the CFPS reaction surpassed our expectations. In vivo, BlcR reacts on GHB and GBL and thereby dissociates from the blc-operator ( Chai et al. 2007 ). This effect could be observed when 0.3% GBL was present in the reaction, as the flurescence signal was greater when compared to the reaction without GBL. Still, for higher concentrations of GBL, protein synthesis was inhibited.
GHB also negatively affected protein synthesis in the BlcR containing extract. Strikingly however, detrimental effects were far smaller than in the standard extract! Interestingly for 3 % GHB, the fluorescence signal surpassed the 1 % GHB signal. We propose two reasons that lead to this effect.(i) When BlcR binds to GHB, GHB is removed from the reaction and cannot act detrimentally on the molecular machinery. (ii) The polymerase is no longer blocked by BlcR which means sfGFP can be expressed.
When we normalized the signals from BlcR containing extract on our standard extract in which GHB was strongly inhibiting, the effect of BlcR was apparant immediately. Consistent with findings from Chai et al. 2007 , BlcR reaction on GHB is stronger than on GBL.
Influence of γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) on expression of sfGFP in extract containing BlcR (t = 60 min). DNA template was BBa_K1758376 .
Extract containing BlcR reveals response to GHB when the observed fluorescence signal is normalized to signal generated in our standard extract (t = 60 min).
We therefore demonstrated that we can detect GHB at concentrations of 1% and 3% by normalizing the fluorescence signal to a control reaction. As our CFPS system is very robust even at ethanol concentrations of 5%, we can say that we built a cell-free sensor for GHB that can be used to detect the noxious substance in liquids.
In the final application, the potential of our sensor became evident. In our paper-based CFPS reaction, water that contained 1% (v/v) GHB was used for rehydration. Fluorescence signals were measured, data quickly"
Tianjin,2015,Team:Tianjin#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," third lane is the original protein solution and the forth is the protein solution which used ATPS to purify. We can see that some bulk proteins have been removed. This fusion protein is GFP-sJanus. The first and second lane are GFP-sJanus, because we didn’t dilute the protein’s solution, the concentration of protein is so high (about 3mg/mL) that they overflowed. The next is 100ug/mL and 50ug/mL.
Figure 2. We used Bandscan5.0 to analysis the gel. We can see that other proteins have been removed all in the third and fourth lane. Meanwhile, we can see that other proteins have been removed to some degree in the fifth and sixth lane.
We calculated the efficiency of this experiment. It is 18.93% in the third and fourth lane and 46.17% in the fifth and sixth lane. The efficiency is a bit low and we analyzed the reasons. We added 10uL of Berol 532 in this system to extract the target protein. However, the total amount of protein is so large that our detergent can’t extract them all.
Formal experiment using Berol 532 as detergent and MCAC0 as buffer
Process of this experiment
In our first formal experiment, we changed some conditions. We increased the speed of shaker to 300r/min in order to make them mixed totally. Meanwhile, in the pre-experiment, we found that we didn’t need to use centrifuge to make them separated because they can divided into two phases automatically in few seconds at the room temperature(Berol 532, article says that its low solubility does not allow cloud point measurement). We used 20% (v/v) Berol to extract our fusion proteins. If less detergent used in this system, it will increase the final concentration of proteins, but it will decrease the efficiency of extraction because detergent is lacking in combing the fusion protein.
The volume of our system is about 5mL (We used original solution which got by centrifuge and high pressure after suspending by MCAC0). We added 1mL Berol 532(20% w/w) in our original solution. And then, we used shaker to make them mixed at the speed of 300r/min and 20 centigrade working about one hour. We put the tube at the room temperature and the mixture was separated into two phases in few seconds. We got the upper phase (2mL) and added water saturated butanol (5mL). Then we used centrifuge to"

Paris Bettencourt iGEM Team
This year’s Macquarie University iGEM team has continued a tradition of collaboration with the Paris Bettencourt iGEM Team by assisting them with their project. The Paris team’s project involves determining the enzymes involved in the break-down of pigment molecules in wine. The idea for this project stems from the fact that wine stains on clothes are amongst the hardest stains to remove, requiring, amongst others, perchloroethylene, which is listed as a possible human carcinogen. As such, finding an alternative method to removing wine stains would be beneficial to human health. The need for collecting samples from vineyards stems from the idea that certain organisms contain enzymes that are able to degrade wine pigments such as anthocyanins and tannins. Collecting these samples would enable the isolation and identification of these enzymes.
The many quality wine producing regions of Australia made collaborating with the Paris team for their iGEM project and collecting the required samples seem a natural fit. After discussing with the Paris team their requirements, we were able to collect two samples from a vineyard here in Australia for their project. The first sample was a falcon tube of soil obtained from around the roots of a vine. The second sample contained vine bark, as well as shoots from both last year’s vintage, and this year’s vintage. More detailed descriptions of the samples can be found here: French Collaboration .
The pictured samples were sent overseas. Customs forms for both France and Australia needed to be completed detailing what was contained in the samples. Examples of the customs forms that needed to be completed include: Customs Declaration ."

2. Simulation of the transmembrane nodal currents
It is possible to implement this model in the NEURON software (http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) to be able to simulate transmembrane nodal currents (Cf. Figure 4). This software calculates the density of the currents presented previously.
Figure 4: Result of the NEURON simulation of the electrical activity (evolution as a function of the time of the transmembrane current) of a Ranvier node of a typical axon of 8.7 μm diameter.[4]
The value of the electrical parameters of the model is based on the study of C. C. MCINTYRE and al.[5]. The simulations make it possible to generate a large database comprising, for each of the nodes of Ranvier of each of the fibers, the representation of the transmembrane current as a function of time. For the study of electrode selectivity, it is the distribution of these nodal currents in the space that must be defined. In other words, we need to know at a fixed time t0 the distribution of the currents generated by the nodes of Ranvier. In fact, Figure 5 represents the total activity of forty nodes of Ranvier. It can be noted that of these forty nodes of Ranvier, only a few are active simultaneously. The envelope of the generated currents is represented in dashed lines.
Figure 5: Spatial distribution of the amplitudes of the nodal currents generated by several Ranvier nodes at a given instant.[4]
If we take into account realistic data of characteristic and propagation of an action potential (duration between 0.1 and 0.2ms and propagation speed between 50 and 100 ms-1) we find a wavelength of the order of 10mm. This wavelength value is characteristic of the propagation of action potential in a peripheral nerve, it is used to size the spacing between the poles of a conventional electroneurogram measuring electrode.
IV. Calculation of the potential at the surface of the nerve
1. Introduction
The purpose of this part is to know the potential “seen” by an electrode wrapped around the nerve. For this, we will study the extracellular potential at the surface of the nerve by considering an axon parallel to the longitudinal axis of the nerve. Each Ranvier node is considered as a point current source. To estimate the potential at a point M at the periphery of the nerve, it is necessary to determine a transfer function linking this potential to each of the transmembrane currents of"

The carousels spin so you can look through your options. A struggle we've been facing is optimizing the camera viewpoint and the colors. We have all of the carousels lining up underneath each other in a centered and even way, which allows them to be easily read.
July 19th
This week flew by. Today is Yoav's last day so we've been trying to get him as much coding experience as possible this week. I've been making him drive a lot.
We split up the work between Dan and I in an attempt to get more done. He's working on the back end stuff, gathering all of the data from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts from the internet. Yoav and I have been working on getting the front end in order and making double carousels happen. In order to do this, I had to spend a whole day changing all of the data structures over to lists of lists. Ironically, we're avoiding tree data structures in Unity, as C# doesn't have any Tree classes without us writing our own. I think it's easier to think of things as lists of lists and it gives us the option in the future to make more than just two carousels spawn with very little additional work on my part. The day Yoav was absent was the day I did a lot of the switching over and I started getting double Carousels to work. Thursday and Friday we worked on many smaller projects that we thought could get done in a short amount of time, considering we had other things going on this week, such as meeting up with BU. Yoav got many useful features figured out. He adjusted the camera appropriately and made things change colors when they're clicked on.
We went to Boston to meet with BU's team, which was fun. Veggie Galaxy is definitely my new favorite restaurant and I'm going to eat there as frequently as possible from now on. SUCH. GOOD. FOOD. My friend Diana came with me because we needed to run some errands so I was glad she joined us on our adventure.

Today was the last day of work before our poster presentations. I think we got a lot done over the course of the summer and our team worked well together. In the last week, we got Daniel's back end code integrated with the front end so that the tree shows the names of the proper parts when their category is clicked on. We also got the double carousels working pretty well and the visualizations look good. We"

Introduction
There has been much talk about the environment in the media today; however the main issue revolves around the accumulation of greenhouse gasses leading to global warming. By developing a biological lighting system this could help in decreasing the burden of greenhouse gas emissions from electrical power supply due to coal-fired power generation. Though our system is very basic, there certainly is potential to fully develop biological lighting systems as a complete in-house lighting system or in lighting street lamps, emergency exit lighting in buildings and even in fun ways such as in trees at Christmas time. To develop this system, we have chosen to examine simple genetic circuits of fluorescing proteins produced from a more difficult cell free chassis due to the distinct advantages of control of the system and greater safeties; which are significant ethical considerations for Synthetic Biology that are potentially addressed using cell free chasses.
Fluorescent proteins based on Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) are made of eleven β-strands that make up a three dimensional β-barrel protein which has one internal β-sheet with an β-helix running through the middle. Uniquely, the fluorescence of these proteins is due to the chromophore found in the centre of the β-barrel. The chromophore formation is provided by the inward facing side chains of the β-barrel that induce the formation of a ring compound in the protein’s active site which is found centrally at the tripeptide sequence Ser65-Tyr66-Gly67. Fluorescence is induced when light of an excitation wavelength is captured within the chromophore, causing an outer shell electron to rise to a higher molecular orbital. This is an unstable configuration and results in the slow reversion of the electron to the ground state. In doing so, energy is released as emitted light (see diagram A). For different fluorescent proteins based on GFP, the changing of colours is simply a matter of changing the important residues involved in forming the chromophore or residues that associate with the chromophore.
Therefore, considering the site responsible for the protein to fluoresce is known, this chromogenic site alone"

Safety
To address potential safety issues with our project, we were asked by iGEM to answer the following questions:
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety,
public safety, or
environmental safety?
For the safety of our researchers and others in the lab, all experiments are done on a safe and dedicated lab space. Also all members are required to wear the appropriate safety gear (gloves,eye protection, and lab coats) when experiments are in progress. Everything is carefully controlled and disposed of in the proper way, like using the biohazard disposal for old cultures of transformed cells.  We also always washed our hands when we finished.  Since our experiments are being done in this lab area, there is no concern for public safety. Our experiment also does use the environment as a factor but it certainly does not compromise the safety and overall wellness of the environment because we are sampling it only in the lab.  If we wanted to sue our device outside we would have it safety tested.  Our Professor handled the arsenic and the ethidium bromide used in electrophoresis.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
We didn't make any.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
We are very careful not to release any transformed bacteria or their products in to the environment.  All of the waste made from our work was disposed of in the biohazard waste container.  We used bleach and 70% alcohol to clean our work area and equipment.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering? </li>
That is a good question: We think that if some researcher is going to use an iGEM outside of the lab that that iGEM should not be able to survive unless given special nutrition or something like that.  This would stop genetic pollution.

Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Math Book#CRISPRi_-_-_TEXT.html," is the same assumption made by previous teams.
Modelling Incomplete Repression
A recent study by Bikard et al.
found that maximal repression (on the order of 100 fold) was achieved when the promoter was targeted. However, targeting the promoter is not viable in this project since an essential promoter from elsewhere in the genome has been harnessed to produce the fluorescent promoter. Instead, we model the incomplete repression (ranging from 6-fold to 35-fold) observed when the off-promoter regions, specifically on the non-coding strand, are targeted.
There are two possible approaches for modelling the incomplete repression, each reflecting a different physical mechanism that allows leaky YFP expression. In the first mechanism, RNA polymerase is sometimes able to cleave the bound dCas9-sgRNA complex from the DNA. In the second mechanism, the complex binds inefficiently and is sometimes separated from the DNA, permitting transcription to continue.
Cleavage Mechanism
Inefficient Binding Mechanism
We assumed that the incomplete repression is accounted for by the first mechanism. This assumption was based on several studies
showing radically different repression rates if the complex targets the promoter, preventing transcription initiation, rather than targeting the DNA further downstream and impeding transcription elongation. The differences in the system behavior depending on whether or not RNA polymerase has the opportunity to bind suggest that the “cleavage” mechanism may more closely resemble the chemical reality.
Consequently, we modeled incomplete repression using a leaky expression term proportional to the expected YFP expression when the complex is saturated. The differential equation model was updated with a repression term dependent on the fold reduction FR and the initial concentration of YFP mRNA, Y0:
This equation was derived using two boundary conditions. Before repression, when the concentration of the complex is zero, YFP mRNA is produced at the rate expected from the sarA promoter, α. After repression has reached its steady state, the YFP mRNA production has been reduced by FR fold, to Y0/FR.
Parameter Finding
We turned to the literature to find parameters for our model, given in the Table below. We first looked for parameter values that had been measured in S. aureus. In cases where those could not be found, we next looked for ways to to estimate the parameters using other available data for S. aureus and finally searched for the parameters in other gram-positive bacteria. Aggregating parameters from many experiments across the literature is by nature a somewhat uncertain endeavor; those parameters about which we are very uncertain are marked with asterisks. An explanation for how we arrived at each parameter is given in the"

What we did for others
During the summer, we collaborated with other teams.
- The first exchange was with the UI_Indonesian Team. We sent to them our survey and they went to Indonesian streets to ask people about chewing gum and synthetic biology. We also did their survey. Ho a wild wiki appear!!!
- Our team participated to the “Meetup France”. In addition to our team, five IGEM teams went to Bordeaux: Paris Saclay, Paris Pasteur, Toulouse, EPFL from Switzerland and KU Leuven from Belgium. This meetup was organized by the team of Bordeaux. Catch them here!!
We participated at several activities:
A discussion about biosafety organized by the iGEM team from Paris Saclay. They suggested us to expose our biosafety methods.
A debate concerning plastic pollution organized by the iGEM team from Paris Pasteur.
- We initiated collaboration with a team from Brasil: the Brasil-USP. They worked on a similar project: the degradation of tyre (made of latex). We planned to exchange with them. In details, we wanted to test their enzyme on our polymers, which are their raw materials, and they did our enzymatic modelling. Unfortunately both teams had problems with enzyme purification. So bad luck, our collaboration did not work! There is a little wiki hiding right here!
- We also participated to the newsletter done by the Amoy iGEM team from China Here are our Chinese friends!
Here a group picture of the France meetup
What others did for us
We've set up a survey competition between all IGEM teams. According to the number of completed surveys, we've awarded medals:
- between 5 to 15 surveys, a bronze medal
- between 15 to 30 surveys, a silver medal
- more than 30 surveys, a gold medal!

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
ADD PARTS
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

Hamburg,2015,Team:Hamburg#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," Engineering (Vincent and Maurice)
Vincent and Maurice spent an incredible amount of time trying to learn HTML and CSS, which they had never used before, to code up an appropriate website for our team’s online representation. Together they wrote several hundred lines of code and struggled through many long debugging sessions. We are really thankful for their endurance and studiousness.
Wiki Editing (Dana)
Dana was the editor-in-chief of our wiki as well as the main contributor of texts to the wiki. Her articulate and nonchalant style of writing makes reading our wiki pages a real joy. She always managed to be politely insistent, when people forgot to document their projects on the wiki in time and is mainly responsible for the completeness and elaborateness of our wiki.
Art Design (Sonja)
Our favorite biology student and art design hobbyist Sonja created our beautiful logo and put a lot of effort into the appearence of our poster and presentation. She has drawn a whole bunch of different logo versions, almost until getting carpal tunnel syndrome, before we had finally chosen one. By always stoically enduring our - partially even contradictory - change requests, she has definitely earned our deep respect.
Modeling (Maurice and Vincent)
Maurice did the network modeling, while Vincent was responsible for the RNA structure. They were both utilizing many skills and a lot of knowledge, that they acquired at their respective bachelor theses at the Center for Bioinformatics Hamburg. Without their broad understanding of the mathematical and physical foundations, we could not have worked out the theoretical background of our project so well, which is why they contributed to our work in an extremely significant way.
Risk Assessment (Kira)
Kira has worked very closely with WMC to tailor their software suite QSEC specifically to our needs. She has spent countless hours with exhaustively assessing and compiling assets, processes, threats and vulnerabilities, while at the same time reading lots of German and European standards and guidelines for risk management in laboratories. Her job has surely been the most bureaucratic one and she has proven really strong nerves carrying it through.
Safety (Nikolas)
Niko was responsible for the safety of our project and was reliably checking all used organisms and chemicals. Moreover, he was constantly reminding us of every important deadline and filled out all the respective forms.
Workplace (Artur)
Artur was the main person in charge for the autolysis part of our project and arranged our workplace. Due to his pessimistic nature he called in many cases in a necessary way diverse ideas into questions. Because of him some rational decisions were made and some less were not. He kept our"

The defused bombs are brought to a company where they are sawn open and where the explosive compounds are burned.
But why is bomb disposal necessary? “When bombs are in a forest or a field, they don’t pose that much of a threat. But at a building site, in a city, they are a real danger when if they are hit.” Another danger is posed by spontaneously exploding bombs. “Under the influence of humidity and time, chemicals of the detonation mechanism can react with the metal of the bomb casing, which can cause spontaneous detonation.” A special type of bomb is particularly susceptible to spontaneous detonation. These are bombs designed to not explode on impact, but up to 144 hours afterwards. These were mostly used in WWII on industrial areas like the Ruhr Area. On impact, an ampoule filled with acetone is broken, which slowly degrades a piece of celluloid which holds a needle in place. This needle will hit the detonation mechanism when released, causing the explosion.  However, this often has not worked as planned, and the bombs remain unexploded, with the risk of the needle coming off and causing detonating at a random moment.
Besides discussing the work of Mr. Lenz, we also discussed the TNT-sensing module of our project. Since land mines are not a real issue anymore in Europe (except from former Yugoslavia) and therefore not in the field of expertise of Mr. Lenz, we mostly discussed the detection of unexploded bombs. This kind of bombs is hermetically closed to keep water out, so Mr. Lenz was skeptical of the chances of TNT leaking out of the bombs, which is a necessity for our project. The types of bombs Mr. Lenz usually encounters have very thick metal casings (6 mm and thicker) and although they rust, it is very rare that corrosion forms spots where TNT can leak out. However, he mentioned that “a free lying bomb might emit some gaseous TNT, which can be detected, although it has very low concentration.” Another opportunity for TNT to leak out is through cracks in the"

In our persuits we have been inspired by  and support mutually with Collegium Invisibile and Offtopicarium who also realize some bottom-up initiatives and have excellent Human Practice. We understand, however, that our contribution is only a droplet in the sea of knowledge. Still, we envisage project to be a small thing with greater perspectives. That is why we are searching for new ways of communication via Scientia Crastina (latin for ‘The Science of Tomorrow’). Our aim is to encourage to seek new possibilities of collaboration of the interdisciplinary projects through open communication in science.

Lanthan Hospital
Moving to implement of our dreams in practice we comprised thoughts derived from our Human Practice in the raport “Celulare: transforming healthcare"" in which we present Future Lanthan Hospital Model. The basic idea behind Lanthan Hospital Model is to integrate synthetic biology lab with hospital. This is sort of start-up strategy with systems impact, which we set in the context of a broader healthcare transformation. As Celulare is focused on lanthanides bioremediation, we want to propose strategy to optimal allocation of these elements and other deficit resources on healthcare market. That is why we have indicated several possible applications for novel economic concepts of Nobel Prize Winners in ‘Nobel Lantan Economy and Nobel Human Practice’ section. We believe that synthetic biology approach, especially iGEM itself may ""influence the world from protein, to policy, to pixels.” To make it happen we develop Future Lantan Hospital Model.

In this way, the Crabtree effect could be monitored (perhaps even online) by measuring fluorescence and used to regulate the amount of glucose to be fed.
EXPERIMENTAL OUTLINE
- We ordered the DNA constructions: pADH2-YAP1 protein and pTRR-GFP protein that were cloned in plasmid pUC57 with a bacterial origin of replication.
- We obtain the Yeplac181 and Yep352 yeast vectors by our laboratory.
- We carried out four transformations of E. coli strain DH5, one for each plasmid DNA (the two constructions and the two vectors), in order to amplify them. See the Transformation Protocol Using Heat Shock .
- We obtained several E. coli transformants in four plates and took some colonies of each DNA construction (from both constructions and both vectors) and cultured them in liquid medium over night at 37ºC in shaking flasks.
- A day after, we extracted the plasmid DNA. See the Mini-preps protocol. See the Mini-prep Protocol .
- We obtained the purified constructions (both in pUC57 plasmid) and the vectors for yeast (YEplac181 and YEp352) also purified. See the Protocol for Gel Extraction
- We digested the four DNAs with restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI in order to obtain compatible ends. See the Digestion Protocol .
- We ligated the pTRR-GFP construction with the Yep352 vector and the ADH2-YAP1 construction with the Yeplac181 vector. See the ligation Protocol .
- The day after that we transformed E. coli with the results of the ligation in order to amplify the final constructions (pTRR-GFP/Yep352 and pADH2-YAP1/YEplac181). We located the recombinant constructs using X-Gal and white/blue selection.
- We took some of these white colonies and cultured them in liquid medium overnight at 37ºC in shaking flasks.
- The day after we extracted the plasmid DNA. See the Mini-prep Protocol .
- After this, we checked the final purified recombinant constructs by electrophoresis, restriction digest and DNA capilar sequencing.
- We introduced the first of the DNA recombinant plasmids in the yeast. See the Yeast transformation protocol .
- We selected the transformants by growth in solid and liquid mineral medium attending to the auxotrophic markers and checked the presence of the construction by PCR."
Goettingen,2013,Team:Goettingen#HumanPractice#PanelDiscussion_-_-_TEXT.html," as the multiple antibiotic usages due to mass animal husbandry were mentioned as potential causes. Furthermore the cultivation of positive resistant plants against herbicides was named by Mr. Prunzel-Ulrich and may also be a genesis of multi-resistant bacteria, which can probable be transferred to humans.
Proposed approaches to fight the development multi-resistant bacteria were less frequent prescription and ingestion of antibiotics and better maintenance conditions in mass breeding sheds. To address existing antibiotic resistances of bacteria Prof. Groß proclaimed a prohibition of some selected antibiotics all over Europe for a longer period.
The second part of the panel discussion focused on the topic gene technology. We as biologists find gene technology in our daily lab work but it is also very common in agriculture and industry. Therefore, we wanted to know whether it already is essential for us and whether it is possible to live without gene technology. From the scientific point of view, Dr. Kalinowsky and Prof .Groß agreed that gene technology has already arrived in Europe and that it is indispensable in areas such as research and pharmacy.
However, on the agricultural side there were split opinions. Nevertheless, all panel guests agreed that the declaration of genetically modified food must be improved in the interest of consumers.
Dr. Wurbs advocated the use of gene technology to improve plant breeding as it has many benefits for the farmers. Furthermore, he mentioned that the demand determines the offer and that gene technology is only applied as long as the consumer desires those products. Mr. Prunzel-Ulrich said that he sees no need and advantages but rather disadvantages in the use of gene technology in agriculture. Mr. Hirschfeld met this topic in an open way but confirmed that there is no need for it to saturate the German population.
Finally we asked our panel guests an admittedly fictitious question: “What law regarding the discussed topics would you introduce if you were the king of Germany?
All guests agreed in a law for better declaration of food and a statute for an optimized education for everyone to enable an objective judgment when forming their own opinions regarding topics like gene technology.
After these nice closing remarks we finished our panel discussion with many acknowledgements to our panel guests, the whole audience and of course to the members of the iGEM Team Braunschweig, which only had travelled to Göttingen for our discussion. To leisurely end the day, our panel guests and the iGEM Team Braunschweig joined us for dinner in the Kartoffelhaus.
To evaluate the success of our panel discussion we handed over questionnaires to the audience. Here you can see the results of our survey and process it"

NTU-Singapore,2018,Team:NTU-Singapore#IHP_-_-_TEXT.html,". Whereas for people in China, there is no obvious peak or valley, suggesting an equal distribution.
Figure 5. Confidence level of making an informed choice regarding gene editing
In terms of factors in decision making,  Singaporean are most concerned about the safety of the technology and the price as Singapore ranks first in these two categories, followed by China and Indonesia. China and Singapore are more concerned with ethics than Indonesia. Indonesia ranks lowest for all three factors of cost, safety, and ethics. In weighing DNA editing over RNA, from the responses with a choice made, all countries show a higher percentage of people choosing RNA editing over DNA editing. In Singapore, there are 42% of the respondents choosing RNA editing, relatively higher than those choosing DNA editing, which is 30%.  Therefore, the public in Singapore favor towards RNA editing.
Figure 6. Significance of factors in affecting decision regarding gene editing
From the results, we are able to conclude that there is a significant value in developing RNA editing technology and the important factors we should think about are safety and cost. There are more interesting observations we observed from the survey.  You can view our complete report here.
 Our Actions
As the general public prefers RNA editing, we decided to expand our research to include RNA editing. As the public deems safety and cost to be the most important factors, we also researched in ways to ensure safety level and reduce the cost of current gene editing technologies. However, we still think it is necessary to engage the other stakeholder in the context of gene therapy, the doctors, who will be giving professional advice to patients who need gene therapy. We want to hear their views on the concerns and choices of the public and possible ways to address these issues. 
Interview with Medical Professionals
 Motivation
After our survey, with the public concerns that we collected, we want to interview the last stakeholder in our conversation, the  professional doctors, as they are the ones utilizing gene therapy in the future, therefore it is important to know what their attitude towards gene therapy is. They also know the needs of the patients from a professional standpoint rather than an emotional one, so they are able to provide us with valuable suggestions to address issues with the patients.

Take 100 uL of bacterial solution into 5 ml of LB liquid medium. After incubating at 37 ° C for 3 h, 5 mM IPTG was added, the temperature was adjusted to 37 ° C, and shaking was incubated at 300 rpm for 3 h, and then an appropriate amount of hydrazine solution (ethanol preparation) was added. The bacterial solution was shaken at 37 ° C, 300 rpm for 4 to 24 hours. We successfully got our indigo produced by E.coli. (Figure.4) Besides observing the extracted indigo by eye, we performed an absorbance measurement in the UV-Vis spectra under 640nm and made its standard curve (Figure5).
We detected flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO) with a 6xHis-tag by SDS-page (Figure 6) and Western-blot (Figure 7). And all the results showed that FMO has been expressed successfully under the regulation of promoter pT7 in BL21. The protein of FMO-His tag is about 54kDa.
To have a higher expression level of indigo, we optimized the fermentation conditions. The concentration of Indole, IPTG and time were investigated by single factor experiment. (Figure 8&Figure9&Figure 10)
When the concentration of lanthanum in the medium reached 150 mg/L, the amount of indigo synthesis and conversion were the highest. Since ruthenium inhibits both host cell and enzyme catalysis, further increases in substrate concentration products are reduced.
Experiments have shown that IPTG can induce the expression of flavin monooxygenase. Considering the production needs, we studied the effect of lactose concentration on the synthesis of indigo. The results are shown in Figure 7 (the concentration of strontium is 150mg/L, the same below). When the final concentration of IPTG was 0.5 mM, the concentration of indigo in the conversion solution was the highest.
The results of the relationship between transformation time and indigo are shown in Figure 10. After 3 h, the concentration of indigo in the medium tends to be the maximum stable value.

Carefully transfer supernatant to the spin column and centrifuge for 1 minute. Discard flow-through.
Re-insert column in the collection tube and add 200μL of Plasmid Wash Buffer 1. If the DNA will be used in transfection, incubate 5 minutes. Centrifuge for 1 minute. Discarding the flow-through is optional.
Plasmid Wash Buffer 1 removes RNA, protein, and endotoxin.
Note: The collection tube is designed to hold 800μL of flow-through fluid and still allow the tip of the column to be safely above the top of the liquid. Empty the tube whenever necessary to ensure the column tip and flow-though do not make contact.
Add 400μL of Plasmid Wash Buffer 2 and centrifuge for 1 minute.
Transfer column to a clean 1.5mL microfuge tube. Use care to ensure that the tip of the column has not come into contact with the flow-through. If there is any doubt, re-spin the column for 1 minute before inserting it into the clean microfuge tube.
Add ≥ 30 μL DNA Elution Buffer to the center of the matrix. Wait for 1 minute, then spin for 1 minute to elute DNA.
Note: Nuclease-free water (pH 7–8.5) can also be used to elute the DNA.
Delivery of the Monarch DNA Elution Buffer should be made directly to the center of the column to ensure the matrix is completely covered for maximal efficiency of elution.
Yield may slightly increase if a larger volume of DNA Elution Buffer is used, but the DNA will be less concentrated as a result of dilution.
For larger plasmids (≥ 10 kb), heating the DNA Elution Buffer to 50°C prior to eluting and extending the incubation time after buffer addition to 5 minutes can improve yield.
Proceed to Nanodrop for DNA quantification. Be sure to blank with the appropriate elution substance (ie. Elution Buffer OR Nuclease-free water).
Leaving the lab
Prior to leaving the lab, you should:
Clean dirty glassware, or at least set aside the glassware to be cleaned by a designated individual.
Wipe down your workspace.
Ensure that all materials have been returned to their places, and that the plates have been properly stored in the fridge.

Figure 1. The plasmid pNF
The homology regions for the knock-out constructs are designed to be around 1000 base pairs each. All Synechocystis constructs are modified versions of the pNF plasmid, shown in Figure 1, which contains the E. coli origin of replication pBR322, an ampicillin resistance marker and a kanamycin resistance marker (KmR). This plasmid was linearized with the primers in Table 1, which only amplified the origin of replication and amp marker, before Gibson assembly.
One important thing to keep in mind when knocking out genes in Synechocystis is the fact that it has several copies of its genome [5]. To make sure that all of the copies of the specific amino acid synthesising gene is knocked out, transformants should be restreaked several times and checked through colony PCR [6].

Constructs for simultaneous knock-out and insertion
1. Knock-out argH + insert ackA
This construct consists of five parts: upstream homology region of argH, KmR cassette, pTrc promoter, ackA and the downstream homology region, Figure 2. This construct knocks out the argH gene when transformed into Synechocystis, making it an arginine auxotroph which is needed to make the cyanobacteria dependent on the producing organism. Furthermore, the endogenous ackA is inserted under the control of the strong consecutive promoter pTrc, for increased acetate production. By combining these two modifications into one construct, the number of constructs were reduced and thus the number of different markers needed.
Figure 2. Construct for simultaneous knock-out of ArgH and insertion of AckA
All the primers used for this construct are shown in Table 2. AckA and the flanking sequences of argH are amplified from genomic DNA of Synechocystis. The KmR cassette is amplified from the pNF plasmid and the pTrc promoter is amplified from the pCyJ2 plasmid.

However, we still look forward to more modifications of our biological pathway                                         and system.
The most important intermediate product, pyruvate,                                         is also possible to be converted to other compounds by E. coli native                                         enzymes or constructed enzymes                                         which is clone into E. coli from other organism.                                         For future work of pyruvate, we expect that it is predicable to produce amino                                         acid, fatty acid,                                         biofuel and even biodegradable plastic. Pyruvate is crucial for central                                         metabolism pathway,                                         the TCA cycle, of most organism and has the potential to become vary                                         biochemistry compounds.
We set our first future goal at producing glutamine,                                         an essential amino acid for human and some animals. We can simply purify it as                                         a nutrient supply.                                         Not only for medical and daily usage for people, but also for animal husbandry.                                         Furthermore, glutamine can easily convert to other amino acid, and potentially                                         produce other proteins.

Furthermore, researchers have successfully constructed pathways                                         produced cellulose and                                         Poly 3-Hydroxybutyrate-co-3-Hydroxyvalerate through the TCA cycle.                                         We are confident of manufacturing more valuable and diverse products from                                         pyruvate.
WAs for the device we designed, we expect that it is possible                                         to modify our device for power                                         generator and other industry. Our device can utilize CO2 and convert                                         it into various valuable products.                                         With our system, companies can not only reduce CO2 emission but also                                         make profits.

Newcastle,2013,Team:Newcastle#Notebook#calendar_-_-_TEXT.html," the seeds we planted on August 19th and observed that the chinese cabbage seeds had begun to germinate. This meant that they were ready to absorb L-forms. We soaked 20 cabbage seeds for 3 hours in 5ml of L-form solution. We created 5%(w/v) mannitol, B. subtilis rod and E.coli rod controls. The seeds were then washed with distilled water (to lyse extracellular L-forms) and replated on Murishage and Skoog agar plates. This was done following the Production of L-form containing Plants protocol from stage five onwards.

L-form Growth Curve
Aim and Methods:
Please refer to August 12th .
Results:
An OD of 0.00 and 0.00 was obtained. For unknown circumstances, the L-form growth curve instead of increasing steadily throughout the week, it increased during the first 48hrs and then decreased throughout the rest of the week. We will reattempt to construct the L-form growth curve again at a later date.
L-Form simulation
Last couple days were quite busy in terms of L-Form simulation, was trying different ways to make L-Forms divide. Found a quite neat solution which required me to create another list, with empty objects (when L-Forms fuse, 1 of the previous L-Forms become redunandt), but using this method number of L-forms in simulation won't exceed initial number of balls.

TU_Munich,2010,Team:TU Munich#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," input transmitter and green for the output transmitter.Each switch and or later logical unit has to be flanked by a promotor and another constitutive terminator, to allow RNA-production by RNA-polymerase in a proper way.
Switch
The basic strcutrue of a switch (left) and a transmitter RNA (right). See text for details.
Roughly speaking, a switch can be regarded as an enhanced switchable transcriptional terminator. The enhancement can be described easier by dividing a switch into its functional components:
Target site
The target site is the functional core element of our switches, allowing a shift between an ""on"" and ""off"" state. Since we work on the level of RNA-production (transcription), a ""switchable"" transcriptional terminator is suitable for this purpose. By allowing or preventing formation of a transcriptional terminator, that is by switching between termination and antitermination it is possible to represent an ""off"" and an ""on"" state, respectively. Therefore, the target site is the 5' ending of the terminator and is required for a stable terminator formation. It should be noted that this principle was also observed in nature.
To highlight and illustrate the functional principle of our switches, only the part of the terminator which is involved in interacting with a transmitter molecule and which is responsible for shifting between ""on"" and ""off"" state is called target site. The remaining terminator sequence is called terminator in the following, even if both, target site and terminator build up the terminator structure occurring in nature.
The important aspect of our switches is the fact that all switches will hold the same identical target site. Therefore having found one functional ""switchable"" terminator, will allow almost unlimited upscaling since this terminator can be used for a large library of switches. This is the main difference to previous works done on this field, which always required developing a new shifting principle for each switch. [12] [13] [14] Beside this scalability, this principle provides a comparable on/off shifting rate (responds function) for all switches, avoiding complex fine tuning of molecular networks.
To sum it up, the target site, allows to switch between an ""on"" and ""off"" state. But so far, the switch is not capable of performing specific interaction with transmitter molecules. This is where the recognition site comes into play.
Recognition site
The recognition site defines which transmitter molecule can actually interact with the switch. Therefore, a unique recognition site is generated for each switch and is positioned right upstream of the target site. In principle the recognition can be any random sequence as long as it remains unique within"

Most presentations may be considered successful when its audience reaches this stage.
3. Analysis
In contrast to comprehension, which emphasize on ‘comprehend all the knowledge and relationship as a whole’, analysis focuses more on breaking the whole project into basic elements again. Through evaluation of different basic element and their relationship, audience are supposed to understand why these elements are organized in this specific way instead of the many other random combinations.
Analysis prepares the audience for making creative changes on the existing project.
4. Inspiration
We have thought a long time about what should be the ultimate goal of an iGEM presentation, and finally we name the highest level of our taxonomy as ‘inspiration’.
After the entire preparing step mentioned above, the audience have converted a new and unfamiliar project into a dynamic part of their own knowledge system. From then on, the original project can be easily abstracted, broken down and forming into new ideas, and that is the most charming point of the communication.

A set of 3-D printed brick toy inspired by the iGEM taxonomy
When we look through the iGEM presentation taxonomy ourselves, we found that it is more difficult to help the audience go through the last two levels of the taxonomy with only a presentation alone. So, we came up with an idea that designing a 3-D printed brick toy may help with these process.
The brick toy is naturally composed of basic elements. They are designed to be easily pulled apart and recombined again and again, thus giving plenty of opportunities for the players to do the comprehension and analysis work. Especially for our recombinase-base system, which actually involves a turning and moving gene circuit itself, a brick toy helps to visualize the process how the circuit changing from one state into another. In that way, the players can easily check whether or not his/her new design can work properly, making the whole ‘inspiration’ stage more enjoyable.
We have brought the brick toy to the iGEM conference CCiC and also to our club fair. It received warm welcome there.
The brick toy is composed of the following parts.

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#PolicyAndPractices#PolicyAndPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," by"" [the fact that they are] the product of their organization […]. There is no separation between producer and product. Being and doing [of an] autopoietic unity is inseparable, and this constitutes their specific type of organization ""(Maturana, Varela 1987). Consequently, the products of synthetic biology would not been self-caused, but organized externally by humans. Consequently, following this train of thought, scientists will never succeed in producing an autopoietic system synthetically. The human as manufacturer of the genome states himself as the creator of the organism. The postulated unit of producer and product can never be succeeded. The organism remains heteronomous by the determination of the genome by man.
This logical problem with the autopoiesis-theory in synthetic biology leads to restricted and modified applicability of the theory .
Thus, the following discussion will concentrate on the definition of life first illustrated and includes the autopoiesis theory in restricted form, as this will gain importance in synthetic biology for future developments.
After consideration of the machine concept and definitions of life it is evident that the organisms named ""living machine"" are by no means machines but living organisms. Today synthetically engineered organisms satisfy the minimum requirements of reproduction, metabolism and evolution. The term ""machine"" emphasizes the intended machine-like function. The organisms are alive but perform a machine-related purpose.
The claim of the synthetic biology is to create living organisms, which act simultaneously as a machine. The synthetic biology changes the definitions of living organisms and aims to abolish the separation between life and machine. It follows that the discussion with this term is not regarding the definition, but rather an ontological problem.
The term suggests a utilization of life with the pure focus on the control and goals of the humans.
On the one hand the term ""living machine"" generates an ethical problem, for the reason that it reduces living organisms to their purpose and implies a total control of created existence. Man breeds and keeps animals for the purpose of procuring food, which includes utilization and control of these creatures. There is an analogy to the organisms of the synthetic biology, however in synthetic biology humans appear as self-creators. Synthetic biology aims the creation of new organisms, in which the structures and properties are artificially defined by man whereas breeding and keeping animals is still subordinated through evolution.
On the other hand, ""living machine"" belies the fact that, due to a lack of understanding any intervention in the genome can indeed provide the desired functionality, but might also have not foreseeable effects. A feature of living cells is the interaction with the environment. It is difficult to assess"

Human Practices
For many within the scientific community, Synthetic Biology is a very exciting new area of technology with great potential. However, there are many social and ethical issues which must be addressed if the field is to be able to develop safely.
For these reasons, we here at Imperial iGEM felt it was important to explore the Human Practices issues and questions surrounding the project.

Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more comprehensive understanding of the practical conditions and improved our own project.
Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we"

TU_Munich,2012,Team:TU Munich#Notebook#Meetings_-_-_TEXT.html,":
Promoters: Design a library containing three types of promoters: ethanol inducible (for EtOH-Sensor), light switchable and chemically inducible (for control of biosynthesis).
Biosynthesis: The main focus will be on products derived from Coumaryl-CoA, because it is an intermediate for many interesting molecules. In addition to this, we also want to try to establish caffeine-synthesis, because only two genes are required.
Proteins: The secretion of proteins is a good idea, because it will give us a third field of research. This module is promising, because it is likely to lead to easy successes (only one gene required for the production of thaumatin...)
Next Steps
Everybody should assign themselves to one of the following topics:
I) Detailed literature research
For one desired product/construct, find out exactly...
How many genes are required?
Which genes (including nucleotide sequence)?
How do we get the physical DNA (ask a research lab to send it to us, extract from organisms via PCR, synthesis...)?
Please post your results in the wiki
II) ""Taskforce Vector Design""
This group should focus on how to transform yeast. Which vectors are available, what techniques are necessary,...? For example, look at the 2011 iGEM Teams John Hopkins and Britsh Columbia. They worked with yeast and got decent results.
Interviews
Interviews with experts will take place on Friday, March 9th. If you are interested in helping, please contact Lara Kuntz.
Miscellaneous
Does anybody know a student from ""Brauereiwesen""? It might be good to have one on the team!
Tuesday March 20th
Overview
The main topics of the meeting were the interviews and the project structure. We agreed that everybody should research his/her topic until the next meeting in two weeks in order to get into the lab as soon as possible (beginning of April). Additionally, we should meet during a weekend (e.g. 15th of April) to work together for a whole day and to address issues such as fundraising and human practice.
We agreed on the following project structure:
Project structure
Promoter and regulation systems
1. Ethanol-inducible
2. Light-switchable
3. Chemically inducible
4. Constitutive active
Biosynthesis systems
1. Coumaryl-pathway
2. Limonene
3. Caffeine
4. Thaumatin

St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#debate_-_-_TEXT.html," was produced by another iGEM team would inherently need to be released into the field to realize their application.  The fear here is that the potential exists during tests for bacteria to become endemic to the environment, colonizing rapidly and making eradication of the bacteria all but impossible.  After colonization, similar problems to the “escape the lab” scenario occur, including environmental damage or infection of animals or humans.
We also introduced the ethical dilemmas faced with respect to the field of synthetic biology, particularly with regard to what moral value should be placed on iGEM.  We discussed the idea of the minimum genome project and how this could redefine what we think of as life.  We asked whether it was for scientists alone to decide on what constitutes 'life' or whether this is a matter for much wider debate, hence engagement schemes like this one.  We also talked about the fears of us 'playing god' by engaging in synthetic biology and the possible ill-effects of humans tampering with complicated biological systems which we do not fully understand.  We finished by talking about the concept of a 'dual-use' dilemma being created, and used nuclear fission experiments in the 20th Century as an example of what this means.
While these issues seem worrying, they were introduced alongside how best they could be prevented, in order to show the audience that while there are dangers associated with synthetic biology, the protection of the public at large is paramount in the minds of scientists worldwide.  The threat of bio-terrorism is greatly reduced upon the realization of the resources required to synthesize and grow a bacteria or virus are vast, and not easily obtainable.  These range from chemicals used to retain the virus’ virulence during storage, to a dispersal mechanism for pathogen release, and finally, serious financial backing and access to a full bio-molecular laboratory.  The risk of colonization by released synthetic organisms is not as daunting a fear after the understanding that genetically-engineered microorganisms are usually less evolutionarily fit than their naturally-occurring counterparts.  Strict laboratory protocols, transportation procedures, and even cell-level safeguards, such as the kill switch St Andrews iGEM has built, can be utilized to help reduce the chance of widespread colonization.
Student Response
Overall students' questions were around three major areas: the direct applications of synthetic biology, the impact that releasing a GEM could have on the environment, and how ownership of organisms works.
Within the application area, students were mostly curious about how synthetic biology could be used to treat diseases. Cancer and HIV occupied a prime place in the discussion. Both iGEM teams explained that research in"
