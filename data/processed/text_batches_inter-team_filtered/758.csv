Future Experiments
In the future we are going to do additional testing to see the full amount of time it takes for a clot to fully form as well as running multiple runs of these experiments to better our results that we have so far. We also want to run an osmotic shock periplasm test to see what is stored in the periplasm and hopefully there will be our viper protein and the Thiol isomerase."

It has been reported that polymer can increase the efficiency of extraction and the system can be divided into two phases automatically without above cloud point. We used Reppal PES100 as polymer to do this experiment. However, it doesn’t work.
Formal experiment using Triton X-100 as detergent and HAc/NaAc as buffer.
The cloud point of Triton X-100 is 64-65 centigrade. We changed detergent and did this experiment again. We put the tubes in the heat block to make system separated. However, there aren’t any florescence in the detergent phase (the lower phase).
Formal experiment using Triton X-114 as detergent and HAc/NaAc as buffer.
The cloud point of Triton X-114 is 22 centigrade. We changed detergent and did this experiment again. We made the system separated at the room temperature, and used centrifuge to get a better separation. However, there aren’t any florescence in the detergent phase (the lower phase).
Summary
We used fusion proteins which are GFP-sJanus, GFP-sJanus-m, BFP-sJanus, BFP-sJanus-m, RFP-sJanus, RFP-sJanus-m, Cut1-sJanus, Cut1-sJanus-m to conduct this experiment. The results are as follows.
1.   The optimal volume of Berol 532 is 5% (v/v) of protein solution and temperature is 20 centigrade.
2.   The process of shaking is important. Generally, the speed of 300r/min working for 1h does work.
3.   The concentration of protein solution should be low.
4.   The optimal buffer is HAc/NaAc(pH=7.5).
In this experiment, we confirmed the strengths using aqueous two-phase systems and successfully separate the target proteins from bulk protein phase based on ATPS at a high partition rate. The most important is that we constructed a standard protocol to separate different kinds of proteins.
Design
This year, we focus on solving the protein purification problem in biological lab. As we talked about in the Protein Extraction Kit page in project description, we aim to replace the lengthy and expensive chromatography with Janus-based aqueous two-phase system. Our design shows many clever points.
Above all, we take advantage of synthetic biology, using the core of iGEM- BioBrick and RFC Assembly Method , to build a universal purification tag. This tag includes a linker containing TEV"

Campus Activity
Throughout this year, we worked hard to popularize the concept of synthetic biology and antimicrobial resistance on campus. As college students, campus is our most familiar and influential place. We organized a series of campus activities, both on college campus and on high school campus, with the hope to recruit freshmen or high school students who are interested in science and would like to devote themselves to our projects. After all, the development of synthetic biology should start from students.
In December 2013, we held an activity named “Early birds in the Laboratory” for the freshmen of our college. Basic experimental skills of molecular biology and the concept of synthetic biology were taught.
In June 2014, on the opening day of our university, we set up a tent on campus to answer questions about the synthetic biology and iGEM for high school students.
In June 2014, we arrived at Chaozhou district for a three-day propaganda in the local high schools. We visited 4 high schools, had our tents there to popularize synthetic biology, and gave presentations to deliver knowledge. Meanwhile, our brochures about synthetic biology reached more than 2,000 students.
We organized and participated in the ""2014 National High Educated Teenager Scientific Camp of south china university of technology"" during which we gave a lecture about the advanced synthetic biology to combat the Antimicrobial Resistance and iGEM to all of the teenagers joined this activity.
""The 2014 National High Educated Teenager Scientific Camp-sub-camp of South China University of Technology"" was successfully held at SCUT. 200 senior students from Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Yunnan took part in this educational activity. This activity was directed by the theme ""Fly to SCUT,"

After we met and exchanged ideas with BIT-China during the meeting in Beijing, we confirmed our collaboration relationship. In the light of helping each other, we assisted them for a new gene circuits.
At the same time, they helped us finish the pre experimental the fish experiment.
The LANZHOU iGEM 2016 team consists of 1 graduate students, 14 undergraduate students and 6 instructors. The main part of our project was finished by students from LANZHOU iGEM. We would like to thank our 6 instructors sincerely, for their time and efforts of helping us improve our project. Our work can be divided into 7 parts which are shown below. Each part of work was finished by several student members.
We helped them finish the “another inhibitor” system (arac+pBAD+B0034+TetR+B0015+pTet+B0034+RFP+B0015).(Fig 1)
Fig 1 Inhibitor system construction.
In this system, pBAD is one of the inducible promoter (from BBa_K808000) which can be induced by arabinose. B0034 and B0032 are two kinds of strong ribosome binding sites (RBS) and the strength of B0032 is only 33.96% of B0034. pTet promoter is constitutively ON and repressed by TetR repressor.
We were very glad to help them because this “inhibitor” system is vital for their project. They use the concentration of inhibitor proteins as a signal indicating the plasmid numbers, and it can trigger the downstream reaction by activating the killer gene while the plasmid concentration reduce to the threshold.
At the same time, they helped us finish the pre experimental the fish experiment.
There are three crucial components, INP, GFP, and Metal Catcher (Fig 2). INP (Ice Nucleation Protein) is an extrinsic membrane protein of E.coli and acts as an anchor. GFP acts as a reporter while metal catcher can bind heavy-metal ions. This is how we assemble the crucial elements.
At the same time, they helped us finish the pre experimental the fish experiment.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model#Cost Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html,"; mainly ODEs. Khan Academy was very helpful with this.
With all three reactions being reversible, MATLABs dsolve function was not able to solve our differential equations. We tried them by hand but were not able to solve them analytically. We had to solve numerically and chose the Euler method. This involves iterating with short time intervals (here we used dt ≈ 1s) between each calculation using a loop to keep a record of how the substances changed over time. We then graphed these values as follows:
k1
k-1
k2
k-2
We’ve recreated this model so it’s actually running in the browser - try dragging the sliders above the graph to modify the rate constants.
Mass action kinetics model with transcription and translation
The first simple model neglected transcription and translation completely, which meant it was an excessive simplification and consequently was not that useful. To address these shortcomings, we created a second model, derived from parts of Tobias Stögbauer’s PhD, with many more species. [5]
This model was very slow to run (so slow we’re not going to try run it in the browser), as there were many species and thus more calculations needed to be done per loop. However, it primarily was slow as we needed a small dt value to keep the model accurate so there were more loops in total.
We had to use a very small dt value or errors could easily add up with so many species. It ended up taking about a minute to run each simulation which wasn’t acceptable for us, as we wanted to be able to quickly change parameters and ideally test a range of parameters. Speeding up the model would make it more useful to the wetlab team. They then could vary each of our parameters and see how they affected GFP output, for example seeing the effects of different switch designs and experimental setups.
Having lots of species also made it harder to find accurate rate constants for all the steps in the reaction. Tobias Stögbauer’s PhD was very useful for this, although many of his values weren’t that applicable to us as we used a different cell-free system leading to inaccuracies -  which were amplified when dt was increased.
It was also difficult to get useful data from the model as there were so many parameters that changing just one was unlikely to have a significant effect on the final result. This made it harder to draw conclusions from the model. For similar reasons it would also have made it hard to adjust the parameters to fit to our lab data when we had it. More parameters also increased the total uncertainty, decreasing the precision of our model.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Model Alkane mfc_-_-_TEXT.html," general cell density for one unit of OD600 is 0.3 gDW/L, the hexane uptake rate is estimated to be by the following equation
Hexane uptake rate(mM/h) = hexane uptake flux(mmol/gDW-h) X Conversion Factor(GDW/L)
The ASS enzymatic reaction model predicts alkane conversion rate to reach 1.8 X 10-7 mM/h
when 0.02uM initial alkane concentration is supplied under excess fumarate condition. This provides insight that micro-molar level of alkane is possible to generate current up to 2.189 A/gDW
Initial alkane concentration required (mM) = Specific Rate Constant(h-1)/Alkane uptake rate(mMh-1)

Subsequently, we aimed to test the binding of the Gal-3 fusion protein to the LPS of P. aeruginosa as shown previously (Kupper, Böcker, Liu et al., 2013). Apparently, because of insufficient sensitivity of the used fluorescence microscope, this could not be confirmed and would require further experiments, idealy using other detection methods.
After we received the collection of pSBX-expression vectors from Team Heidelberg, we used Gibson assembly to make K1319020 from K1319003 and pSBX1A3, which is the translational unit for an mRFP-Gal3 fusion protein with a C-terminal 6xHis tag:
K1319009
This BioBrick is a construction intermediate of K1319003 (gal3), E1010 (mRFP), K1319007 (6xHis tag) to K1319020 (translational unit of the fusion protein).
In addition, we cloned our BioBrick K1319003 into the pET17 expression vector and expressed all combinations of fusion proteins in E. coli BL21(DE3). An SDS-PAGE showed that all fusion proteins were fully translated:
Pellets of different fusion protein expressions
Expression in the pET17 vector was much more leaky than the expression in the pSBX vectors.
SDS-PAGE of K1319020 expression
The fusion protein was fully translated to the correct molecular mass of 74 kDa.

Marit - PR Manager
As PR manager my function was managing contact with the community. Therefore I placed weekly, or more often, updates on facebook and twitter. I went with Michelle to the communication advisors of the TU Delft, and with their help arranged radio interviews. I also coordinated our project movie, and managed to get articles on different websites and magazines. Besides PR, I helped support others in their managing tasks. For policy and practice I joined Michelle with a few of her interviews, including organising the day of wonder, and we are going to organize a workshop in the Science Center of Delft for kids. For the modelling, I wrote the biofilm strength model, and helped develop the other models. For the wet lab, I helped whenever needed, such as doing the western blot experiment and the TEM microscopy.  For Hardware, i arranged that we get all the Knex, and was part of the designing process of the 3D-printers, creating the manual, and joined Anne to Groningen. For the Interlab studies, I made the statistical analysis of the data.
Anne - Budget and Fundraising Manager
As my manager name suggests, I handled all financial administration for the team, and acquired the sponsors. For the wet lab, I helped in the lab with cloning, and digitalising the lab book.  For hardware, I made the “Building the printer” movie, helped design the last version of the printer with Marit, and organized the collaboration with Groningen with Marit and Biolinker. For Policy and Practice, I helped Michelle with the Day of Wonder, the collaborations with iGEM teams, and the RIVM/Rathenau. Besides my main function, I regularly checked documents for spelling mistakes (my second function being the spelling checker). For the final presentation, Max and I will be presenting.

Abstract
We showed indications that we made a  MAGE competent strains of B. subtilis 168, in which we were able to introduce mutations using oligos. For a proof of concept three different approaches were tried, but only the last method turned out to be useful. In this approach, we took advantage of a point mutation in the ribosome of B. subtilis 168 which provides the strain streptomycin resistant. We were not able generate a sufficient amount of data to significantly proof our results. Experiments were carried out to optimize MAGE in B. subtilis 168, but these result were inconclusive. In spite of the unclear results, we decided to continue to see if we would be able to change the specificity of a NRPS module. We did get vague data suggesting that we were able to change the product of the native B. subtilis 168 nonribosomal peptide (NRP) - surfactin. Due to time constrains the strain was not sequence this mutant, so the successful substitution in surfactin is not confirmed.

We cultured bacteria transformed with pSR58.6gRNA in M9 (commonly used for industrial fermentation), and repeated measuring growth curve following the same protocol as week 3.
We discovered the impact of type I-e CRISPRi to bacteria growth is relatively weak.
pcrRNA.bbsI-7-phac was assembled by both Gibson assembly and restriction enzymes, and it was successfully assembled by Gibson assembly according to sequencing results.
Week 5 (May 24th to May 31st) ▲ back
PT7 was inserted into pcrRNA.bbsI-7-phac through PCR and Gibson assembly, but it was failed. So we tried to assemble the plasmid by restriction enzymes.
Week 6 (June 4th to June 10th) ▲ back
We were appreciated to receive pSR43.6r and pHZ from HZAU-China2017 and they were transformed into E. coli DH5α. pSR43.6r was derived and the ccaS component was improved by deleting about eight hundred base pairs according to paper [1]. But we were stopped by PCR.
pHZphbc, which contains phbCAB gene cluster, was assembled by PCR and Gibson assembly.
phbCAB gene cluster was inserted into pcrRNA.bbsI-7 by both restriction enzymes and Gibson assembly. The sequencing result showed that this new plasmid was assembled successfully by Gibson.

pHZphbc was failed in assebling, so we repeated cloning and redesigned the plasmid at the same time. Tested by colony PCR and sequencing, pSR43.6-ccaS#10 was successfully assembled. To insert crRNA into pSR43.6r, we needed to construct an intermediate plasmid called pHZZJ.
pPT7-crRNA was assembled successfully by restriction enzymes after editing PT7 for a long time.
Week 8 (June 18th to June 24th) ▲ back
pHZphbc and pHZZJ were assembled successfully. To construct pSR43.6-ccaS#crRNA, DNA fragments were copied from pSR43.6-ccaS#10 and pHZZJ and then they were assembled"

Growth and Toxicity Assays
This page includes all of our experimental growth, toxicity and sole carbon source assay data. OD600 in some experiments are larger than 1, as they were converted from absorbance at 600nm. Thus they are considered accurate.
Growth assays with different experimental media
In additional to standard LB and minimal media, several novel experimental media were developed in order to characterise Biobricks within a mixed waste/landfill setting. These media were characterised through an examination of pH and through an array of growth assays with the project chassis, E.coli (MG1655).
Media characterisation. E. coli strain MG1655 were transformed with a control plasmid and grown in different experimental media over a period of 5 hours. LB media, minimal media ( M9M ), supplemented minimal media (M9S), as described here or waste conditioned media (WCM), which is made from sterile filtrated mixed waste, see here . OD600 measured, error bars are S.E.M., n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
pH of experimental media. pH measurements of experimental media were made both before and after several experiments. The time periods refer to the duration MG1655 transformed E. coli were cultured in the media before a pH measurement was made. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Conclusion: MG1655 E. coli are viable and grow in all of our experimental medias. We have established a novel media that is optimised for characterisation of biobricks within a mixed waste/landfill context. LB as a long term media suffers from increased alkalinity over a period of a month
Long term waste growth assays
These assays were designed to test whether our chassis, E. coli (MG1655) could grow directly with waste over a long period of time.

The first detection is always late compared to the vector injection; this permits an efficacy of the first dose. But during the second injection, the clearance is so fast that the vector efficacy is nearly null.
According to some people, this issue is not transposable to nanoparticles, which benefit from stealth molecules. These molecules, like Polyethylen Glycol (PEG) for example, are supposed to avoid recognition by the immune system thanks to a steric repulsion. But this is not true, or at least only in single injection, PEG like other stealth molecules, offers an accessible epitope to antibodies and other body opsonins. Then, during the second injection, an immune response is put in place and clearance is speed up, decreasing considerably the therapeutic efficacy.
However, vectors recognized by opsonins are absorbed by hepatho-splenic system macrophages (liver and spleen), then it is quite easy to target these organs pathologies with this technology. It is totally naturally, via hepatic and splenic macrophages, that organism concentrate “vectorized” medicine dose in these two organs.
Industrialization is an issue from another nature. However, it stays essential to control. Many revolutionary techniques never succeeded due to a disability to be transposed to industrial scale. This can be the case for some type of vectors. Today, except prokaryotic vectors, vector production cost is very high. For example, viral vector has to be produced by eukaryotic cells, which seems to be a brake to their commercialization. For nanoparticles, prices are high for the moment, however some products with hepathosplenic tropism can be found on the market. Moreover, fabrication of more complex vectors, which need more components, several conception steps and organic solvents use has a production cost very high.
To sum up, a table of each vector type faces to the vectorization problems:
We observe in the previous table, that each vector type fails face to at least one of the problematics. So, we can say that this technology, as promising it is considered, is faced to a technological barrier.
This table shows that each vector type possesses at least one problem. But to each problematic, one or more vector reply positively. Viruses, phages and bacteria are biological vectors, so we can associate them to form an optimal vector, replying to all major problematics.

*The concentrations found were rounded off to the next immediate integer, as these are number of molecules.
This was calculated with the concentrations in the initial state . As we can see in the initial [AHL] scan , the time taken to reach the steady state does not vary much, as it is dependent on Mass Action law (less concentration diminishes the reaction flux). However, we can see a small variation in the time taken:
The range of AHL concentration in this analysis was chosen from 30 (when we start to see a measurable response) to 10,000. We can observe a linear dependence with higher AHL concentrations. The extent of RcnA repression can be adjusted at will as long as the extracellular concentration of nickel is not damaging to the cell.
 
Jacobian and Modal Analysis
The Jacobian of a system is defined as the matrix of first order partial derivatives, ad it represents the best linear approximation to a function at a given point. In biochemical networks, the Jacobian can be defined for metabolites(Jx) or fluxes(Jv):
Where S is the stoichiometric matrix and G is the gradient matrix. S defines the structure of the network and has the stoichiometric coefficients of all reactions which are represented by the rows of S while metabolites are represented by columns. G is the matrix of first order derivatives of fluxes with respect to species concentrations:
This formal representation of the Jacobian formalizes the relation between the topology of the network, and its biophysical and kinetic characteristics7,8,9.
For our system, we first obtained S which is rank deficient: its rank is 7 and it has 13 rows, this difference is explained by the moieties of the system. We reduced S to make it congruent with its rank by eliminating the rows corresponding to: AiiA, LuxR, pcI, p, Ni-ext and Unk. Then we constructed G as previously defined; the partial derivatives are calculated only with respect to the species that remained in S; the state at which G is"

ERASE-The Game!
Stakeholders
These were people from a wide range of backgrounds for whom our project may impact or interest. This could be from a research, social or economic standpoint. Contacting these groups and individuals allowed us to understand the need that our project was satisfying, whilse also allowing us to structure and direct our project in the most efficient way possible.
Though the total number of people that could be affected by our work is vast, here we summarise the main groups/people that we identified and contacted whilst working on our E.R.A.S.E. project.
DSTL
As the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory division of the MOD, DSTL were not only a strong stakeholder in terms of being impacted by our work, but also incredibly helpful in terms of advice on project direction and scope. The division has previously worked on bioremediation of TNT and was happy to visit us at the University to answer some questions that we had and discuss our work. They also advised us on the health and safety, as well as practical aspects of the project.
Professor Christine Gosden
Christine is an expert in explosive remediation who works around the world to assess the threat explosives pose to public health and safety, and develop responses to these threats. Christine was happy to answer the questions that we had, especially ones involving the key aspects that a solution would have to uphold to be practically feasible in her field.
These qualities included:
Safe to use.
Easy for non-specialists to apply.
Quick (on a time-scale of days, not decades).
Effective.
Sensitive.
The long term effects of the project on the environment must also be considered.
Doctor Chris French
Chris is a professor at the university of Edinburgh. He has not only led his own research project into TNT degradation over a period of ten years, but he was also involved in the Edinburgh iGEM team that"

UQ-Australia,2011,Team:UQ-Australia#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," plan could open iGEM up to the influence of outside corporations, and of course that not all companies may be willing to undertake such a partnership. To keep iGEM independent of such parties, we think a well-defined agreement would be required that specifies exactly what each party agrees to, which we assume must be similar to any agreement iGEM has with its current sponsors. In effect, this agreement would just be another form of sponsorship, with both parties benefiting; the patent holders get access and exposure to a cohort of intelligent young scientists who will soon be entering the workforce or undertaking further research, while iGEM gets the ability to redistribute and modify these items within the competition’s community.
We foresee this option as a solution that complies with the aims of both patent-holders and iGEM:
Patent holders:
maintain ownership of their items
Profit in the long-term from past iGEM participants continuing to use their products outside of the competition
iGEM:
unlimited use of patented products
can offset any potential licensing fee by providing advertising to the companies
has the ability to share and standardise patented parts within the competition
maintains its independence from outside interests
Although iGEM has remained a staunchly open-source arena for innovation in synthetic biology, we feel that the current trend in science to patent any promising discoveries will mean that iGEM and the intellectual property (IP) field will inevitably cross paths more and more often as time goes on. Consequently, immediate action should be taken to achieve the best possible outcome for participating iGEM teams, while also retaining iGEM’s independent, open source nature as much as possible. We have presented two possible solutions to this problem – the first allows iGEM to avoid any direct contact with IP holders, but means that the quality of the distribution kit and BioBrick library could be compromised over time. The second solution requires more direct negotiation with licence holders, but would hopefully result in a licencing agreement allowing iGEM to keep on largely as it has been run in the past. If iGEM does decide to confront this issue, the choice it makes will depend on the direction the competition, and indeed synthetic biology as a whole, wishes to take in the future. In this constantly adapting scientific landscape, it is important that iGEM is able to fit in amongst the framework established by industry and the academic world to facilitate discovery and innovation, which is at the centre of synthetic biology and the scientific discipline.

We received sequencing results for B0030 and J23100: both sequences were correct, confirming that we were working correctly!:)
All the four overnight plates showed many colonies! A1 and A2 plates showed only a couple of red colonies...maybe a contamination of the non completely cut plasmids carrying RFP downstream of the promoter...
Colony PCR for A1, A2 and A4. We decided not to perform it on A3 because the insert was very long (>3 Kb!) and in our opinion colony PCR was not the ideal way to screen the plate. We let the picked colonies grow in 1 ml of LB + Amp, 37°C, 220 rpm for 5 and 1/2 hours, waiting for the end of the PCR screening.
Gel run for the PCR reactions.
Colony PCR: we had at least a positive colony for each of the three screened plates! we chose the third colony for each plate.
Gel results: A1-2, A2-1 and A4-1 reactions did not show any amplicon...Anyway, the positive reactions gave the expected lengths! We chose:
3rd colony for A1 (expected length = ~1100 bp)
3rd colony for A2 (expected length = ~1100 bp)
3rd colony for A4 (expected length = ~1100 bp)
NOTE: A4-2 showed a 290 bp band, but in the picture above it's quite hard to see it.
Glycerol stocks for the chosen colonies.
We re-filled the remaining 250 ul of the chosen colony of A4 with 5 ml of LB + Amp and incubated the falcon tube at 37°C, 220 rpm overnight.
We picked five colonies from A3 plate and infected 5 ml of LB + Amp. We incubated them overnight at 37°C, 220 rpm. Tomorrow we will perform miniprep and we will screen the colonies through digestion/electrophoresis.

Notably the biggest improvement of the week was changing the code to generate the coordinates on each time step rather than all at once - these values are then stored in an array of vectors ready for plotting. Originally, plotting occurred after each timestep but this was deemed to be inefficient and instead we decided to plot the function at the end of all the timesteps using the generated array. This sped up our model by about half (according to the timing function within MatLab).
Separating the plotting into a function that occurs after all time steps also made it easier to remove it as it is very time consuming. This means that pure numerical information can be extracted in the future.
Week 21/07 - 27/07
More optimising! This week involved a lot of debugging and general tidying up (a running theme!) including:
Rearranging for loops - this needed to be changed as some of the coordinates were being made too many times
Changing the way toeholds and RNA bind - a vector called check was created in order to see which toeholds bind to which RNA.
Removing unnecessary lines
Making sure the toeholds and RNA cannot join and then split instantly. They now require a cooldown period countdown which took a while to get working (this was achieved by counting up from negative numbers instead of counting down)
Following a further meeting with Jonathan fieldsend on Monday we found more problems within our code and come up with some new ways to work around them.
Firstly he told us about version control and gave us a tutorial on setting up a GitHub account.
Next he pointed out we could create a function to generate the random walk. This will optimise our code as it will remove large sections.
A few more code optimisations were pointed out such as, defining loop variables instead of adding t+r etc, and moving j==1 loops outside of others
We also spoke in detail about parameter scanning so that we can use our model to optimise the experimental system:
This could be done with reductionist gridding or a genetic algorithm.
This will be explored in more detail soon.
The next steps will be to get the plotting to work to create a visual output and to introduce a trajectory function at the container walls.

Introduction
Thinking how our project will affect society and how our solution based on synthetic biology will be contemplated by citizens was a constant concern for our team. Throughout our project, we adopted a lean startup methodology, building our device and our scenario by successive iterations. We conducted a large survey about the use of synthetic biology to fight air pollution, which received more than 2 300 answers worldwide. We also met the French actors of the fight against air pollution, such as the French Ministry of the Environment, city agencies, scientists, medical professionals and associations. It allowed us to present and review our project, check our assumptions and integrate their feedback to our device. To show that we have now gathered a solid knowledge of the air pollution ecosystem, we have regrouped our findings in a socio-economic legal report. Finally, we participated in a conference with scientific experts in the field of air pollution to present and validate our chosen targets, Poly aromatic hydrocarbons and particulate matter.

Socio-economic analysis of the data
We wrote a report on the political, economic, social and legal issues of air pollution.
Our study of air pollution and synthetic biology perception received more than 2300 answers.
We identified a problem of lack of information about indoor air pollution.
We got valuable information for the design and the scenario of aether: Relevance of the chosen targets ; Relevance of a local approach, initiated by a beta test, and the development of a database on indoor pollution.

TMMU_China,2016,Team:TMMU China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," multidrug resistant bacteria have emerged and posed great threat to public health, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and so on. To know about the exact situation of antibiotic resistance in the hospital, we visited Doctor Gong Yali, who works at the burn department in the Southwest Hospital. She did a lot of researches related to antibiotic resistance. She introduce that currently antibiotic resistance is a really urgent issue that needed to be treated seriously. For example, one of her researches demonstrated that the Acinetobacter baumannii was resistant to many antibiotics. We introduced our project and explained our goal of establishing a markerless integration visual selection system. She agreed with our idea and praised us for concerning antibiotics resistance. She compared the counter selection with our visual selection system and discussed with us about their value, on the basis of which she gave her advice. Thanks to her guidance, we had a better understanding of antibiotic resistance and we were enlightened to do more.
Collaborations
SCU-China:The project of SCU-China focused on the antibacterial deodorant insole. However, they met some trouble in microbes. Therefore, using our advantages, we helped them verify the antimicrobial effect of the insole. At the same time, we found our mathematical modeling unsatisfactory, so we invited their talented group members to provide technical guidance for us.
UESTC-software:UESTC-software encountered problems when synthesizing DNA primers,so we helped them. Additionally, considering that we had several models, we hoped to achieve visualization of the models by using software. UESTC-software kindly helped us, and the result was satisfying and helpful for our further work.
Conferences
Southwest Union:After five months of experiments, our project began to take shape. Meanwhile, we have just received a meet-up invitation from the Southwest Union (iGEM meet-up in southwest China). Simulating the final round, this meeting set up presentation, poster exhibition and free discussion. Together with the SCU-China, UESTC-China, UESTC-software and SICAU-China, we knew much detailed information about the competition, such as the progress and the judging criteria. All the teams exchanged suggestions with each other and build up deep friendship.
CCiC Conference:As the competition approaches, the Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC) conference was hosted by Sun Yat-sen University, in order to simulate the iGEM Giant jamboree and enhance further communication among different teams."

Bands expected at around 1.5 kb instead of the usual 1.4
Making more practice plate oligos
We were running low on oligos 1 through 6 from our practice plate, so we did a PCR to make more, using the same protocol as before. We then PCR purified the product.
Results of our PCR purification
Design a new primer for GFP
We designed a new primer for GFP, with a 7 bp spacer between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the start codon for GFP.  According to what we discovered online, it seems that the spacing between the ribosome binding site and the ATG start codon is very important for transcription efficiency.  We had previously thought that there were 8 bp from the beginning of the RBS to the ATG codon, but instead it is really 5-9 bp in between the end of the RBS and the ATG codon that is correct.  We thus added the spacer that comes directly from the Ambion website, which is AGGAGGTATATACATG (spacer bolded).  More info can be found here: [ [21] ].

Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"oresis to make sure that you did not lose the DNA. Determine the DNA concentration and the purity.
Concentration of DNA samples
You can concentrate your DNA sample if the amount is too low. Therefore add 1 M NaCl to a final concentration of 0.1 M and add two volumes of 100 % EtOH. Vortex your samples and spin down for 15 minutes at 13,000 rpm. The supernatant can be discarded. Add then 700 µl 70 %age EtOH and centrifuge again for 2 min at 13,000 rpm. Let the EtOH evaporate at room temperature. Now you can dissolve your pellet in water.
How to design primers
One of the major tools in molecular biology is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) where DNA fragments are amplified in a logarithmic manner. Therefore, you need at least two primers that bind to your template DNA strands and boarder the region that should be amplified. It is obvious that good primer design is essential for successful amplification.
The Material
Template sequence + the sequence of the flanking regions
Program for primer design (optional)
The Procedure
The optimal length of primers should be around 18 - 30 bp and the melting temperature should be around 52 - 64°C (usually 58 - 62°C). The temperature can be calculated with a program (e.g. Oligo Calc) or manually (for each C or G add 4°C, for each A or T add 2°C). Non-binding sites are not calculated in the melting temperature (like flanks or additional restriction sites).
Typical set-up for a forward and a reverse primer. The two primers anneal within the PCR reaction to the two complementary strands. The reading direction is different so that they produce a product. For sequencing the primer can also read only in one direction. The primer should bind once so the template (plasmid or chromosomal DNA). The GC content should be around 40 - 60 % to provide a stronger binding to the template. It is necessary to check if the primers can form undesired secondary structures that can lead to the disturbance of the PCR.

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get

We were additionally able to contact an electrical engineering lab technician that has had experience working with Arduino and our colour sensor to ensure our circuits and code for the programs we are planning on writing next week are the most efficient and effective they can be. Additionally, we continued with Maya tutorials to ensure our skill levels are ready for animation and the use of the Simbiology toolbox for Matlab.
Week 10:  July 7th - July 11th
We began this week receiving our first purchase order that consisted of 2 Arduino Uno microcontrollers, graphic LCD display, colour and temperature sensors, LED’s, and a soldering station.  Using the Arduino Uno microcontroller and the breadboard we were able to construct the circuit and program the Arduino to calculate temperature and ensure that temperature sensor was accurately operable.  Additionally we received our Arduino kit and have begun experimenting with various components previous to starting our formal experiment. As part of the learning experience, we constructed a circuit with Piezo Elements to play “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” and “Happy Birthday"", and a circuit with the photocell that would shine the LED light brighter when the lights were turned off. After learning how to work with Arduino, our goal was to get the sensors operable with Arduino circuit and programming.  We were able to measure temperatures and determine colour using the temperature and colour sensors respectively. The program and the circuit for the temperature sensor was taken from the manual coming with the Arduino Kit. The program and the circuit for the colour - light sensor was taken from the Parallax official website.
Once the colour sensor was working, we started testing it using red, blue and green colours of different intensities. However, first we had to calibrate it with black and white. In theory, the black measurements are supposed to be 0 0 0 for each of the red, green, and blue components, respectively, but we get measurements around 20 for each of the components. So the numbers we get for black need to be subtracted from the measurements of colours other than black and white. When white is measured, the number for each of the component can be used to determine coefficients that are necessary to convert the input values to colours by going 255/component reading for white colour. When a colour is measured by the sensor, we multiply each of the components by corresponding coefficients and then convert it to the name of a colour. We"

Meeting of Young Minds
Together with the Rathenau Institute, our team organized one of the two debate rounds at the event Meeting of Young Minds.                 This debate took place on October 5h, the Friday of the Jamboree. The topic of this debate was about the release of research                 details on the creation of highly transmissible H5N1 (bird flu) in the lab. This topic was subdivided into three statements.
The NSABB made the right choice to give permission for publication of this research
Looking at the potential risks, this research should not have started in the first place
Scientific research may never be censored.
The experts who were invited to talk during this debate were
Prof. Hans Westerhoff, an expert on synthetic biology from the VU Amsterdam
Dr. Koos van de Bruggen, from the workgroup biosecurity KNAW,
Dr. Sander Herfst and Dr. Martin Linster, from the Erasmus MC who worked on the H5N1 research
Dr. Robin Pierce, expert on Law and regulations from the TU Delft
Pieter van Boheemen, iGEM 2010 alumnus and part of the Dutch Do-it-Yourself Biotechnology group
Mark Ruitenbeek, chairman of the VWS CDJA (a Dutch youth political party)
During this debate the public was asked to vote before and after each statement if they agreed or disagreed with the statement. It was very interesting to see that a few people did change their minds after they heard the discussion between the experts and our team.
The second round the iGEM team of UCL was hosting another debate about a future scenario disaster caused by synthetic bacteria that has mutated, which was also a very interesting debate. Those two debates were"

This secondary killing mechanism will be triggered by the presence of a diffusible conjugation signal and will be able to induce neighboring killer cells, even when not conjugating. Such diffusible signal and corresponding promoter have never been described, but we’ve found promising candidates and their characterization is the main challenge for this project.
The Yeastguard
Industrial ethanol production occurs in open vats with over 500,000 L. This process is mostly hindered by lactobacilli contamination, which produces lactic acid as their main metabolic product. Once contaminated, the whole vat must be discarded and cleaned, thus generating losses ranking in the millions of dollars.
We want our engineered yeast to be able to detect and control the proliferation of lactobacilli by introduction of a simple genetic device. The device must be able to recognize the presence of lactate in the medium during fermentation. In order to allow the entrance of lactate in the cell, we will construct a gene coding for a lactate transporter under the control of a constitutive promoter. Once in the cell, this metabolite will induce the transcription of the gene coding for killer enzyme, lysozyme, which is the most widely used antibiotic for lactobacilli decontamination.
The greatest challenge of this project consists of characterizing a lactate-inducible promoter that is not subjected to glucose catabolic repression, since the device must be activated during the process of sugar fermentation of the diauxic shift of S. cerevisiae.

Entrepreneurship
Cornell iGEM recognizes that synthetic biology is so much more than just work done at the lab bench. That’s why this year, we have decided to take our policy and practices to the next level by pursuing our fishPHARM idea from the perspective of a profitable business. To this end, we have engaged in the following entrepreneurial endeavors to facilitate the growth of fishPHARM as not only a synthetic biology based project, but as a locally-based business venture capable of curing BCWD worldwide.
Biotech Resource Center, McGovern Institute Family Center for Venture Development - We have spoken extensively with Marla Coppolino, the Director of Business Development and Outreach for the Institute of Biotechnology at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY. Marla has helped to guide Cornell iGEM through the business start-up procedure as well as connect Cornell iGEM to the necessary business experts on Cornell campus. At the McGovern Institute, we also presented fishPHARM to a potential investor with fish farm industry expertise, allowing us to develop a clearer hypothesis of customer demands.
eLab @ Cornell - eLab is dedicated to accelerating top Cornell University startups. Established in 2008, by Student Agencies Foundation in collaboration with Entrepreneurship at Cornell, eLab has worked with hundreds of students in turning concepts into real businesses [1]. Cornell iGEM has collaborated with eLab to present fishPHARM at the eLab kickoff event in which team members networked with potential investors at Cornell University.
Feasibility Analysis Plan
We wrote a feasibility analysis to assess whether fishPHARM provides desired and profitable products. Through a product feasibility analysis, industry feasibility analysis, organizational feasibility analysis, and financial feasibility analysis, we have decided that our business would not only be feasible, but would be profitable as well.
Business Plan
No business is complete without an in-depth business plan. We performed market, financial, and industry analyses, conducted market research, formulated a mission statement, and devised an organizational plan for fishPHARM. This information, and more, can be found in our business plan. This plan has undergone revision from Cornell professors and entrepreneurship experts, Professor John Callister, and Professor Michael"

Palak I determined that one of the necessary elements in determining ideal pathway was flux balance analysis. I spent sometime looking into what the flux of a reaction is as well as how it is calculated. It turns out that the function in COBRA that finds the flux balance analysis uses a linear solver. I experimented with various linear solvers that are compatible with python interpreters. I found the NUMpy and SCIpy were the most useful modules. I also continued to learn how to program in python using several tutorials.

Construction of the system
We succesfully assembled a prototype version of this system in the model bacteria Escherichia coli.
The initial promoter is a strong constitutive promoter from the biobricks registry, BBa_J23119.
The genes involved in vitamin production are replaced with fluorescent proteins, allowing for easy monitoring of their production. Our construct contains mCherry as a reporter gene, and two other fluorescent proteins to mimick pathways operons. It also has a phage PhiC31 integration site for subsequent addition of new genes.
In theory, the cells with this cassette integrated in the chromosome are expected to emit a red fluorescence. Upon induction of the CRE-recombinase, they should lose the red fluorescence and start to express either mCerualean (a cyan fluorescent protein) or mVenus (a yellow fluorescent protein). Each cell should express only one of those two proteins at the same time.
Chromosomal integration
This cassette was constructed by gene synthesis and Gibson assembly and assembled in a self-integrating plasmid vector (Saint-Pierre, 2013). This vector uses the integrase of the phage HK022 to integrate itself in E. coli's chromosome. This plasmid was electroporated in the bacteria and the HK022 integrase was induced.
To check that the cassette has correctly been integrated in the right locus, we performed an analytical PCR on the whole genome of the transformants, with a set of four primers which allows for amplification of the junction between the vector and the chromosome.
Here is presented the result of this PCR using the genome of six clones of transformants as a template.
It tells us that the vector was succesfully integrated at the right locus. It also shows that there have been only one integration and no tandem integrations, which would have resulted in an additional band.
Integrity of the cassette
We then performed three other PCRs with pairs of primers binding on the ORF of the three fluorescent proteins. As a positive control, we performed the same PCR on the pure fragment that have been used for the assembly.
This way we ensured that the cassette was present in its entirety in the chromosome.
Sequencing of the Lox Array
To investigate whether unexpected recombination occured within the LoxP sites due to homologous recombination, we performed sequencing on the first part of the integrated cassette, where the Lox Array is. This way we could make sure that it was still intact and contained no PCR-induced mutations.
Impact of the Lox array on the transcription

Conclusions
In conclusion, the State 2 of our bistable i by IPTG doesn't only express the cI repressor,  also it expresses the Sspb adaptor protein. This protein binds the DAS+4 tags and enhances specific degradation by the ClpXP protease. Therefore, when the State 2 is active, State 1 promoter is being repressed and the State 1 reporter is being degraded. Thus, State 2 repressor altogether
With this proteolysis system we are, as said, degrading State 1 reporter and State 2 repressor when this second State is the dominant. This will allow us both to minimize the residual GFP signal and to enhance PLac expression, as it won’t be repressed. With this mechanism, we intend to shorten switching time between states and to obtain the clearest signal difference.

The preservation of the culture medium was measured based on the height that it presented. According to the medium heights obtained, it was decided not to use polymer in the medium due to the low decrease of height in the negative control after ten days compared to those where certain amounts of PVA were added. Also, we observed that in the last day of the experiment (12th day) the heights of the medium with 5% of PVA and the negative control (no PVA added) were similar (Figure 6).
Membrane permeability for microorganisms
    In order to prove that microorganisms are not able to pass through the nitrocellulose membrane which has a pore diameter of 0.22 µm, we simulated the biopatch being in contact with skin. To do so we inoculated nutritive agar medium with E. coli and then covered it with the membrane and two filter paper pieces in order to simulate skin. From experiment 1, samples did not show growth both in the tubes containing the filter paper pieces (Figure 7a) and in the Petri dishes where filter paper 1 was put. The only exception was sample 3 (Table 2) which came out to be contaminated due possibly to a deficient manipulation technique during the procedure, even in the initial Petri dish more colonies than inoculated appeared. From experiment 2, exactly as for experiment 1, all samples did not show bacterial growth with the exception of one, S1, which also displayed more colonies than inoculated at the beginning (Table 2). As expected, for the positive controls, where no membrane was added, tubes containing its filter paper pieces (1 and 2) revealed bacterial growth (turbid broth) as well as the Petri dish where filter paper 1 was put. All negative controls had no growth at all since no microorganism was inoculated (Figure 7b).
    These experiments validate that the nitrocellulose membrane with a pore diameter of 0.22 μm does not allow bacteria to move from the biopatch towards the burn injury because the size of E. coli is approximately 1 to 3 micrometers (Reshes et al., 2008).
Modelling

Safety Considerations of Biobrick Parts
Public safety: Threonine auxotrophy was employed where integrated cassettes containing flanking regions of homology for the B. subtilis thrC  gene were used. This knocked out threonine synthase in our chassis, making it unlikely it would survive outside of conditions where theronine is not supplied.
Environmental safety:  It’s possible that our B. subtilis  transformed with mBBI could outcompete native microbes and potentially disrupt existing ecologies; however, the integrated mBBI genetic construct would not make a significant difference in the bacteria’s survivability outside the lab. Given the nature of our project and safeguards we have implemented, none of our BioBricks confer unsafe risks to individuals nor the environment.
Future Considerations
We would engineer inducible kill switches that could eradicate the bacteria if need be. Additionally, integrating mBBI in various essential genes required for amino acid synthesis could provide more opportunities for auxotrophy, increasing the safety of using B. subtilis in the device.

SDSZ_China,2018,Team:SDSZ China#cf_-_-_TEXT.html," subject, we got in touch with the professer by using the resources of one of our team members’ parents. After Professor Wang heard about our project, he was very willing to help us because Professor Wang had done research in this area before. He believed that chitosan is a promising new material. After reading our initial experimental ideas, he gave us valuable advice. There is a region between the ribosome binding site and the promoter called scar, but the design of our previous experiment made this region too long. In order to make the protein be successfully expressed, the scar should not exceed 6 bp. In the end, the protein was successfully expressed, which is inseparable from the professor's credit.
Work experience and performance: 2003.6-present, teaching and research work at the School of Food Engineering and Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science and Technology. He teaches undergraduate courses ""General Biology"", postgraduate courses ""Functional Food Technology and Equipment"", ""Food Science and Biotechnology Special Lecture"" and other courses, and trains more than 20 postgraduate students. In recent years, he has hosted and participated in dozens of national, provincial (ministerial) projects, and has carried out international cooperation with Canada and the United States. Published more than 30 academic papers, including more than ten papers in SCI.
Practice:
- Xi’an Pharmaceutical Factory:
While designing our project, we have learnt that the current production method of chitosan has some limitations. In order to gain more knowledge about the setbacks and how are they influencing the industrial supplies of chitosan, we put visiting these institutions up on our schedule.
One of our destinations is the Sciphar Organic Products corporation located in Xi’an. We learnt that they used to produce chitosan and healthcare products that contain the chemical, and reached out for them in hope of visiting their factory, where we can have a better understanding of how chitosan is produced. Yet in the first response we received, the company showed their concern—They have already closed up their chitosan production line. This, however triggered our interest: Why did they closed it up? Sensing that the reasons behind the company’s decision could also give us inspiration on our project, we decided to visit anyway.
At the company, we asked why the company had shut down the chitosan production line in addition to the technical questions we have prepared. The manager sighed at this: “You would be disappointed…it was profitable, indeed, we used chitosan to produce all kinds of products from drugs to cosmetics. But there were too many risks.” He explained to us that the"

Easy to cultivate and modify
Naturally adapted to your targeted insect species
Non pathogenic for humans, animals or plants
Transmissible vertically and horizontally in your targeted population

Figure 1:The surface CALB structure (turquoise) is shown. Dirhamnolipid (blue) and Chitosan (red) are placed in the active site pocket.
Methods
We used three different enzymes (Candida antarctica Lipase B (CALB), Pig Liver Esterase (PLE) and Fusarium solani Cutinase (FSC)) and two ligands, rhamnolipid and chitosan, to perform different tests. We used Gromacs [1] and the tutorial by Justin A. Lemkul. He provides a tutorial about protein ligand complex MD simulation ( Mdtutorials ). The selected enzymes were downloaded from the PDB database . The ligands were imported into a pymol session to place the ligands into the active site of the protein (Figure 1). Afterwards, the ligands and proteins including the new structure coordinates are extracted.  The protein topology was prepared by using the pdb2gmx command of the gromacs version 2018.1-gnu7.12018.1-gnu7.1 installation. The force field of charmm36 all-atom force field (KJuly 2017) by the MacKerell lab website was chosen. The ligand topology file was created using the LigParGen server [2] . A complex.gro file is created that contains the processed, force field-compliant structure of our protein and the manually added ligands structures.  Also a main topology file was created which contains the ligands parameters such as force field parameters, too.  Furthermore a box including the solvent was created by using the commands gmx editconf and gmx solvate.  To achieve a net free charge we added ions into the systems which contained an overall charge.  Some error occured so we did trouble shooting e.g. we changed the lines which showed the wrong number of atoms.  Afterwards we performed the energy minimization using an input parameter file (em.mdp) provided by the Emkul AB Virginiatech group .  Subsequently an index file was created to get the position restraints defined by the ligands.   As following step the system was equilibrated using a modified script of the Prof. Dr. Pleiss group. So the system has a constant number of atoms, same volume and the same temperature (NVT), so called a canonical"

Deng Liu: Deng is interested in the research on cyanobacteria, especially on the synthetic biology and transcriptional regulation in cyanobacteria. Deng helped iGEM members on details of experimental design, plasmid design, and cell culturing.
Our Non-iGEM affiliated advisors worked in their respective labs and would help us on a daily basis, whether it giving valuable input on experimental or cloning protocols or feedback during our project presentations. The list includes:
Allie Hoynes-O’Connor, Ray Henson, Ryan Lee , and Tatenda Shopera: The graduate students of the MRG helped the Brauer Group by aiding in answering every day questions and making sure we contributed to the well-being and material readiness of the lab as well as following all safety and labeling protocols. Ms. Hoynes-O’Connor served as our lab safety officer and gave us guidance and training on lab safety procedures. Mr. Henson also gave guidance and plasmid material in the Brauer Group’s early attempts at constructing a sequence verifiable chromophore.
Kenneth Ng and Soo Ji Kim: Kenneth and Soo Ji are laboratory technician staff in the MRG and helped resupply the lab’s vital operating stock materials and equipment in addition to giving advice and answering questions the iGEM students had. Kenneth provided his advanced expertise in adjusting and optimizing protocols drawn from his vast knowledge due to a highly inquisitive nature.
Nancy Duan: Nancy is the technician in the Rebstock lab. She takes responsibilities of maintaining cyanobacteria culture and assisting iGEM in doing experiments such as PCR, sub-cloning, plasmid preparation etc.
Jingjie Yu: Jingjie works on developing a new cyanobacteria model system for synthetic biology purpose, especially, for biofuel production. During iGEM project, she provided detailed advice on nearly all aspect of experiment for Rebstock group.
At Monsanto, a group of scientists specializing in nitrogen fixation sat in on our team’s presentation about the outlook of our nitrogen fixation project and offered plenty of suggestions through the advisory panel meeting. The diagnostic panel meeting with scientists of Monsanto later proved to be productive for the design and procedure of the lab work.
Modeling Support:
Andrew Ng: Andrew also helped to create the list of kinetic equations for our model.
Brandon Nicklas: Brandon Nicklas is an undergraduate at Penn State; he helped us to design a kinetic model for our light regulation system. Unfortunately we did not continue with the model as we were missing some experimental values that we ran out of time to find.

Conclusion
Conclusion
By performing these activities, we aspired to relate to people to not only understand what they taught about synthetic biology but also to know how they felt about it. Our objective denoted to enhance the community, then Mexico and later other countries through activities that involved new societies into this newly emerging field.
For our surprise, we achieved even more than that. We expected to teach and receive feedback on this science branch, but what did surprise us were the great bonds we built with beekeepers, youth and the public in general.
Everyone involved in our Education and Public Engagement section was in the right place at the right moment, which drove us to explore different opportunities. These new opportunities allowed us to correlate our brains with their brains as well as our hearts with their hearts.
We are very happy to have accomplished our goal after developing these 12 projects, but the best of all is we managed to impact so many people with synthetic biology. We saw how curiosity defeated shyness over the public and we are sure it will continue growing in the same way on the future.
High School Introductory Topics
When we are freshman students, we want to involve ourselves in every activity or take any opportunity our career has to offer us. That’s why there is no better audience that people who are enthusiastic at the beginning of their adult life.
For this reason, our college has a week full of activities for all high school alumni with the objective of helping them find out if he or she likes the career they have chosen or not. In our case, we were able to help in a week full of biotechnology engineering activities and welcome students into undergraduate projects. Introductory topics week was from February 26th to March 2nd.
This was our very first Education and Public Engagement activity. There were around 30 high school students who made activities such as molecular gastronomy, a mouse dissection, nitrogen ice cream, oocyte extraction, electrophoresis, between others.
At the end of this week, we wanted to help them see how they can apply what they had done during the week in a real project. Therefore, we presented these alumni synthetic biology for the first time. Since we knew that for several students this week was their first approach to biotechnology, we explained what
was synthetic biology and how this new emerging tool can be used to help current worldwide issues. As well, we had the chance to answer some questions that emerged in some"

SZU-China,2018,Team:SZU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," was measured by spectrophotometer and the enzyme activity was calculated according to the standard curve. There were three replicates of each group,perform three parallel experiments in each replicate, and the final data were averaged.
We calculated activity based on the standard curve formula: U=（A540+0.03279）/2.202 (Fig.10), a summary of the data at different times is made into a line chart as follows.We can see that after 12 days the transformant’s enzyme activity is still growing while the wild-type is falling.(Fig. 11)
Fig.10 Glucose standard curve
Fig.11 changes in chitinase activity over time.
In order to verify the function of Bbchit at the macroscopical level, we improved Kan Zhuo's chitin transparent circle method for verification[3]. We stained the czapek solid medium without chitin colloids in red with 0.1% Congo red dye solution and then inoculated wild-type and transformed Metarhizium.Then compared the size of the colony and the transparent circle between wild type and transformant. The size measured is the diameter of the chitin transparent ring (R2) and colony(R1). The ratio of the diameters showed as R2/R1.The conclusion that the chitinase activity of Metarhizium anisopliae is enhanced.
Fig.12 A: wild-type Metarhizium anisopliae 128 produced transparent zone on Czapek chitin - induced medium; R1: 8mm, R2: 9mm; R2/R1=9/8 B: Metarhizium anisopliae HsbA transformant produced transparent zone on Czapek chitin - induced medium; R1’: 8mm, R2’: 12mm; R2’/R1’=12/8=3/2
Therefore, these results confirmed that the chitinase activity of Metarhizium anisopliae The enzyme activity of Bbchit transformant is about 1.3 times higher than wild-type's Metarhizium anisopliae 128. Our modified fungus certainly enhanced the ability of penetration.

Bielefeld-Germany,2013,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#MFC_-_-_TEXT.html," Beside these technical changes the aeration with nitrogen was increased in comparison to previous experiments. This was to compensate the increased distance between the bacteria and the anode. Since the new chambers were thicker, mediator diffusion would otherwise have become even more of an issue.

width: 50 mm
depth: 18 mm
volume: 45 mL
The iGEM York Cell
Since the iGEM Team York_UK is also doing work related to microbial fuel cells this year, we offered to send them one of our fuel cells to conduct their experiments in. Our design did not fully meet their requirements, especially since it was too large. After consulting with two of their team members, we built a small fuel cell based on the 3rd generation design and sent it to York.
Figure 15: The Fuel Cell designed for the iGEM Team York.
Dimensions per chamber:
height: 25 mm
width: 25 mm
depth: 12 mm
volume: 7.5 mL
The Stack
In order to increase the power output of the fuel cell, a fuel cell stack was built based on the third generation design. It consists of alternating anode and cathode chambers, five of each, placed between two cover plates. Using copper wiring, the five chamber-pairs are connected in series. Physically, they are separated by 1 mm thick stainless steel tiles, which act as bipolar plates.
Figure 16: The Fuel Cell Stack.
Dimensions per chamber
(10 total):
height: 50 mm

depth: 12 mm
volume: 150 mL total
The fuel cell stack is assembled from a total of 173 parts, when 3rd generation fuel cells are stacked six times. The complete assembly takes about 18 minutes. Watch this process in the video below in fast motion. For more videos and pictures look here .
Assembly of our MFC stack in fast motion. The stack consists of six combined 3rd generation Fuel Cells wired in parallel with a total of 173 separate parts.
Do It Yourself
3D Printing
To make the microbial fuel cell accessible to everyone, an additional model was developed which can be produced using a 3D printer. 3D printers are becoming more and more common and if none is available, the model can be ordered online from a 3D printing shop.
For our 3D printed microbial fuel cell it was important to apply material that does not inhibit microbial growth. To make sure this is the case, E. coli KRX was cultivated"

Monday
Today is the official first day of term. Imperial is crowded again.  Also it is the first day of Yutong, Siwat, Thomas and Alberto alone in the lab. The application constructs seem to have worked. Yutong is picking colonies to characterise them.  Alberto has completed the data collection for C1A characterization. Now we can start to characterise the promoter library.  We have a sexy sygmoid!  Final preparations for tomorrow's fresher fair. Also there is a new student in the Ouldridge's lab,and he did BioMod!.
Tuesday
Today we were at the Fresher's Fair of Imperial College, resenting our poster at the Synthetic Biology stand. For the bioengineers, it's lecture time. Siwat tried to do the PCR for the silver medal.  There was a lot of PCR spam on the whatsapp group
Wednesday
For the life scientists it's lecture time as well. It's going to be a very intense month. Yutong is testing the application constructs. Alberto is finalising the plate reader experiments. And plate the cells in solid cultures with the final conditions. Thomas is pulsing the plates waiting for the electrode array. Siwat is listening to Structural Biology lectures and then he's trying the PCR again. Shiv helped him on the PCR and finally we have the band as expected. We wouldn't have  ticked the silver medal criteria  without that band... Yutong, Thomas and Alberto went to sports night.
Thursday
Good results from the agar plates with the final conditions. Everything fluoresces as expected. The second years are going to lectures now. Interesting lecture by Prof. Mark Isalan on Directed Evolution and Turing Pattern. I am glad you asked...
Friday
Today there are good news: the Gp2 construct in oxidising conditions seems to grow way worse than in reducing conditions (and than the controls). Let's send it for sequencing for the final proof that it worked then. What a glorious day. Celebration at the union with Thomas, Yutong, Alberto and Ismael.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#unnatural base pair#uptake_-_-_TEXT.html,"C3-PtNTT2 were used as negative controls. Unsurprisingly, no thick band can be observed around 90.3 kDa, which would be the size of PtNTT2-cMyc-GFP. No bands can be observed for the other PtNTT2 variants.
A second gel was used for a Western Blot using an anti-GFP antibody. The result is shown in Figure 21.
Figure 21: Western Blot of the samples prepared using the fast cell lysis for SDS PAGE protocol.
An anti-GFP antibody was used for the detection of PtNTT2-cMyc-GFP variants. E . coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PtNTT2 were used as negative controls. Much unspecific binding of the anti-GFP antibody could be observed, which is not surprising given that the entire proteome of the cells was analyzed. Thick band can be observed for PtNTT2-cMyc-GFP, PtNTT2(66-575)-cMyc-GFP, PtNTT2(31-575)-cMyc-GFP and PtNTT2(pelB)-cMyc-GFP around 35 kDa. This indicates that only the cMyc-GFP linker was detected and that the linker might be cleaved of from PtNTT2 due to the high difference in hydrophobicity.
In a second approach, the cells were lysed using a nitrogen cooled Precellys Homogenizer. After three cycles, cells were centrifuged at 4 °C and the membrane fraction was isolated as described in the methods section . After boiling the membrane fraction, the samples were loaded onto two SDS PAGEs, one of which was consequently used for a Western Blot, if the fusion proteins were used. For the Western Blot, two different antibodies were tested, an anti-GFP antibody and an anti-cMyc antibody. Figure 22 shows the SDS-PAGE after isolation of the membrane fraction. Again, no clear difference between the negative controls and the samples could be observed around 90 kDa.
Figure 22: SDS PAGE performed with the isolated membrane fractions.
The cMyc-GFP fusion proteins were used, which should be visible around ~90 kDa, differing slightly based on the PtNTT2 variant used. No bands could be observed around 90 kDa, which was subsequently proofed by performing a Western Blot.
The Western Blot (figure 23) performed with the same samples verified these results, since"

Overlapping PCR is a commonly used method to link two fragments together. The two templates contain complementary sequence and can perform as primers and templates for each other. In this way the two fragments are linked together in the first 5~8 cycle. Then add the primers for the whole segment amplification and we can acquire the target sequence of a considerable amount.

Bacteria liquid PCR(20μl volume):
Bacteria liquid PCR or colony PCR is used for detecting whether the colony contains the desired plasmid or not. It can lessen the workload when extracting the plasmid, however, the case of false positives is unavoidable (decreasing cycle number may help to reduce the false positive, but we didn’t do any test to prove it). Variety kinds of examinations should be performed before sequencing. You can see that specifically in “Restriction Enzyme Reaction” and “Blue-white Screen”.

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," washing machines. Degradation of plastics on the beaches results due to surface embrittlement and micro cracking, yielding micro particles that are carried into water by wind or tidal action. In some marine test areas micro particles of PET already exceed the concentration of oceanic plankton. Combined with its property to bind toxins, these micro particles become a hazard for nature and it´s biological variability.  This year an interdisciplinary and self-organized team of students from the Technical University of Darmstadt are forcing this challenge at the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM). Their goal is to create a new bacterium which can transfer PET, normally not useable for organisms into components that can be metabolized. With assistance of techniques from synthetic biology they are building a biological machine, creating an organism from scratch.  The goal of the following manuscript was to develop a technology assessment based on a model by Wolfgang Bender. The used model first described the goals and intentions of the team before it draws two perspectives of what might happen in best and worst case scenario. In the second chapter the technology was described in detail so that possible risks and opportunities can be evaluated not only on a technical issue but even by looking at effects on society, human self-understanding and environment. For a final recommendation another model by Christoph Hubig was used. Different possibilities for the use of synthesized bacteria were evaluated for their option and bequest values.  The use of synthesized bacteria in industrial facilities seems to be most efficient and safety. The role of politics should be to strength research to develop profitable techniques to extract PET from sea water and set incentives for reducing the use of plastic products. If conditions are optimized, a responsible use of synthetic biology can help to clear the planet from human PET.

The discovery of the DNA as a kind of blueprint for all living organisms changed the way of thinking about life from something mystical, god given, to something based on matter which could therefore, be predictable and manipulable.The hope was, that if we understand the genetic code, we could understand principles of life and maybe one day be able to create life which has never occured before. In the last century new techniques have arisen, which made it possible to read and even write the genetic code. Automatic DNA analysis and gene synthesis became affordable and the completion of the human gene project lead to complete new possibilities and dreams. This progress has modified the researchers possibilities to not only manipulate single genes but even create new genomes. The foundation for a new field of biotechnology called synthetic biology was built. The results are comments like the"

Our localization analysis together with the final enzyme activity assay gave us quite conclusive results about the two constructs we had used in these experiments. MC-degrading activity was observed in the enzyme samples taken from the fraction containing the inclusion bodies, plasma membrane and cell wall as well as from the post-refolding fraction containing the plasma membrane and cell wall. This suggests that active forms of the enzyme are localized in the plasma membrane. There is a possibility that the refolding step does not refold all of the inclusion bodies, which could mean that even though our enzyme localizes into the plasma membrane and or the cell wall after refolding, it could actually still be partially in the inclusion bodies. Yet, it is highly unlikely that a protein in the inclusion bodies would work properly, i.e. have activity. Therefore, the activity results give quite conclusive information about the enzymes’ likely localization.
It seems that the MlrA without the mating factor α has a slightly higher activity than the MlrA with the mating factor α. The activity of both constructs had been analysed from the insoluble fraction after cell lysis since they localized mostly there. However, in the first expression of the yeast constructs, there was also some MlrA without secretion tag localized in the soluble fraction. Since this was not the case in the second expression, we decided not to analyse the soluble fractions from the second expression due to resource constraints. In addition, our hypothesis was that if the enzyme is localized in the membranes, it probably needs the membrane conditions in order to function properly. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see what kind of activity the soluble fraction would have given, since our positive control was from the soluble fraction of E. coli.
If we had more time, we would have wanted to test our hypothesis about the enzyme needing membrane conditions to function properly. To test this, we would have analysed the activity of the soluble fraction as well as purified the plasma membranes from the fraction containing them and the cell wall. If the hypothesis had been correct, we would have tried to quantify the amount of MlrA in one plasma membrane in order to be able to calculate the amount needed for the detoxification of a certain volume of water. However, if it seemed that the soluble fraction had higher activity, optimization of the purification process would have been needed.
Our plan was to have a final product composed of the microcystinase and lysozyme. If we had obtained results of the"
Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Labjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," the activity of the supernatant after 36h was less than after 18h, which indicated that 36h incubation is more convenient. On the other hand, the activity also decreased upon increasing the beads’ concentration without reaching a saturation level (see Fig.). Therefore, we decided to carry out another experiment with higher beads concentration.

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," ura3 gene, ura3-terminator and β-carotene gene. Among them, ura3 gene and ura3-terminator are flanked by vox locus. Then we use overlap PCR to combine these parts together. The next step is transform this composite part into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We screen for the correctly transformed cell by using the Sc-Ura plate. For the purpose of verifying desired strain PVUVC, we use colony PCR to amplify the TEF promoter-vox-ura3 structure and ura3 terminator-vox-β-carotene structure. The length of the strip will be observed by agarose gel electrophoresis.

2) Construction of vox-RFP-terminators-vox Structure
This structure has a great similarity to the vox-ura3-terminator-vox structure above. Therefore, it is easy to construct because we only need to change the ura3 gene to the yEmRFP gene. We use PCR to amplify five basic prats including TEF promoter, yEmRFP gene, Adh1 terminator, ura3-terminator and β-carotene gene. Among them, yEmRFP gene and ura3-terminator are flanked by vox locus. Then we use overlap PCR to combine these parts together. After that we use the lithium acetate conversion method to transfer this composite part into TVUVC. We screen for the correctly transformed cell by the 5-FOA plate. This part will integrate into SynⅤ by homologous recombination, and we will get another desired strain called TVRVC.

3) Verification of yEmRFP in the PVRVC
The verification of yEmRFP is carried out by using colony PCR to amplify the homologous arm-TEF promoter-vox-RFP gene and terminator-vox-crtE gene, which determines the existence of vox sites and yEmRFP gene. Then we can detect the red fluorescence.
