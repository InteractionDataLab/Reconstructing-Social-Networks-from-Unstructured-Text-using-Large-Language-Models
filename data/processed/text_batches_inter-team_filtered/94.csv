Gibson assembly
Back to protocols .
We use Gibson assembly to assemble DNA fragments into plasmids. It is a multistep process, requiring first a PCR to create each fragment by copying them out of template plasmids, then a single isothermal assembly to stick the fragments together, then transformation into competent cells and culture for amplification.
Protocol adapted from Nikolaus Obholzer ( https://wiki.med.harvard.edu/SysBio/Megason/IsothermalAssembly )
Take the different DNA parts you want to assemble and measure their concentration with Nanodrop
We need equal molecuar ratios! Divide the concentration measured above [ng/ul] by the length of each part to have equivalent  numbers
Based on these numbers, calculate the ul you need of each to have the same amount of molecules
Take 5 ul of the mixed solution and add 15 ul of Gibson mastermix
Heat at 50°C for 45-60 minutes (there is a programm written in the iGEM folder)
Now the samples are ready to be transformed.
PS: if someone has a less complicated method, please change the protocol :)

SCUT,2013,Team:SCUT#Project#Odorant sensing_-_-_TEXT.html,"p, Ste7p, and Fus3p held in a complex with the Ste5 protein. Fus3p then activates the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Far1p and the transcription factor Ste12p to bring about cell-cycle arrest.
It is worthy to announce that a major negative regulator of the pathway, Sst2p, is a GTPase activating factors that return Gα to its inactive state which generally would be deleted to increase the sensitivity. Finally, a reporter of this pathway was under the control of a Ste12p inducible promoter, Fus1 linking BFP, GFP or HIS3.
Figure 1. Comparison between endogenous GPCR pathway in yeast and motified Odr10 pathway.
Diacetyl is utilized as our ""language"" for our communication between E.coli and S.cerevisiae. Diacetyl can be released by modified E.coli as a kind of special intermediate in metabolism pathway which was described in Oscillating odorant part. We take advantage of the modeling olfactory receptors (ORs) odr-10, which is from caenorhabditis elegans and specific to diacetyl. Additionally, diacetyl may be harmful to humans when inhaled frequently and diacetyl-induced bronchiolitis obliterans is one of the representative diseases. Consequently, our biomimetic nose can be utilized to detect the diacetyl in our surroundings more sensitively.
Pathway reconstruction
To express exogenous GPCR，our plasmid manipulation is performed in E.coli strain top10. Odr-10 CDS sequence, which is optimized in GenScript, was inserted into the YEP352 shuttle vector with GAL1 promoter and ADH1 terminator.
However the odr-10 fails to contain the N-terminal import sequence, which results in the difficulty of localization on plasma membrane when express odr-10 in heterogeneous cells. The overexpressed and inefficient folding odr-10 will stimulate the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and autophagy pathway. To solve the difficulty of odr-10 localization on the plasma membrane, we try to insert the sequence of rhodopsin signal peptide (rho) into the upstream of odr-10 CDS. Our rho sequence has also been optimized. Additionally, to detect whether our odr-10 has been transcribed and located on the plasma membrane or not, we insert the sequence of GPF in downstream of odr-10 and the sequence of flag-tagged into the position between our rho and odr-10 respectively.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Internal#Ultra#Test7_-_-_TEXT.html," product forming enzymes: LuxI and Transaminase B. LuxI is the enzyme responsible for AHL production and Transaminase B is responsible for Leucine formation.
For LuxI kinetics Schaefer et al. (1996) found a value of 1 molecule/minute for the Vmax. Since we assume that LuxI is fully saturated with substrate, we take this value as the synthesis rate of AHL.
Transaminase B forms leucine from aKIC and glutamate. In this reaction glutamate is converted to aKG. The reaction kinetics is of the ping-pong bi bi form. This model describes a mechanism in which the binding of substrates and release of products is ordered. The enzyme shuttles between a free and a substrate-modified intermediate state.

In conclusion, the current need is a simple detection method which could be applied to grass samples to be able to check if a pasture is secure for horses to graze on. Therefore we have analysed the possibility of developing the second worm buster by studying fluorescence in grass samples.

As you can see these little worms can cause a lot of harm. While we hope that our practical work will help solve the physical problem, all of the problems that come with these worms cannot be solved in a laboratory.
The strongyles harm the horses but the collateral damage is extensive - sentimental value, resistance against anthelmintics, the effect the drugs has on environment and the noteworthy economics are all involved [6]. These are all aspects that make the issue bigger than it appears at first glance.
Figure 7: Some members in the team with our mascot Gromit.
Raising Awareness
We have attacked the problem at several angles to raise awareness for our project. We have performed a market analysis of the problem and sent out questionnaires to better judge the severity of the problem. We’ve even been published in a local swedish magazine, explaining the problem and raising awareness locally.
Financial perspective
The equine industry includes many areas like stud farms, breeding, slaughter, trading, training and sports stables, and riding schools [18]. In Sweden the equine industry has a turnover of 450-500 million EUR and horses graze around in fields that in total correspond to 600,000 football fields [17]. There are approximately 350 000 horses is Sweden (2016) which gives Sweden a larger horse/person ratio than many other European countries [18, 19].  A large amount of money is spent on horses within and without the borders of the EU, so this is clearly a global problem.
Even though all the available data points at a high demand for our product, more data is needed to predict how an eventual new GMO product would be perceived. That is why we have worked on the market analysis and economics modelling. The result from these decides if the eventual solutions actually will be possible to implement in real life.

After purification, we  wanted to demonstrate whether our purified TALE A - β-lactamase fusion protein retained its enzymatic activity. This was tested by a variation of the ampicillin survival assay where we pretreated, LB containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol, with our purified TALE A linked to β-lactamase ( BBa_K1189031 ). We then cultured bacteria in the treated LB carrying the psB1C3 ( pSB1C3 ), conveying resistance to chloramphenicol. In order for the bacteria to survive our isolated protein needed to retain its enzymatic abilities. We can show that the bacteria susceptible to ampicillin were able to grow in the presence of our purified proteins ( BBa_K1189031 ), which means that we are expressing and purifying functional fusion protein which is degrading the ampicillin (Figures 8). Both graphs show an increase in OD for cultures pre-treated with our protein demonstrating our protein is functional.

After verifying that TALE A -linker-β-lactamase ( BBa_K1189031 ) retained enzymatic activity and was able to degrade ampicillin, we performed a pH assay using benzylpenicillin as our substrate to demonstrate that our fusion TALE A - β-lactamase protein"

Hey, I'm Vic, an undergraduate senior student majoring in mathematical statistics. Yet my research field is biology statistics, and that is why I'm here.
For IGEM, I'm mainly responsible for human practice and have been giving lectures as well as other promotions on both synthesis biology and IGAM. It is this special experience that has not only made my college life amazing, but also presented me with a broader view of biology. Besides working for IGEM, I've also been researching biology statistics, including bioinformatics and biology networks.
My goal is to be a biostatistician in the future, on which I'm gonna keep putting effort. Now I'm applying for an opportunity to study as a biostatistics PhD. Good luck to me, huh? : )

UV-INDUCED PROMOTER
This construction is made up of two parts:
The transcription factor-binding site inside the promoter
The repressor-binding site inside the promoter and
the coding sequence, which contains a synthetic fluorescent (green) protein. The promoter was taken from the RecA one. Proteins that participate in the orchestrated bacterial SOS-response [1] that involves more than forty independent SOS genes, most of which encode protein sengaged in protection, repairing and replication regulate our construction.
When is the protein synthesized? In order to obtain the green fluorescent protein one condition should be met. Since there is a repressor, lexA, that blocks any possible transcription, it is needed to UV-irradiate the cells to break down lexA and habilitate transcription.
The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is as follows: when a bacterium undergoes severe damage it uses this repair system for maintaining a functional (double stranded) DNA able to duplicate. The damage can be so harmful that it can generate ruptures, dimers, bases modification, etc., therefore the bacteria releases RecA resulting in polymerized and filamentous structures which bind to and stabilize DNA [2"

Hardware
Our hardware team consisted of four students: Katzi , Matthias , Sven and Max . Our fluorescence detector ""Lightbringer"" was conceived, designed and built by Katzi and Matthias, while the whole hardware team developed ""Heatbringer"", the sample processing unit. Sven and Max worked on the initial design blueprints, both in design and execution; Matthias and Katzi then developed ""Heatbringer"" to its latest version. Along the way, our supervisors Lukas , Benjamin and Michael gave valuable input and feedback. Julia Müller und Marisa Götzfried, both PhD students in Prof. Simmel's lab, helped our hardware team by giving tips regarding 3D-printing and circuit design. Jerome Lutz, from UnternehmerTUM, also helped us by giving us access to the awesome parts library in UnternehmerTUM's MakerSpace and offering us some courses there.
Software
Jorge worked on the fluorescence detector's software under the instructions of Katzi , who designed the algorithm. Sven and Max wrote most of the thermocycler's software, with support from Igor for the web interface.
Human Practices and Outreach
Everyone on the team contributed to human practices by organizing our attendance in the many events we went to, representing us there, or reaching out to scientists and to the community to discuss our project. However, Dawafuti , Rob , Erika , and Benedikt presented our project in most of the fairs and youth educational meet-ups. The survey was designed by Teeradon , and he conducted the interviews with Benedikt , Katzi , Florian , Dawafuti . For outreaching and acquiring sponsors, Matthias coordinated the communication between the different companies and our team. Thanks to Jerome Lutz from UnternehmerTUM for reaching out to for different events like the TECHFEST .
Wiki
Our wiki was a joint effort mainly between Benedikt , who drew all the icons, logos, and designed most of the page, and Jorge , who did most of the coding with help from Milica and Igor . Our supervisor Benjamin provided us with helpful ideas and feedback. All our team members helped writing the wiki content. We would like to thank Team Bristol 2017 for creating and showing us the iGEM IDE which facilitated the work.
Design, Presentation and Poster
As our main art-guy, Benedikt created our amazing logo and banner, took pictures, filmed, and styled our presentation. Together with Teeradon , he also was in charge of designing the poster.

Put the tubes back on ice for 2 minutes.
Add 200-500 µL LB or SOC media (without antibiotic) and grow in 37 °C shaking incubator for 45 minutes.
Plate some or all of the transformation onto a 10 cm LB agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotic.
Incubate plates at 37 °C overnight.
Electrical Transformation
Thaw SOC or LB medium.
Thaw E.coli electro-competent cells on ice.
Add 0.5-1 µL of plasmid DNA sample to a sterile 1.5 mL tube (don't forget a negative control). Volume should not be over 4 µL. Store on ice.
If necessary, sterilize electroporation cuvettes (1 mm gap for E.coli) by rinsing with EtOH, and treating with UV for 2-5 minutes. Store cuvettes on ice.
Set the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser to 1.8 kV by pressing the up and down arrows simultaneously. All other settings (200 ohms, 25 µF) will always remain the same.
Once cells are thawed, add 30-50 µL cells per tube of DNA. Mix gently 2 times up and down with a pipette tip.
Add the cells and DNA directly to the cuvette. To avoid air bubbles, gently tap the cuvette on the bench top 2 or 3 times. You don’t have to put the cap back on.
Wipe off the metal electrodes of the cuvette with a kimwipe to remove any water.
Place the cuvette in the sample chamber. Be sure that the electrodes are contacting both sides of the chamber.
Press and hold both red ""pulse"" buttons at the same time to deliver the electrical pulse. You will hear a beep once the pulse has been delivered within 1 or 2 seconds. Once you hear the beep, release the buttons. Most readings will be around 4-6 msec following the pulse.
If you hear and see a loud pop, the sample has arced (meaning the pulse did not pass through the cells, but somehow around it). Discard the cuvette and try the sample again.
Remove the cuvette from the chamber and add 200 µL SOC or LB to resuspend the cells. Add 200 µL of the cells and media to a round bottom snap-cap tube.

Host strain influences on supercoiled plasmid DNA production in Escherichia coli: Implications for efficient design of large-scale processes.

Summary:
Set out to investigate if E. coli genotype plays a significant role in host strain selection for optimal processing of plasmid DNA based on both quality and quantity of supercoiling
17 E. coli commercial and non-commercial strains were selected and their available genetic backgrounds were researched in the open literature. Growth characteristics of all the strains were considered and made impartial by using a common medium and growth condition platform.
Can screen the number of strains which are likely to give good productivity early on, before any further optimisation and verification is performed, both for small and large plasmids.
Found that high specific growth rates of some strains did not affect the level of DNA supercoiling but did influence the total plasmid yield, potentially an important aspect in the design of fermentation strategy. Interestingly, a few host/plasmid combinations result in what appears to be runaway plasmid replication.
Potentially helpful for deciding strains to use to amplify plasmids

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Bioethics_-_-_TEXT.html," doubts about the safety of any new technology, and genetic engineering and biotechnology are certainly no exception. One reason for this concern is the fact that it is virtually impossible to prove that something is entirely secure about every condition imaginable. In instance, the importance of these discussions is immeasurable both to guide these new techniques as limiting them in order to protect the ecosystem.  It was and still is a concern of UFAM_Brazil 2014 to ensure that the environment and all beings inserted do not suffer adverse consequences from the techniques used in this experiment.

MichiganState,2018,Team:MichiganState#HP Survey_-_-_TEXT.html," 5, only 7% thought that genetically modifying bacteria instead of a plant was unacceptable. The other 93% were at least open to discussion and learning more. This is promising for the future use of our GM bacteria. From question 4, we found that people's major concerns with GMOs were the effect on the human body, and the effect on the environment. One benefit to our GMO is that people wouldn't actually be consuming GM crops, but rather crops grown with GM bacteria. This may decrease some of the concerns with the effect on the human body.
Conversation
Passing out surveys also turned out to be a great opportunity to discuss our project in depth with people who had filled out the survey. They were often interested to learn more, and we engaged in many interesting and thought-provoking conversations. Because of this, we decided to make a brochure that provided a basic overview of iGEM, our project, and we gave copies to interested participants after they had finished filling out a survey."

The activity also demonstrated the concept of using standardized parts, represented by foam blocks, for easy biobrick assembly. Both students and advisors seemed very interested. We were happy to find that both groups learned a lot from our presentation and activity.
Our team also performed this same activity with different groups visiting campus, including a high school leadership group. After the event, several of the students expressed interest in participating in iGEM or synthetic biology research in the future.
Academic Contributions to the University
Bio 375 - Biological Design and Innovation
Our iGEM team (in conjunction with one of our advisors, Dr. Dave Westenberg) created a course through the university called Biological Design and Innovation I (Bio 375) to teach students how to design a synthetic biology research project. This course is open every spring semester to any student interested in upper level biology coursework, not exclusively iGEM team members. The purpose of this course is to teach students how to design a synthetic biology research proposal from conceptualization to forming a concrete research plan. This serves two main purposes for the team: to benefit team members by formally teaching them how to develop a research proposal and to develop research proposals from which the team can select a project each year. The course was offered for the first time in spring of 2011, which allowed for the development and selection of our previous project, the microbial glucose sensor. An additional project was developed, which was later funded by Missouri S&T's OURE Fellows program to conduct research on the effect of education on synthetic biology . During the 2012 spring semester, four proposals were developed involving: condensation of the nitrogen cycle, microbial cellulose, malaria-fighting bacteria, and mycolic acid degradation to fight tuberculosis. The latter of the four listed proposals was ultimately selected and evolved into our team’s project for the year.
Undergraduate Research Conference
Participation at Missouri S&T’s Undergraduate Research Conference (URC) accompanies the team’s normal activities and research. Team members often get funding through S&T's Opportunities for Undergraduate Research Experience (OURE) program to participate in research for iGEM projects, and then present these projects at the URC. Team members can develop project proposals in the spring semester either individually or through Bio 375. These proposals are often entered into the Project Proposal section of the conference. One such project proposal, The Effect of Education on Public Opinion of Synthetic Biology, developed in Bio 375 in the spring of 2011 was"

4. Repeat the step 2 and 3 twice.
5. Resuspend the pellet with 0.4 ml PBS and add 2 μl 1 M PMSF.
6. Sonicate the bacterial mixture on ice with 3W output, pulse 30 sec and pause 30 sec, three cycle.
Digestion
1. 0.5 μg DNA + 0.2 μl fast digestion restriction enzyme ( 10 unit/ μl, final 0.25 μg/unit) + 1 μl 10X buffer + mQ H2O → total volume 10 μl.
2. Bath in 37oC warm water for 15 min.
Ligation protocol
1. Quantify the concentration of the linear DNAs that you are going to ligate.
2. Calculate the molar weight of DNA. Converse the unit into ng/ fmol.
3. Calculate how much nanogram is required for 20 fmol of backbone and 60 fmol of insert.
4. Then by the quantified concentration, find out that how much μl is required.
5. Adjust the total volume to 8.9 μl/tube.
6. Add 1 μl of 10x ligation buffer and 0.1 μl of T4 ligase (5 unit/μl)
7. Place it in 16oC water bath, overnight.
PS:
The ideal volume for DNA ligation is 10 μl, but it is adding the volume to 15~20 μl is fine, since part of the liquid will vaporize during ligation.
It is recommended that the concentration for the backbone is 20 fmol.
The molar ratio for backbone : insert = 1 : 3
The ligase required 0.1~0.5 unit/tube.
Run electrophoresis gel
1. Make a suitable agarose gel (depend on your DNA size), X (g) agarose + Y (ml) 0.5X TAE , X/ Y = 1.2%~1.5% (<0.5k), heating until all agarose melted.
2. Cool down the agarose gel (use the back of your hand to check it, as long as it does not burn your hand, it is suitable temperature), add EtBr (final, 5 μl/ 100 ml) into agarose gel and mix well.
3. Put agarose gel into mold and wait until it become solidification.

NEFU China, Korea U Seoul, and Nankai teams posed more general questions about our overall knowledge and experience with synthetic biology, and Wiki building. The Paris-Saclay survey posed questions regarding chassis organisms and safety concerns that arise from working with such organisms."
BIT,2013,Team:BIT#HP_-_-_TEXT.html,"    We gave a brief introduction of the modification process of our engineering bacteria and the mechanism of our antibiotic detector. The staffs there are really impressed by the hand-hold detector.
    During the visit, the director told us that the farm command high quality for their products. Milk secreted by cows that had taken antibiotics would not be allowed to send to factories within certain period to ensure the safety. However, this case still existed in some smaller dairy factories to cut the loss. Therefore, he insisted that our detector should be optimized and popularized among consumers so that malpractice among illegal traders could be revealed and the interest of consumers could be protected better.     The curious staffs also asked more questions about our detector, to which we gave detailed explanation.
    In the end, the director and staffs told us that we could further reduce the detection time so that our detector would work more efficiently and become more popular. We promised we would try our best to reduce the detection time and we also thanked them for their thought provoking questions as such questions had always inspired us for the optimization of our detector.
Event VIII. Market Survey
    In order to survey the current market milk about containing antibiotics, we have visited several supermarkets in Beijing. Unfortunately, we found no antibiotics in the milk formula. So does it mean that our milk is safety? In fact, according to our results, no one is aware of the dangers of antibiotics in milk at all, whether manufacturers, as well as consumers.
    Out of curiosity, we interviewed some citizens, and by the way, ask if they know the milk contains antibiotics. At the same time, whether know the dangers of antibiotics.
    The majority of our interviewees don’t know the concept of antibiotics in milk but they know the dangers of antibiotics fortunately. So we ask their opinion of our project. Happily they showed great interest and expectations, and provide a lot of valuable advice.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 Notebooks Chromoproteins_-_-_TEXT.html," extraction on the 4 liquid cultures of VP, PP, TP, and CP we started on Tuesday. We spun them down in the centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes (make sure tubes are balanced). The pellets were colored which was a promising first step.
Chromoprotein Pellets out of liquid cultures
4 pellets spun down from liquid cultures. Clockwise from the top: PP, CP, VP, TP.
●
We then poured of the supernatant and poured a bit of LB into one of the tubes and vortexed it. Then once all the pellet was off the bottle the LB and cells were transferred to the next bottle and so on until the LB and cells were poured into a 50 mL tube. Spin in centrifuge at 4500 rpm for 10 minutes. Weighed pellet after and added 10 mL/g of cell lysate (CellLytic B). Then added 100 ul of lysozyme and 50 units/mL of benzonase (can also add RNAse and DNAse). Then vortex until pellet is resuspended and place onto vortex for 10 minutes (remember to tape so it doesn't fly off). Spin down at 11,200 rpm for 10 minutes in centrifuge. Then follow the protocol on Jesica's lab bench to wash the column and add the protein. After each elution wash we got fractions that showed color. This confirms our His-tag was present and we were able to purify our proteins.
●
Once we had our purified protein we put them into snake skin dialysis tubing and into 1.75L of  1X TBS buffer overnight
●
Tomorrow we plan to concentrate the product of our dialysis
●
We ordered primers that were the reverse compliment so we will use these tomorrow to perform a PCR of our chromoprotein and then Gibson and transform
Friday, 9/9
●
Took our four chromoproteins out of their dialysis tubing and put them into 50 ml tubes. Because we see color it confirms our His-tag is present because we were able to purify them. This also gives us protein to work with that we can concentrate and use to perform heat testing on.
Chromoproteins after purification and dialysis
Here are our proteins after they have been purified and dialyzed. From left to right they are: TP, PP, CP, and VP.
●
We then concentrated some of each chromoprotein. We did this using centrifugal filter units and spinning them at max speed for 10 minutes.

In order to make roGFP2-orp1 in a suitable                         redox state, we chose several promoters of different intensity and ligated them to roGFP2-orp1                         through OE-PCR, then adding hydrogen peroxide to verify its function.
Specific method:
First, we obtain seven promoters of different intensity from Saccharomyces yeast genome through                         enzyme digestion method. They are: FBA1,TEF1,TEF2,ENO2,PCK1,PDC1 and PGI1. [1]
Second, we linked the promoter fragment to the previously constructed fragment roGFP2-orp1by                         OE-PCR and constructed it on the pESC-Trp plasmid. We screened positive results in the                         following of digestion，ligation and transformation of the large intestine. Finally, we                         constructed the fragments into our chassis organisms through yeast transformation.

Result & discussion
The response of roGFP2-Orp1 to H2O2
According to literature[2], roGFP2-Orp1 green fluorescent protein shows peak value                         at 405nm (oxidation peak) and 488nm (reduction peak). Fluorescence ratio R (R=I408 / I488) is                         uesed to the redox degree of roGFP2-Orp1. Therefore, we used different H2O2 concentrations (independent variable) to simulate the accumulation of ROS in cells and the                         fluorescence ratio (dependent variable) to characterize the redox degree of roGFP2-Orp1, which                         means that the increase of fluorescence ratio R shows roGFP2-Orp1 is oxidized and the decrease                         shows reduction.
Fig.7 Experimental Group
As Figure.7 shown, the fluorescence ratio R of roGFP2-Orp1 increases with the increase of H2O2 concentration. And the fluorescence ratio is basically unchanged when the concentration of H2O2 exceeds 0.8 mM.
Fig.8 Control Group
As Figure.8 shown, the fluorescence ratio of wide-type was not affected by the change of H2O2 concentration and remained unchanged.
Redox reversibility of roGFP2-Orp1
Firstly, we made the cells almost be oxidation state by adding 1 mM H2O2 and observed the change of fluorescence ratio R (dependent variable) with time (independent                         variable).

Christian has worked within the area for many years, and he thought that our idea is important since it tackles antibiotic resistance. The most important feedback we got is that no treatment plant is the same, and therefore we need to develop methods to provide each plant with their own need. One idea would be to use immobilization on degradable carriers. He made us look further into immobilization, and urged us to contact hospitals for information about how they take care of their waste.
""We always had, and still have, a belief that nature is a good cleaning system itself. Therefore wastewater is not cleaned more than necessary."" - Håkan Jönsson
Håkan Jönsson is a senior advisor at Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, SLU. Håkan believes that Biotic Blue could be implemented in their research; making multifunctional toilets using the generated by-products as fertilizers - free from antibiotics. These kinds of toilets could be implemented in hospitals and elderly homes, where the concentrations of pharmaceuticals are higher.
Process engineer Stefan Berg at the municipal treatment SYVAB, Himmelfjärdsverket was interested in Biotic Blue, but advised us to look more into the sensitivity, retention time and how many cycles Biotic Blue could be used for. Sofia Andersson, Development engineer at the municipal Henriksdal wastewater treatment plant thought that there might be difficulties implementing Biotic Blue in their wastewater plant based on the retention time, cycle time and the pH difference. However, Sofia thought that the implementation of Biotic Blue in the sand filters could be feasible, where the enzyme could be retrieved and reused. The meeting left us thinking about possible places and steps in the plants where our product could be adapted to. Since space is an issue for many wastewater treatment plants, this also needs to be considered when implementing Biotic Blue.
Thomas Mörn, process engineer at the municipal plant Lotsbroverket (Åland) thought that Biotic Blue has great potential, but that on Åland it would be most suitable in a pump station before the plant. He gave us valuable information: not all houses are connected to a treatment plant, which is important when thinking about the implementation.
Meeting with Elin Kusoffsky and Jesper Olsson, Investigation engineers at the municipal plant Kungsängsverket, Uppsala, we got the insight that most plants are not developed for cleaning complex pollutants. This is the case for Kungsängsverket, but they are planning for the implementation of a fourth cleaning step to eliminate pharmaceutical"

Primary pollutants can further damage by interacting with the environment, such as acid rains and smog, the greenhouse effect and the high ozone levels in the air we breathe (Radovič, 2006).

Acid rains introduce plentiful problems for humans, nature and artifacts (EPA). In humans, the NOx and SO2x gases cause or exacerbate respiratory diseases such asthma, bronchitis, and pneumonia all of which can be deadly (EPA, 2016). Its harm to nature is through it seeping into the soil to dissolve its nutrients, eroding it (EPA, 2016). Furthermore, it can release aluminum, which prevents trees from getting water (EPA, 2016). Such weakening conditions for trees make them vulnerable to various infections and infestations of insects, damaging forests which compensate some of the harm made by fossil fuels (EPA; EIA, 2016).
Greenhouse gas emissions accelerate global warming by releasing a gas covering the atmosphere are mostly sourced by fossil fuels' combustion in the U.S. (US EPA, 2016). All but agricultural greenhouse gases (which accounted for just 9% of it) were caused by fossil fuels (US EPA, 2016).
Lakes and streams get their share of damage from fossil fuels too (EPA, 2016). Conventionally at a pH of near 6.5, such bodies of water house a colorful variety of aquatic wildlife including phytoplankton, mayflies, rainbow trout, frogs, crayfish and many more (EPA, 2016).
Buildings and objects also get harmed by acidic rains too (EPA, 2016). Acidity in rain water corrode the paint and stone on them; wearing them out, vanishing their value and beauty (EPA, 2016).

We believe we have created the first BioBrick to emit light in normal E. coli strains without the addition of any external substrate.
Tools
During our project we made extensive use of Gibson Assembly to manufacture our parts, and have submitted an RFC to the BioBricks Foundation to help future teams make best use of this technique.
Along with this, we also constructed a number of tools to assist the synthetic biologists of the future:
Gibthon Construct Designer allows the user to enter a series of BioBrick or GenBank IDs in a specific order and computes the appropriate primers for Gibson Assembly .
BioBrick → GenBank allows parts from the registry to be downloaded in .gb format, making them compatible with a wide range of biological software.
The Ligation Calculator is a small calculator to help you work out the proportions to use for ligation in BioBrick assembly without having to worry about units.
The E.glometer is a cheap, easily built, piece of electronics for measuring bioluminescence.  It allows scientists without access to expensive plate readers to measure bacterial light output and has potential applications in quantitative biosensors .

Introduction
The production of plant essential oils and their derivatives represents an over 9 billion dollar industry when considering their applications in the food and fragrance industries alone 1. Up until only a couple decades ago, the production of these essential oils was done almost exclusively by chemical extraction from plant material. However, the sudden emergence of synthetic biology a versatile and efficient tool has the potential to transform this immense industry,whose products are an unavoidable staple of everyday life.
By harnessing existing biosynthetic pathways and introducing enzymes taken from plants into malleable model systems, it is possible to significantly improve on current methods for synthesizing the active components of essential oils, most notably the terpenoids. While most plants express terpenes in the range of parts per million and thus require very large scale operations to be commercially viable, early forays into the biological production of terpenes have proven that it is possible to improve yields 100-fold 2. We selected a total of nine different terpenes to produce (see table) to prove the feasibility of our distinct approach. To demonstrate the strengths of our approach, we purposefully chose what amounted to, relative to most iGEM projects, a large number of pathways to be working on simultaneously. The list includes both well-characterized terpenes and more exotic varieties, all of which share direct practical applications that make them prime candidates for alternative modes of manufacture. The first aspect of our project involves using the great potential of synthetic biology to design a commercially-viable strategy for the production of numerous terpene varieties.
Just as important to the economic benefit of this approach is its environment benefit. With chemical terpene extraction being such a relatively inefficient process, it is necessary to process large amounts of plant material to get a substantive yield. This may not pose as significant of an issue for citrus growers, but many of the most prized compounds are taken from the rarest species of plant. The continuation of the status quo in terms of terpene extraction is not an environmentally sustainable solution. In our selection of terpenes, were conscious of the value of our approach from the perspective of sustainability. From a small amount of plant tissue as a starting sample, we could create theoretically limitless amount of terpene in our microbes, and by starting with gene extractions from plants, there is left open the possibility to use techniques like degenerate primers or sequences"

DTU-Denmark,2014,Team:DTU-Denmark#Overview#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," further here. The ethics of synthetic biology on living animals, while interesting, is out of scope of this discussion.
Conclusion
The central question in the present ethical discussion can be seen as a decision between two actions: Practicing synthetic biology, or not practicing synthetic biology. To answer this question, the above arguments can be considered, and in simplistic terms a proactive or precautionist approach can be taken. With a proactive approach the positive consequences of synthetic biology would be given a higher weight, than the negative potentials, and with a precautionist approach, the negative consequences of an action are weighted higher. However in either approach it is difficult to predict all potential consequences of an action. Especially the cost of lost potential, that is the negative consequences of not doing something, can be non-obvious. For synthetic biology, the cost of lost potential would be the negative consequences of not practicing synthetic biology, compared to practising it. The huge range of applications that synthetic biology has and the number of problems it can help solve contribute to the cost of lost potential associated with a decision not to practice synthetic biology. It is our opinion that these costs of lost potential far outweigh the potential negative consequences of synthetic biology. Because of this we think that the practice of synthetic biology is justified, although there are of course issues that must be considered in order to reduce any negative consequences that might arise.

Background
The threat
The discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928 and the following broad application of antibiotics have marked a major victory of mankind in the battle against infectious diseases. The intake of the wrong dosage or even the unnecessary use of antibiotics in medicine and agriculture have led to an enhanced appearance of resistant bacteria. Subsequently, we have reached the point where bacteria have evolved resistances against all common antibiotics. The drugs of last resort are rapidly being exhausted in cases like the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or the vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). According to the US Threat Report, 2 million persons are infected by resistant bacteria annually  whereof  23,000 die.
Further misuse will lead us back to medieval conditions not only for postoperative patients but even small infections will be able to cause severe problems and may cost many lives. Tragically, only four new classes of antibiotics made it to the market in the last 40 years as research in the field of antibiotics is getting less profitable due to high research and development costs and the poor chance of success to actually launch a new antibiotic (Cooper and Shlaes, 2011).
Therefore, we should better control the use of antibiotics in medicine as well as agriculture. Meanwhile, we need to develop new antibiotics, which can sufficiently eliminate the pathogenic bacteria without affecting beneficial and harmless bacteria"

McMasterU,2017,Team:McMasterU#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"2016-2017, Dr. Yingfu Li has worked with us in developing the theme of antibiotic resistant bacteria during the early stage of the project. It made sense for us to go to him first and get his perspective on the current stage of research for antibiotic resistance. While interviewing him, we found that on the subject of resistance, there are two major branches of AMR research. One is improving the diagnostic method, to detect the bacterial strains with improved accuracy and timing. The other is developing new therapeutics to treat the novel strains. We determined that to grasp the full situation of antimicrobial resistance in Canada, we must approach researchers and clinicians who are involved in both branches of the issue.
Dr. Li also brought attention to a factor that must be considered in the wet lab design: balancing sensitivity and efficiency. He told us that a diagnostic tool that is fast in detection must sacrifice accuracy, while a tool that prioritizes accuracy sacrifices efficiency. The Human Practices and Wet Lab teams then opened a dialogue about the ramifications of sacrificing one component for the other.
Finally, Dr. Li encouraged us to find multiple stakeholders to understand the problem of antibiotic resistance. He provided names of researchers here at McMaster, whose work we would find especially interesting. We were able to interview some of them through his assistance.
Dr. Gerry Wright
— Director, Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research; Canada Research Chair in Antimicrobial Biochemistry
We had the opportunity to interview Dr. Gerry Wright, an expert in drug development and antimicrobial resistance, early in our project. The foundational knowledge we learned in this meeting heavily influenced our project direction, with the first section of our discussion addressing the basics of antimicrobial resistance. Dr. Wright justified his research, which aims to identify both new antibiotics and compounds which inhibit resistance. We learned that, although sometimes resistance is due to internal mutation of the bacteria’s DNA (which we thought occurred most often), the most common resistance mechanism is the acquisition of resistant genes from plasmids and transposons. That is, a bacterial organism’s resistance is more heavily influenced by external, rather than internal, factors.
Next, we discussed difficulties associated with a drug’s commercialization process. We learned that there is often a decade between the discovery of a compound and the “phase two” trials of experimenting on patients. In this decade lies the translational period referred to as the Valley of Death, wherein most discoveries will remain, since rigorous trials often prove the compound inefficient or harmful and the cost of the years of testing is enormous. This conversation led us to contact several research institutions, including the Canadian Institutes of"

Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Project#module2_-_-_TEXT.html," binding proteins (FABPs) are lipid-binding proteins that regulate fatty acid uptake and transfer between extra-and intracellular membranes. There are 9 different FABPs identified with tissue-specific distribution, including FABP1 in liver. Some, such as Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR), are believed to transport fatty acids from the plasma membrane to intracellular receptors, and as such have a selective cooperation with the receptor to activate gene transcription.
2. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) Promoter
The peroxisome proliferator – activated receptors (PPARs) function s transcription factors to regulate expression of genes. The expression of PPAR-alpha can be up-regulated by increased fatty acid concentration in mammalian liver cells. The promoter of PPAR-alpha has a basal expression level. However, when it is stimulated with an extracellular palmitate concentration of 150uM, the activity of the promoter will increase by over 4 folds within 48 hours.
3. Glucose Regulated Protein (GRP78) Promoter
GRP78 (HSPA5) is involved in the folding and assembly of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). High concentration of fatty acids disrupts cell homeostasis, leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). This in turn will activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) that consists of three trans-membrane proteins: IRE1, PERK and ATF6. The signals from these three proteins, when integrated together, will activate the GRP78 promoter. Other factors such as NF-Y, ERSF, YY1, which are normally acquired from the normal stress response followed by UPR, also play a role in activating the GRP78 promoter.
4. Fatty Acid Metabolism Regulator Protein (FadR) and FadBA Promoter
FadR is a bacterial transcription repressor that regulates lipid metabolism and determines the bi-stable switch between fatty acid biosynthesis and beta-oxidation. The binding of FadR to the operator is inhibited by fatty acyl-CoA compounds, which are intermediates of fatty acid degradation. When the cellular environment is deficient in fatty acids, FadR binds to Pfad (promoter of operon fadBA) and shuts down the beta-oxidation pathway while turning on the biosynthesis pathway.
Cell Viability
We are working towards to introducing an inducible system that allows tunable fatty acid uptake regulated by fatty acid concentrations. To test our"

Abstract
Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS)  offer a unique opportunity to spin around their inherent logical assembly and observe if their functionality is preserved or even improved.
Following this idea, we investigate the interchangeability of NRPS domains and the possibility to tune their efficiency at the example of indC from Photorhabdus luminescens, the NRPS module used for the Indigoidine-Tag. The native NRPS domains have been replaced with domains from other bacterial organisms and fully synthetic domains. Moreover, we compare the activity of different PPTases, which are required for the activation of NRPS modules. To determine the NRPS efficiency we established a quantitative indigoidine assay based on OD measurement of the blue-colored pigment. Interestingly, our data points out that some of our engineered indC variants exhibit increased efficiency in producing indigoidine compared to the native enzyme. Furthermore, we introduce HiCT - High throughput protocols for circular polymerase extension Cloning and Transformation -"

Tianjin,2011,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," in the above image, which is also the foundation where we build our modeling section. FAP takes the place of Rapamycin (Rapamycin-Fpr1) to render the inhibiting effects. However, our model has been simplified to just several major regulatory proteins to avoid some immeasurable proteins interacting parameters and obscure mechanism. Another downstream substrate of TORC1 is AGC kinase (homologous to protein kinases A, G, and C) Sch9. Six amino acids in the C terminus of Sch9 are directly phosphorylated by TORC1. Phosphorylation of these residues is lost upon rapamycin treatment as well as carbon or nitrogen starvation and transiently reduced following application of osmotic, oxidative, or thermal stress.
These observations support the notion that TORC1 activity is regulated by nutrient abundance and inhibited by noxious stress. TORC1-dependent phosphorylation is required for Sch9 activity, and replacement of residues phosphorylated by TORC1 with Asp/Glu (turn to continuous phosphorylation) renders Sch9 activity TORC1 independent. Sch9 is required for TORC1 to properly regulate ribosome biogenesis, translation initiation, and entry into G0 phase, but not expression of Gln3-dependent genes. Using TORC1-independent versions of Sch9, Scientists found that Sch9 is a major effector of TORC1 that appears to function similarly to the mTORC1 substrate S6K1. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Sch9 is directly phosphorylated by TORC1 at multiple C-terminal sites and by the yeast PDK1 orthologs in the activation loop. Both phosphorylation events are independently required for Sch9 activity. As Sch9 is contemporarily controlled by both TORC1 and Pkh1/2, and shares rather overlapping functions with cAMP-PKA pathway, this branch is not our emphasis presently. Nevertheless, for the central role Sch9 plays in nutrient-mediated signaling, this pathway deserves further interests and deeper exploration. Briefly speaking, when TORC1 is active, it could keep the downstream transcription factors phosphorylated , thus they be excluded outside the nucleus and not accessible for the initiation of stress response genes, autophagy and several pathways that allow growth on poor nitrogen sources. However, when it comes to adverse environment with FAP or poor nutrients, transcription factors would be dephosphorylated because of the deactivation of TORC1 and enter the nucleus, causing the repression of protein synthesis and the stimulation of amino acid biosynthesis, stress response genes, autophagy and nitrogen discrimination pathway.

The result proved that the inhibitor can almost completely repress the killer gene at the turning point. Also,                                 we could say inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene.
Summary:
Above all, we proved that plasmid numbers will influence the concentration of inhibitor proteins, and the inhibitor concentration will regulate the expression of killer gene which is indicated by RFP measurement results.
After connecting with killer gene, the plasmids losing on different levels will influence the expression of killer gene, which means we can sense the plasmid numbers and accordingly decide whether or not to turn on the switch of killer gene. From all these, we can achieve the goal of controlling the number of plasmids as we need.

Each approach could generate up to 415 DNA sequences, which is roughly 1,07 billion. On the level of the amino acid sequence there are 3,2 million possibilities, since each residue can be taken by 20 different amino acids.  For the assay we therefore need a high throughput method.
We adapted work of DeLoache, Russ and Dueber using the violacein pathway to measure the import effectiveness of tripeptides. The pathway consists of Violacein A (VioA), Violacein B (VioB) and Violacein E (VioE). It converts tryptophan into the green product prodeoxyviolacein (PDV). The first two enzymes, VioA and VioB, are expressed in the cytosol, and the third one, VioE, is targeted to the peroxisome with a PTS1 sequence. The degree of import can be measured by the intensity of green colour of the colonies. An efficient import signal leads to a strong import of the VioE into the peroxisome and subsequently to white colonies, because the intermediates cannot diffuse into the peroxisome to its respective enzyme. DeLoache et al. showed that there is a proportional correlation between the concentration of the green product PDV and a red fluorescent substance. The concentration of this product displays the import efficiency of the respective sequence.
This assay has been used for the evaluation of the generated PTS2 sequences. The VioE-PTS2 plasmids are harvested and cotransformed with a VioA-VioB plasmid. Each plasmid contains a specific auxotrophy marker. Consequently every growing colony contains both plasmids. To evaluate the respective sequence the concentration of the red fluorescence is measured. The more fluorescence is detected the more VioE is in the cytosol. Therefore the respective PTS2 is not that efficient. The other way around a low concentration of the fluorescent substance correlates with an efficient import via the respective PTS2.
Membrane integration
In our design we worked with both,  the cytosolic import way and the the ER-dependant one. We first tested our hypothesis and then created membrane anchors that can be fused to you protein of interest C-terminally as well as N-terminal. This allows you to add proteins to the compartment that never"

Overview
For education and public engagement human practice, we spent a lot of efforts on introducing our project, the iGEM competition and synthetic biology to the society. We can divide our work into 4 parts, outreach, visualization, analyse and communication. In outreach prat, we’ve organized exhibitions, propagation and providing teaching support to spread the concept of synthetic biology as well as our own feeling to which. Also, to make our project more acceptable by common people, we exhibit and give out various art pieces including postcards, bookmarks, leaflets and art entities as the visualization part. Analyze is a crawling method which can be used by other teams which can help for iGEM data analyse. Also, we attend conferences and seminars to communicate with professors and other teams about our project.
Outreach
This part our theme is to introduce our project, the iGEM competition and synthetic biology to the society. So we held several activities to accomplish this task.
First, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the development of synthetic biology and the 10th anniversary of the establishment of SJTU-BioX-Shanghai iGEM team, we organized a science exhibition on the topic of synthetic biology to promote the development of the discipline and provide the public with opportunities to understand science and participate in science. The exhibition achieved very good response in the library. In the 20 days, our exhibition attracted a large number of people to visit.
Exhibition
Science exhibitions are an important means of disseminating scientific and technological ideas and popularizing knowledge [1]. The science and technology exhibitions carried out in public places have the characteristics of large coverage, large flow of people, detailed content and controllable costs, which are one of the important ways to carry out public science education activities. The exhibition can be combined with explanations to further develop the scientific role of the exhibition, bridge the effective communication between scientists and the public. This can promote scientific knowledge go out of the laboratory and the journal to more common people, as well as establish an intuitive understanding of the development of science and technology for the people"

Lysis of E. coli Cells
For full lysis protocol, go to “Lysis Protocol (E.Coli)” under the Experiments page of our wiki.
We used the lysis protocol to help extract the protein from the E.Coli, as they are not excellent secreters of proteins. Our lab does not have capabilities to purify the proteins or enzymes from the lysate, but in the future, this step will be important to further test whether the constructs do adhere selectively to the plastics. We suspect the protocol was successful due to the pink/purple colouration of the lysis buffer. In our results, we can see that F2, which is PET-ase mCherry, has a slight colouration signifying the excretion of the mCherry.
Results of the Lysis Protocol, October 5th. Notice the pink coloration on ""F2"".
Testing of Constructs
Our four constructs were tested on a strip of PET plastic. We predicted there will be a slight gradient of coloration, visible to the human eye, with each construct and plastic combination. We expected to see the brightest colouration with the PET-ase and mCherry with the Hydrophobin without mCherry since the hydrophobins will make it easier to adhere better. The constructs were also tested on bubble wrap, which was our control for a non-PET plastic.
Firstly, we ran the pure mCherry through the spectrophotometer to measure the wavelength where it shows the max absorbance to have a baseline target for our upcoming tests. We determined from the results the absorbance peak was 1.011 at 587nm.

Due to late results for B. subtilis, we only got a chance to test with the transformed E. coli cell cultures. We used the spectrophotometer and ran every construct at wavelengths ranging from  557 nm to 617 nm to test different absorbances. For the full description of the procedure, see “Spect"

Week7 (Apr 27 -May 3)
We constructed all of acid production genes to the pSB1C3, as standard parts.
We did the second cell culture to test the function of glsA, but again, we didn’t get the expected results.
Comparing to the strain with the plasmid carrying J23119, we measured the intensity of proteins expressed in the strain with the plasmid carrying JBG.

We did the second cell culture to test the function of glsA, but again, we didn’t get the expected results.
Comparing to the strain with the plasmid carrying J23119, we measured the intensity of proteins expressed in the strain with the plasmid carrying JBG.
Week9 (May 11 -May 17)
We obtained the sequence of P-atp2 and P-asr by articles. We tried to constructed P-atp2 to pSB1C3, but there is an EcoRI site exists in P-atp2. So we chose another vector pXMJ19 to construct it.
We did the third cell culture to test the function of glsA, but again, we didn’t get the expected results. We have improved our experimental method, but there are still a lot of difficulties. It’s hard to realize the synchronous culture between the two strain because the different activities of preserved bacteria.
Week10 (May 18 -May 24)
We got P-atp2(Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032) and P-asr(Escherichia coli K12) through PCR. And linked them to pXMJ19 and pSB1C3 respectively. Then transformed them into BMTOP10.

Only the strain transformed with pJEJAM16 targeting GFP to the mitochondria did not result in any transformants and due to time limitation the experiment was not repeated.
The obtained transformants with the different constructed devices integrated into the genome all had a different morphology and were growing slower than the wild type strain. Especially the strain transformed with pJEJAM14 looked sick. The fungi also had a pronounced number of undefined vacuoles that can be seen on the images obtained from differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Such 'symptoms' are not uncommon when DNA is introduced into the genome by NHEJ. Below the images of the microscopy are presented.

pJEJAM12 is a plasmid intended for linearization and transformation into A. nidulans. The plasmid contains the gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the strong constitutive PgpdA promoter. The expressed GFP was evenly spread in the hyphae.

Green fluorescence can be observed in the hyphae and in clear spots. This indicates that GFP is targeted to the peroxisomes, but further investigations are required to confirm this. The 'background' fluorescence was however not expected and a replication of the experiment should be conducted in order to be able to draw any conclusions upon this.

After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference in Chung Hsing University  --Exchange ideas and receive advice for improvement
We attended the 2018 6th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference, held by National Chung Hsing University in Taichung, from July 30th to August 2nd. At the conference, we shared our project with other teams and received useful advice. For instance, someone pointed it out that some of our candidate drugs can affect the fluorescent protein, which would cause misdetection of our system. It’s such a shame that the conference was only held for four days, we received wonderful feedback and enjoyed our time very much.
Tokyo tech --Sharing an idea across the world
We have long been in a good relationship with our neighbouring country, Japan, who is one of our targets for sharing ideas iGEM projects. Fortunately, we have a Japanese in our team and he would like to spend his summer vacation in Japan with synthetic biology. Thus, he, as a representative of our team, travelled back to his hometown to build up a relationship with Tokyo tech iGEM team.
Tokyo tech is the largest institution for higher education in Japan dedicated to science and technology. With that, we decided to pay a visit to share interesting ideas with them. We are really elated to their warm welcome. Since the clock ticks fast in summer, Tokyo tech and us could only hold a short meeting in Tokyo tech and give a brief presentation to summarize our ideas.
Their topic this year is to devise a highly specific method to detect dengue fever from the patient without the use of or even surpassing ELISA. Japan is not seriously concerned with dengue fever according to the low number of reported cases. However, Tokyo tech has pondered for a solution to lower the cost of detecting dengue in tropical regions. With early detection of dengue fever becoming highly applicable, more and more people’s lives can be saved.
Our project also involves detection techniques used by Tokyo tech this year. While Tokyo tech and we use the techniques to build quite different things, we have the common goal of eliminating the use of ELISA in the domain of interest for that Elisa is a"

Evry,2016,Team:Evry#Model#Dynamic#Circuit_-_-_TEXT.html," Kirchhoff’s current law. Additionally, the deep similarity between the Boltzmann thermodynamic equations that describe noisy electronic current flow in sub-threshold transistors and noisy molecular flux in biochemical reactions has been used to map analog circuit motifs in electronics to analog circuit motifs in cells and vice versa [3] . For instance, the increase in gate voltage in a transistor (which lowers energy barriers and increases current flow) is analogous to the increases of enzyme/catalyst concentration in a metabolic reaction (which increases reaction rates).
In our project, the aim of electrical circuits-like modeling was to integrate metabolic and gene expression levels in order to obtain a profound sight on our production pathway, considering the pathway tightly connected into the cell metabolism and more importantly cell gene expression and regulation network. In the electronic, possessing the differential equation of many kind of the systems (an electrical chip, a string or a biochemical reaction or regulation), enables one to model the system in a circuit schema. Then, the circuit is solved to study or optimize the system.
Here we presented the first electrical circuit modelling of the dynamic regulation in the metabolic engineering in the iGEM. Our approach can be applied in order to design regulating system applying biosensors (Using the tool from [5] ) and making synthetic feedback loops sophisticating and optimizing the processes in the metabolic engineering.

Figure 1. Electrical circuit interpretation of the designed dynamic regulation system.
The first effort was to interpret the dynamic regulation circuit in an electrical circuit language (Figure 1. Derived from dynamic regulation map , the annotations are based on the equations which have been represented in the table). Because we did not have any electrical engineer in our team, we confine ourselves in extracting the differential equation (see the equations) of the evolution of each component from dynamic regulation map and solving them using Python (see the code). Figure 2. illustrates the dynamic behaviour of each component proportional to the time. The mathematical method used for extracting the dynamic equations is from Brian Ingalls lab, University of Waterloo [4] .

(B) Increasing the time range of the solution confirms the stability of the all components of the system after a period of time, while PLA is still increasing.
Figure 2. demonstrates that evolution of the PLA (red curve) increases while all the other components reach a balance after a period of time. Even though we used approximation for the value of all the constants (Ki , di …), we achieved"

Progress
Regulation bacteria
The focus was on finding the magical molecule 'X'. Ideas that gathered the most attention:
Ideas concerning aquaria (nutrients for fish):
Essential amino acids (Methionine/Leucine/etc..)
Vitamines (Vitamine K/Thiamin/Choline)
Odour bacteria (Manage the concentration of odour that is synthesized and transported)
Vanilla odour
biobricks for odour:
Odor bricks
(Banana odour generator)
(Wintergreen odour generator)
(Feruloyl-CoA hydratase for vanillin biosynthesis protein generator) <-- no experience/DNA available (yet)
(Synthetic periplasmic binding protein that docks a vanillin molecule) Receptor molecule
Experience from iGEM 2006 MIT group wintergreen and banana odor generator
Experience from Igem 2006 valencia group Vanillin detector system
Problem: Vanillin receptor and light receptor use the same ompr-p molecule. So, either find a different receptor for vanillin/other receptor or use a different regulator system, such as chemical receptors or others...
The system for measuring the difference between desired value (light) and the vanillin concentration would be competitive binding of repressor and activator. However, if both systems utilize the same receptor protein, no competitive binding of repressor and activator occurs"
