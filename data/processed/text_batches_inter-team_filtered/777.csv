TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Meetings_-_-_TEXT.html," checks to make sure sure that the problems are on the DNA. (+) control works fine, (the problem is not on the transformation protocol) put the DNA in a gel, got unclear/weird images. It looks like with the IGEM protocol (includes a heating step up to 42oc), you loose DNA but many impurities under the form of chopped off protein. In time DNA denaturates. Plans: There is one more thing to test: to transform the DNA we received to test promotor strength.
PCR: Ruud is setting up/checking available PCR protocol. 95-50-75 protocol with Taq polymerase seems expectedly working. Plans: Put the genes into a vector (from stabs)
New sequence design: Bastiaan made an additional sequence design that would allow to be activated starting from ~27oC. He got the green light to order it together with an additional sequence (to be activated at ~32oC). Where to order? (Action man:Bastiaan)
How to test the temperature? We have a meeting with Peter Leon Hagedoorn. The outcomes of this meeting will be reported.
Modeling work: The coloring pathway is curated. Found a parameter set for which the system is stable. Bifurcation analysis is carried out to find out parameter regions for which the system is locally stable. BRENDA is checked for nominal values of the a number of parameters in the pathway. Most values lie between 0.001-0.034. Matlab freaks have practical problems in generating random numbers within this region. Plans: make the enzyme variable, (currently constant). Check the literature for temperature enzyme activity relations.
Questions: -What is actually in the vector? (from Steven to the Pipette nerds)
-How do you plan to integrate (plug in/adapt not Runge-Kutta), the Temperature dependence of the enzyme activity? Put a switch.
Additional remarks: Janine said: ""Disregard my remarks"".

Others realize that it is a combination of society and nature, which makes them get closer to nature. Some people believe that the application of this new material improves the service life and stability of architecture, yet meanwhile doesn’t affect their artistic value. In this way, Chaoshan people still can decorate their walls and beams with gorgeous paintings and carvings.
It can be expected that, in the future, if they apply this new material, the service life of house will be greatly extended to offer shield for the people of a family, and to keep their memories as well. Those delicate decorations will remain for a longer time.
REGIONAL TEAM CONFERENCE
To promote better communication in teams, every year, igem teams in China will take part in conferences where we give presentation and get advice from the others. This year, wondefully, we even held one conference for 9 teams by ourselves.
South-China Conference
We held it!
Thanks to the ideas from SCUT-China iGEM team. We managed to held the first iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting in our school. Nine teams Participated in the event. Each team had a 20min’s presentation and 10min’s Q&A time. We all took it seriously and asked a lot of questions. It was a great opportunity for all the teams to widen their vision especially when it was April and all the mistakes can be corrected. SZU-China not only organized the event well. We also prepared a bag of souvenir for each of the participant.
In-depth communication with THU & BIT-China in Beijing
SZU-China iGEM team went to Beijing this summer. We shared our projects in detail with THU&BIT-China. We paid a visit to BIT’s labs. And had in-depth communicate about the management and inherit of iGEM teams. The friendship we got is the best treasure.
China Regional High School Meeting
We did a presentation and answered a lot of questions. And we also gave some advice to high school iGEMers.
Conference of China iGEM's Community
SZU-China iGEM team went to Fuzhou to take part in the 4th CCiC held by FAFU with posters and presentations. We received a lots of new questions from iGEM teams all over China. It was pretty rewarding and communicates has broadened our horizon.

3. Triclosan Inhibition Screening
We were down to the ""Fab 5"". Since Chalew et al showed the levels of triclosan leaving Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTPs) was up to 9 nanomolar [18], so we wanted to measure enzyme inhibition using a nanomolar level of triclosan. Under our conditions, however, not all of the fab 5 had measurable activity with a nanomolar amount of enzyme, and in order to see inhibition using a nanomolar amount of triclosan we needed to use a nanomolar amount of enzyme.
Triclosan inhibition was measured by running our standard enzyme activity assay with no triclosan and 1 nM triclosan. Negative control was 100 uM NADH, 100 uM crotonyl CoA, no enzyme, no triclosan. Observed enzyme activities were subtracted from negative control activities. Percent inhibition was calculated by:
( (uninhibited activity - inhibited activity) / uninhibited activity ) * 100
The enzyme concentrations ranged from 1.9 - 3.3 nM using two biological replicates of each enzyme. Nanomolar inhibition from P. falciparum has been previously reported [8], but we are the first to show triclosan inhibition using A. protothecoides Fabi! Interestingly, with P. tricornutum, a marine diatom, which have been shown to be sensitive towards triclosan [29] we were unable to see triclosan inhibition, which suggests there is a different biological mechanism of action for triclosan inhibition. However, nanomolar inhibition was also not observed with H. influenza, and E.coli, even though previously reported [6][7][10]. Therefore more detailed studies on conditional dependencies of inhibition are needed in order to elucidate the mechanism of action. However, the A. protothecoides inhibition data clearly indicates that triclosan effects FabI from algae and that this could be the biological mechanism of toxicity.
For our biosensor, P. falciparum FabI, being the enzyme most inhibited by triclosan, appears to be the best enzyme to use for our"
BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," in fermentation industry. Prof. Xin greatly appreciated the prospect of our parts’ application in industry, but he also mentioned that the ethical, social, legal, and environmental impact of a concept usually unfolds when it is transformed                     from a novel idea into reality ,especially when it is applied to the practice of production. Compared to the professional technicians, we lacked necessary industrial experience, so we surveyed LooKChem®, a leading biotechnology company                     in Hunan, China.
We focused on two questions during the investigation:
How does a biotechnology factory control the stability of strains in huge-amount gross production?
When our idea of automatic selection is converted into an application, what should be thoroughly considered?
LooKChem®
About these questions, Dr. Peng gave us two important information. The first is when it comes to the biological legalization, an automatic cell factory is forbidden to use antibiotics which is usual in laboratory work. As a result, they have                     to concentrate and separate the solution in order to sustain the recombination strains account for the majority of total strains. This is the central concern of our project. He also pointed out that the most common degradation happens                     when plasmids unequally distribute in cell cycles to let normal bacteria with less burden replace the recombination strains and resulting in the declination of total production.

In order to assure the practicalities of our SAM project, we've contacted a lot of experts, companies in related fields to acquire information on the prospects, potentials and weakness of this technique. Throughout these interviews and                     investigation, we've developed a profound understanding on the interaction between our project and the society, which in turn has enlightened the further study.
Prof. Yang Dong
Chinese society of biochemistry and molecular biology
Beijing normal university
After reading numerous papers,we came up with the first idea of self-control system consisting of a series of genes collaboration, and discussed with prof. Yang. In spite of her appreciation of the sophisticate network we designed, she                     regretfully denied its feasibility. Prof. Yang pointed out that a truly valuable plan for practical use must be concise because when we introduce heterologous genes, we add to more variables at the same time, which will greatly increase                     the probability of our potential failure.
But during the discussion, we came to an agreement that fermentation incubator could be considered as a natural field of natural selectivity. In this theory, the core reason of strain degradation is the strain without recombination plasmids                     or the mutated strains could get rid of the burden of heterologous protein while maintaining the same ability to absorb nutrition and growth.

The overlaps on the fragments for the Gibson assembly were designed to be 25 base pairs and were generated through PCR. On the first plasmid GFP and the native Glutamine synthetase (GLN1) are expressed and on the second the amino acid transporter AQR1 [16] from S. cerevisiae.

1. Overexpression of GLN1 and GFP
A similar strategy was used for Yarrowia as in S. cerevisiae to increase the glutamine production. The native GLN1 was overexpressed under the control of the native pTEF1 promoter, and GFP was expressed under the same promoter to allow quantification of Y. lipolytica in the co-culture. For the full construct, see Figure 14. This construct was integrated into the genome of Y. lipolytica JMY2101 by random ectopic integration through the NHEJ recombination pathway [20].
Figure 14. Construct for overexpression of GLN1 and GFP in Y. lipolytica.
The fragments for the constructs were generated through PCR with the primers in Table 15. The gene GLN1 and the terminators tXPR2 and tLIP2 were amplified from genomic DNA of Y. lipolytica JMY2900. The GFP gene was amplified from the S. cerevisiae plasmid p416tef gfp. The promoter driving the expression of GFP was amplified from the JMP1047 plasmid.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#VeronicaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Today is our iGEM Wiki Day - all of us are in the lab for a majority of the day to work on our team wiki and presentation slides. We started our day off by polishing our notebooks and adding photos from the summer. We then moved on to our individual tasks. I compiled information about the SynBio Search to write up the ""Tool Overview"" and ""Future Work"" categories. Unfortunately, Linda is still working on the SynBio Search web app, so I cannot complete the other categories yet. So far, I have included the text under ""Tool Overview,"" as well as photos and captions for the web app. Hopefully, soon I will be able to update the ""Future Work"" section and add a demo video and results.
Oct. 1: Final Stretch...
With the Wiki Freeze date only a few days away, the home stretch has begun! SynBio Search has been finalized, and the final version looks great, props to Linda! Our team is all busy finishing up the Wiki - we just finished our SynBio Search user study, so we're trying to compile the results into a comprehensive summary. The last thing we need to do is to make a demo video for the SynBio Search...and then we're all done! For the next few days/weeks, we will be practicing our presentation for iGEM - we are all so excited to come to Pittsburgh!! It's been an amazing experience and I have learned much more than I thought I would, both about synthetic biology and about computer science.

Our members introduced children to a bit of cave ecology and a more in depth understanding of White Nose Syndrome. Parents and children from the Rolla community alike were able to understand the relevance WNS has to cave ecology and the potential effects, due to its rapid spread in Missouri, it may have on their own lives if it is not stopped. We also got to speak with them about ways they can help prevent its spread. Lastly, we had a stalagmite themed ring toss that children could play.

Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," But we want to avoid a gene drive at all costs. We have also considered surveyor assay. So we are still looking for ideal solutions, probably by tracking Cas9 cuts by qPCR. (or do we have a solution?)
Our Cas9 is now fused with the fluorescent protein. It means each molecule of the FP corresponds to a molecule of Cas9. And we can supply an interesting part into the registry
TYPES OF CAS9
We were also considering different versions of Cas9 - from different bacteria, expressed from nucleus targeted to chloroplast (unluckily it is probably toxic in the cytoplasm), transiently or stably expressed, and for long we were considering using nickase (which makes just single-stranded breaks and so pair of gRNAs is used to reduce off target activity by around hundreds of folds). But then we learned the toxicity is more likely because of sucking RNAs rather than cutting off-target.
WORKING SYSTEM
We considered prototyping experiments on isolated chloroplasts to speed them up but at the moment we plan to transform chloroplasts in the whole Chlamydomonas
INSERTION SITES
This design also enables any researcher with a prepared cassette for insertion to work with our system just by changing the gRNA (20 nucleotides) to correspond to the desired site of insetrion. We have searched different sites of insertion (homologies) and in our default modular design we have settled for far on a using the sites tried out by Prof Purton's lab (trnE2-psbH) for the driver (see picture below) and also a site which in literature is reported as producing high yields (TrnI-TrnA) for our gene of interest. Right?
MODULARITY AND COMPATIBILITY
We design the system highly modular and compatible with Golden Gate so that it can be easily used and changed, it should work with any standard strain of Chlamydomonas. We are looking into possibility of maintaining our system modular by using GoldenBraid technique.
Well done if you got up to here! Have a look at our current design:

Aloha! I am a marine scientist working on plankton biology. I have experience with bioluminescent marine invertebrates and microbial plankton ecology. Though I have a more basic-science profile, I am inspired by biological and ecological properties of these organisms to design applied biotech systems such as this one. Besides science, I love SCUBA diving, playing Rock music and, of course, party like hell!! :D See ya in Amsterdam, and Oppan Gangnam style!

Hi!! I’m a project of industrial engineer, 8th semestrer. Since I was little, I have done so many diferent things further school playing football, tenis, playing piano, singing in a Church choir, learning English and German, scouting. I found iGEM as the Challenge to achieve and the Challenge to explore another scientist area that was unknown for me, in other words amazing. After iGEM i know clearly that my future comes beyond an interdisciplinary working, of course biotech within.

Hi! I'm biologist and I enjoy too much working in the laboratory, but which I really like is teaching Biology.I started in the iGEM because I liked the idea of crate something new by ourselves, and try to find all their applications of everyday life. Furthermore, I like meeting people of diferentes countries, in fact, I was in other Jamboree 2 years ago, and I think that this centralization is an excellent opportunity to meet all of you and give our diferents points of view about science. See you soon!! :)

We made a lot of changes to the presentation tonight, and it is an almost polished form now.  Arun switched to his next color scheme: a deep Cornell red with baby blue banners. Eric has gotten his part of the script memorized. He will be speaking about the three components of our project. The fungal toolkit, and its implementation through the carotenoid pathway and antifungals expression. Hannah has also prepared her part on human practices. In addition she has prepared an analysis on the market trends towards bioplastics.

There was a clear zone of inhibition around the discs dipped in 10X hygromycin, no inhibition around the discs dipped in sterile water, for the wild type BL21 E. coli. However, there was normal growth around the 10X hygromycin discs for the BL21 E. coli transformed with our pC13BV construct. For the geneticin tests, the antibiotic appeared relatively ineffective, possibly due to degradation, and that experiment will need to be repeated.
The T7 promoter and hygromycin resistance construct appears functional in E. coli.

Today we met again with Oat to make some changes to our images.  Arun moved onto his next color scheme: the same deep maroon with elephant grey banners.  In addition, the data, and ending slides will follow a baby blue and off white color scheme. We also made a few of our slides (our styrofoam map, standoff figure, and toolkit image) fancier and more attractive.  Arun also experimented with backgrounds of clouds, dirt, and toolkit to make the introduction slides very sharp. It look like we now have a solid design for our presentation.

Week 4  (7/30 - 8/05)
1. The shipment with the synthesized parts (mPR of Danio rerio and mig1) arrived.
2. A transformation of the parts mPR Danio rerio and mig1 was performed using the competent E. coli TOP10 cells. Another transformation of the backbone plasmids pRS313, pRS315 and pRS316 was executed. Both were successful.
The first attempt to isolate the plasmids was through usage of a plasmid preparation kit, but this try failed. Therefore the plasmid isolation was successfully repeated using alkaline lysis.
3. A new PCR of the parts 1-8 with Taq/Pfu polymerase was performed applicating new yeast DNA. As an effect of the frequent freezing and defrosting the old yeast DNA was probably damaged. Therefore some earlier PCRs did not work.

1. A small restriction digest of the shuttle vectors pRS313, pRS315 and pRS316 was performed with XbaI and SpeI in order to examine the capability to linearize with the right overhangs for a ligation to take place later. The restriction digest was executed with the parts mig1 and mPR of Danio rerio, too. Due to unclean plasmids and DNA (perhaps to much salt) this step had to be repeated several times, because the restriction digests were incomplete.
Therefore the plasmids (pRS313, pRS315, pRS316 and the parts mig1, mPR Danio rerio) were purified again with a Midi Prep DNA purification kit. Now the restriction digest was executed completely. We estimate that max. 30 µg DNA can be digested with our reaction.
The purification of the parts mig1 and mPR Danio rerio and the pRS vectors was performed with a PCR Purification Kit in order to prepare the DNA for ligation.
2. A new PCR of the parts 1-8 was executed using Herculase in order to obtain a higher amount of PCR product. The polymerase Herculase was used due to its precision and productivity. Indeed the result of the PCR was better than with the Pfu/Taq polymerase.

In order to characterize their increased tolerance of copper or/and cadmium ions, we designed and conducted two different sets of experiments, in both visible and quantitative manner, to test their ability to cope with adverse environmental conditions.
CONSTRUCTION
This vector consists of three parts, an estrogen-inducible PCLB2 promoter (BBa_K2407002) , the Cre-EBD sequence (BBa_K2407005) and a CYC1 terminator (BBa_K2407003) . We used overlap PCR to ligate these three parts and then the plasmids with URA3 and HIS nutritional label respectively through enzymatic digestion and ligation. Then this composite part (BBa_K2407011） ,was sequenced and proved to be accurate by using the promoter's forward primer and the terminator's reverse primer. The electrophoresis results below also showcased that the sequence length (about 2800bp) was correct.
Fig.3-1 This is a simplified version of this vector expressing the Cre recombinase enzyme. Cre-EBD is the coding sequence of Cre recombinase; PCLB2 is a constitutive  promoter in yeast; CYC1 is a terminator.
CHARACTERIZATION
Dilution Assay
We conducted dilution assay on SC solid media containing 0.14 mM cadmium ions. Experimental groups are S1, S2, S3, and S4; control groups are synX (the yeast strain containing a synthetic chromosome X), BY4741 (wild-type haploid yeast), and BY4743 (wild-type diploid yeast). Results are shown in the picture below.
Fig.3-2 Experimental groups: S1, S2, S3, and S4; control groups: synX, BY474, and BY4743. Yeast cells were picked up from single colonies on solid growth media and diluted by 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000 times.
Apparently, the experimental groups have a survival advantage over control groups. In this picture, S1 is able to develop a large single colony even after it is diluted to 100000 times on SC solid media containing 0.14 mM cadmium ions; S3 and S4 are able to grow when diluted to 100000 times but the colonies are much smaller than that of S1. Although S2 is not as good as the other three, it still shows higher resistance to cadmium ions than the control groups do. Wild-type yeast strains BY474"

Deploy
Strategy Development
After the validation of the genetic circuit, the next step, especially for teams in Diagnostics, Environment, Food and Energy, and Manufacturing tracks is to develop a strategy for implementation in the real-world. Here, teams should consider the other category of constraints (social, resource-based, financial, etc.). We call these dimensional considerations. By thinking about entrepreneurial considerations or what it will take to implement your solution with minimal resources, teams will help guide the evolution of their project in a more pragmatic direction. One thing to keep in mind is that sometimes talking to these stakeholders may uncover information that changes a foundational assumption and sends you back to the drawing board. It can be disheartening at first, but it is important to use this as a learning lesson and as a pivot for the direction of your project.
Communication
Scientists are notoriously ineffective communicators, and this extends to iGEM teams as well. To help resolve this, it is important to identify your audience and determine what their most crucial needs are. Why are you presenting this information to them and what are they hoping to get out of it? The goal of effective communication is to make sure that each party gets something out of it: it is important to make sure that the information given is clearly described without logical missteps and is effectively delivered.  This brings us to our second sub-component of communication: communication through design. Especially as iGEM members, our most effective platform for communicating our results is through the wiki, and too often, too much technical depth is provided. After identifying your target audience(s), it can be difficult to tailor the information specifically through them, but that is where information design can be a very powerful tool. Make sure that your graphics are clean and communicate a single concept at a time; much like good writing, it’s important to allow your reader/viewer the opportunity to digest the information at their own pace and to communicate just what is necessary, nothing more, nothing less.
The beauty of our approach is that all parts are ongoing at all times! We encourage teams to use this paradigm and incorporate it throughout their entire project, and we hope that it will be of great benefit to teams going forward.

Modelling Results of the RelE-RelB System
Results
As the bacteria only require a few tens of RelE molecules to enter dormancy, the threshold was placed at 40 copies to allow for lag in activation. This is of course an oversimplification, but it is not a problem that activation and dormancy are defined at different levels, since the exact number of RelE molecules required to induce dormancy is unknown.
The Impact of Promoters with Different Production Rates on RelE Expression
During the implementation of RelE, gene expression was simulated for promoters with different strengths, which were chosen through an iterative process. Promoters with production rates of 3.5 and 10.5 molecules per minute, both induce dormancy rather slowly, with the latter inducing dormancy in approximately 50 minutes. In cells cloned with a promoter producing 35 molecules per minute, the cells will enter dormancy in about 10 minutes, while promoters producing 105 and 350 molecules per minute both have a negligible timeframe. In the simulated dormancy system, the three strongest promoters exhibited similar results, indicating that a certain threshold value had been transcended. This means, that not only was the gene expression disproportional to the promoter strength, but the risk of overshooting was also increased tremendously.

Gibson Assembly
Modified from Gibson et al. (2009)
Gibson Assembly
This assembly method is an isothermal, single-reaction method for assembling multiple overlapping DNA molecules. By coordinating the activity of a 5‘ exonuclease, a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase two adjacent DNA fragments with complementary terminal sequence overlaps can be joined into a covalently sealed molecule, without the use of any restriction endonuclease.
Preparation of DNA molecules for in vitro recombination
Generate the complementary sequence overlaps by PCR using the Phusion DNA-polymerase . If necessary add 5 M Betain in the reaction mix by reducing the amount of H2O to decrease the number of false PCR products.
Identify the PCR products of interest by gel electrophoresis with known DNA standards.
Extract the PCR products from the gel by cutting out the DNA fragments and clean them up by using a commercial PCR clean-up kit .

Next, we added dCas9 system via an overnight ligation. Using the restriction sites ClaI and XhoI, we can digest the dCas9 PCR product. The Plasmid 1 backbone was digested with ClaI and SalI-HF restriction enzymes. A SalI site is already present in the dCas9 system, but XhoI and SalI sites are compatible. This plasmid was termed ""Plasmid 1.1"" for ease of understanding, shown in the figure below.
The final step was to insert the Lambda Red Recombinase system using ClaI and XbaI restriction digest sites. This plasmid was termed ""Plasmid 1.2"" shown below.
Future Plans
We will continue trying to insert the Plasmid 1.2 into the P. putida genome using homologous recombination. Before Ashlee graduates, she hopes to construct the second plasmid, containing the HMF pathway and the RFP reporter gene, and insert that into the genome as well. She will use a CRISPR RNA targetting RFP to validate that the dCas9 system can knock out genes. Emily will continue this project after Ashlee graduates in December. She hopes to identify the essential genes of the pathway and engineer it to function in E. coli!
More Detailed Information
Why is this important?
If we can determine the genes essential to the function of the pathway responsible for catabolizing furfural and HMF toxins, we can in principle engineer any bacterium to have these genes. Engineering E. coli to have the HMF pathway will allow this well-studied, easily manipulated and fast-growing bacterium to live in the presence of toxins released during biomass pretreatment, and even use furfural and HMF toxins as fuel!
Therefore, industry and academic researchers can subject biomass to more intense pretreatment processes – which release more toxins. Engineered bacteria will be able to live in the presence of these toxins and more sugars will be available for hydrolysis and fermentation, increasing biofuel yields from the same initial amount of biomass.
Background
Greenhouse gas emissions and dwindling fossil fuel reserves have pushed developed countries like the United States to explore renewable fuel sources. “Biofuels” are an attractive sustainable energy technology because they can be produced from plant biomass, which includes wood, grasses, and agricultural waste. Bioethanol and biodiesel can be blended or used as automobile fuel, among other uses. One way to produce biofuels from"

As our project revolves around global warming and green sustainable energy, we were thrilled to hear about the iGEM Goes Green initiative made by the TU Dresden iGEM team. Following their guidelines, we have calculated the carbon footprint of our laboratory work and travelling. We have, in part, tried to make up for our carbon footprint, by changing our travelling and eating habits in our everyday lives. Furthermore, we have reduced our daily electricity consumption, our wiki became CO2 neutral, and we made an effort to sort our waste. The full report can be scrutinised here. Due to our team being the most green dream team, TU-Dresden asked us to lead the iGEM Goes Green project in year 2018.
We sought expertise from the Macquarie Australia iGEM team, who has worked with the implementation of photosynthesis in E. coli since 2013. We had an interesting Skype call with their team, where we discussed the particular challenges their previous teams had experienced throughout their projects.
We were also able to help the Stony Brook iGEM team by facilitating communication with members of the SDU iGEM team from 2016.
During our project we received several questionnaires from fellow iGEM teams. We were delighted to help the teams by answering their questionnaires. These included from:
Waterloo - regarding 3D printing of lab equipment
Dalhousie - regarding the common conception of science literature
University of Washington - regarding communication platforms used by teams
Vilnius-Lithuania - regarding cotransformation
Nanjing-China - regarding a whole-cell sensor for formaldehyde
University of Sydney - regarding the use and accessibility of insulin

The value of $\sigma_N(\phi)$ can be interpreted as the minimum charge density that a polymer duo of length $N$ and volume fraction $\phi$ need to have in order to coacervate.
Now remember what we are trying to do here: we are trying to show that for a fixed charge density, longer polymers in solution coacervate, whereas shorter ones do not. In other words, we want to show that by chopping up one of the polymers, the system will go from a coacervate state into a homogeneously mixed state. Full mathematical treatment ranges beyond our scope, so instead we will take a graphical approach. We start by plotting $\sigma_N(\phi)$ for a solution containing polymers of effective chain length $N=400$ (Figure 2A). Say that the used polymers have charge density $\sigma=0.135$ and are present in a concentration $\phi=0.008$. Our system is thus at the point $P$ in Figure 2A, which lies in the region where coacervation occurs. Now what we do is chop up all the polymers from a length of $N=400$ to a length of $N=100$, without making any other change to the solution. The polymers still have exactly the same charge density, and the volume fraction is also unaltered. In other words, our system stays at the exact same point $P$. When we plot the same graph now for $N=100$, we see that the point $P$ suddenly lies outside the coacervate region, and in the region where homogeneous mixing occurs (Figure 2B).
Figure 2: The spinodal curve shifts upon decreasing polymer length. The spinodal curve shifts into the direction of positive σ when the polymers in coacervates are chopped up into smaller pieces"

Ethical and Safety Considerations in Synthetic Biology
Synthetic Biology Safety Considerations
Our university iGEM team are pioneering the first truly synthetic biology project here at Aberdeen; previously genetic manipulation projects have simply involved expressing, or overexpressing, a single gene. We are the first researchers to attempt to assemble a biological circuit, by combining components to generate an emergent property.
Before our lab work commenced, a few safety and ethical issues had to be considered. We were required to submit an application for permission to the local University of Aberdeen Advisory Committee of Genetic Manipulation (ACGM), the outcome of which can be seen in the document below. Consideration by this Committee was designed to ensure that there were no safety concerns for researchers on the project, the general public, or the environment, all crucial pre-requisites of a safe iGEM project.
As you may recall, the aim of our project was to create a bacterial Pico Plumber, capable of detecting and mending broken"

We have successfully induce the expression of this protein and test it’s efficiency under 585 nm illumination. This picture below showed the expression of killer red under the illumination of laser. The body of E.coli stood out in this picture.
After the illumination of fluorescent microscope for 4 hours, we cultivate them in 37℃ drying oven overnight, and we could see it clearly that the culture medium which both under induction and illumination is smooth, have no bacteria survive, and the others(one illuminated by light and not induced, one induced without illumination of light, one neither induced nor illuminated) surface are rough, indicating the growth of E.coli.
Phi 174 Gene E
Gene E is a kind of lysis protein from phage. It could help promote efficient cell lysis by inhibit cell wall synthesis.
We can induce the expression of gene E under different condition such as heat shock or small molecule. If we want to terminate the therapy, we could give our patient heat shock or other small chemistry molecular, thus induce the end of bacteria’s life. We have tested the efficiency of gene under the temperature control operon. We insert Gene E into the multiple clone site of pBV220, which would express our protein under the condition of 42℃
However, we found it surprising that it would be much more efficient in 37℃ than in 42℃, And it actually showed the efficiency of gene E
Then we induced the expression of gene E under small chemistry molecular, IPTG. These data showed below ,under the induction of the corresponding small chemistry molecular, the gene E can terminate bacteria’s life as we hope. On the other hand, even when we use the BL21(DEe)plyss, which could express toxin protein, the results showed serious leaking expression. This gene is too toxin to cultivate them to OD 0.2.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," across various labs and instruments, but do not account for natural variation. In order to combat the difficulty of reporting measurements accurately, we decided to design an internal control featuring monomeric RFP.
GFP tends to show a high Copy-Number Variation (CNV), and this combined with its unreliable cell count can render it a non-optimal fluorescence standard. In a study conducted by Kosuri et al. (2013), “GFP expression levels varied over approximately four orders of magnitude compared with relatively constant red fluorescence”. Copy number is affected by many factors, such as culture conditions, the ori, the size of the plasmid, the growth rate, etc. In the absence of selection, high-copy number plasmids are typically lost from populations at a high rate, making plasmid loss a key factor in limiting accurate measurements.
RFP’s high, constant levels of brightness, a relatively low number of base-pairs, and availability of multiple assays to measure its fluorescence such as spectrophotometry and microscopic assays, make it a viable choice for an internal control. By integrating a monomeric RFP reporter into the current iGEM Interlab plasmids, it is hypothesized that a better alternative to Ludox and fluorescein can be found in RFP.
A comparison of fluorescence versus OD measurements across multiple plates of both interlab plasmids as well as plasmids with the proposed internal control, should indicate the reliability of the RFP unit as a standard.
Design
BBa_K2205000 is a proposed composite BioBrick reporter that constitutively produces MFRP1 (Figure 3.1). It possesses an MRFP1 coding sequence (E1010) after a strong Anderson promoter (J23100) and RBS (B0034). A double terminator (B0015) was added after the MRFP1 sequence. A BioBrick RFC10 prefix and suffix were added as well. Three twins were discovered after submission to the Registry. The construct was submitted to IDT for synthesis as a gBlock.
Figure 3.1 An internal control mRFP device assembled with Interlab Device 1
Due to time constraints, work on assembling and further characterising this Biobrick was unable to finish. Future work could be conducted by further characterising this part and acquiring OD and fluorescence values on a plate reader of an assembled interlab plasmid against interlab devices without an internal control. Ideally, the RFP should maintain constant levels of fluorescence regardless of cell count and copy numbers across all plates, and provide an internal standard for comparison against"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi.

We used a lot of different Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) during our project written by last years SDU iGEM team. It is very important that every person in the lab uses the same SOP to make sure that the experiments does not depend on the person executing them, but only on the methods used. Any changes made to the SOPs were agreed upon by the entire team, to make sure that everyone knew when and why a Standard Operating Procedure was changed. Below you can explore all our SOPs:

EDUCATION AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
In France, the general public and even first year bachelors students of biology seem to associate Biology to the observation of flora and fauna. We tried to speak to a large target audience, including people who had been previously introduced to the synthetic biology and those who hadn’t. Our aim was to popularize synthetic biology and its various applications.
We met people from different walks of life, whatever were their age, their professional or their social situation. In this way, we were able to introduce Fatima, 6 years old, to Biology and to make her understand the significant role of bacteria. We were able to help Camille, 21 years old and biology student, to learn more about laboratory practices. Not to forget Lucette, 81 years old, for whom Biology and the world of research were very abstract.
OUR INTERVENTION FOR KIDS FROM 3 TO 17 YEARS OLD
In June, we spent a week speaking and playing with kids from holiday centers as part of the Scienc’estival, an event we organised with Planète Science and the Les Ulis city. We worked with more than 150 kids from 3 to 15 years old.
The aim of our stand was adapted to the age-group of the kids. With the younger ones we tried to teach them the advantages and the disadvantages of bacteria. To do so, we asked them first to say what they thought bacteria were, and also to draw one. Then, we taught them difference between a “good” bacteria (“Gentille” in French) and a “bad” bacteria (“Méchant” in French). We also asked them to put their fingerprints in a Petri dish and showed them that bacteria were everywhere. Finally, we organised an Assault Course game, where the kids played bacteria that needed to bring to their team water, sugar and minerals without touching fire, antibiotics or bleach"

SDS-PAGE & Western Blot
For efficient detection of proteins in our studies, especially dCas9 and it‘s targets, cells were transfected and after 48 h cell lysis followed.   SDS-Gels (10 % SDS) were performed in Invitrogen-cassettes or Biorad-systems. Therefore, resolving- and stacking-gels were poured as listed in the according table.
The bags were loaded with 20 µl sample or 10 µl marker (cell lysates were boiled at 95 °C in 1x Loading Buffer for 5 minutes before). Runs were performed at 80 volt until the samples had reached the resoltution gel. Then, the voltage was increased to 120 volt. Gels run until the blue frontline had passed the gel completely.
Afterwards, blotting in a wet tank or semi-dry blotting followed. therefore PVDF-membranes were activated for 5 minutes in methanole. Then, they were passed to transfer-buffer just as the Whatman-Paper.   wet-blotting: The blotting sandwiches were prepared as follows, started from the bottom:
one fiber pad
2 pieces of whatman-paper
SDS-gel
PVDF-membrane
one piece of whatman-paper
one fiber pad
Then, the sandwich was inserted into the wet tank. Blotting was performed for 1.5 h at 4 °C. For one membrane 200 mA was set (two membranes: 400 mA).
semi-dry-blotting: For semi-dry blotting the apparatuses of AG Weber were used.
one piece of whatman-paper
PVDF-membrane
SDS-gel
one piece of whatman-paper
Blotting was performed for 1.5 h. For one membrane 350 mA was set (two membranes: 700 mA).
After blotting, the membrane was blocked in 10 ml of 4 % milkpouder-TBST solution for 1 h. The solution was aspirated before primary antibody in 2 % milkpouder-TBST solution was added (10 ml) and incubated over night on a shaker at 4 °C.
In general primary antibodies were: anti-HA (dilution: 1:2500), anti B-Actin (dilution: 1:2500), anti-GAPDH ("

This presentation was videotaped and then the whole group had a chance to talk about it, give feedback, etc.  After this, we went and refined these presentations and gave someone else on the team a chance to present (Jamie) and we repeated the same process.  This was really helpful as it helped us see some of things that our fellow teammates do well as well as some things that they could improve on.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

High-school Teachers
Through discussions with local high school teachers we learned that synthetic biology is not a deeply explored topic in upper division classrooms, and that biotechnology has been removed from the grade twelve biology curriculum. With this knowledge, and an alignment of concerns, we decided to implement their concerns for the betterment of primary and secondary education in Northern British Columbia. This quickly became a major focus of our initiative Bringing Synthetic Biology to the North.
With the above deficit in mind, we approached high-school education improvement in the following ways. First, we asked teachers what they wanted their students to learn from us then created specialized presentations each classroom we visited that integrated concepts specific the teachers’ wishes, as well as included introductory concepts on synthetic biology as well as the vast applications of biotechnology. Furthermore, we wanted to integrate synthetic biology more deeply into the classroom that could work alongside the current BC curriculum to fill the gap of the recently removed biotechnology unit. Therefore, we developed a lesson plan booklet consisting of introductory synthetic biology concepts and biotechnologies. Each lesson plan was written in a way both teachers and students could understand, with concept checks at the end to make sure students understood what they read.
Elementary School Teachers
All of our team members grew up in communities around Northern British Columbia. After much discussion among ourselves we agreed there was a collective lack of introduction to science during our elementary years, and a further lack of enthusiasm for the field. We also couldn’t remember a formal introduction to synthetic biology until our late years of high-school, or for some early years of university. Our thoughts and feelings aligned with conversations we had with current elementary school, primary, teachers, where they admitted that in their classrooms science wasn’t a focus nor did they feel they showed it the enthusiasm it deserved. As a team we brainstormed ways to address this problem. We came up with a few avenues. First, we designed a free Synthetic Biology Activity Book , that contains eight synthetic biology based, interactive activities for elementary students. This is for teachers to use to help introduce young students to synthetic biology. We contacted and distributed our activity book to various public and private elementary schools in Prince George and surrounding Northern communities. Our other approach was community-outreach based. We aligned ourselves with our local museum to be"

As cells swim up a concentration gradient of attractant, they spend more time smooth swimming than tumbling; this modulation of swimming behavior is manifested as a chemotactic response.

E. coli has five chemoreceptors, four are methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (McpS) which have periplasmic ligand binding sites and conserved cytoplasmic signaling domains (Fig. 2).  The McpS initiate a motor control response and a feedback circuit that updates the methylation record to achieve sensory adaptation and cessation of the motor response. A fifth MCP-like protein, Aer, mediates methylation-independent aeroTCAtic responses by monitoring redox changes in the electron transport chain. The five MCP-family receptors in E. coli utilize a common set of cytoplasmic signaling proteins to control flagellar rotation and sensory adaptation (Fig. 2).  CheW and CheA generate receptor signals; CheY and CheZ modulate rotation of the flagellar motor and thus change cell behavior and movement; CheR and CheB regulate MCP methylation state to make feedback to CheW and CheA.
Fig. 2 Signaling components and circuit logic. E.coli receptors employ a common set of cytoplasmic signaling proteins: CheW and CheA interact with receptor molecules to form stable ternary complexes that generate stimulus signals; CheY transmits those signals to the flagellar motors, CheZ controls their lifetime; CheR (methyltransferase) and CheB (methylesterase) regulate MCP methylation state.

LB broth was used as blank after testing no significant changes in OD600 absorbance upon Cadmium concentration.
We measured the absorbance overnight of the different mutants using LB broth as blank -after assessing that Cadmium chloride did not affect absorbance-. The concentration of Cadmium reflects a negative effect around 0.9 mM concentration in all mutants, being pYoda the best growing mutant. However, the wild type presents depleted growth compared to the mutants in absence of CdCl

Second test: Inducing pYodA with different cadmium concentrations and assessing its strength by using GFP expression as a proxy
The test was performed using 96 well plates arranged as shown in diagram 1. The results (not shown) did not present inducibility of PYoda regardless of the Cd concentration and fluorescence levels remained under the spectra of the wild type’s. This could suggest our chassis (Dh5Alpha) may not have the necessary apparatus for the induction of PyodA as it is known that the induction of the promoter by the heavy metal is not direct. It is mediated by many different genes related to facing stressful conditions in E. coli such as Soxs and Fur (Puškárová, A., et al., 2002).

OLS_Canmore,2016,Team:OLS Canmore#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"iobrick KerUS plasmid seems promising and in several experiments shows evidence of some enzyme activity.  Seen either as clearing on skim milk plates, or possible leaching of protein-based dye from the cap of the falcon tubes.
Our modified miniprep seems to skirt many of the problems experienced in our lab.
The biobrick KerUS plasmid seems to have been unsuccessfully created because they results obtained do not show evidence of enzyme activity.  However, gel electrophoresis using miniprepped biobrick KerUS plasmid are also unsuccessful.  This points to a problem with the creation of the part, and not with the expression of keratinase.
Creation of the biobrick parts:
After starting from scratch, knowing that the synthesized parts were mistakenly placed in a backbone with Kanamycin resistance, we had no issue growing up and maintaining cell cultures and plates.  However, because of the time crunch between the 13th of October and the part submission deadline on the 21st, we were helped by our mentor Lisa Oberding.  She works for Fredsense and has full-time access to a lab, therefore she was able to assist in creating the parts.  She also set up some assay with the biobrick parts in her lab, while we ran them concurrently at our school.  We are very grateful to have her as our mentor, otherwise we would never have been able to submit parts.
Starting From Scratch:
The description of the results is quite vague because they were only obtained a few hours before the wiki freeze.  We would love to discuss these during the poster session, or through email and facebook (contact info at the bottom of the page)!  Also, we’ll be sure to mention these during our presentation.
Starting from the beginning, the synthesized plasmids were transformed and plated onto Kanamycin plates.  Unlike when we were transforming onto Ampicillin plates, the cultures grew quicker and better.
Then a restriction digest and gel electrophoresis were run in order to be able to construct the biobrick.  The gel below shows the, in the top row KerA digests, and in the bottom row, KerUS digests.  For the KerA wells, 3 of the digests were positive showing a band at around 5,300bp for the vector (pET28b+), and approximately 1,400 bp KerUS and 1,100 bp for KerA. A ligation using these digested plasmids was done to assemble the composite keratinase parts into the pSB1C"

Mix the ingredients of the running gel and pour the solution quickly (gel starts to polymerize once TEMED has been added) into the gap between the glass plates. Leave enough room for the stacking gel – appr. 1 cm below the bottom of the comb´s teeth. After a minute you can overlay the solution with iso-propanol or ethanol. This excludes the access of oxygen and plane the surface.
After polymerization, pour off the iso-propanol and rinse with distilled water. Mix the reagents for the stacking gel and pour it on top of the running gel till the space is completely full. Then insert the comb. No alcohol overlay is needed due to the comb.
After polymerization clamp the gel into the electrophoresis apparatus and fill it with running buffer. Remove the comb carefully and use a pipette or syringe to wash the wells with running buffer.
The protein samples (up to 15 µl) are mixed with SDS loading buffer (2.5 µl) and incubated for 10 min at 95°C.
After heating briefly centrifuge the samples to spin down the condensed water.
Then you can apply the samples on a SDS PAGE with a pipette or Hamilton microliter syringe. Do not forget to add molecular weight marker in one lane.
Run the gel at 80 V until the front has moved into the running gel. Then you can increase the voltage to 120 V. Run the gel until the running front has reached the bottom of the running gel.

NanoDrop was used to measure the DNA concentration (Harry and Jan)  Time-lapse measurements of ''B. subtilis'' growth in specified metal and ethanol concentrations (based on previous data)were performed (Harry, Hugo, Dainius and Jan).
*'''8th of July''':  Two PCR reactions were set up to clone out genes of interest from ''B. subtilis'' (Harry and Hugo; Dainius and Kyle).  The ethanol production part was combined with a promoter - overnight ligation(Jan)
*'''9th of July''': The PCR product was run on the gel to confirm the presence of the desired product (Aleksandra, Dainius, Jan)  The ligation product was transformed into the competent ''E. coli'' cells. Those were plated on the KAN+IPTG+X-gal plates (Aleksandra, Jan).  ''B. subtilis'' genomic DNA was purified from the O/N culture for the use in the future PCR reaction (Harry)
*'''10th of July''': DNA gel electrophoresis of the PCR product was performed once more due to inconclusive results from 9/07/2013 (Jan). Bands of expected size were observed. Additional PCR was set up to obtain more DNA (Harry and Hugo). Following gel electrophoresis resulting products were restricted using correct enzyme and an O/N ligation reaction was set-up (Aleksandra and Jan)  The transformation using the EdiBrick and ethanol production parts ligation product was successful - numerous blue colonies were obtained. Two colonies were selected and propagated into 5ml LB +KAN medium. Two more colonies (4 in total) were propagated onto LB+KAN+X-gal plates and incubated O/N in 37 deg.C (Aleksandra, Jan)
*'''11th of July''': The ligation products of vector and two transcription factors amplified using PCR were transformed into E. coli and plated on LB+AMP+X-gal+IPTG"

If we consider a completely exclusive binding (i.e. either the activator or the inhibitor complex is attached to the promoter), in our model we have to set \(J\to\infty\) (i.e. the interaction energy between two complexes goes to infinity). In this case the last term of \(Z\) wanishes and the partition function of our system is simply         \[             Z_{\infty} = \lim_{J\to\infty} Z = 1 + K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a] + K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_i].         \]         Again, it is easy to compute binding probabilities.

WHY ARE LAND MINES A PROBLEM?
Since the end of the Cold War and the implementation of the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, the use of land mines has sharply declined. Also, the production (in almost every country) and trade in land mines has come to a standstill. However, land mines still pose a large humanitarian problem. There are two main reasons for this. First, In some conflicts, land mines are still used in several conflicts. Secondly and eEvven more importantly, large areas of former war zones are contaminated with unexploded land mines, which continue to cause (civilian) casualties on a daily basis [7].
ONGOING USE AND PRODUCTION OF LAND MINES
Due to the Ottawa Convention, most countries have stopped the production and use of landmines. However, there are still eleven countries who continue to produce mines or reserve the right to do so. These countries are: China, Cuba, India, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, South Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Singapore, and Vietnam. Of those, four were actively manufacturing antipersonnel mines in 2012: India, Myanmar, Pakistan, and South Korea. The United States have recently (27 June 2014) declared a change of Mine Ban stance, announcing that they are planning to join the Mine Ban Treaty in the future and that they will not produce antipersonnel mines[7].
New antipersonnel landmines have been laid in recent years in Yemen (a State Party of the Mine Ban Treaty), apparently by government forces. There are also allegations that State Parties South Sudan, Sudan and Turkey have used antipersonnel mines. From the countries who have not signed the treaty, the governments of Syria and Myanmar have made use of landmines in 2012 and 2013. Mines are also placed by non-state armed groups (rebel armies, terrorists) in Afghanistan, Colombia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Syria, Thailand, Tunisia, and Yemen. In this case, the used devices are usually not “real” landmines, but victim-activated improvised explosive devices [8].
OLD LANDMINES AND EXPLOSIVE REMNANTS OF WAR
Mines emplaced during a conflict can still kill or injure civilians decades later. Next to that, after a conflict, areas remain contaminated with explosive remnants of war (ERW). These are explosive weapons that somehow failed to detonate and are left behind. They pose dangers"

Cell targeting
Context
After the tissue vector action, comes the cell  vector , this one is a modified bacteriophage which has the ability to infect eukaryotic cells. Lambda phage, because of its high capacity of cloning and a capsid structure adapted to a concentrated presence of exogenous proteins, is a good candidate to design an eukaryotic tissue vector . The penton base originally from the adenovirus capsid appears as a promising candidate for Lambda phage targeting. Indeed, it is endowed of several functions like the cell receptors link, the viral particles internalisation and the release of the capsid by the endosome.
Objective
Our objectives are to design a cell vector of Lambda phage type recombined with a penton base from the adenovirus 5 fused by its D protein . The tissue vector should be able to integer the cell, go out of the endosome, transport its DNA to the nucleus of the cell and finally to transcript its therapeutic genes .

As we have made BL21(WT) with several plasmids, it was necessary to determine the OD and fluorescence value of the bacteria so that we could know if BL21(WT) with the plasmids was able to oscillate. To achieve the goal, we used enzyme-labeled instrument. By sampling and measuring on time, we could see that if our circuit would work smoothly.   After sampling per hour, we centrifuged samples at 6,000g for 10min. And then we discarded flow-through liquid. Next, we added PBS buffer into bacteria. Using enzyme-labeled instrument, we got a serious of data of OD and fluorescence value. We did it three times.

Amsterdam,2012,Team:Amsterdam#outreach#handout_-_-_TEXT.html," itself consists of six undergraduate (MSc) students that span the following studies: Biomoleculair Sciences, Systems Biology, Bioinformatics.
Our project: The Cellulair Logbook
Meet the Cellulair Logbook. It does what the name implies: A cell that keeps track of its cell variables and variables in its close environment. These variables can be anything that can be sensed by a cell. Some examples are: oxygen, light, toxics, heavy metals and nutritients. When a cell measures one of these variables it is stored in the cell by methylation of restriction sites (see definitions), literally storing data on the DNA. By having these restriction sites methylated, the DNA can not be cut and as such the read out will show that the the gene has been expressed, and as such we know that the variable has been present. Because in bacteria daughter cells do not inherit methylated sites from its parent, every reproduction cycle the amount of methylated cells is halfed. This way we are able to use mathematical models to trace back when something is methylated and when the variable has been present.
Applications
It is very important to realise that what we are doing is very fundamental research. This means that once we are done it can not be directly used for any of the applications below. However, when further build upon these ideas we believe that the applications listed below are possible. Some are a long way into the future (years) where others might be applicable after months of further research.
Medical applications
In the future we might be able to put our cell in the human body. The cell will then travel trough it and keep track of its surrounding variables. When the cell has travelled trough the human body it is excreted and the 'log' is read out.
If, for say, the cell has noted that at some point there was less oxygen present than normal, we can trace back when this has happened with mathematical models using the fact that bacterial cells do not inherit methylated sites. Knowing that an area around the tumor is less oxygen rich than normal areas in the human body, we can mark this region as potential tumor region.
Environmental applications: Heavy Metals
If we design our system in such a way that it is able to recognize multiple heavy metals (by having a sensor, fusion protein and restriction site for each) we can detect if water is polluted. This would be especially handy in third world countries, as this would be a cheap method to detect if water is drinkable or not.
Environmental applications: Using synthetic biology to protect against synthetic biology
One of the potential dangers of synthetic biology is that potentially"

Prof. Dr. Wiechert explained that only a few companies use LSPR and that their products are expensive             (about 200,000€ to 300,000€).
Furthermore, we discussed other approaches like the Molecular Beacon Method.             But he advised us not to use it due to its complexity.
Besides, he introduced us to Prof. Bott who helped us in the next step.

Meeting with Prof. Dr. Bott in Juelich
Choosing RZR as a receptor for our hardware device
After getting the SPR idea from Professor Wiechert we visited Professor Michael Bott in the Juelich Reasearch Center,             who leads the systemic microbiology there. He told us more about this technology and we discussed with him different             melatonin receptors to use. We learned that working with the MT1 receptor should be avoided because it is a membranous protein.             So for anchoring it, we would need to create an artificial membrane, which would be a tricky task.             Professor Bott suggested using preferably our other melatonin receptor, the transcription factor RZR.

Semiconductor Experts
In August we started looking for partners to build our gold nanostructure.             We had a lot of luck to talk with experts in this field from the Institute for Semiconductors (IHT)             and the Institute of Integrated Photonics (IPH): Dr. Florian Merget of the IPH and Stefan Scholz of the IHT.             We met multiple times to talk about our concept.
At first, our hardware idea was to build an optic fiber based LSPR System.             In this setup, the gold nano structure is placed on top of a small optic fiber and the light is guided             from the lamp to the nano structure by the glass fiber. Some light is reflected back by Plasmon Resonance,             guided through the fiber and then analyzed in the spectrometer. The advantage is that the optical handling and alignment is really easy.             No moving parts and lenses that need to be in focus are needed.             That is why we at first preffered this method.
After presenting this idea, we got to talk about how commercial chips like those inside a computer,             smartphone or car are produced. Dr. Merget and Mr. Scholz had a lot of insight to this"

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

Still, some plasmids were isolated from colonies of plates with insert, and digested with SalI-HF and ScaI-HF. Any positive clones should not be cut by SalI, because this restriction site is only present in the original backbone. Expected bands: 759 bp and 1782 bp. No positive clones were found.
The next strategy was to digest with BsmBI and SalI, isolate the linearized plasmid from gel , and proceed with a href=""https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2016/7/76/T--Wageningen_UR--Ligation.pdf"">lig"

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#XY Plane_-_-_TEXT.html," from the nozzle to the well A1. Optical sensors and ultrasonic sensors would result in accurate locations, but would increase the cost of TERRA and are harder to integrate to our system.
Control: We decided to use the Arduino Mega to control our XY-plane and syringe pumps, as the addition of Arduino shields allowed for more motors, and therefore syringe pumps, to be connected per microprocessor. Our team also considered the use of a Raspberry Pi, but it would have been harder to integrate into TERRA and it contained more functions than needed for our project.
Manufacturing Method: TERRA is composed of 3D-printed supports, as 3D-printing is more accessible, lower-cost, and allows for quick prototyping. While traditional machining, such as milling and turning, would result in tighter tolerances and more accurate parts, we realized the cost of manufacturing parts in a machine shop were high. In fact, many of these parts only include clearance holes, which will serve its purpose as long as they meet a minimum dimension.
Material: Since our team chose to manufacture our system with 3D-printing, we chose to create our parts with ABS. The typical material for 3D-printing is resin, as it is inexpensive, but resin lacks the resolution needed to create the negative features on certain parts. ABS is stiffer and allows for more accurate parts and is more durable than resin.
Motors: We chose to incorporate stepper motors to the XY-plane as it allowed for a minimum step resolution of 1.8 degrees, which translates to 0.20 mm per step. Stepper motors also allow for microstepping, which allows us to further improve the resolution to 1/16 of a step, or 0.0125 mm.
Design 1
The first iteration of the XY-plane was composed of 3D printed parts and HDPE machined parts. We chose to do so in order to test the accessibility of each manufacturing method. All parts were modeled in Creo Parametric and STL files were generated for 3D-printing using a UPrint SE and ABS stock material. The machined parts were created from HDPE stock and milled using a manual NC mill.
Since the first design was part of the prototyping stage, we had chosen to use open ended timing belts in order to have the freedom of adjusting the design of the XY-plane with the least amount of dimensional constraints. We realized, however, that the timing belts were difficult to maintain the correct amount of tension without a proper tensioner, which would not be possible to integrate to our"

Instead of using CutSmart buffer, Neb buffer was used for PstI and SpeI. PstI should still work in CutSmart buffer even though it would not have maximum activity; however, due to problems with digests and ligations it was decided to try and change the buffer.

OLS_Canmore,2016,Team:OLS Canmore#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," The team split into two groups, with one researching lab assays and the other researching bioreactors to make our very own. We researched about the many different multitudes of bioreactor types, as well as specific parts that all bioreactors have. At the end of the day we came together and decided on a concept for our bioreactor which can be seen below. We decided to design a chemostat model bioreactor, with two media inflow pumps, and a stirring mechanism, with an aeration system through bubbling. ( Figures 1.2-1.3).
With the initial design of our bioreactor complete, when our team attended a Mindfuel lab workshop at the University of  Lethbridge, we worked on our construct and solidified design , including specific parts for the bioreactor prototype so that we could begin the process of ordering and assembly. When this design was finalized we got a talented, artistic classmate and honorary team member to draw out our design that we had settled on, so we could start to visualize it.
Design
After some edits of our initial design, our design of the prototype bioreactor the breaKERs initially went with resembled a bubble column reactor mixed with a continuous stirred reactor as seen in figures 1.2 and 1.3. This design would have required some sort of container with different hatches for effluent media, hair/feathers, media dispensed in two separate IV bags, and air. We designed our bioreactor using 2 IV bags for media inflow, each with a different pH to prevent any back growth of biofilms up the tubes. We decided to use IV bags to allow for gravity to power the inflow of media, to save money and energy of getting another pump. Our design incorporated a air pump with a filter system and a bubble column with a blade attached for the physical degradation of the substance (hair/feathers).
After the Lethbridge mindfuel lab day we decided on an alternate design that would accommodate all the available parts that we had chosen, to be more cost efficient (Figure 1.4) . This new design utilized the concept of a spinner flask as the container with the idea to use bubble walls, used mainly in aquariums to aerate and stir the solution to avoid tangling of the hair/feathers around the blades. This design stayed mostly consistent when we started assembly, except that we purchased glass carboys, rather than the spinner flasks, to stay cost effective.

I. Background
Each year, 700,000 tons of dyes are discharged in printing and dyeing mills, and a large proportion of them were discharged in waste stream without proper treatment. These emissions could cause human diseases or even lead to irreversible damage to the ecosystem (Guang etal., 2013). Our team sets the goal to build a system that could efficiently decompose synthetic dyes.
Azo dyes’ pollution (Guang etal., 2013)
There are three existing ways to decompose synthetic dyes: physicochemical method, photocatalytic method, and microbiological method.
Physicochemical method uses carbon-based sorbents to adsorb synthetic dyes. However, it is energy- consuming to make such substance. Consequently, this method is too expensive for smaller business owners, since lots of carbon sorbents is needed for removal of dyes. Synthetic dyes are usually designed to withstand photodegradation, so the photocatalytic method may require many catalysts and intensive irradiation, which makes the treating process to be very sophisticated. (Alessandra Piscitelli, C. P., Paola Giardina, Vincenza Faraco and Sannia Giovanni., 2010)
Microbiological decomposition is a relatively cheap solution, but in traditional biodegradation method, toxic gas like Hydrogen sulfide may be produced as a byproduct. Nevertheless, the decomposing rate of traditional biodegradation may potentially be lowered by a high flow rate which washes away bacteria floating in sewage. Thus we planed to build a bio-substrate that can be coated with bacteria or functional enzymes. In this case we decided to improve the on-going microbiological method, creating a system that holds all the cells in one piece and could decompose synthetic dyes. (Alessandra Piscitelli, C. P., Paola Giardina, Vincenza Faraco and Sannia Giovanni., 2010)
Focusing on our goal, we soon located the first key component of our system: the biofilm. Biofilm is a layer adhered by microorganisms and enzymes on the surface. It maximumly protect bacteria and enzyme in wide range pH environment, lowering the impact of acidic sewage water to laccase activity, as well as providing a large surface area for contact between laccase and synthetic dye molecules."
Tsinghua-A,2011,Team:Tsinghua-A#Safety#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," it’s not as easy when the amount of signals increases, for that molecules should maintain orthogonality.
In our further research, we try to utilize microfluidical chips, which aim at separating signals and transmitting information through physical isolation, to achieve the independence of biological reactions.
Application
Oscillation can be always seen in biology, so we want to build genetic machines with an oscillation, and hope these machines are able to deal with the biorhythms. In the follow paragraph we talk about the ideas of their applications on medical treatment.
Nowadays a lot of people are suffering from insomnia, a sleeping difficulty sometimes caused by hormonal disorders. Here, we hope to use an oscillator, which can generate a signal follow the cycle of day and night. With an oscillator like this, we can build a system implanted which can cooperate with our body to regulate the hormone secretion to a proper way.
Another interesting example is about medicine taking. When catch a cold, we find it a trouble to take medicines follow the doctor’s prescription such as “taking it every 8 hours and three times a day”, sometimes we even forget it. Suppose the drug is carried in a bio-oscillator. Once we take it in, the drug inside the oscillator will be released every 8 hours automatically in our body. It will be amazing!

This can easily be done by embedding this in the criteria for the gold medal standard. If reproducibility is successful then the team's research is valid and if not, it is open to error, misconduct or fraud.
iGEM is a rich case-study in the aspirations for open-science, competing with real-world challenges of research competition, evolving technologies, and reward structures which prize novelty over sustained efforts at validity and documentation.
Conclusion
iGEM and the Registry of Standard Biological Parts are expanding international knowledge infrastructures that are dedicated to advancing the new discipline of synthetic biology. The approaches are imperfect but, from the perspective of synthetic biology, these are also emergent scientific enterprises that are grappling with the challenges of open science, and the scientific ideals of open data. The iGEM competition is valuable as an educational opportunity for young researchers, but through its affiliation with the Registry, also acts as a catalyst for openness. The competition  helps undergraduates, future scholars, develop skills in communication, collaboration, data management and use.  Through these facets, transparency and cooperation are encouraged in research. While not executed perfectly, they are at the core of the competition and repository, developing synthetic biology as a discipline.

Intestinal Diseases
The intestines, which are responsible for digestion and absorption, are a crucial part of the gastrointestinal tract in the human body. There are many diseases affecting our gastrointestinal system, which jeopardize our health.
Inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are an inflammatory condition affecting the bowel linings. Crohn's disease affects about 3.2 per 1,000 people in Europe and North America. Unfortunately, mechanisms of IBD remain a riddle, and scientists spare no effort to seek effective therapies.
We conducted a survey regarding inflammatory bowel disease awareness and found out that a lot of us are suffering from these diseases. People in China are still not paying enough attention to intestinal diseases. Our team iGEM2016 ShanghaiTechChina_B is striving to change this situation. We chose IBD as an entry point and designed a complete set of therapeutic methods to treat it by utilizing our engineered E.coli. Actually we are hoping to build a platform that may also be applied to other intestinal diseases in the future.
We hope that our work can help more patients who are suffering from intestinal diseases, and raise the attention of public. This is the fundamental principle of our human practice.
There are currently four methods to treat IBD: surgery, chemical drugs, immunosuppression, fecal microbiota transplant. It is unfortunate that all of these treatments have limited effects on IBD.
Surgery
Ulcerative colitis can in most cases be cured by proctocolectomy, although this may not eliminate extra-intestinal symptoms.
Surgery cannot cure Crohn's disease but may be needed to treat complications such as abscesses, strictures or fistulae. Crohn's disease can recur in the healthy parts of the intestine, usually at the resection site.
Chemical Drugs

It employs two component systems called oligopeptide auto-inducers,                                 instead of AHL molecules (luxI from Vibrio fischeri produces AHL with a distinct                                 side chain that can’t be found in Gram positive bacteria)6.
Thus, we may try to express pluxR promoter along with luxI synthases within the gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis and test whether there is a reduction in promoter leakiness in such chassis.
Suggestion for more specific recombination
While Cre-loxP system allows                                     the study of spatial and temporal gene expression, CRISPR/Cas9 can target specific site                                     to mediate gene editing. According paper published in 2017,  CRISPR/Cas9 was shown to be able to work with loxP for the first time. This has an application on site-specific genome editing in human cells where using loxP mutant that contains sgRNA could allow a selective gene excision. 7
Nevertheless, future improvements need to be made. Fayu Yang and his research team suggested that loxP66 and loxP71 mutants (which we also employed in this iGEM project) may be more suitable for CRISPR/Cas9-loxP design because they contain PAM sequences which sgRNA can recognize.
Thus, this system may enhance effectiveness in knockout performance inside bacterial cells if two or more external genes are to be inserted and knocked out at the same time. Knocking out long sequences of target gene such as sensing and time-delay module may be done more easily especially when Cre recombinase fails to recognize lox site. Due to time limits, we could not explore more in details so we consider this method as our future suggestions and possible improvement for our project

Gram-negative bacteria have two cell membranes. The LPS are embedded in the outer membrane and are composed of a lipid and an O polysaccharide.
Characteristic parts of the lipopolysaccharide structure (LPS) of P. aeruginosa can be bound by galectin-3. Specifically, the O polysaccharide (see figure on the left) of the LPS is recognized by galectin-3. Therefore, this specific binding of galectin-3 enables the construction of a fluorescent based detection system.  A fusion protein of galectin-3 and a reporter protein, such as a fluorescent protein, can be built and applied in the detection of P. aeruginosa.
In our approach, a galectin-3-YFP fusion protein is built and expressed in E. coli, including a his-tag and a snap-tag for purification. The fusion protein can then be incorporated into a cell-free biosensor system. These biosensors have many advantages over systems that use living cells such as an uncomplicated storage. Furthermore, from a biosafety and social acceptance point of view, it is advantageous if the sensor system does not contain alive genetically modified organisms.
'
To detect P. aeruginosa cells, an agar chip could be used to sample a solid surface. However, other materials but agar can be considered to collect pathogens. The cells stick to the sampling chip which is then immersed in a detection buffer containing the galectin-3-YFP fusion protein. Excess protein is removed during washing in a suitable buffer. The galectin-3 remains bound to the pathogen and illumination with 514 nm, the excitation wavelength of YFP, in a modified version of our measurement device reveals the location of the cells. The picture taken by the measurement device can then be analyzed by our software Measurarty.
Achievements
Due to the generous support of Sophia Böcker and Prof. Dr. Elling of the Helmholtz Institute for Biomedical Engineering in Aachen, we got access to a pET17-derived expression plasmid for a His- and SNAP-tagged YFP-galectin-3 fusion protein. We transformed the fusion protein into E. coli Rosetta cells and conducted a batch fermentation to obtain large amounts of protein.
With the help of David Schönauer and Alan Mertens from the RWTH Aachen Institute of Biotechnolgy we then purified the fusion protein using FPLC. Subsequently, we aimed to test the binding of"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,": Graph Indicating the Most Frequent Spacer Between -35 and -10 Regions Found in E. coli Promoters. This image was taken from Harley and Reynolds (1987).
Design Stage
As seen in Figure 3(B), the regions known to be important for a reliable promoter expression (-35 and -10 regions) were changed to variant of the wildtype but kept constant between the three distinctive designs. These regions were discovered to be the most frequent occurring -35 and -10 regions in native E. coli promoters by Harley and Roberts in 1987. The sequences between such converged regions were kept constant as per the wildtype for designs 2 (P2) and 3 (P3). For design 1 (P1) however, they were randomized in order to test its effect. The decision to reduce the number of base pairs from 18, found in PLac, to 17 was made due to the results of the study by Harley and Roberts in 1987, listing this number to be the most frequent occurring number of base pairs gap found in regions in native E. coli promoters.
Design 1 (P1) was made by randomizing all elements of the promoter while only keeping the -35 and -10 regions constant. The upstream element (US element) of P2 were randomized while keeping the downstream element (DS element) conserved as per wildtype. The DS element of P3 however, was randomized while keeping the upstream element conserved. This systematic approach of randomization was chosen as it allows for the most variation between promote designs allowing for a rich synthetic promoter library.
Figure 3: Image Detailing Promoter Designs.
In order to implement these synthetic promoter detector variants into the Sensynova platform, designs were made by replacing the IPTG detection module of our framework with the promoter library.
Figure 4: SBOL Visual Detailing Detector Promoter Variants
Implementation
The promoter designs were sent off for synthesis by IDT as single stranded oligos.
Using Q5 PCR , the three designs P1, P2, and P3 were converted into double stranded DNA. Once PCR purified, samples were restrict digested using EcoRI and SpeI. Digests were subject to gel electrophoresis .
The plasmid backbone, BBa_J61002, was digested using EcoRI and XbaI and purified following gel electrophoresis .
Promoter designs were assembled into BBa_J61002 using BioBrick cloning. Ligations were transformed into E. coli DH5α cells and grown overnight .

Identify, investigate & address issues relating to ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual    property rights (Human Practices) in the context of the project:
This year Cork iGEM identified intellectual property rights as an issue. We interviewed Cathal Garvey to    investigate the issue and see his views on the issue.
Issues relating to the safety of the system for use as a diagnostic were identified. As with all diagnostics, this system must be    optimised, standardised and deemed as good as or better than current procedures. The use of live cells in a diagnostic system is a    unique feature which may lead to unforeseen complications such as unsuitable growth conditions in some settings or the impact of    contaminating growth on results. To address this, we investigated suitable controls and validates our results by having outside    labs (TCD & UCL) carry out our tests. We also sought the advice of experienced Biomedical Scientist, Dr. Brigid Lucey on the issue.
Another aspect of our human practices work was that done by team member Donnchadh in Malawi. The issue of sustainability of our detector    in a real life lab setting was investigated by Donnchadh as he visited hospital labs in Malawi where the detector may theoretically be used.    He surveyed staff members on the equipment and reagents they had and whether they believed such a detector was a viable and sustainable tool.    We considered this in the design of our prototype and what to include in kits sent to TCD & UCL labs.
While in Malawi, Donnchadh evaluated resources in the lab and what diagnostics tests are available to patients of that hospital.    Speaking to Dr.Bridget Lucey, a Biomedical Scientist in Ireland and the Biomedical Scientists working in Malawi- the issue of social justice was very clear regarding the standard of diagnostic tests available. With Basehunter, we can help bridge the gap between the inadequate resources and tests available in Malawi and those available in Ireland. This innovative Basehunter technology will make first world standard health care diagnostics available to all. Our project aims to bring first class molecular    diagnostics to areas where it currently is not by providing an alternative to expensive equipment such as PCR machines. With this in mind,    we designed our kits to be low cost,"

NUS_Singapore,2016,Team:NUS Singapore#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the bacteria in tumour environment. Detailed working mechanism of RIOT sensors can be found at the Introduction page. When being integrated into the whole system, RIOT sensors are expected to increase the successful rate of detection of cancer cells or delivery of biomolecules that kill cancer cells while leaving normal cells unharmed.
We transformed E. coli Nissle ∆alr, a D-alanine auxotrophic mutant bacteria (Hwang et al, 2016) with RIOT sensors 1 – 9. This is an engineered probiotic microbe which aims to eliminate and prevent pathogen infection in the mammalian gut. RIOT sensors, which express ALR in the presence of L-lactate, will be able to rescue the transformed bacteria grown in media without D-alanine supplement. Therefore, the performance of RIOT sensors were assessed by the growth rate of transformed bacteria over a range of lactate concentration in M9 minimal media via natural logarithm (LN) of OD600. We used linear regression analysis to fit the data of bacterial growth rate using four data points of LN (OD600) values from 90 to 180 min of each sensor. This is because the growth rate of each constructs appeared to deviate from each other at the 90-minute time point (Figure 3) . We postulated that induction of ALR by lactate might take about 90 minutes for these sensors. The slope of each fitted linear line represents the growth rate of bacteria (P-value < 0.01).
Since naturally occurring amino acids have an L-configuration in mammals and D-alanine was also shown to be absent from human plasma protein (Hoeprich, 1965; Nagata, Masui & Akino, 1992), bacteria transformed with a well-controlled sensor will not be able to grow in the absence of both D-alanine and lactate. The results shown in Figure 2 suggested that RIOT sensors 1 – 6 with strong and medium RBS exhibited high leakiness. The transformed bacteria were able to survive after 6 hours even without addition of lactate. Moreover, Table 1 showed that transformed bacteria with sensors 1 and 2, regardless of lactate concentration appeared to have similar initial growth rate compared to those were grown in the media containing D-alanine supplement (0.008 – 0.009 min-1, P-value < 0.01). This is probably because the amount of ALR expressed at the lowest lactate concentration is still sufficient to convert enough L-alanine into D-alanine, which help the bacteria to maintain their normal growth"

Marburg Team
This year our iGEM team had the opportunity to form a trans-Atlantic collaboration with a team based in Marburg, Germany.  We sought to determine the evolutionary trajectory of killswitches, with the Marburg team. Throughout this collaboration, the Marburg team assisted in modelling the behaviour and evolution of a previously described MazF killswitch. The Lethbridge team was able to devise a novel protocol for analyzing and accelerating the evolution of killswitches utilizing ultraviolet light. Our group also had killswitch parts synthesized by the Marburg group and improved upon them. This was a valuable collaborative opportunity which we hope to translate into a manuscript related to biocontainment and biosecurity trajectories over time. Our collaboration will be an ongoing one, with the aim of fully characterizing killswitches from a molecular standpoint as well as a computational modeling perspective.
Experimental Protocol
500,000 microjoules of UV light was used to irradiate 200 microlitres of E. coli cells (OD600=0.1) containing an inducible plasmid expressing MazF. Cells were then plated on LB+agar plates containing antibiotic and inducer and grown for 16 hours at 37 degrees Celsius. The number of CFUs obtained after UV irradiation was compared to prior to irradiation and an escape frequency was obtained using this method. Clones which escape the killswitch will be sequenced to examine possible mutations allowing for their escape. Optimization of the amount of UV delivered as well as replication of these experiments are required, however it is a valuable step forward in assessing the evolution of killswitches.
