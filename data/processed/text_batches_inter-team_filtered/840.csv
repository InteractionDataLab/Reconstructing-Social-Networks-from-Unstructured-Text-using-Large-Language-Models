Project Overview
Team ITB_Indonesia tries to create a new method to degrade plastic using synthetic biology approach. We create a novel device which is a synthetic bacteria that able to degrade PET and consume ethylene glycol as the byproduct of degradation reaction. We also establish ompA protein fused with LC Cutinase in E.coli BL21(DE3) thus exposing the enzymes on the surface membrane of bacteria. This condition make the degradation process easily because PET, a high molecular substrate, doesn't need to pass through bacteria cell membrane. We also construct a cassette comprised of two enzyme, glycoaldehyde reductase and glycoaldehyde dehydrogenase which responsible in metabolising ethylene glycol. We use constitutive promoter for both construct, thus making it necessary to create a modul of reporter and self regulatory in order to maintain system efficiency and minimizing severe cytoplasmic stress, in this case, formation of inclusion body aggregate due to strong constitutive expression.

Meetings with institutional actors and experts in various fields
We also present the solution aether to a number of actors in the fight against pollution. We made them discover our solution based on synthetic biology and we benefited from their feedback to improve the design and scenario of our device. Thanks to these meetings, we truely improved our knowledge of the air pollution fight ecosystem.
The international conference on Atmospheric Sciences and Application to Air Quality (ASAAQ)
This conference was initiated in Seoul in 1985. Since then, ASAAQ has been held in Tokyo, Shanghai, Seoul, Seattle, Beijing, Taipei, Tsukuba, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Jinan, Seoul and Kobe. The ASAAQ Conference covers broad topics on atmospheric sciences from the observation, analysis, to the simulation of air quality on all scales (from urban to global), including emissions, transport, diffusion, chemistry, removal processes, impacts, and air quality management.
ASAAQ 14 took place in Strasbourg, France from the 29th to the 31st of May 2017, and fostered scientific discussions and exchange of information on the latest research and practical applications of atmospheric science and air quality issues. Three of our members attended the ASAAQ conference and presented the aether project to air pollution experts from around the world. After the conference, we were able to talk to researchers. Those conversations allowed us to confirm the relevance of targeting PAHs.
Breath Foundation
The Breath Foundation aims to bring together all the actors involved at a national level in the fight against respiratory diseases. Its main mission is to encourage and support the development of research projects in the fight against respiratory diseases and their causes, thanks to funding from patrons and public generosity. We met the president of the foundation on July 5th. This meeting allowed us to receive expertise on pollutants and respiratory diseases they cause. We also confirmed the relevance of our targets, and our choice to focus on indoor pollution. Finally, we obtained useful feedback on the overall project.
Skype meeting with Mr. Rémi Pampin, electrical engineer
This meeting allowed us to make a lot of progress on the design of our device. Indeed, we were looking for a technical means to achieve our goals of designing an affordable, simple device, modeled on a kit ""Do it yourself"". In addition to recommending us to learn about printed electronics, Mr. Pampin has given us valuable advice about the electronic design of our circuit.

Waterloo,2016,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices#OpenScience_-_-_TEXT.html,"ser, & Lindsey, 2012; Shetty, Endy, & Jr, 2008). The approach of synthetic biologists typically proceeds by inserting and synthesizing new DNA into a cell to encode a protein with a novel function. The complexities of engineering new molecules with unique functions raise a variety of issues both from biological and engineering standpoints. The storage and dissemination of the data behind these synthetic approaches parts has, as each discipline does, its own challenges and motivations behind the development of open science.
As an example of open-data developments, there is a  nascent data repository in synthetic biology called the Registry of Standard Biological Parts (""Registry"") that was initially developed by researchers at M.I.T. and others to store the elements that make up complex systems in synthetic biology (Baker et al., 2006). The initial step of the creation of a data repository is significant in the development of an open science (Borgman, 2015). Submissions to this repository initiate the expectation of standardization for data which, with the concerns iof reproducibility in science, will motivate sound scientific practices.
Synthetic biology is founded on the conceptual framework of distinct biological parts which are “bricks” that can be assembled into functioning biological systems.  As a discipline, the ultimate goal is the assembly of these biological parts into complex, engineered systems (Purnick & Weiss, 2009). This standardization of individual blocks provides engineers with reliable blocks with standard function so that they can fabricate these systems without the concern of having malfunctioning “bricks”. It has been proposed that these bricks should undergo systematic testing, like other non-biological engineered systems (Canton, Labno, & Endy, 2008). Testing would validate individual “bricks” and their attributes, and allow engineers to reliably predict function of larger, composite, system. These assembled items (or “BioBricks”) are beginning to be accumulated into the previously mentioned Registry library (Shetty et al., 2008).
iGEM Case Study
Oldham’s indication of the increasing size of the discipline of synthetic biology indicates the importance of instilling good research practices and capabilities, of openness and collaboration. This is especially helpful to young researchers as they become the researchers of the future. This “nurturing role” is evident in the Registry which provides a basis for an annual competition called the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM).  This competition invites undergraduates from around the world to build and develop these systems from the standard biological parts as well as contribute to the growing database of parts. The official i"
BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," These hardware components are designed to integrate seamlessly with Neptune’s Software.
Because Neptune is inherently modular to change with synthetic biologists needs, Neptune’s electronic control circuitry must be equally as modular to ensure the user is not overpaying for extraneous hardware nor is unable to safely control their setup. The electronic system is comprised of power inputs, stackable Arduino motor controller shields, an Arduino Mega, and varies headers and capacitors to make the system respond appropriately. The power is delivered through 5v 10W laptop power supplies which are readily available, safe, and deliver enough power to control up to 16 servos at once. The stackable controllers can each control 16 servos per board, and therefore users do not have to order a more expensive system that can control 200 servos if they only need 10 to get started.
A piston rod setup for syringes and servos used to control valves and dispensers on the chip was selected to prioritize low cost, ease of use, and modularity.  In order to accurately control Neptune’s hardware, the mechanical motion of the servo and syringe paring must be completely defined. Therefore, the equation for off-center piston-rod motion was derived. This involved geometric modeling and trigonometry to translate the rotational motion of a servo arm to linear syringe pump motion. After the equation for off-center and on-axis piston rod motion was verified and tested, the response was modeled with a range of values for each parameter. The ideal parameters for a smooth and most linear response were selected, as well as limits imposed to ensure Neptune always delivers smooth syringe motion.
An inherent characteristic of the piston rod mechanical system is a non-linear response from the syringe pump being controlled. Based on where the servo arm is in its circular path of motion, the syringe pump will move different amounts with the same change in theta of the servo arm. Furthermore, the equation derived to map this motion is not invertible, preventing a simple equation to obtain change in linear motion with a change in theta of the servo arm. This problem was overcome by developing an algorithm to ensure a constant flow rate is always achieved with Neptune given the specific values of the active servo and syringe, involving two lookup tables and linear extrapolation.
Neptune’s baseboard must retain system expandability to arbitrary dimensions and maintain ease of use by providing places to auto-align components. This is done by creating modular squares that can be milled out one at a time and connected together. The 1/8” diameter holes are arranged in a grid, spaced 0.3” from one another and "

H2 E.coli: System
Here we introduce the details of the system we thought.
mixed acid fermentation
As we stated in the background page, our H2 E. coli project aims to produce hydrogen from garbage efficiently using Escherichia coli. E. coli naturally produce hydrogen through a process called mixed acid fermentation. We thought we would be able to increase H2 production of E. coli by enhancing a specific pathway of mixed acid fermentation.
Here is an overview of the mixed acid fermentation pathway of E.coli.
First, Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is produced from glucose by glycolysis, which is in turn transformed into pyruvate or into oxaloacetate. These two molecules are then transformed into several products after a chain of reactions, including hydrogen. ( produced from formate in order to regulate the intracellular pH of E.coli.) [7] So, we expected to be able to increase hydrogen production by overexpressing specific genes of the mixed acid fermentation pathway, that are involved in enhancing H2 production. [2]
Here are the three main reactions which lead to hydrogen production.
1:The conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate
Phosphoenolpyruvate + ADP + 2H+ ↔ Pyruvate + ATP
2:The conversion of pyruvate into formate
Pyruvate + Coenzyme A ↔ Formate + Acetyl-CoA
3:The break-down of formate producing hydrogen
Formate + H+ ↔ CO2 + H2
After we examined a lot of published research, we concluded that the most important reaction of these three reactions in order to increase H2 production is the transformation of formate into hydrogen.

ALPHA was created in August 21, 2009. It consists of three robot arms. Each arm consist of two arm segments as shown in the picture. One arm segment is referred as the control arm and is connected to the motor which controls entirely the joint. The other arm segment, referred as a linkage is loosely attached and moves in a sphere. The end of this attaches to the platform which holds the four pipette tips.

Total carotenoids (in µg/g[dw]) = (A449 x mL hexane) / (0.2702 x g [dw])
Here the dry weight is 0.8g and the volume of hexane used to extract the vitamin is 2mL. There is a peak of absorbance reaching 1.2 at 449nm.
The total carotenoid content is then (1.2*2)/(0.2702*0.8) = 11ug/g of dry weight.
Further improvements
An optimized polycistron
The current strain is not producing enough ß-carotene and to meet to daily requirement we would have to add more yeasts in the batter and this could have effects on the taste and texture of idli. This is why we aimed to strongly increase the ß-carotene yield of those yeast.
For this purpose, we designed a construct very similar to theirs, except that we moved the crtE gene to the first place of the polycistron, in order to increase the carotenoid yield. Indeed, it has been shown that the efficiency of translation decreases after every 2A sequence (de Felipe et al. 2006), and that an increase of CrtE may improve the ß-carotene production (Verwaal et al. 2007). We kept the same 2A sequences between the cistrons, as well as the same terminator TEF1. In order to synthesize the whole construct though, we had to change the TDH3 promoter: like most yeast promoters it has a very low GC content, which makes it very difficult to synthesize. So we used the ADH1 promoter instead, which is another strong promoter for yeast.
We also codon-optimized the three genes for S. cerevisiae, using the IDT codon-optimization tool, in order to increase the genes expression. The study from Li et al. (2013) had shown that the optimization of 5 codons in the sequence of crtI, and 8 codons in the sequence of crtYB had increased the ß-carotene production in S. cerevisiae by 200%, so we had high hopes that codon-optimizing the whole genes would lead to an even better yield.
The whole construct we designed was synthesized by IDT in 5 gBlocks.

Additionally, we codon-optimized for S. cerevisiae the HMG-CoA reductase gene from"

Q2. No matter how hard we try to keep biosafety, there remains a probability that researchers themselves might abuse the technology. How can we prevent that? (Riku)
A2. The most important thing is to not provide  funding or facility to those people. For example, the researcher who has dubious funding sources or who ordered dangerous series of reagents might be surveyed. Also, the achievements and status as a researcher will be checked if they ordered synthesis of genes. In the U.S, when they have debts or criminal records, their applications will be rejected.
 
The lecture of an expert in biosafety taught us many things we have to pay attention to as a scientist. When we thought about the comment for the first question “it is necessary to find out whether the problem comes from the bacteria or the substances”, we came to the answer that the problem came from the bacteria we use. After this lecture, we gave close attention to the waste liquid treatment. When the waste included E. coli, we made sure it was thrown in the Biohazard waste bag. All the experiments were carried out with more than one person, so that we can check each other’s mistakes.
From this approach , we were able to learn about the points scientists need to be aware of. We can say that this feedback gave many good effects for us.

Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," along with our work we will be sure to keep assessing the risks involved with our biobricks and synthetic biology in general to make sure that our work is as safe as possible!
Biosafety
The chassiss we are using are E.coli BL21 gold strain which are in risk group 1, Our lab has a bio-safety rating of 2. Therefore it is ok to work with this strain in our lab. When handling bacteria sterile techniques were used and anything that comes into contact with the bacteria is autoclave sterilized.
Lab Safety
For safety in the Labs we have undergone compulsory health and safety training run by the Faulty of Biological Sciences. We will also be following UK Health and safety legislation in our work. For every new Chemical or reagent used we will follow the risk assessments put in place, and the COSHH assessments. When handeling bacterial cultures we will use sterile techniques and employ the use of PPE to prevent contamination.
Ethics
Ethics is a big consideration when doing biology, especially synthetic biology as we are making new systems and engineering bacteria to have new and desired properties.  A primary concern is the accidental release of these redesigned organisms. Current policies are alreadt prepared to deal with this situation if it were to occur.  An even more daunting possibility is the fact that terrorist organizations could use engineered microorganisms to harm others. This is a new concern called Bioterrorism and it is fast becoming a growing concern. Bioterrorism is defined as terrorism involving the international release or dissemination of biological agents.   Questions are also raised over the unpredictable nature of these pathogens. Biosecurity measures within the field of synthetic biology must be finalized to reduce the sense of fear that accompanies its advances.  Even if no immediate danger exists, ethical issues remain as synthetic biology can be deemed as ""playing God"". Redesigning organisms opens the possibility for redesigning humans To gain an insite into what the public think of synthetic biology we sent out an initial survey about what synthetic biology is. One of the questions on this survey included ""do you think synthetic biology is unethical?"" Surprisingly all but one answered this question ""no"". We then asked them to expand further; here are some of the responses:
""[...]if the end justifies the means. But it would be unethical if there was animal testing involved.""
""Knowledge is basically neutral, but I can see situations where it can be misused, so ethics should never be ignored.""
To further address ethics we have also included an ethics video in our series of synthetic biology videos for young people at school/in sixth form. To do this"

Background
The Cancer Stem Cell Theory
Many tumours contain a sub-population of self-renewing and expanding stem cells known as cancer stem cells whose symmetric division result in tumour growth. These cancer stem cells can be identified using molecular determinants or markers which have properties such as self-renewal, clonogenicity, multipotentiality, and longevity. Recent studies have increasingly implied the importance of Aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme as a marker for cancer stem cells owing to their ability to detoxify potential cytotoxins, thus making them resistant to chemotherapy.
Our Project
Our iGEM project taps into the cancer stem cell theory. We have set out to synthesise a genetic construct that can identify, isolate and destroy cancer stem cells. Three different genetic constructs which serve different purposes are to be synthesised. A number of isoforms of ALDH exist, and three of the most common occurring form in cancer will be isolated. The isoforms selected are ALDH1A1, ALDH1A3 and ALDH3A1. These isoforms show increased activity in recurrent forms of cancer. We have also identified ALDH2, which will be used as the control isoform, as this form is involved in ethanol metabolism and it will be easily induced by the addition of ethanol.
The second part of our project was to create constructs to selectively isolate cancer stem cells in a range of cancer cell lines. This will provide a powerful tool for researchers in the field of cancer Biology.
Assembly System
We have opted to  use the Plug and Play system of assembly created by DTU-Denmark for the 2011 iGEM competition. In addition, we have designed our final constructs to conform to biobrick standard parts. We feel that this could offer an opportunity to incorporate Plug-n-Play to the Biobrick system.
Due to the scarcity of available mammalian in the registry, we had to source parts from outside the parts registry. We were fortunate to obtain parts from DTU-Denmark which they had made in 2011. These parts were not available in the Parts Registry. We also contacted Serrano labs and were fortunate to receive some mammalian biobrick parts from them.

Today I did minipreps of all the biobricks I cultures yesterday. then again I continued with the assembly by digesting all the parts with the SpeI available in our lab. I am not very confident of it since the expiry date shows somewhere in 2008. So I thought let me continue the work properly after discussing with supervisors on friday because Daniel's backup plan biobricks are working very well.

Part of their work is encouraging discussions about the development of synthetic biology from a policymaker’s perspective, which includes a collaboration with all Dutch iGEM teams since 2014.
In short, we learned a lot from collaborating both with the RIVM and the Rathenau institute/Synenergene. The RIVM and Synenergene assignments helped us to think more in depth about different safety aspects, how safety by design can be achieved and our own opinions about it. We gained a new perspective on how biocontainment is perceived.
Events
Throughout the year we have visited a lot of conferences with several goals: to inform different stakeholders about our project, to collect input on the BeeT system through different stages of the project, to network with companies and explore sponsor possibilities, and to have fun and learn some things ourselves.
March: multi-stakeholder dialogue
""The role of synthetic biology in energy transition""
Discussion about the current Dutch energy supply and the potential role of synthetic biology. We created “the green human” futuristic scenario where humans would evolve together with plants to be able to rely on photosynthesis for energy. In our opinion it exposes a very important aspect of both energy transition and synthetic biology: that the public should be involved, to be more conscious about energy use and more engaged with technological advances in the field of synthetic biology.
April: NBV and BioSB
Annual conferences of the Nederlandse Biotechnologie Vereniging (NBV) or Dutch Biotechnology Association and the Bioinformatics and systems biology research school. Our goal: collect input, talk to potential sponsors and have fun.
April: DAE Meetings
As mentioned in the collaboration section, we designed our project with the help of students from the Design Academy Eindhoven.  We met with them twice : The first time, we visited them and took part in a design workshop.  The second meeting was a lab day for them to see what our everyday life in the lab looks like.
May: National Meetup
We organized the meet-up of all interested Dutch iGEM teams. Four teams took part: Groningen, Leiden, Eindhoven, and us.
June: Synenergene forum
The Rathenau institute organised a conference , for relevant stakeholders regarding the future of synthetic biology, to explore the right conditions for responsible research and innovation.

2.3 Solving
Once the user is satisified with the pathway, it can be solved by clicking to the ""Solve"" button on the bottom left of the screen. PolyEnzyme will integrate the equations defining the system with a 2n order Runge Kutta algorithm. The size of the differential, maximum time and resolution of the solution can be specified in the settings panel (see section 4). Depending on the setings and complexity of the pathway, computing the solution may take a few minutes. Once solved, the results will be displayed on a graphic showing the time evolution of the concentration for all nodes.
2.4 Real-time Solving
At the bottom left of the screen there is a horitzontal slider. Modifying its value will trigger a continuous update of the nodes in the canvas. This may be useful to visualize how the system behaves in a more intuitive way. The slider value modifies the velocity at which the solution subrutine is trigered. Not that the maximum velocity may depend on the system specifications of the user.

Clicking the save button on the left side panel triggers a prompt asking for the schematic name. The system is saved in json format in /saved, where PolyEnzyme.exe is located. Clicking the load button down below opens a prompt that allows the user to select all existing saved pathways in the /saved folder, and a selections of different pathways located in the repository.
3.2 Erasing mode
By clicking the button with the same name on the left side panel the user enters in delete mode. In this mode, reactions and nodes can be removed by clicking on them. Note that deleting a node will erase all its associated reactions.
3.3 Erasing everything
Clicking the button by the same name in the left side panel will remove all nodes and reactions, yielding a blank canvas to work with.

--CS-- Today I ran the colony PCR of the transformed bacteria that Julie had grown up last week. The gel of my PCR products looked like this:
The image on the left has 7 norB colonies with a negative control (no insert) and the image on the right has 7 nosZ colonies with a negative control. Bet you can’t tell which lane is the negative control! So it appears that this round of cloning didn’t work either. I went through the whole procedure with Julie and we were unable to figure it all out, so we think it might be a primer problem but we really have no idea.
June 19, 2014
--CS-- So things haven’t been working well for norB and nosZ. For some reason I constantly get gels that look like this:
The norB lane (the middle lane) seems to be blurry the majority of the time, and the nosZ lane (the right lane) seems to always have 3 bands in it. This makes it seem that the primers I have for these two genes are screwy, so I looked at my primer sequences again. Both of the primers have the correct sequences and have 24-25 bp of the gene start/finish in addition to the correct restriction digest sites and the extra 3 bp that help the restriction enzymes bind. I blasted the P. aeruginosa PAO1 genome with the primer sequences and found that there are actually quite a lot of sites in the genome that match the sequences. Besides the appropriate sites of the genes that the primers were designed for, these matches are much weaker though, having no more than 15 aligning nucleotides for the most part. I tried to look for some pairs of sites that would result in the extra bands found in the nosZ lanes, but I couldn’t identify anything obvious that would work for that. So I am unsure as to why norB always smears and nosZ always has 3 bands and why neither of them works. I can amplify both of them from the P. aeruginosa genome but somewhere after that things don’t work.

I don’t know how it happened but somehow the beginning of each of the gene sequences in the primers got switched around; the following shows what the primers are and what they should be:

The meeting had three parts. Firstly, we introduced our project to the                         COFCO. Then, they asked us some questions about the project. After that, we asked them about                         the market of current antioxidant products. Through communication, we learned that the sales of                         anti-oxidant products are on the rise, and more and more people are pursuing anti-oxidant and                         anti-aging products. Therefore, we have more reasons to believe that our project has a good                         application prospect in the market. We would do our best to make the project more reasonable                         and more beneficial to the world.
Wehand-bio
In order to figure out what we can do by our system, we visited Wehand-bio, a leading                         innovative pharmaceutical company in Beijing. During the meeting, we gave a brief introduction                         of our design to show the idea of our living antioxidant detection device, and they talked                         about their current research. After the discussion, we found that there is another application                         of antioxidants which is used in medicines. As they told us, almost all of the medicines would use antioxidants to prevent oxidation of medicines. So our system could also be applied in                         pharmaceutical production. What’s more, they offered us a good idea about testing whether the                         natural antioxidant products will deteriorate in quality over time. As you can see, this                         discussion had let us take a deeper look at how to use our system more widely.

Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse the heparin chromatography of the dxCas9 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 12% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol.The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:
Figure Heparin Chromatography. 12% SDS PAGE of dxCas9 (expected size 158.3kDa). Lane 1 molecular ladder (kDa), lane 2 starting material, lane 3 flow through, lane 4 wash, lane 5 elution 1, lane 6 elution 2, lane 7 elution 3, lane 8 elution 4, lane 9 elution 5, lane 10 elution 6, lane 11 elution 7, lane 12 elution 8, lane 13 elution 9, lane 14 elution 10, lane 15 elution 11.
The heparin chromatography was successful. The protein recoveries were high, with no losses in the flowthrough and wash (lane 3-4). The first 4 elution fractions (lane 5-8) contained some low molecular weight contaminating proteins, as a result only elution fraction 5 to 10 (lane 9 to 14) were pooled. Again the double band for dxCas9 was observed on the 12% SDS PAGE, which we have seen with all purification.

1 Modeling Goal
2 Our Approach
3 Progress
4 Preliminary Analysis
Modeling Goal
Currently, the modelling team is considering issues that would be relevant to any industrial application of UW's 2008 project. Specifically, we are interested in determining the amount of time for which the genome of a cell should be exposed to the endonuclease to ensure, with a given percentage certainty, that the bacterial population is destroyed. In addition, we would like to know the relationship between this amount of time and the strength of the promoter used for the endonuclease.
Our Approach
To achieve our goal, a computer simulation of the activity of the endonuclease molecules inside a virtual cell will be used. In this simulation, endonuclease molecules will be generated randomly at a rate determined from empirical data, and their movement will be given by three-dimensional Brownian motion.  A region of space within the virtual cell will be designated as the genome, with cut sites at the appropriate locations. The computer will register ""cuts"" to the genome whenever one of the endonucleases comes into contact with a cut site. After a predetermined number of ""cuts"" have occurred, the genome will be classified as degraded (we are assuming that after this many cuts have taken place, the genome is certain to be destroyed).
The rate of endonuclease production in our simulation will rely on empirical data provided by the lab team. The lab team will obtain a measure of the rate of cutting of the endonuclease, by measuring the number of test-plasmids (each containing a cut site) that remain after being exposed to the endonuclease for various amounts of time. We will then adjust the endonuclease production parameter in our model, until our simulation produces comparable results to the empirical data under corresponding conditions. In this way we hope to calibrate our model to a reasonable approximation of reality.
Progress
To produce our simulation, we edited a pre-existing open-source simulation project called Cell++ . Cell++ was designed to simulate metabolic and intra-cellular signalling pathways. We used the signalling simulation capabilities, with a few modifications, to simulate the interaction of the endonuclease with the genome's cut sites as described above.
Various parameters in the program can be easily specified, such as the rate of production of end"
ATOMS-Turkiye,2014,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Testing_-_-_TEXT.html," tumbling and smooth swimming, which is known as random walk. When bacteria perform chemotactic behaviour towards a concentration gradient(not pictured), the probability of the bacteria performing smooth swimming increases after a transient decrease due to saturation of chemoreceptors. This video has been taken as a set of frames, with one frame per four seconds. Imaging done by Imperial iGEM 2011.
During bacterial movement up a concentration gradient of attractant, the probability of the smooth swimming is higher than that of tumbling. Smooth swimming is a fast, uni-directional movement, whereas tumbling is random and although the speed may not be slow, overall velocity is far less than that of smooth swimming. Due to the complicated assay set up with a concentration gradient, we changed strategy to look for uniformity of the bacterial movement. We expected the cells, which are capable of malate recognition to show much more uniform response than those that do not. The bacteria were grown to mid-exponential phase (OD600 0.4-0.6) before being induced in motility buffer 2 hours prior to observation. Bacteria containing construct PA2652 ( BBa_K515102 ) have been exposed to motility buffer (reference), 10 mM serine (positive control) & 10 mM malate (test). E. coli DH5α without any construct have been exposed to 10 mM malate (negative control). Observations were taken with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 Inverted Fluorescent Microscope and video collection Volocity software. ImageJ plug-in Manual Tracking was used to collect data and Chemotaxis Tool plug-in to analyze the data.
Figure 1: Probability density function of bacterial number at observed velocities. PA2652 cells exposed to 10 mM malate are more than 90% likely to be moving at just over 2 μm/s. PA2652 cells that were exposed to serine were 90% likely to be moving at a velocity just over 2 μm/s. PA2652 cells that were not exposed to attractant were over 70% likely to be moving at 2 μm/s. Cells without BBa_K515102 construct were less than 50% likely to be moving at a velocity between 2 and 4 μm/s. Data depicts difference in response between PA2652 cells, which were and which were not exposed to an attractant. Also cells without construct show lack of uniform response when exposed to 10 mM malate. Data collected by Imperial iGEM 2011.
From the data analysis it seems that the bacteria with construct"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," assume that the proliferation of erythroblasts is constant ( Lichtman et al. 2005 ).
The cells stay in the erythroblasts stage for 5 days until they stop dividing, extrude their nuclei and mitochondria, and become marrow reticulocytes. Marrow reticulocytes no longer proliferate and their mortality rate is inversely dependent on iron concentration in the plasma. Since we assume that athletes have a sufficient iron supply, a constant apoptosis rate for marrow reticulocytes is assumed. The time cells stay in the reticulocytes stage is between 0.75 and 3 days. An increase in EPO concentration shortens the marrow transit time of reticulocytes.
Once reticulocytes are released from the bone marrow and enter the blood, they mature into erythrocytes (red blood cells) within 1-3 days. Reticulocytes have a hemoglobin content of around 27.5 ± 2.8 pg per cell and, red blood cells have a hemoglobin content of around 26.4 ± 2.4 pg per cell ( Fishbane et al. 1997 ). Due to the similar ability of blood reticulocytes and red blood cells to carry oxygen, when red blood cells are discussed, we refer to both blood reticulocytes and mature red blood cells.  The lifespan of red blood cells (RBCs) in healthy human adults is about 120 days before their components are recycled by microphages ( Jandl 1987 ). Over the course of this time a small number of RBCs die due to random daily breakdown or, internal or external bleeding. This is taken into account with a small apoptosis rate for RBCs. Adults have a red blood cell count ranging from about 20 to 30 trillion. Women have a blood cell count range of 3.5-5.5 trillion cells per liter, while men have a range of 4.3-5.9 trillion cells per liter ( Dean 2005 ). The average red blood cell count is estimated to be 24.98 trillion by Lichtman et al. 2005 . The entire process, from stem cell to red blood cell recycling by microphages, takes 141 days.
The endogenous release of EPO is inversely related to the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood. The partial pressure of oxygen in the blood is proportionally related to the number of circulating red blood cells. An increase in the red blood cell population in blood will decrease endogenous EPO production. If the concentration of"

Light Induced Technologies
UCL iGEM 2017
What is LIT?
LIT aims to give everybody control over cells through light. One of our project's main aspects is to engineer bacterial cells that can detect changes in sunlight levels and produce light at night time. The result? An innovative light bulb. Two types of bacteria will live inside the bulb, providing nutrients for each other and making the bulb a sustainable long-term source of light.
Join the challenge
Developments in technology will challenge the way we design and conceptualize objects from our everyday lives. The light bulb, as a source of light and inspiration is one of them.  This week, in collaboration with @the_art_competition we want people from different backgrounds to incorporate art and design into science. Rethink the light bulb’s design, usage and role in private and public spaces. What would it look like? What’s its source of energy? What functions can it play? The most imaginative ideas will become part of our engineering project and will be displayed at MIT in November.
More about the art competition
Send a picture of your proposal on Instagram to @the_art_competition by July 30th, 2017. We will evaluate the top submissions and work with the creator of the winning design to develop a 3D model to print.  The winning design will be announced on August 15th, 2017.

Kombucha Strains
The first steps in the characterization of microbes native to kombucha involved the isolation of strains from store-bought kombucha samples. This was accomplished by plating various dilutions of kombucha onto a variety of media including YPD, HS, and R2A.
Figure 1: Shows YPD plates spread with various dilutions of GT's brand kombucha samples. Credit: Zach Martinez.
Isolated colonies were selected from each ""isolation plate"" (Figure 1) and continually grown up and streaked out to ensure that the resulting frozen stock was truly axenic. Each newly isolated microbe was designated with a ""KOM #"" based on the order in which it was isolated (i.e. KOM 01, KOM 02, etc.) to serve as a placeholder name until the species could be identified. In order to begin this identification process, genomic DNA (gDNA) was first isolated from each individual strain. This DNA was then used as the template for two separate PCR reactions targeting either the 16S rRNA gene in bacteria, or the ITS rRNA gene for fungi. PCR products were then run on a 1% agarose gel to observe which reaction yielded product in gel (Figure 2).
Once it was determined whether each isolate was a bacterium or a fungus, the PCR products were purified and samples of the gDNA was sequenced using Sanger sequencing. The resulting sequences were then run through the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) SeqMatch tool in order to identify the exact species of bacteria or yeast that correspond to each tested isolate. The identified microbes are listed below in Table 1.

Technion-Israel,2014,Team:Technion-Israel#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," for a plate that was left on the workbench. Meanwhile in the plate with AB we saw that all the deposits had the same shape - one or two lines, which suggests some kind of symmetry breaking, due to some external factor.
To showcase these deposits, and their differences, we took some images of these deposits with a normal CCD camera, while providing lighting with a common tablet:
However, it is difficult to focus the lens well, and any analysis of the results would require advanced image processing. To obtain more accurate and easily accessible data, we used an unmodified Infinite 200 PRO Microplate Reader's function allowing for the measurement of OD within the wells in 225 different spots inside the each well arranged in a 15x15 grid. We used this as an ad-hoc imaging technique, through which we could determine the structures of the deposits get what is essentially an image of the sediments in every well.
As you can see, some of the wells on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th plate images (which are of the 2 plates without AB) appear to have patterns similar to those found in the wells with AB, despite the fact that conventional imaging showed otherwise. A closer look at which wells show the circular patterns seen by the naked eye, and which ones don't, show that the earlier a well was measured the more circular their pattern appeared.
Moreover, for the ""Plate left out"" (3rd and 4th images) we took 2 pictures, a few minutes apart, the second time, more of the wells had restructured into a linear shape as with the AB plates. In addition, in the second image, we saw that the wells which had already restructured themselves during the first image maintained their shape during the second measurement, which leads us to believe that this structure has a certain stability preference over the symmetric ones.
We believe this is caused by the AB being volatile (and therefore moving from one plate to the other by air, and thus contaminating our plate reader for the last 3 images), but more experiments are necessary to be sure of this conclusion. Either way, we are definitely witnessing some kind of external force working on the cells to restructure into a shape which is asymmetric.
High-Throughput Plate Reader Imaging
We proceeded with our high-throughput experimental design whereby we checked different concentrations of AB, mixed with cells with a different initial OD. We began by running letting the cells grow for a while, then measuring OD, activating the AB using specific wavelengths of photons, measuring OD again and again over constant time-lapses, and then shining on the cells"

Thus, if a parameter is defined strictly, there is little chance to form pattern. We considered the changeable or fluctuating parameters
Therefore, we defined a paramter range widely. There are no parameters by which patterns are well formed when the parameter is too large or too small , excluding the ratio of diffusion coefficient (the more different, the more likely pattern emerge). All parameters should not be too large, nor too small. Hence we define some range, and within the range, vary parameters, conduct stability analysis, and ""seek"" the parameter set that generates pattern.
But there needs some calculation time for stability analysis. The system we want to analyze have four elements and ten parameters, and all parameters are related complicatedly. Before stability analysis, we want to assume suitable parameters.  We focused on the condition to have a stable point.
For example, on case 2, the condition of having a fixed point ($u_0$, $v_0$, $a_0$, $c_0$) satisfies the condition below.
$$ {\alpha} - u_0 - v_0 - \frac{a_0}{a_0+K}{\delta} = 0 \\ {\beta} - u_0 - v0  - {\kappa}c_0 = 0 \\ u_0 - {\gamma}a_0 = 0 \\ u_0 - {\mu}c_0 = 0 \\ u_0, v_0, a_0, c_0 > 0 \\ $$  Then, u0 satisfies the condition below.
$$ -\frac{\kappa}{\mu}u_0^2 +({\alpha} - {\beta} - \frac{\kappa}{\mu}{\gamma}K - {\delta})u_0 + ({\alpha} - {\beta}){\gamma}K = 0 \\ u_0 > 0 \\ {\beta} - (1 + \frac{\kappa}{\mu}) * u_0 > 0 (from v_0 > 0) $$  From this condition, below can be assumed.
I. ${\alpha}$, ${\beta}$, ${\delta}$ are the same order, from the second term. The term would be useless if the parameters are too different.
II. ${\kappa}$ and ${\mu}$ are the same order, since these two values is always used as ratio.

Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#Water Report_-_-_TEXT.html,"2012).
It is important to note that, apart from dealing with the issue of water recycling and water perception, we are dealing with the applications of Synthetic Biology in the field. The track record of public perception in terms of genetic engineering and its applications is generally poor. In the case of water innovation an innovation barrier is created significantly due to ignorance, in both public and industry level. This ignorance hampers the translation of concepts developed in an academic set up to a large scale industrial implementation project (Balmer & Molyneux – Hodgson 2013).
This is a great concern for our team, which is focusing in the application of a GMMO-derived biomaterial in a large scale project like reclaimed water purification for potable use. Furthermore, we are focusing on mass production of bacterial cellulose in order to make our system available as much as possible to areas that face water problems, given that pressing issue addressed previously in the report is indeed the pricing of recycling water.
Finally, one key barrier in the implementation of Synthetic Biology solutions in the water industry in the use of GM bacteria for direct water treatment. Deliberate release of bacteria in order to treat water supply is a concept that instigates a lot of skepticism in the public. In order to bypass this issue we decided to not use GM bacteria to directly treat water, but rather use the biomaterial derived from them. By demonstrating that the final, processed membrane will be indeed GM-free in the safety section we hope to ease the public’s mind and make our method more widely acceptable.
Conclusions
Our planet’s natural water resources continue to be unsustainably exploited; as a result, we are faced with the challenges of water stress and scarcity. Climate change, population growth and urbanisation fuel the worsening crisis. To avert disaster we must rethink the way we process and use our water supplies. Promisingly, solutions are emerging but significant technological and sociological issues need to be addressed. Water treatment systems are becoming decentralised which makes the system more reliable and adaptable. Supply can be better expanded to meet changing demands and systems can be more tailored to local supplies though improvements are needed to make smaller scale plants more cost effective. Recycled wastewater is becoming an increasingly important component of our water supplies, indirect reuse is common and direct reuse, whilst initially confined to irrigation, is becoming more common. Barriers such as public perception ans deliberate release of GM organisms has prevented Synthetic Biology from becoming a valuable option in water innovation. Innovations are needed to improve quality and cost as well as public confidence in the process.
With many of these facts shaping the outcome of our project,"

In order to test the expression system, we request some BioBricks carrying the genes (amajLime, BBa_K1033915 ; asPink, BBa_K1033933 ; eforRed, BBa_K592012  tsPurple, BBa_K1033905 ) of chromoproteins from iGEM Team Uppsala . The work was done in 2012.
We transferred the parts to pGEX-2T followed by transforming E. coli BL21. Color proteins seen by naked eyes are the indicator of success of protein induction and expression system. In addition to validation of BioBricks created previously, it also can be used to optimize the condition of protein induction system.
 
The experiment procedure was described briefly as follows:
↓ Culture E. coli BL21 O/N, which carry indicated BioBricks from the stocks at -80°C.
 ↓ Dilute 100X in the fresh media (LB with 100 ug/ml Ampicillin) for 2 hr
↓ Till OD600 = 06~1.0, 1mM IPTG was added and incubate for 4~5 hr at 37°C
↓ Transfer 1 ml of bacteria and centrifuge for 1.5 min
↓ Observe color expression

“We all live in Alberta so it does hit us close to home,” Vigar said. “It is a big issue, especially with the oil spill in the Gulf. We’re noticing that it isn’t just an Alberta issue now, it’s very global so that’s making us feel even more important.”
The student project falls in the area of a relatively new field called synthetic biology. Synthetic biology involves engineering a biological system, organism or metabolic pathway to do a function not normally seen in nature, Vigar said. He’s heard all the arguments against genetic engineering but he said the benefits are tremendous.
“The industrial world has been messing with nature for hundreds of years with (carbon dioxide) and carbon emissions and pollution and even killing off species and endangered species. The playing-with-life thing is an issue. The good thing about synthetic biology is it’s carbon negative,” he said. “It is a touchy issue but it is well-regulated.”

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#test-2_-_-_TEXT.html," anthelmintics by raising the awareness in farmers regarding when they actually need to treat their horses.
Current Methods
Current Methods of Detection
Currently the only method for detecting/counting how many worms there are in an animal is counting nematode eggs in fecal samples. This method is not reliable and also requires farmers and ranchers to send in fecal samples to a lab with trained personnel [4]. This technique is expensive, inconsistent, and requires time sensitive shipping of samples. Currently many horse owners are reluctant to conduct the testing; treating their horses regardless of need which contributes to the resistance problem [10].
Resistance Development
Resistance Development
Unfortunately, the extensive overuse of deworming drugs has now lead to the detection of worms that are resistant to the most commonly used drugs [2,4]. Since no new deworming drugs have been approved for use in horses the whole equine industry relies on macrocyclic lactones, currently the most common type of deworming drugs used. Unfortunately, cases of resistance among nematode adults have been spotted for macrocyclic lactones as well. So far, four studies with similar results spanning from Europe to North America have been published with concrete data, linking certain small strongyle species to reduced time until detection of eggs after deworming treatment, showing an increase in resistance[2].
Moxidectin is a very common drug used. It is both hazardous for the environment and is also losing its effectiveness towards worm populations [14,15].
Due to all of these facts, we have during our iGEM project developed a reporter that is suitable for the in vivo environment of horse intestines. Moreover, we have developed new applications on existing techniques to be able to find the promoter that would be coupled to the reporter which would at last create the worm buster.
By implementing the model described under Symptoms together with the worm buster, horse owners will not only know how large the treatments should be but also when the treatments should happen. Thus they complement each other to minimize the amount of anthelmintics used; thereby helping to prevent resistance development.

Modeling: Gal1 Promoter
The Gal1 Promoter is the standard promoter for our pYES vector that is used in the expression of all ingredient pathways. As it is also part of the construct for the light switchable promoter, it is crucial to thoroughly characterize the kinetics of this promoter.
For details about the methods used see Team:TU_Munich/Modeling/Methods
Model Specification
Model Equations
We used a two species approach for mRNA and Protein concentrations. x1 and x2 represent the mRNA and protein levels for the induced promoter and x3 and x4 the respective levels for the uninduced promoter.
As no analysis was done with several galactose concentrations hence the hill function that normally models the response to the concentration was replaced by a single factor to improve identifiability.

DESCRIPTION
Toxicity of modern sunscreen
Sunlight is very important for maintaining human health: it boosts vitamin D production,increases blood level of endorphins, induces the release of the alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone [1] . However, along with positive effects of sunlight, Sun’s UV may cause sunburns, photoaging, photosensitivity, age spots and skin cancer [2] . These risks can be significantly reduced by the use of sunscreen. There are two types of sunscreen – organic and inorganic. The former contains chemical filters such as Oxybenzone and Octinoxate. They absorb UV radiation resulting in the emission of light with a longer wavelength, which is less damaging to the skin. Inorganic sunscreen, such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, act as physical sun blockers, which scatter, absorb and reflect UVA and UVB rays [3] .
However, the use of sunscreen currently available at the market can be harmful to nature. In particular, UV – absorbents negatively affect marine environment:
Oxybenzone and octinoxate cause coral bleaching by promoting viral infections in coral’s endosymbiotic algae [4] . DNA damage, resulting in reproductive diseases and endocrine disruption [5] .
Nanoparticles of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide exert harmful ecotoxicological effects such as bleaching and, inhibition of algal growth along with the increase of the lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane, resulting in the deformation of the membrane structure [6] [7] .
Every year up to 14,000 tons of sunscreen is being washed into the oceans and seas, resulting in a dramatic increase of the toxicity level and causing a variety of pathologies to corals [5] .
Mycosporine-Like Amino Acids(MAA)
Considering all the negative effects on the environment mentioned above, our team decided to look for safer sunscreen options. The possible alternative to current synthetic UV filters might be Mycosporine-Like Amino Acids (MAA). MAAs are small, water-soluble, colorless molecules [8] produced by a variety of marine organisms, including cyanobacteria, fungi, microalgae, and macroalgae [9] . Nowadays, more than 30 different types of MAAs have been identified [10] . MAAs"

induction of barnase (death gene) reduces cell growth
We characterized the activity of Barnase on an inducible plasmid constructed by UC Berkeley for iGEM 2007 (parts BBa_I716408C and BBa_I716211). This construct works by expressing background levels of Barstar with in the presence of an inducible Barnase. When induced, Barnase will overwhelm Barstar. Higher levels of Barnase expression resulted in lower rates of growth in the bacteria, affirming the principle of Barnase-based growth control for the genetic fence, and confirming the results from Berkeley 2008. We characterized the growth repression of Barnase under a range of arabinose inducer concentrations.
Our results show that expression of Barnase is effective in reducing cell growth, suggesting that Barnase will enable the genetic fence to prevent growth of iGarden plants outside of their designated areas.

We are solving problems
4 billion trees are cut down each year to make paper. To secure natural resources, reprocessed paper was developed. Paper reprocessing industry in Taiwan use about 70% of pulp from recycled paper and 30% of primary pulp. Paper recycling includes an important process called deinking. The key of this process is to detach ink from the fibers. Deinking nowadays uses lots of chemical agents including NaOH, NaSiO3, and Na2PO3 . It causes a great amount of pollution and generates huge amounts of waste water. To reduce the pollution from this process, our target is to develop an enzymatic deinking module. Furthermore, in this process a great amount of paper fiber is lost. To solve this problem, our team came up with an idea to replace manufactory process. The plan of our project is to insert enzymatic sequences into yeast by using genetic engineering and use red light to trigger the enzyme expression. After enzyme was expressed, the medium will be put into our process to see if it has the ability to deink.
This one day meet-up event includes brainstorming activities, project presentation and lecture. For the lecture part, we had invited Dr. Wong Chi Huey, the Distinguished Research Fellow from Genomics Research Center, Academia Silica. He shared about his research on Saccharides synthesis and guide us to explore the possibility and future work of synthetic biology. We appreciate for Dr. Wong’s sharing and coming, the speech did broaden the Taiwan iGEMers’ horizons and help us grow.
Key Achievements
● Build up deinking enzyme construct
● Transform construct into yeast
● Let yeast secret out enzyme into medium
● Put medium into our process and shows the dramatic deinking work
● Build up the Hardware device to fulfill deinking process
● Collaborate with TAS, using biofilm to replace flotation chemicals

William_and_Mary,2018,Team:William and Mary#Human Practices#VADOE_-_-_TEXT.html," corresponded extensively over email and over the phone to create a new biology standard representing synthetic biology under standard BIO. 5. The final draft of the standard was voted on by the Virginia Board of Education on October 18th. The standard reads:
BIO.5  The student will investigate and understand that there are common mechanisms for inheritance.  Key ideas include...Synthetic Biology has biological and ethical implications.
A complete version of the SOLs and Curriculum Framework from 2010 can be found here and here .
The final email from Dr. Petersen with revisions of the standard can be found here .
Our team will now begin the collaboration on the curriculum framework for the synthetic biology standard. Our moving forward our proposal includes the following information:
Plasmids are small circular pieces of DNA
Synthetic biology techniques utilize existing cellular mechanisms
Transformations allows for the uptake and incorporation of external genetic material
CRISPR/Cas systems can be used to target and alter specific DNA sequences
Advancements in DNA sequencing have made synthetic biology research more accessible and led to a rise in DIY biology or Biohacking
Synthetic biology has applications in a variety of disciplines including: medicine, agriculture, research, energy and travel
Synthetic biology advancements have ethical implications which affect both animals and the environment
We will be working with the curriculum framework team until March when our framework will be up for public review. The final review of the framework will be in May and will then be voted upon. Once passed, the Department of Education will develop Continued Professional Development to support professionals in transitioning to the new Science Standards of Learning. Full implementation of our standards be completed in 2021.
However, because Virginia’s standards are only updated every 7-8 years, and take over a year to update, many students are not being exposed to the most recent findings and research. To address this, our team is working with Dr. Petersen to create a resource for teachers which will provide the most up to date biotechnology advancements and applications. This living document will be managed by a team of vetted educators and education partners who will ensure the information presented is up to date and accurate, while providing guidance for teachers hoping to integrate the new material into their classes. This novel program is currently in the developmental stages and will be implemented alongside the new Curriculum Framework.
Together our new Standards of Learning, Curriculum Framework and Advancements Tool will help prepare Virginia students with up to date lessons in synthetic biology and bioengineering, inspire the next generation of iGEMers, and prepare them to be informed members of the community.

The restriction digest products of yesterday were run on 1% agarose gel with GelGreen stains for 45 minutes. 1 ug of DNA were used for each sample, together with ladder and uncut plasmid (as negative control). However, no bands were visible under UV or Blue light illumination.
To find out the cause of the problem, we put the agarose gel in EtBr solution for 1 hour staining (post-gel staining). The bands then showed up under UV illumination. This suggested that the problem might reside in GelGreen. We might have used the wrong illumination frequency, or GelGreen added was insufficient (protocol recommended 1 ul GelGreen for every 1 ml of agarose gel). Consequently, we will run an agarose gel tomorrow and then do post-gel staining with 3X GelGreen to check if the problem persists.

Break-even Analysis
At this point in the start-up, our financial predictions are estimates. We modelled the break-even point based on 3 different scenarios with combinations of our total cost - considering unit production cost and overheads - and revenue.
Table 1. Break-even point analysis
The ideal scenario for our start-up would be low total cost with high return, allowing us to break-even with the production of 450 boxes a year.
Graph 1. Break-even point analysis of low total cost, high return
Limitations
There are several limitations to our modelling of the break-even point:
We assume that our overheads will be constant, whereas this is very unlikely as within the first year we will be manufacturing boxes ourselves and conducting focus groups to improve the product.
We have excluded reagent supply to avoid making a multi-product prediction and assuming that the amount of reagents and boxes would both be constant.
We have not made allowances for changing financials environment

Safety
The aim of our project was to develop an innovative and cheap detection system for chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore we equipped E. coli bacteria with resistance plasmids containing the genetic information of our mTaz-receptor- and our OmpR/GFP-reporter construct. When working with genetically modified organisms safety of people and environment always needs to be taken into consideration. As our diagnostic method requires direct contact between the patient sample and the detecting bacteria, special provisions needed to be found to ensure an easy but safe handling of the GMOs.
The lab-on-a-chip device
The challenge of our project was to create an application which is safe but still suitable for the requirements in developing countries. Therefore it needs to be handy and easy to use, even for non-scientific stuff, usable without special laboratory equipment, suitable for mass sampling and fast and easy analysable. We met this tasks by encapsulating and immobilizing our bacteria on a lab-on-a-chip device.  Firstly the E. coli cells are mixed with 2.5 % alginic acid. During its polymerization the alginic acid develops pores which are big enough to allow smaller molecules like mDAP to enter the capsule but too small for the bacteria to escape. In a next step the biosafety encapsulated bacteria are bonded to the microfluidic diagnostic device. The capsules remain trapped inside the chambers of the device as the size of their diameter (100 µm) exceeds the size of the filter meshes (20 µm) that border the chambers at the openings of the inlet and outlet channels. The diagnostic chamber is probed with the patient's serum which passes through several filters before it is exposed to the capsules and the contained diagnostic bacteria. If the serum contains chlamydia trachomatis the mDAP released by the pathogen is expected to reach the receptors of the immobilized bacteria leading to the expression of GFP. That ensures the reliable diagnosis of chlamydial infections without the risk of a direct contact between people or the environment and the genetically modified E. coli.  The chips are solid so that they can be easily transported and handled and are therefore suitable for field projects, as long as the GMO guidelines of the country allow the usage outside of a S1 laboratory.

The cuvettes were then placed in a spectrophotometer every hour and the absorbance at 600 nm was established; in between readings the cuvettes were placed into a 37 ºC incubator in order to encourage bacterial growth. This was repeated for 12 hours and the absorbance readings compared to the calibration curve in order to give data on the level of growth of E. coli transformed with the different promoters/untransformed over time.
We found that there was a significant difference between Alpha cells and PyeaR cells. Initially, Alpha cells had a greater growth rate, but after the third hour into the study, the growth rate of PyeaR was faster than that of Alpha cells. The overall growth rate of PyeaR cells was significantly faster that Alpha cells (Levenes Test, F = 1.009  p = 0.372; T Test,  t = 4.196, df = 4, p = 0.014).
Figure 5Growth of PyeaR transformed E.coli cells relative to Alpha cell (untransformed cells. Error bars show the standard deviation between the three repeats.  For clarity reasons, lines of best fit are not shown.
The growth pattern and rate of E.coli cells with or without transformation with B-M and M-B show little difference. Any differences in growth rate were not significant. There was lots of overlap. As previously described, there was a significant difference between the growth rate of PyeaR and Alpha cells. There was also a significant difference between MB/BM and PyeaR cells. The statistical results can be seen in Table 1

From all the above graphs, it can be seen that with the starting concentration of cells as high as they are, the cultures are in exponential stage and do not undergo lag phase. A further growth study will be carried out on purely the lag phase with lower starting concentrations. As the starting absorbances here are approximately 0.2 at a wavelength of 600nm, the lag phase study will involve starting absorbances of 0.04 and lower.
Following the above study, we found that a lag phase only study needed to be carried out to see if there was a significant difference in the lag phase.  Again the study protocol was the same"
Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," missing populations that are not being treated. And this is a problem in several areas. I think that there are still a lot of lessons we need to learn if we are going to eliminate this disease. Our surveys although they are good for what they were designed for, they do miss out so we need to have other tools to make some decisions.
Daniel C.:
We read through some of that regional case study summaries and also the GET [Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma] 2020 reports which also talked a lot about regions. […] You were also active in GET 2020. […] Can you tell us more or less about what you did associated with the WHO?
Dr. Courtright:
Well, GET 2020 is really an alliance. So, WHO leads the group but it’s an alliance of organizations […]. You have to talk about the past versus the present. The standpoint of the present GET 2020 is much more active and muscular, which is great, in terms of trying to provide the guidance, it doesn’t provide any money. It’s really the guidance for what programs and countries need to do to reach the elimination. There’s a new documentation on what a country needs to do to verify the elimination, for example. And that’s what GET 2020 does. GET 2020 […] also […] worked through organizations like KCCO to have scientific meetings: KCCO organized for GET 2020 the first and recently the second Global Trichiasis Scientific Meeting. […] So our role has been to provide some of the scientific backstopping and the coordination of overall GET 2020 activities.
Daniel C.:
Which means, that you probably have a very good overview of the progress GET 2020 has made? Global elimination of trachoma until 2020 is an ambitious goal. Do you think they will reach it?
Dr. Courtright:
Well, I would say yes and no. Yes, in many of the countries like Malawi, Mozambique and Nepal, in these countries, even Tanzania, […] they will achieve it by the year 2020. Some countries Ethiopia, for example, probably not, just because the problem there is so massive. Other countries like South Sudan that are still in a conflict stage, clearly it’s not, because there’s really nothing going on there or very little going on. If people say that global elimination means that every countries has to be at that level, then they are not going to achieve it. I don’t personally subscribe to that perspective because I think if the vast majority of countries have achieved it and we"

The gylphosate target, the EPSP synthase, exists in ...

Dr. John E. Franz who was working for the American company Monsanto (recently bought by Bayer) observed that glyphosate specifically inhibits the 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase which exists in plants, fungi, bacteria and archaea.
To use glyphosate genetically modified organisms are needed
8/24
In 1996 Monsanto launched their first Roundup Ready crop – the Roundup Ready soybean. This specific genetically modified soybean is resistant to glyphosate and was obtained by the expression of inserted DNA into the Glyphosate-tolerant Soybean (GTS) plant DNA. This insert contains the EPSP synthase of  Agrobacterium tumefaciens (check here) Since then multiple other Roundup Ready crops resistant to glyphosate haven been developed. All of them are resistant to Roundup, so farmers that plant these seeds must use Roundup exclusively (Glyphosate) to keep other weeds from growing in their fields.
However glyphosate is not only used in the combination with GT crops. In Germany those genetically modified crops are forbitten and glyphosate is used in three application modes which are pre-sowing (20.7% of application area), pre-harvest (11.2%) and stubble application (68.1%).

It does not cause disease in healthy of adult humans and also does not have any additional safety precautions. We handle the organism safely by keep it into the safe place in our laboratory. We work in the lab where not all people have access to enter the lab.
Our project resulted biological waste. In order to dispose the biological wastes (for example used pipette tip), according the standard of laboratory safety, we collect them together in a certain box with label and decontaminated the autoclave before disposal or destroyed; the liquid waste such as cell culture and agar plate treated by decontamination with autoclave according to the laboratory standard operational procedures and dispose the material to the sanitary sewer system.
We use lab coat, rubber gloves and surgery mask in order to minimize contamination of the experiment whether in the laboratory or workshop for the society.

- Experiments From Jun 30
Finish flux range comparisons
L_exp21
Finished up comparisons.  Looked through fluxes of transporter reactions in search of an explanation for ATP synthase directionality change in N2 fixing WM1788 vs. wild type.  Did not find any conclusive result.
- Experiments From Jul 02
Finished flux range comparisons
L_exp22
Did a flux range comparison of N2 fixing WM1788 at maximum ATP production vs normal N2 fixing WM1788.  Many reactions changed their directionalities, but the largest change was .02.  Can determine from this that the N2 fixing strain is already ATP limiting-- ie. there are no major differences when ATP is maximized.
- Experiments From Jul 06
Performed an analysis on all reactions with non-overlapping flux ranges between N2 fixing WM1788 and the wild type
L_exp23
Performed an analysis on all reactions with non-overlapping flux ranges between N2 fixing WM1788 and the wild type.  Determined which metabolic system each reaction was in and what percentage of the non-overlaps each system made up.
Amino acid metabolism was the system with the most non-overlaps, but it had the smallest changes.  Ion transport, exchange, and inner/outer membrane transport made up a little over 15% of the non-overlaps together, but had the highest changes.
- Experiments From Jul 07
Analyzed ATP production/consumption in N2 fixing WM1788.
L_exp24
Analyzed ATP production/consumption in N2 fixing WM1788.  Compiled a ranked list of reactions which produce ATP.  Jess compiled a list of the top 10 reactions in the model which consume ATP.
- Experiments From Jul 08
Started working on the Python script
L_exp25
Started working on the Python script for knocking out all of the genes in the N2 fixing model.  Started by writing a code which takes the GPRs (gene protein relationships) present in the model and creates a list of all the unique genes.

BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEMers’ online communication this year:
In this way, most of the common problems can be solved as quickly as possible, and the members can get inspiration from these communication.
b) Make it more convenient for the following iGEM teams:
Excepting for presenting every team’s project, most of the members shares their experiences on this platform,                                 during the preparation process of competition. Based on these resources, the following iGEM teams can get many information at their beginning and avoid many mistakes.
c) To publics
We think that every iGEMer has the duty to spread the knowledge of synthetic biology to public. So that’s what we do, giving relative courses to anyone interested in it. With this union, we also introduce the idea of iGEM competition, and what we gained in the challenging process to attract more people to participat in iGEM competition.
To achieve these goal, we tried hard.
The first step is to build a Wechat official account to communicate with other                                 teams and propagandize to the public. This way, all the followers can get to know the member teams and communicate with them. For us, it makes investigating and getting feedback from the public more easily.
We led the HP union and started the union with other five teams: BIT, CGU-Taiwan, Jilin-China, Peking, TJU. So far, more teams up to 10 are members of the union.
We shared some articles about issues containing biological safety, ethics, iGEM                                 competition and other controversial topics which are concerned by public.
Besides, we plan to provide new teams or the potential participating teams with resources including union members’ project introduction and team members’ personal contact information                                 attached with attribution.
This way, it can facilitate the communication among students.
We truly hope, in the coming future, more and more iGEM teams can                                 join our iGEM Union, more and more students can participate in iGEM competition.
Communication with COFCO
What we designed is a product that will be used in large-scale fermentation,                                 to get some suggestions for applying our project in industry production, we visited COFCO Nutrition and Health Research Institute.
We introduced our project to the staff, getting many useful feedback. Their                                 suggestions helped us view our project in a different way, find the existing                                 problem in our project, and lead us to think more about application and the                                     practical problems.

Nanodrop then showed DNA presence, so the following digests were prepared: D1- 20.5 µL pSB1A3, 2.5 µL 10x Tango, 1 µL EcoRI, 1 µL PstI; D2 - 14.5 µL water, 2.5 µL 10x Tango, 6 µL MP5, 1 µL EcoRI, 1 µL SpeI; D3 - 18.5 µL water, 2.5 µL 10x Tango, 2 µL MP7, 1 µL XbaI, 1 µL PstI

Figure 2: Results obtained for our LovTAP activation experiment.
Figure 3: Results obtained for our LovTAP TrpR mutant activation experiment.
Figure 2 shows the response of two clones of LovTAP under blue light (controls were not included in this experiment). There is no clear difference in response (measured by fluorescence/optical density) over time. Expected results would show higher fluorescence in the dark than in the light.
Figure 3 shows the same experiment performed on the TrpR mutant - to see if there is any difference in LovTAP activation under blue light illumination. Again, fluorescence should be higher in the dark state - due to RFP reporter being suppressed by blue light - of LovTAP activation. Again, however, results are inconclusive.
We believe that there is a need to test the system under different conditions: temperature, different strength of promoters, etc. Further experiments are being carried out at the present time. For further details, please see the lab book .

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#Choice of Protein_-_-_TEXT.html," has been very important for the development of our project that we have been able to speak with experts in space medicine and protein production such as Virginia Wotring,  Karen McDonald, Jon Scott, Jørgen Sauer, Michael Hecht and Eva Horn Møller (which we will introduce below)  and we have very much incorporated their inputs into the very core of our project.
Experts. We chose to contact Virginia Wotring, Adjunct Associate Professor, Center for Space Medicine, Department of Pharmacology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, US, because of her background as pharmacist and her experience with drugs and drug stability in outer space. Given that we wanted to produce protein drugs we wanted to know more about properties of protein drugs such as stability, and sensitivity to radiation etc.
We chose to contact Jon Scott, Medical Projects and Technology Team lead for ESA's Space Medicine Office, because he works for the European Space Agency  (ESA), has a background in sport and exercise science and did his PhD in about bone metabolism. We thought that it might be very interesting for us to speak with him because bone loss is a serious concern for astronauts due to microgravity in outer space.
We contacted Lonnie Grove, PhD, Postdoc at University of Copenhagen and Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of California San Diego because of her background as medical doctor and her interest and experience with space and astronaut health. We wanted to speak with Lonnie about what happens to the human body in outer space from a broad perspective.
We contacted Karen McDonald because she (among other things) work with production of protein drugs for astronauts at CUBES (Center for the Utilization of Biological Engineering in Space) .  We believed that we had a lot to learn from her and that she might have some interesting inputs about which proteins to produce with our system.
We contacted Eva Horn Møller because she works as Senior Drug Product specialist at Zealand Pharma and we therefore knew that she would have some insight into and experience with production of drugs.  Furthermore, she works in the industry and we thought it would be very nice to get some feedback from the industry.
We contacted Jørgen Sauer because he has a background in chemistry and has experience with protein production. We were very interested in getting some feedback on the technical (protein-production) part of our project.
We contacted Michael Hecht, who is a professor at Princeton University, at the European Meetup. He made some interesting suggestions for our system regarding how to handle protein folding.

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Cholera - Detection_-_-_TEXT.html," using phage in our construct to do so. There are two approaches to using phage to eliminate the biofilm in Cholera. We may engineer a phage to do what we need, or we may go looking for a phage that has already evolved to do what we need.
Here are a few summaries of articles I read today:
The use of phages for the removal of infectious biofilms. Azeredo, J. and Sutherland I.W. (2008)  Used two phages isolated from sewage; showed 2-4 log decreases in bacterial population both in vitro and in vivo (murine model). OF INTEREST: In vitro testing involved biofilm and took longer; in vivo testing involved only planktonic cells and was faster. OF INTEREST: Calcofluor biofilm staining. Efficacy of cocktail phage therapy in treating Vibrio cholerae infection in rabbit model Summary: Oral administration of a cocktail of 5 lytic cholera bacteriophages to rabbits yielded strong and statistically significant reductions of cholera. Researchers showed that administration of the cocktail at 6 hour and 12 hour time intervals after bacterial challenge reduced bacteria populations 100 fold and 10 fold, respectively. Administration of the cocktail before bacterial challenge apparently did not significantly decrease cholera OF INTEREST: The emergence of multiple drug resistant strains of V. cholerae is thus a cause for global concern [4,5] and is prompting the exploration for alternative ways of treatment  OF INTEREST: To the best of our knowledge it is the first report of combatting V. cholerae infection in an animal model by phages adminis- tered through the oral route. Here are a few more articles that I've downloaded and I'm going to read:
Phage-bacterial interactions in the evolution of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae - this article exams the co-evolution of phage and cholera toxin. From what I read of the abstract, it is hypothesized that cholera's toxin was introduced by horizontal gene transfer from the CTXw phage. Written by a researcher from Harvard Medical School
O Antigen Is the Receptor of Vibrio cholerae Serogroup O1 El Tor Typing Phage VP4 - phage VP4 infects cholera, but certain mutations to the O-antigen gene provides resistance against VP4 (VP4 has anti-biofilm properties?)

Biotic Blue - The Guardian of the Baltic Sea
Figure 2.Trametes versicolor
Our mission as iGEM Stockholm 2018 is to inactivate SMX and reduce its ecotoxicity. We created Biotic Blue, a solution  based on an enzyme produced by the common fungus Trametes versicolor. To be able to grow on wood, this fungus produces a class of multi-copper oxidases called laccases. Laccases degrade lignin, a building block in wood consisting of phenolic polymers. With their natural affinity for phenolic compounds, laccases have been shown to have an affinity for a wide range of pharmaceuticals with a similar chemical structure, including estrogen hormones, anti-inflammatories, and antibiotics like SMX [11].
While laccases have nearly identical copper-containing active sites, they still exhibit promiscuity in substrate interactions and catalytic rates [12]. Our team has chosen to utilize this defining characteristic of laccases to target SMX. By employing laccase to transform SMX into a less ecotoxic product and immobilizing the enzyme on magnetic beads, we created an innovative technology that is reusable and can easily be implemented as part of the wastewater treatment process. All this together led to our design of a physical prototype .
Figure 3. Wild-type vs. mutant laccase
With the help of super-computational power, we also characterized the reaction mechanisms of our laccase at a level of detail not previously published, using Molecular Dynamics, QM and QM/MM simulations . These simulations provided a unique insight into the key interactions between SMX and the laccase. By exploring our model further, we found mutations that would increase the enzyme’s affinity for SMX, as well as the degradation rate. With this approach of rational enzyme design, we aimed to improve our enzyme and create a super-enzyme that transforms SMX with high efficiency.
This is how Biotic Blue was born!

The cells were imaged at excitation energies of 0.1 mW, 0.5 mW, 0.7 mW, 1 mW, 2 mW, 5 mW and 10 mW. These images were analysed using ImageJ to determine the output intensity and corrected for background noise (McCloy et al., 2014) .
Results and discussion
The output intensities of our cells were plotted against the excitation power to determine whether our cells emitted laser-like light. The results are shown in figure 2.
Figure 2: Intensity measurements of cells transformed with mCerulean or mCerulean and OmpA-silicatein, we show two duplicate experiments per strain. The measured emission intensity was plotted against the excitation power (black dots) along a prediction of the increase of intensity for fluorescence (blue line) and lasing (red line). Left of the intensity graphs, a picture of the imaged spot is shown.
In figure 2, the measured intensity is plotted against the excitation power (black dots). Since we expect a linear relation, the expected increase of intensity of fluorescence (blue line) and the expected increase of intensity for lasing (red line) was also plotted. The expected fluorescence is fitted to the fluorescence of the mCerulean, the expected lasing pattern is estimated from this. We show two duplicate experiments per strain. Comparing the measurement data to the expected relations, we cannot see a convincing result that our cells are lasing. Above an excitation power of 2 mW we see that in all cases the fluorescence stays at the same level. This means that the intensity is not increasing anymore and we believe that we observe photobleaching. So, both the fluorescent cells as well as the laser cells do not emit any laser-like light. For the fluorescent cells that were transformed with solely mCerulean, this result is as expected, these cells do not have any extra modifications that should cause them to emit laser light. The strain that was transformed with both mCerulean and OmpA-silicatein had a glass shell around the cell that could cause the cells to emit laser light. This effect was not observed. The strain transformed with solely OmpA-silicatein did not emit any light, as expected.
From this experiment we cannot see any clear proof of lasing in our cells. This could be both due to our setup or due to"

Interview with Dr Khan from The Brooke, Pakistan
Click here to learn more about our interview shedding light on the difficulties with diagnosis in Pakistan
To gage the importance of a cheap and simple diagnostic kit for use in rural areas in developing countries on economically neglected diseases, such as Tuberculosis, through Rachel's contacts at The Brooke we reached out to several vets in the field, including Dr. Muhammad Jawad Khan.
Many infectious diseases that are common in the developing world receive little research funding because these diseases are rare in developed countries. However, these diseases can cause serious health problems and hundreds of thousands of fatalities a year – especially when coupled with a lack of access to high-quality medical care. It is estimated that over a billion people in developing countries are at risk of such diseases (Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, 2015).
Over the past two decades, changes in global travel patterns and lifestyles has led to the emergence of new infectious diseases in the developing world and re-emergence of old infectious diseases in the developed world. Coupled with the global spread of antibiotic resistance, this has made the emergence of new infectious diseases a truly global concern.
We got Dr. Sanjib Bhakta, Director of Mycobacteria Research Laboratory at the Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London and UCL to share his expertise of TB with us in order to shed some light on our rationale for designing a quick diagnostic tool in the wider international fight against this infamous bacterial infection.

Click here to hear Dr. Sanjib Bhakta, Director of Mycobacteria Research Laboratory at the Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London and UCL, discuss how accurate current standard methods are for the detection of TB and drug-resistant TB.
According to the World Health Organisation, one of the main ways of addressing infectious diseases is through a strong surveillance system to monitor the spread of different diseases (WHO, 2015). Improved detection and surveillance can help in prioritising public health resources and research funding to combat these diseases more efficiently.
