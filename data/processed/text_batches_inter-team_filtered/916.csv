(5) Because the rate of transcription is much faster than the rate of the translation, we think the rate-limiting step is the translation.
The reaction processes of circuits are described as below:
""In-promoter"" activity:
And groups of differential equations are:
The initial values and description of variables are:
From all these we can finally get two the diagrams, the first one is about the relationship between the concentration of inhibitor protein and number of plasmids, the second one about the relationship between RFP intensity and number of plasmids
Fig. 3 The intensity of inhibitor expressed by constitutive promoter changes with different plasmid numbers.
From this curves, we can know the inhibitor protein have a positive correlation with number of plasmids. At before, we think when the concentration of inhibitor is above 24.42 units, the in-promoter will be repressed fully. And then from this curve, we can see that when the concentration of inhibitor is 23.95 units are so similar with 24.42 units, the threshold of the plasmids number we calculate is 210 copies.
Fig.3 The intensity of RFP expressed by PR promoter changes with different plasmid numbers.
From this curve, we can see that corresponding to the threshold of RFP intensity (12.05 units), we can calculate out the threshold of plasmid number 210 copies.
Here goes our conclusion: The number of the plasmids will determine the intensity of RFP. When the plasmids number is above the threshold 210 copies, rfp (stands for killer gene) will be just repressed, and the cells with enough plasmids number will be saved.
·Summary·
With these three models, we successfully prove that：
① The number of plasmids will have a positive influence on the corresponding inhibitor’s concentration.
② Since ""in-promoter"" will respond to the inhibitor with different concentrations differently, we can decide whether the killer gene express or not by changing the concentration of inhibitor.
To make a long story short, we successfully prove that the number of plasmids will affect the ""in-promoter's"" activity. By rudimentary calculation, we can say when the number of plasmid is above the threshold (210 copies), the inhibitor can just repress the expression of killer gene and the cell can survive. Once the plasmid number gets smaller, the inhibitor won’t work anymore, our P-SLACKiller time starts!

Our project description
For the first part of our project- an aflatoxin detecting strip - our bacteria will be able to produce a fusion protein containing:
1. scFv (Single-chain variable fragment) that can recognize aflatoxin and bind to it Specifically.
2. RFP that make the protein more easy to observe.
3. His Tag acts as the antigen of the secondary antibody.
Using this fusion protein we will create a strip that detects the presence of aflatoxin in food.
For the second part of our project - an aflatoxin degrading enzyme-  our bacteria will be able to produce:
1. An enzyme(FGD) that can degrade aflatoxin.
2. An enzyme that can produce the cofactor(F420H2) of the enzyme(FGD).
Our bacteria will be engineered to release these enzymes (FGD) that can protect the digestive system and human body by degrading the aflatoxin before this harmful substance is absorbed.

Outer membrane proteins form an essential component for Gram-negative bacteria, providing the bacteria with protection against a harsh environment [2] . More than six outer membrane protein families have been discovered, which all share a beta barrel secondary structure. Thanks to this structure, the proteins feature loops protruding from the bacterial outer membrane, and intracellular C-termini. This enables clicking of aptamers to the membrane proteins and fusing signaling components to the outer membrane proteins intracellularly, making outer membrane proteins the perfect scaffold for COMBs. Read more on outer membrane proteins:
OMPs can feature as a scaffold as aptamers can be clicked on the protruding loops & signaling components fused intracellularly.
The signaling components
The signaling components used for COMBs translate a close proximity into a response. Signaling components which do exactly this are split luciferases & fluorescent and bioluminescent proteins, through Resonance Energy Transfer. In the future, TEV Proteases may be used to translate a proximity into the release of the transcription factor, coupling COMBs recognition to the vast amount of cellular responses bacteria have available. Read more our signaling components:
COMBs signaling components translate a close proximity into a measurable signal. Here shown is BRET.
The Recognition Element – Aptamers
Since the discovery of the nucleic acid structure, nucleic acids were long thought to have a single function – storage of the heredity information as genetic instructions. Our perception on the function of DNA and RNA changed radically, however, as it was discovered that small RNA molecules could fold into a three-dimensional structure, exposing a surface onto which other small molecules could perfectly fit.  Soon after the discovery that nucleic acids could have interaction with other molecules, Craig Tuerk and Larry Gold described a procedure, called SELEX, to isolate high-affinity nucleic acid ligands for proteins through a Darwinian-like evolution process carried out in vitro [3] .
SELEX is an acronym for Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment. The process is carried out in vitro and requires a very large oligonucleotide library (~1015 members), which can be generated by combinatorial DNA Synthesis. SELEX starts with incubation of the library with the target molecule. This incubation is followed by a washing step which ensures that only oligonucleotides with higher affinities are selected. Next, the oligonucleotides which are still present in the mixture after the washing step are recovered and amplified. During this amplification step, mutations are introduced into the oligonucleotides, yielding a new"

Promoter function in P. acnes is still predicted, however, because P. acnes is more closely related to M. Bovis, belonging to the same phylum.
Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe one or more ways in which these or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project.
The chassis developed by the 2014 Pitt iGEM Team naturally grows on human skin, therefore there are a number of potential safety risks involved in engineering and working with this bacterium. While none of the genes presented are toxic nor are expected to lead to any adverse effects, and given how engineered strains typically experience a reduction in fitness compared to non-engineered strains, some safety precautions need be considered due to the direct contact of the organism with humans. Additionally, the engineered bacteria would also contain resistance to erythromycin, because the gene vectors were selected for on antibiotic plates, therefore the chassis has an additional, albeit remote, possibility for horizontal gene transfer. Thus, the ideal implementation of the system includes a kill switch to efficiently kill off any engineered bacteria in the event of a negative reaction to the engineered bacteria. Several such systems have been developed by previous iGEM teams. Another possible solution would be the creation of a genetic fence such that the bacteria would only survive in the presence of some exogenous inducer on the skin. The fence would be a substance topically applied to the skin, forcing the engineered bacteria to only inhabit the “fenced” skin area. As P. acnes traditionally inhabits the skin follicle, the substance would have to penetrate to this level. It is likely that either of these systems would provide all of the necessary safety precautions to lead to removal.

We transformed our constructs in an E.coli expression strain, grew them at various temperatures (room temperature and 37 degrees celcius) and induced expression with increasing amounts of IPTG. We also added salicylate or chorismate to the growth medium in an attempt to increase MeS production. The figure shows results obtained with the BBa_J45700 brick. Our biobrick (BBa_K1060003) showed similar results (data not shown). Increasing the amount of IPTG did not influence the protein expression profile (compare lanes a-d or lanes e-h) but we do see some bands in the lanes a-d which we cannot see in lanes e-f (eg a band just above 55 kDa). Nonetheless, this observation can be verified with lower amounts of the protein extracts. Nonetheless, our smell test would suggest that the MeS brick does work. Hence, we need a more sensitive approach to identify the protein production of the MeS brick. Possible approaches would be via classic western blot experiment or a GC-MS set-up.

To recap,    the meaning of $\bar{R}^2$ is the scaled squared intercellular distance    after updating once with timestep $\Delta t$ starting from    an initial distance of $r_0$. Then we define $F$ as the cumulative    distribution function for the random variable $\bar{R}^2$ as (24).
$$     F(\bar{R^*}^2) = P(\bar{R}^2 \leq \bar{R^*}^2)     \;\;\; \text{(24)}     $$
To then finally calculate    appropriate timestep for a given $r_0$, $r_{cutoff}$, $\mu$    and desired $P^-$    we take    the inverse cumulative distribution function and equate it    to the intercellular cutoff distance, after appropriate scaling      and squaring (25).
$$     F^{-1}(1-P^-) = \bar{r}_{cutoff}^{2}     = \frac{r_{cutoff}^{2}}{4 \cdot \mu \cdot \Delta t}     \;\;\; \text{(25)}     $$
Note that both the left hand side and right hand side both    depend on the $\Delta t$ in a nonlinear way, therefore    a nonlinear solver is required to solve this equation.    As stated previously, it is not possible to completely avoid    that the cells will jump out of each other's influence in a single    timestep. However, equation (25) allows us to calculate the timestep    $\Delta t$ that will result in cells detaching in a single timestep with a    probability $P^-$ that we can specify.
Boundary Conditions
Solving the equation of motion to compute trajectories of    bacteria is well-defined as long as they stay within in    the domain. To give a complete picture however, we also    need to specify what agents should"

There are some problems about Freiburg’s parts. We can’t connect TAL in the right order.                            So we designed some new primers for PCR that could produce the right sequence.
August Week 4
We designed a few new adaptors for the fusion protein.                            Sequencing results showed accurate construction. Then we observed the FP using LSCM to confirm that the fusion protein could locate on the membrane.
September Week 1
We tried co-transformation: pRSF, pACYC and pBluescript. Also, we found the conditions of protein expression. What's more, we were still trying to find the way to construct the TAL. Meanwhile, we were starting to synthesis the TAL gene.
September Week 2
With the current experimental results, we were beginning to find the enzymes for the application and the way to detect the substrate in these pathways. In addition, we did some modification to connector plasmids.
September Week 3
We finally received the synthesized TAL gene sequence from the gene company, so we continued to construct the part with our new adaptors. In addition, PSK vector was remoulded in order to achieve our aims.
September Week 4
We began to express the TAL gene and do some tests for prokaryotic expression. Constructed gene were expressed and the final results were obtained.

Fudan-CHINA,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," factor occupy system resources. By promoting SE, we can achieve the same level of system output with fewer resources (i.e., lower chain generation rates).  It should be noted that since the TC chain is no longer likely to contribute to system output after losing its transcription factor, using the TC chain to measure SE is a bit of a hassle. However, the structure of the PC chain is always the same, which means that we can easily measure $SE$ with parameters related to PC chain.   Therefore, we advance the birth-death process model above to an ordinary continuous-time Markov chain, in order to research the behavior of a PC chain. The state transition diagram of the advanced model is shown in Figure 7. The meaning of each state the PC chain can be in is as follows:       State 1: (free state) it moves freely on the cell membrane,     State 2: (semi-bonded state) it binds to an exogenous ligand,     State 3: (effective binding state) it binds to a TC chain with the help of exogenous ligand, so that they may produce transcription factors,     State 4: (invalid binding state) it binds to a TC chain without transcription factor with the help of exogenous ligand, which means it is occupied but cannot help produce transcription factors.
Figure 7. State transition diagram of the Markov process.
Using the theory of stochastic process[5], we find the analytical solution of the stability probability of this chain in each state after a long enough time, which can help measure system efficiency. Hence, we obtain the relationship between the binding abilities of the two chains to the exogenous ligand.
Conclusion
Through the equations obtained from the model (Eqs. 42, 43 and 44 in Section 2.2 of our entire model report ), it follows that under the condition that our basic system does not contain a specific degradation pathway to free TC chain out of transcription factor, we cannot increase system efficiency by changing binding abilities. However, if we design the pathway, it will be feasible to increase system efficiency by improving the binding ability of the PC chain and exogenous ligand or reducing that of the TC chain and exogenous ligand, which is shown in Figure 8.
Figure 8. Effect of the binding abilities on system efficiency under the condition of the existence of a degradation pathway to free TC chain out of transcription factor. λ1 are negatively correlated with the binding ability of the PC chain and exogenous ligand, and λ2 are negatively correlated with that of the TC chain and exogenous ligand.

This year we are cooperating with team SJTU-BioX-Shanghai. We come up with an idea of combining the two projects to achieve a win-win goal, which is to desalinate sea water with a high concentration of heavy metal. They are engineering with blue algea which can desalinate sea water while we work with engineered B. subtilis which can adsorb lead, gold and uranyl selectively. We also sent them our cell adhesion materials in case they need to separate blue algea from sea water. They have been trying to utilize the material to optimize their project.
Fig 1. Cell adhesion materials. 1. First generation plastic pellet 2. Second generation plastic pellet 3. Cyclic fiberfill 4. Chain-like fiberfill
Firstly, as is known, different organisms live under diverse conditions. Therefore the first problem that we meet with is related to the living conditions of our chassis. Can our engineered B. subtilis survive in sea water? Can their blue algea survive in aquatic environment with high solution of heavy metal? Only if we solve the two obstacles can we cooperate with each other smoothly. So we decided to do some tests to confirm whether they can survive simultaneously in sea water with heavy metal. We planned to select microorganisms that meet the collaboration requirement. Unfortunately, the microorganisms used in our project were both chosen. It could be unpredictable if we had tried to modify them. Thus we had to change our plan.
After many rounds of discussion, we found that places such as estuaries could provide the two organisms with required environment. So we finally decided to desalinate polluted sea water step by step. Sea water with high concentration of heavy metal go through our purification device first so that heavy metal contaminants can be adsorbed. Next, blue algea functions to desalinate the sea water. The advantage of our idea is that we only need to make sure that our engineered B. subtilis can survive in sea water while the low efficiency problem is also inevitable.
We have been collaborating with each other since early July and the collaboration is still going on. We sincerely hope that our win-win goal can be achieved some day. Because we have found that almost all desalination technologies encounter the problem of sediments which contained a variety of heavy metal such as lead. The combination of our two teams not only identified the significance of"

To decide the time it took for a reaction to occur, we sample a random number \(r_{1}\) in the range [0,1] and stick that number on the y axis of the graph. We read off from our graph a corresponding time and we're done - we now know when the next reaction took place.
2) To decide which reaction took place, we need the probabilities of each reaction occuring being proportional to the ratio of their propensities. We split up the domain of 0 to 1 into the normalised ratios of the propensities of our problem, recalling the propensities we calculated. We could have, in this case, selected the backwards reaction B to A. We can generalise this to the form given in the Gillespie Algorithm above.

Diffusion
In this section we will derive some of the equations used in the Delivery Section .
Diffusion out of our Beads
In order to find the convection mass transfer coefficient , \(K_m\), of our beads in water we needed derive a theoretical curve to fit our experimental data to. To do this, we made a number of approximations. Our beads are assumed to be spherical and of equal diameter. We also used a lumped capacitance model, in which the concentration of substance is assumed to be uniform within the bead. We will also make use of the equivalence of heat and mass transfer.
Our derivation starts from Newton's law of cooling
\[Q = hA\Delta T\]
Where \(Q\) is the flow of energy, \(h\) is the convection coefficient, \(A\) is the surface area, and \(\Delta T\) is the difference in temperature accross the boundary. Or rather its mass equivalent
\[\dot{m}=K_{m}A_{b}\left(c_{b}-c_{f}\right)\]
Where the mass flow rate, \(\dot{m}\), across a boundary is driven by the concentration difference across it. In our case the concentration difference is between the concentration of particles, \(c_f\) in the fluid and the beads, \(c_b\). Using the relationship

Chemical Drugs
Chemical drugs for IBD are tailored for each patient.  So doctors must consider various factors to determine drugs and doses.
Immunosuppression
Generally, depending on the level of severity, IBD may require immunosuppression to control the symptoms. The side effect is that the body becomes more vulnerable to infections and malignancy.
Fecal microbiota transplant
FMT is the process of transplantation of fecal bacteria from a healthy individual into a recipient. It is a relatively new treatment option for IBD which has attracted many attention since 2010 and many related standards has not been completely established yet.  This therapy needs strict tests for donors, and the curative effect is not significant enough so far.

This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the Attributions bronze criterion .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

Interviewing Smart City Odense
For the possible implementation of the PowerLeaf in the local environment of Odense, we decided to reach out to Kristina Dienhart, project manager of Smart City Odense. Smart City Odense is a project within Odense Municipality, that seeks to combine urban planning with new technologies and open-data toward creating a smarter, more sustainable city.
This made us aware of necessities essential to Odense and its citizens. She gave us feedback that we integrated into numerous areas of our overall project.
Changeability - From Mrs. Dienhart’s point of view, one of the most advantageous attributes of our device is the potential for changeability in the size and shape of the design. We had yet to consider the PowerLeaf as a device not limited by physical dimensions. This has been the most significant element we took with us from the interview. Changeability is a necessity to a city planner, as various laws and aesthetic considerations need to be taken into account, when altering or creating an urban environment.
Accessibility - She also discussed accessibility with us. The citizen will not use our device unless it is easily accessible. This means that the overall design of the PowerLeaf, regardless of its aesthetics, always needs to be designed with a user in mind. Reflecting on the advice of Mrs. Dienhart, we decided to reevaluate the means of implementation of the PowerLeaf to ensure that the need for accessibility and user-comfort is met.
Essentiality - She supported our notion if the needs for accessibility and changeability are met, the PowerLeaf could help ensure that citizens of Odense use and remain in the public space for a longer amount of time. Something that is valuable, not only to the individual citizen, but also to the community as a whole, as it creates a sense of city cohesion and hence a high quality of city life.
Mrs. Dienhart introduced us to several considerations that shaped large parts of our project. We do not know the needs of every urban area in Odense and consequently, we have aimed to create a device that is changeable to a city in movement such as Odense.
Furthermore, this interview was also a source of inspiration for our ethical and safety thoughts. While we ought to strive for a sustainable tomorrow, we do not necessarily have to provide an exhaustive description of what the future should look like.

Understandability—Definition of technical terms
Newspaper provide less definition of technical terms, since most of the gene-related words are easy to understand. As for iGEM wiki and Magazine, more technical terms appeared and they are more likely to come up with definition or explanation,
Understandability—Alternative language for technical terms
In this section, nearly all technical terms are appeared with an alternative language (mostly English). And the rate is quite high
Attitude analysis
In this section, we discover that nearly all iGEM teams are written their description and overview in a neutral tone. Newspaper and magazine perform equally well. It is worth noted that the rate of negative attitude in newspaper is twice the rate in magazine.
Attitude—Newspaper
We discover that Newspaper shares the highest negative transfer attitude (10%). When we investigate into the contribution of each field. we found that when it comes to social issue and the field of economics, the negative rate goes to 31% in social issue and 23% in economics, market and industry. It is the technology and development that contribute most to positive rate.

In our project IOS-i-GEM, we try to diminish concerns over genetically-engineered entomogenous fungi both from building a plasmid construct, a functional prototype and a pest group size forecasting website. However, several worries arise when comes to the word ‘genetically-engineered’. But why?

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.

When combining the graphs of the samples and the standard dilutions, it is clear that the spectra are uniform. This similarity of the spectra indicates that the cells actually do produce beta-carotene. The graphs also give a qualitative indication of the amount of beta-carotene produced by the MG1655 and the Top10 E. coli cells. The resulting graphs are presented below:
Figure 4: The graph shows the absorbance of beta-carotene in E. coli strains MG1655 and TOP10 at different wavelengths
The graph shows that the beta-carotene production of TOP10 containing pSB1A2 with constitutively active K274210 produces beta-carotene in a concentration just above 5 µM.
The MG1655 containing pSB1A2 with constitutively active K274210 produces beta-carotene in a concentration just above 10 µM.

UT-Tokyo team made a presentation on two of our three projects : “Sudoku” project and “fundamental cure of allergy“ project. Especially on Sudoku, our main project, active discussion was heated with many questions and suggestions from other teams.
After the presentation meeting, we had a social party and made the bond with between teams tight.
Meetup at Tokyo institute of Techonology (Team Meetup in Tokyo)
In addition to meet up at Kyoto, meetup for Tokyo area team was held led by UT-Tokyo. This was because only a few teams in eastern Japan had attended the meetup on 18th August above, because of long distance to Kyoto.
This time, we gathered at Suzukakedai Campus of Tokyo Institute of Technology on 23rd August. All 5 teams in Tokyo area (UT-Tokyo, Chiba, Tokyo-tech, TMU, Tokyo-NoKoGen) attended, owing to close combination between teams and strong concern for project of UT-Tokyo.
In this meeting, the aim of our team was to have a direct discussion and to get familiar with Prof. Daisuke Kiga, the instructor of Tokyo-tech team and most leading synthetic biologist in Japan.
At first in the meeting, attendants were divided in four small groups, in which members from each team explained their projects and discussed together. Moreover, on the very day, two members of iGEM2009 Cambridge (Caitlin Cockerton et al.) visited to meet Prof. Kiga to make a research on the relationship between biotechnology and industry. We had a talk with them about jamboree last year and cultural difference between England and Japan.
After small group discussion, UT-Tokyo team made a full presentation, with requests from other teams and Prof. KIga. This was benefit for both sides, as other teams had long been interested in our Sudoku project. After the presentation, fortunately, Prof. Kiga gave us various advices. An impressive his comment: “I’d be willing to go over to UT-Tokyo from Tokyo-Tech immediately if I could”. It may just be a complement, but at least we got some confidence about our project.

We drew some interesting conclusions from all of the 544 questionnaires. There are three main conclusions:
1. Water pollution is much serious and of concern: 97.06 % respondents think water pollution is widespread (Fig1) and 88.24% of them care about the impact of water pollution on fish, holding that it is urgent and need to be resolved(Fig2). At the same time, as we asked their opinion about the study on the contaminated water and fish,only 0.74% think it’s meaningless and others all consider it to be important to health, environment and manufacture(Fig3). These results show that it is high time to put efforts on these worrying problems which is the goal and meaning of our project.
As we asked people’s opinion on introducing the gene which encodes the protein (or polypeptide) into the microorganism in order to produce the protein (or polypeptide) that can remove heavy metal. Although 66.18% think it’s feasible and encourage us to have a try(Fig4), 90.62% show their concerns to a certain extent(Fig5). So it’s possible for us to promote our device to the public. Meanwhile, since there are still many people who are unfamiliar with biological treatment, it’simportant for us to spread related knowledge to the public.
3. There are 67.83% of the respondents haven’t heard about iGEM before our questionnaire(Fig6). So we still have much work to do to promote the concepts of iGEM, making public learn more about it.
Public Education
We devised some interesting and educational activities. In May 2016, our team paid a visit to the Lanzhou University Affiliated Elementary School. Considering the significant role of microorganism in iGEM, We made a presentation about microorganism.
In the presentation, we taught kids the basic definition of bacteria"
British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#BiobrickConstruction_-_-_TEXT.html,"We have been having issues with having no colonies grow on plates with cells transformed with PCR products ligated into vectors.  One possible cause is the transformation itself.  All of Joe's transformation resulted in a spark.  He had added 5 uL ligated to competent cells.  The high salt concentration may have heavily influenced the sparking.  So, I redid some of the transformations in a smaller volume of ligate.  I transformed Joe's ligated 3:3 dszB, 3:3 dszC, and 3:1 dszB plasmids into EPI300 cells.  Added 0.5 uL ligate to 40 uL competent cells and electroporated them.  The 3:1 dszB cells sparked during electroporation.  The cells were left to recover undisturbed at 37C for an hour before plating 50 uL transformants onto Chlor plates.

June 23
Made competent Pseudomonas putida cells using the Competent Cell Production protocol.
We had trouble getting the cells transformed with the ligated amino acid pathway genes to grow when plated.  We're unsure if the problem lies in the digest, the ligation, or the transformation.  Thus, we decided to redo all these steps.
Re-digested the ""M,"" ""TA,"" ""TB,"" ""TyrA,"" and ""ArgC"" PCR products provided by Jacob.  Made a master mix of 5 uL NEB buffer 2, 0.5 uL BSA, 0.5 uL EcoRI HF, 0.5 uL PstI, and 18.5 uL dH2O.  Incubated each of the mixtures of 4 uL master mix plus 4 uL PCR product in a Thermocycler for ____.
Re-ligated digest of ""M,"" ""TA,"" ""TB,"" ""TyrA,"" and ""ArgC.""  We suspect that it may be the ligase we used that was at fault for the undesired results seen in previous experiments.  So, we decided to add in more ligase and add in ligase from 2 different sources/tubes.  We added 1 uL pSBIC3 EP, 4.0 uL dH2O, 1 uL T4 ligase buffer, and 0.5 uL from each tube of T4 ligase were added to 3 uL of the respective digest products. "

Software
Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

I found that colonies grown from plates were very less (around 1 to 5). There must be something wrong with the assembly. I must run the gel on monday to check the digesion. Also i found that pLacI, pTet and pSB1C3 DNA were getting less hence I must prepare them also on monday.

CRISPR/Cas9
In the last few years, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/
CRISPR
associated protein (Cas) method became a popular application in genetic engineering. This method is based on an adaptive antiviral defense mechanism of prokaryotes (Barrangou et al. 2007). As a part of the bacterial immune system,
CRISPR/Cas
provides protection against foreign DNA through the action of the RNA-guided DNA endonuclease
Cas,
which cleaves the entering viral DNA at a specific point (Qi et al. 2013).
The first
CRISPR-
loci were discovered in 1987 in the E. coli strain K12  (Ishino et al. 1987) and the first description of a
cas
gene and their homologies to DNA-related enzymes appeared in 2002 (Jansen et al. 2002). Since then, more than 9000 research articles have been published about the different
CRISPR/Cas
subtypes and their application in various
CRISPR
based technologies (Adli 2018). The potential applications are almost limitless, ranging from new methods in research to industrial applications as well as human gene therapy. With
CRISPR/Cas,
it is possible to specifically switch off genes in a large number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, to integrate foreign DNA   into the genome of an organism or to use the      DNA-binding property for in vitro experiments (Hsu et al. 2014).
Figure 1: CRISPR/Cas9.
The picture shows the Cas9 assembled with the sgRNA and DNA. The scaffold of the sgRNA is  illustrated in purple and the spacer in blue. The PAM is shown in red.
Due to its simplicity and modularity, the Type II
CRISPR/Cas9
system from Streptococcus pyogenes is a commonly used tool for genetic engineering applications in a variety of organism (Hsu et al. 2014, Charpentier & Marraffini 2014, Doudna & Charpentier 2014). For its RNA-guided silencing of foreign DNA it requires just one
Cas9
encoding gene and the action of the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) as well as the trans-activating
crRNA
(tracrRNA) (Jinek et al. 2012, Gasiunas et"

Mutant transformations screened and liquid cultures taken of successful screens. Another pNPB assay run using only 5 and 10ul of cells between control, induced, uninduced, J23101 and a second control.
Saturday September 22nd
Once again, there is too much background the take good data from our western blots. pNPB assay run using only blanks (no cells) and J23101 only in order to check for reasons of the strangely high degradation seen in blanks from last assay results. This assay showed normal blanks suggesting a one time screw up in the previous assay. Thus, another assay performed using 5 successful mutants, wild type control,J23101 and J23101 supernantant.
We liquid cultured the SDM of the B0034 + Reductase + B0015 to fix the deletion. We also ran a PCR screen on the pSB1C3 and they looked good. We also documented the colonies from the EMS plates and there were enough for the Tecan experiments. We set them aside in the 4 degree room to be used for the Tecan cultures later.

We took the OD of the Strain E-15 EG3 that we liquid cultured on the 21st. There was a spread, but none had reached 0.2 OD, so we let them grow another night. Digestion, Ligation and Transformation done on mutants to change backbone. Another pNPB assay run using cells and supernatant from controls and J23101.
Monday September 24th
We took the OD of each of the Strain E-15 EG3 cultures again and they ranged from 0.08 to 1.5. We washed them in mineral solution and then took the OD again. Then we set up the Tecan to measure which of them have the best growth. We want to be able to see the variation in the Strain E-15 EG3 without any EMS and how the EMS changes the variation in the population. This plate serves as a control for the comparisons. We are also sequencing the B0034 + Reductase + B0015 to see if the SDM worked for the deletion fix. We also began a crude experiment to see if the K206000 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase versus the K206000 + B003"

Future work
To promote MoDeL for wide use as a standard, we need to refine the structure of MoDeL definition and extend its content to enable descriptions of more biological process. In the future, the new version of MoDeL will be proposed and new functions of iGame will be added.
Next version of MoDeL
MoDeL is young, to be exact, just born. There must be a long way before he can stand up and run by himself. At this stage, we have to take extra care of him. Knowing the drawbacks of MoDeL, we have already got a list of improvements waiting to be implemented in the next version of MoDeL. They are:
Enhance MoDeL to support description of intra-molecular reactions.
If it is applied, our software will become a useful tool to study the competition mechanism between intra-molecular and inter-molecular reactions.
More powerful substituents.
Only six kinds of substituents are far from meeting the demands of more accurate modeling and complex reaction mechanism. At present, substituent parts are limited to match only parts on one chain, and they are not allowed to represent a structure with more than one chains and trees. This needs the extension of definition of substituent parts by designing a unified format that can provide enough information.
Enable description of transcription and translation reactions.
Currently, transcription and translation are handled differently with other reactions. It is necessary to modify MoDeL to incorporate description of the two reactions.
Eliminate the inconsistencies.
In the current version of MoDeL, a bunch of inconsistencies exist. For example, the identifiers of compartments follow different restrictions from other global identifiers, and some components’ attributes are required to be a certain value. These problems make MoDeL not so elegant when looking at details. Work must be done to improve its consistency.
Be more independent.
Currently, some of MoDeL syntaxes are defined for specific algorithms of iGaME. Being a language for automatic modeling, cooperation"

Stony_Brook,2017,Team:Stony Brook#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"8 clades had a divergence time less than or equal to 0.04. Furthermore, nearly all class I bacteriocins analyzed belonged to one clade (dark-blue region), with a significantly small divergence time to each other (0.01). The largest divergence time relative to the outgroup (9.79) belonged to the enterocin group (yellow region).
Using this method of clustering-and-research, lacticin Z was determined to be most suitable for hybridization with three other bacteriocins: lacticin Q, epidermicin NI01, and aureocin from the TE8 strain of Staphylococcus. These results provide an evolutionary basis for SDU Denmark’s 2016 iGEM team’s successful hybridization of lacticin Z with lacticin Q, which was the inspiration for our project. Out of the other two bacteriocins, with both having divergence times of 0.04 to lacticin Z, epidermicin NI01 was chosen over aureocin TE8 because of the difficulties of obtaining the TE8 strain.
However, because lacticin Z was also evolutionarily close to a surprisingly large number of other aureocins from different bacterial taxa, and because of aureocin A53’s highly conserved functionality between species, we then decided to choose a second bacteriocin and make a second hybrid. Aureocin A53 from Staphylococcus aureus, which had a relative divergence time of 1.25 to lacticin Z, was chosen as the second bacteriocin.

The construction of a phylogenetic tree can be divided into three steps: sequence selection, multiples sequence alignment, and phylogenetic reconstruction.
Sequence selection involves picking the appropriate bacteriocin sequences to analyze. All 93 bacteriocin sequences were selected under the basis of the availability of literature, representability of a clade, and evolutionary similarities with lacticin Z.
Multiple sequence alignment describes the process of aligning the pool of sequences to identify regions of conserved function and structure. Phylogenetic reconstruction is the process of creating the phylogenetic tree using the model of best fit. Throughout the process, through research and trial-and-error, we chose the algorithm and method (e.g. PAM matrix, maximum likelihood method, JTT model) that best represents our knowledge of bacteriocin hybridization.
Results: Class Composition
Bacteriocins can be divided on the basis of two groups: those produced by gram-negative bacteria (colicins and microcins), and those produced by gram"

Spring workshop itinerary
Three wise men of iGEM
The trip to Tokyo began with a mad dash for the two students attending, Muriel Aldunate and Candice Raeburn, as they rushed to the airport straight from their last exam. As iGEM began in USA and expanded to become an international competition, sometimes the dates and deadlines can be a little tricky for those not following the USA semester structure. Nonetheless the two students arrived at Narita thoroughly exhausted and excited to seek out their instructor, Dr. Leonard Pattenden, who had flown out the day before.  After a couple of “detours” including purchasing the wrong tickets, cockroaches in inconvenient places, nearly being run over and with the help of a friendly convenience store clerk who left work to play navigator, the girls eventually found their way to their accommodation, forgot to take off their shoes, and slumped into bed to slumber the journey away in preparation for the iGEM 2009 Spring workshop.
The next morning saw more disorientation as the group tried to navigate its way around the Tokyo. After walking past their destination and trying to make sense of a plethora of maps, a kind stranger pointed them in the right direction and they finally made it to the Takeda Building – or did they? In the knowledge they would probably get lost (and perhaps among mis-setting of watches) the group left so early they had arrived even before the iGEM organisers, wandering around the grounds until eventually some other lost-looking souls appeared with whom they could coalesce and talk about all things iGEM.
""Synthetic biology is nanotecnology that works"" Tom Knight begins by speaking passionately about the field that stole him away from what could have been a life of straight computer science. Tom and his team from MIT went on to give a little history and background on the roots of Synthetic Biology, the evolution of iGEM and the BioBrick concept. After a quick lunch"

We somehow lost our old mutated DnaE samples, so we went through the process of re-Quikchanging wild-type DnaE (alongside our newly ligated MutL). We also plan to ligate our sequence-verified, mutagenized MutS into ARM, so we set up the digests for that today, will need to ligate tomorrow. We ran more Colony PCRs of the ones that didn’t show any positives from before (see Thursday), and finally got more positives for EmrR and DamR, but still not for DinB (likely we’ll have to . We finished processing/imaging the protein gel we ran yesterday. A link here File:UChicago wk13gel1.tif . Note: the protein gel is inverted so lane labels as listed from yesterday are backwards. The two rows should be identical; they’re just done at different protein concentrations to see which one would image better. We got some plasmids from Walker lab at MIT also today, which we put on nonselective LB plates for recovery. We may need these plasmids for PolB and UmuD’C, but on second thoughts (as you’ll see later), we ended up not actually needing them. We checked Dam and EmrR plates from the mutation rate assay that were plated on Thursday for growth, but there were few/no colonies, so we’ll wait one more day and see what happens as time works its magic.

Ryan S came in for a bit today to do various household chores. Checked plates we restreaked yesterday from glycerol stock to repeat the mutation rate assay, restreaked Walker lab plasmids from yesterday on selective plates (cam for the PolB plasmid and amp for the U"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook-2_-_-_TEXT.html," weekend.
We began PCR experiments to amplify our riboswitch inserts in anticipation of our Gibson Assembly trials. Trials initially showed mixed results, which was perplexing since all PCR trials used the same primers and overhangs, but were confirmed as successful on 0.8% agarose gels by the end of the week. Nanodrop analysis gave the following concentrations of PCR products in the table below.
We also began out first Gibson Assembly experiments with our amplified inserts and linearized plasmid backbone. After this, we used PCR to confirm the presence of our pOPPY_GFP plasmids by using two of our Sanger sequencing primers and running the generated amplicons against a ladder on a 1.5% agarose gel. We also attempted a series of transformations of E. coli using our 5 Gibson Assembly products.
We also sent off our first samples for Sanger sequencing at the UC Berkeley DNA sequencing facility. With results coming in at the end of the week. Our reads indicated that our GFP gene was functional with no detected SNPs that would hinder our experiments.
We did our first yeast miniprep to test the effectiveness of our outlined miniprep procedures. The resulting Nanodrop curve was ragged and lacked the attributes of plasmid DNA. We tried again to miniprep yeast, this time washing the glass beads multiple times to get rid of residual isopropanol. The results were much better: a DNA curve. Still, there was an unknown source of salt contamination in the plasmid sample.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Science#Experiment_-_-_TEXT.html," ligate these into the required pSB1C3 backbone. For BsDyP and ispB asDNA, this proved to be fairly straightforward, and quickly resulted in the production of our first new BioBricks: BBa_K1336003 for BsDyP+pSB1C3, and BBa_K1336005 for ispB+pSB1C3.
This was trickier for 1B6, as this gene possessed 2 illegal PstI restriction sites. Site-directed mutagenesis primers were designed to remove these sites, however, we could not completed this in time for submission. We did, however, succeed in performing a directionless ligation into pSB1C3. From here, we screened for plasmids with the correct orientation, and started our characterisation assays with this pseudo-BioBrick part.
Stage 05: Assembly of BioBrick Devices
We decided to assemble both BsDyP and ispB in a LacI cassette, inducible by IPTG.  Issues with inconclusive antibiotic effectivity led to major delays in construction of these composite parts. We first had to prove our antibiotics were functioning properly before making progress on our project.
We confirmed the construction of our BsDyP and ispB cassettes using analytical gel digest cutting at sites E and P.
Ideally, we wanted a Azo-Remediation Chassis (ARC), our BioBrick System, to be assembled as follows:
A further development on this prototype would be to have Bba_K1336000, the AzoR gene, to be inducibly transcribed by one promoter (say BBa_K314103, the LacI Expression Cassette) such that it is expressed in the reductive step of our azo dye remediation process. This would form a distinct BioBrick Device of ""promotor A + AzoR + double terminator"".
A secondary BioBrick Device (of ""promoter B + gene 2 + double terminator"") would follow this, where gene 2 would be one of our enzymes that function in the oxidative step of the azo dye remediation process, e.g. laccase or one of the dye decolourising peroxidases. A further tertiary BioBrick Device, with another oxidative enzyme would also be ideal. At least 2 oxidative enzymes are proposed as the enzymes are specialised for different substrates (as described in our BioBrick page. As always, time works against us, and we succeeded only in constructing 2 composite parts (BioBrick Devices): BB"

Business time : SWOT Analysis
Using Strengths to take Advantage of Opportunities
The reproducibility of our project and the high quantities of E. coli and Saccharomyces c. are in line with the future demand of vineyards.
Using Strengths to avoid Threats
The Curdlan ecological argue will convince biovineyards to use it. Indeed, we told you before that Bouillie Bordelaise wasn't good for the ground whereas Curdlan hasn't side effect on it.
Overcoming Weaknesses by taking Advantage of Opportunities
The Lack of expertise and our limited synthetic biology knowledge are overcome by our PhD presence.
Minimizing Weaknesses to avoid Threats
Being undergraduate and inexperienced team leaves us in a questionnable position compete against experienced laboratories. Moreover, our no recoil on the project may not be interested laboratories and societies.
iGEM Bordeaux: Contacting vineyards
To try to see the effect that mildew has on wine producers, iGEM Bordeaux contacted numerous castles in the region and attended the two biggest wine assemblies in Bordeaux: La foire au vin and Vinexpo. This allowed us to speak to the producers on how much their production is threatened by oomycetes such as mildew and to see if they would eventually be interested in an alternative preventive solution that would be eco-friendly. At the same time, this allowed us to search for sponsors in the region to raise money for our lab work. Unfortunately, since these assemblies bring together mostly the commercial team who's aim is to land big clients, our sponsoring wasn't successful.

Summary
Funding currently stands as follows:
Ian is being funded directly by BBSRC
Maria has secured personal funding
Biochemistry department has agreed to fund up to 2 students
Biology department has agreed to fund to up 3 students. Obviously there are more than 3 biology students so it will be necessary to consider how this money can be split based on commitment (see actions).
We may consider approaching some commercial sponsors to secure possible expenses for lab work. This needs to be agreed first though.
Stipend will be for 10-12 weeks and it is envisaged that they will start on or after the 1st July.
Project presentations:
Radio Receiver ( Slides ) - Extending the work in a theoretical paper. The physics for the project has not yet been fully thought through meaning it is not yet fully understood the frequency range or power that would be required to cause effect. Initially a wide-band input of varying power could be used but it would be good to single out the major frequencies. To detect a change in conformational state FRET was initially proposed, however, this requires skilled operators which may not be available in Bristol. Instead, a bi-partite GFP was suggested.

VEENAH VENUGOPAL
Currently pursuing her final year in Biotechnology, Veenah loves Biology and all things related, but give her a book full of math problems, you're guaranteed to make her week in knees. For a pretty gentle soul who'd be hard pressed to throw a solid punch in self defense and who's smile is as contagious as the flu, Veenah is weirdly drawn to the most violent of crimes. Because of this though she aspires to own a biotech start up of her own one day, her ideal job would include investigating crime scenes and working in forensic labs. Apart from being hardwired to solve the most difficult of puzzles, Veenah enjoys singing a lot. She was the person in charge of managing the team's accounts.

Being a gifted poet, Sai is one of the most creative people on the team. He’s a passionate biotechnologist, driven by his love for research. Although he may seem naive on the outside, he’s exactly the opposite on the inside and can charm his way out of any situation easily. Sai is always calm and composed and hardly ever gets agitated. His hobbies include playing cricket, reading and singing. He is a curious person by nature and looks forward to learn new lessons from every aspect in life. He is one of the most hard working people we know and was responsible for planning the lab schedules while also working in the lab diligently.

The results presented in figure 7 illustrate the influences of different copper concentrations on the cell extract.
Figure 7: Influence of different copper concentrations on our crude cell extract. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates.
As shown in figure 7 copper has no negative influence on the functionality of our cell extract. Therefore, a relatively stable system for copper sensing is provided.  First tests with specific cell extract and different copper concentrations lead to further tests and normalizations, illustrated in figure 8.
Figure 8: Copper specific cell extract made from E. coli cells which have already expressed the activator before cell extract production. Induction of copper inducible promoter without T7 upstream of the operator site with different copper concentrations. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates.
Figure 9: Copper specific cell extract made from E. coli cells which have already expressed the activator before cell extract production. Induction of copper inducible promoter without T7 in front of the operator site with different copper concentrations. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates. Data are normalized on coppers influence to the cell extract.
In addition,we measured the operator device under the control of T7 promoter as described before.
Fluorescence was normalized to influence of copper on the the cell extract (figure 10 and figure 11).

Compared to the former fluorescence levels the T7 reporter device showed higher levels. Therefore, a reporter device under the control of T7 promoter is more suitable for our CFPS.

Then the real challenge starts - to untie the Gordian knot! We tried to untangle everyone for about 45 minutes before we realized that we had terribly failed. I’m sure it wasn’t our fault though since we were still trained from our castle Monschau event.
After the big defeat our heavy hearts craved some comfort food (we recommend pizza with sauce hollandaise, white asparagus and ham) and we decided on an easier game: Werewolves.
This game is role playing game and takes places in a town in which several unknown werewolves strike terror into its inhabitants hearts by killing  people. Each round the residents are allowed to execute one person in the hope of getting rid of one of the werewolves. With the help of some special characters, we actually did it!
Encouraged by our success we started our last tour for the day into the “Altstadt” of Düsseldorf.  The “Altstadt” of Düsseldorf is widely known for its many bars next to one another which earned it the nickname “longest bar in the world”. What is only known to most residents of Düsseldorf though is a special shot called “Stress”. The name says it all as it is loaded with many hot spices like pepper, tabasco etc and of course we had to introduce it to the team of iGEM Bielefeld.  Thankfully everyone survived.
After this everyone was treated with “Altbier” - an traditional beer brewed in Düsseldorf.
As everyone was tired, we went home and four of the team members set their bed for the night in Carina’s 15 m2 (150 square foot) room. It was crowded to say the least…
But well worth it!
After a successful and fun meeting, the Bielefelder iGEMers were guided to their train in the morning and went back to Bielefeld, probably to catch up on some sleep.

Optimized esp :
We ligated optimized esp with rsaA and two types of promotors: PrsaA and Pxyl. Later we transformed the ligate products into E.coli. Colony PCR showed that we had optimized esp gene alone in pSB1C3 plasmid, opt esp gene with rsaA gene in IDT-SMART Amp plasmid and opt esp behind two promotors in pSB1C3 plasmid. Overnights of E. coli with opt esp+PrsaA/Pxyl containing pSB1C3 plasmids were made and MiniPrep was done to the overnights so that rsaA gene (from gel extract) can be inserted behind optimized esp later. Additionally, optimized esp + rsaA combination were cut off from IDT-SMART plasmid and put into the standardizd pSB1C3 plasmid for sending to the registry as a BioBrick part. RsaA inserting into opt esp+PrsaA and opt esp+Pxyl containing plasmid were both proved by colony PCR to be successful.

Edinburgh,2015,Team:Edinburgh#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," that no live organisms were incorporated in the test.
Avoiding the use of live organisms also allows for a degree of portability, for regulation would have otherwise hindered the implementation in non-laboratory environments, including the environments in which we intend to employ the device (see p&p for more - link to our story). Furthermore, there would be a long and costly legal process to get our biosensor the green light if it were to utilize genetically modified organisms.
The choice of a paper-based biosensor was also fundamental to its ability to compete on the free market, as this reduced the estimated cost to no more than 10 pence per test paper1.
Enzymes or Genes?
In the earliest stages of design, we contemplated using gene networks to operate our detection system; however, our human practices research quickly led us to re-evaluate this decision. Through conversations with our end users, as well as professionals working directly with the users, we quickly learnt that users would be seriously deterred from using the sensor if they were subjected to long waiting-times for results. Thus, it became clear that minimising time-to-detection was a priority for our design, and that using an enzyme system, with its increased speed of detection and stability compared to gene networks, was the best method to meet this criterion.
Producing the Enzymes
In order to decrease the cost of the biosensor, we decided not to purify the enzymes, because this is both a tedious and expensive process. Instead, we will place crude cell lysate on each of the bioactive zones. By transforming the plasmids in the chassis Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), we can increase enzyme production. This is a result of it being a robust and non-pathogenic E. coli B strain able to grow vigorously in minimal media in comparison to the Top10s we completed our cloning in. It is also deficient in ompT and lon; two proteases that could cause problems with protein isolation2.
All protein expression is under the control of the lactose induced expression cassette (BBa_K314103) produced by iGEM10_Washington. This expression cassette includes a LacI generator and a lactose inducible promoter with the Elowitz standard RBS. By putting the lac operon in front of the enzyme coding sequence, we should be able to regulate transcription of the gene via production of the LacI repressor protein. IPTG, an analogue of lactose, can be used to induce protein expression3. Having a repressible promoter is key in situations where the proteins can be toxic to the cells in"

We will help do the autoclaving. Ethidium Bromide is done in only one area of the lab - it is stained into gels after they are run, rather than put into the gel agarose. The reasons for all of Dr Roberts' protocols are completely obvious. (Even if they weren't, we would follow them anyway!)
We will have to provide ALL of our expendables - from gloves, tape, felt-tips, foil for autoclaving, tissue wipes, clips and storage bottles, to all reagents we need for reactions. That means gel agarose, molecular ladder, restriction enzymes, ligase, competent cells, antibiotics, cell culture plates and agar, DNA oligos, primers, dntp's, polymerase, BSA, buffers for PCR and Restriction digestion reactions. We also need to bring over a gel apparatus or two (he has ample power supplies), pipetmen, filter tips, tubes of all sizes, work blocks for holding tubes, chemical jars (orange lids) if we need to mix up own own solutions. Other needs will become apparent as we begin to perform experiments in the Roberts lab.
We do not have to provide our own TAE, TBA or paper towels. These items are cheap enough that Dr Roberts can let us use his. We will not bring ethidium bromide for now. Maybe later.
We may use Dr Roberts' glassware. If you break it, Dr Liz buys it. Please be careful! We have access to PCR machines, rockers, water bath, centrifuges, spinners, cold centrifuge, fridge, freezers (both -20 and -80), microwave, autoclave, and the gel imaging system. The cell culture room is on the 4th floor of Smith and is open all the time for anyone's use.
We may also use the PC's in the lab for lab-related work or checking email. (Please do not update your facebook account on Dr Roberts' PC's!).

Sr Jim Saunders, Director of the MB3 Program, has gotten lengthy wish lists over the last few days from Dr Liz, and he has already provided storage boxes for tubes.

Tianjin University of Science and Technology is a key university in Tianjin, China, which is famous for its excellent fermentation engineering and food engineering subject. Some years ago, some professors and students of TUST decided to set up a iGEM team and participate in the iGEM competition in the future. This summer, a sophomore student and a graduate student from TUST came to Tianjin University and study the basic knowledge about iGEM and synthetic biology and help our experiments in protein modification part. They told us about the enormous difficulty they are facing in team establishing process and we shared our experience and gave several suggestions to them. Before they leaved us, they invited us to give a speech in their school after summer vacation. On September 27th, five members of our team went to Teda campus of TUST and gave a speech about how to set up a iGEM team and what could a iGEMer receive from this competition. Almost all the seats were occupied by listeners. Since the iGEM competition is almost a band new term for most students in TUST, many"

Having learned a lot during this intense and exciting  work, I would now like to share my knowledge and experience  with the members of the next team. I'm sure this collaboration  will be interesting and fruitful for both me and the new iGEMers.

Last year, I participated to the iGEM competition as a student,  this experience was incredibly exciting and instructive.  However, building a project from its imagination to its design,  modeling and achievement at the bench is not an easy task…  That’s why I would like to share my experience and help the  new iGEM team to go as far as they can!

Naturally, I would be glad to contribute my experience in  previous iGEMs to the current team. Besides the science side,  I'm very interested in teaching science with research, and  untraditional mode of scientific research. iGEM is the perfect  model of both of these. From the teaching side, I'm really  excited by the prospect of getting to know and working with  people from different backgrounds. In addition to that, iGEM is  an opportunity where interdisciplinary projects got done by  undergraduate students, which would"

Selama berabad-abad silam, para ahli alkimia percaya akan keberadaan sebuah batu filosofi, yakni sebuah substansi misterius yang tidak hanya bisa mengubah logam biasa menjadi logam berharga seperti emas dan perak, tetapi juga mampu memenuhi keinginan terbesar manusia: untuk bisa awet muda dan hidup abadi.
Meskipun sampai sekarang batu filosofi ini belum juga ditemukan, mitos keberadaan batu ini telah mendorong para ahli alkimia untuk menguji di laboratorium mereka berbagai substansi dan interaksinya, dalam rangka membangun dasar ilmu pengetahuan yang kokoh di bidang kimia, metalurgi, dan farmakologi yang nantinya akan bisa dikembangkan lebih jauh lagi.
Hidup di abad ke-21 yang disebut-sebut sebagai abadnya dunia penelitian ini barangkali sempat membuat keyakinan kita terhadap keberadaan batu filosofi menjadi buyar. Akan tetapi kami, baik sekarang maupun ke depan, tetap akan selalu bersikap optimis dalam pencarian ini, mencari solusi yang tidak hanya bisa menolong seorang individu untuk hidup sehat dan panjang umur, tetapi juga untuk mengatasi masalah lingkungan yang timbul sebagai dampak dari modernisasi. Berbeda dengan zaman dulu, kita percaya bahwa kita sekarang tidak sekedar dalam pencarian sebuah substansi ajaib yang sudah tersedia dan masih tersembunyi di alam. Akan tetapi, hal itu hendaknya kita jadikan inspirasi yang membuat kita mau secara aktif untuk terus-menerus berusaha menciptakan sesuatu yang bisa menjawab tantangan-tantangan yang tengah ada di dalam masyarakat.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer_-_-_TEXT.html," network allows an adequate response to situations of nitrogen limitation.
In the Bacillus subtilis, ammonium assimilation occurs via the glutamine synthetase - glutamate synthase pathway. Bacillus subtilis faces nitrogen- limiting conditions when it consumes glutamate as a prior nitrogen source,   while glutamine is the secondly preferred nitrogen source [3].
Two transcription factors, TnrA and GlnR, and one enzyme, the Glutamine Synthase, are the major players in the B. Subtilis nitrogen regulatory network [3]. We use TnrA transcription factor in our system.
Under nitrogen-limited conditions, TnrA works as an activator and a repressor both. TnrA represses expression of glnRA (Glutamine Synthase) [4], gltAB (Glutamate Synthase) [5] and other genes. Also the form of Glutamine Synthase which is feedback inhibited by excess glutamine, directly interacts with and unbinds from TnrA, thus blocks its DNA-binding activity [6]. Based on all this information, if the amount of NH3 is not sufficient, glutamine synthase will not work properly, glutamine will be produced in a low amount, TnrA will bind to promoter and Toehold production will be repressed. But if there is a sufficient amount of NH3, glutamine will be produced in a high level, TnrA will not repress the promoter as previous and Toehold – Tev Protease will be produced in a high amount.
Figure 3: If there is a sufficient amount of NH3, Toehold and TEV protease will be produced. If there isn’t a sufficient amount of NH3, Toehold and TEV Protease will not be produced.
Seventeen TnrA targets were detected by a combination of DNA microarray hybridization, a genome-wide search for TnrA boxes, and gel retardation assays [7]. The TnrA box consensus delimited in this study to a 17- bp interrupted, inverted repeat sequence, TGTNANAWWWTNTNACA.

Cells were then pelleted via centrifuge at 4000rpm for 10min at 7 Celsius. Supernatant was taken out using pipets and discarded. E coli was then resuspended in 10mL M9+ supplemented with uracil and adenine.
- To the four centrifuge tubes, add 0, 100, 200, and 500 uL of 5-bromodeoxyuridine. The volume of the mutagen should correspond to the label on the test tube. Because 5-bromodeoxyuridine stock is a 10mg/mL aqueous solution, the final mutagen concentration in the five test tubes will be 0, 100, 200, and 500 ug/mL.
- Let the bacterial suspension incubate with mutagen for approximately 1h 45min.
- 30uL of 5.3 phage stock was added to each centrifuge tube. From 5.15 Titer Test on 5.3 T7 new Phage Stock, we know that 5.3 phage stock has 7E8 particle/20uL. Thus, to each of the test tubes, we are adding approximately 1.2E9 particle.
- Incubate phage on shaker at 37C for approximately 30min.
- Liquid culture from the four test tubes is then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes to pellet cell debris. Supernatant containing phage particles is removed and 1mL of chloroform is added destroy any remaining E coli cells.
- The stock solutions are now stored in 4 Celsius.
2) Titer to determine phage concentration (6.14)
- For each mutagenesis, specifically 0, 100, 200, and 500ug/mL, dilution series were performed to generate 0 through -6 dilutions (a total of 28).
- For each dilution, a test tube was assigned to it. To each test tube, 0.75mL of BL21 liquid culture overnight was added and then transfected with 30uL of phage dilution. After 20 minutes of incubation, 7mL of x8 agar was added to each test tube and the content was then plated

DR DAVID ASPINALL AND DR MYRTO ARAPINIS
From the outset of our project we wanted to be able to include some form of encryption in our DNA data storage as this is something we had yet to encounter in the literature. At the start of the summer we met with Dr Aspinall and Dr Arapinis to pitch to them our initial ideas and see what feedback they had. Dr Aspinall is the leader of the Security and Privacy research group in our School of Informatics and also leader of the Cyber Security & Privacy Research Network at the University. Dr Arapinis is a lecturer in the School of Informatics with a research focus on verification of cryptographic protocols, such as verification of security properties and detection of attacks.
Upon explaining our initial ideas for encryption, Dr Aspinall suggested that we look into applying a stream cipher method to our DNA data.
Within the next few days we also met with Dr Arapinis, who agreed with Dr Aspinall that a good encryption system would include a stream cipher. However, at this meeting we pitched to her the Vignere cipher method that we had developed and she told us that if we kept this system our encryption could be hacked very easily. She recommended we look into Stream Cipher: SALSA. To see the full development of our stream cipher, click here .
DR KAMI VANIEA AND DR AGGELOS KIAYIAS
Dr Vaniea is a lecturer in the School of Informatics with a strong research interest in the human factors of security and privacy. Dr Kiayias is an Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, working specifically in cryptography and computer security.
Dr Vaniea agreed that a stream cipher seemed to be the best option for us, but she had a few hesitations about our plans for key exchange. She encouraged us to focus on CIA when developing an encryption system: that is, Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. She also questioned whether encryption was really necessary in our system.
Dr Kiayias had similar feedback for us; in order to apply a cryptographic function to encrypt your information, you first need some sort of threat model that you can use as a starting point"

The HfsF protein translocates the polysaccharide chain linked to the lipid carrier across the inner membrane. The polymerases HfsC and HfsI proteins link the NAG repeat units together. The holdfast polysaccharide is transferred across the outer membrane by HfsA, HfsB and HfsD proteins. Hfa proteins mediate the polysaccharide attachment to the cell.

Synthetic biology requires reliable and repeatable measurement. However, the ability to repeat measurements in different labs has been difficult for different units or different ways may be used in various groups. The InterLab Study is part of the Measurement Committee’s continuing effort to develop a standard measurement procedure for green fluorescent protein (GFP). In order to improve reproducibility, we used plate readers to take measurements of fluorescence and absorbance this year.

Being member of this kind of team is amazing. I always love working together and doing scientific things with team. Mostly these parts attracts me, but also MIT part should not be forgotten! :)) I will work in wetlab and modelling, I guess because I already know something about wetlab and I continue to learn about it during my education, but modelling is a different unexplored area for me and I'm very curious about it. Besides iGEM and science, I really enjoy painting. In fact, I intend to be an artist like Salvador Dali but without moustache :-}) I hope to see you in Boston!

EPF_Lausanne,2013,Team:EPF Lausanne#Nanoparticles_-_-_TEXT.html," could be done is to chemically attach antibodies on the nanoparticles surface, as done with NHS-ester dye (see above). Something similar has been done at the National Taiwan University [3 ].
Cargo transport alternatives :
During our project, two cargo transport strategies emerged: external labeling with a chemically activated cargo that directly reacts with the nanoparticles outer layer, or internal loading during nanoparticles synthesis. Both have their advantages and drawbacks. External loading is quick and can be achieved after synthesis. The release of the cargo only requires the digestion of the outer layer of the nanoparticles. However, the cargo must be chemically activated, i.e should ideally contain free sulfur radicals. Furthermore, with such a layout, the cargo is exposed to the environment. On the other hand, internal loading isolates the cargo. However, we saw that it requires a big protein and the cargo protein encounters denaturation during nanoparticles synthesis. This loading strategy would however still be very efficient for small resistant molecules comparable to FITC: they could be easily loaded after being attached to dextran.
Linking nanoparticles to bacteria :
We decided to chemically attach streptavidin to bacteria (using streptavidin hydrazide) in order to be able to link biotinylated nanoparticles to them. This was done both on simple DH5-alpha cells and GFP-expressing E.coli. Though the cells were dead by the time we visualized them under the microscope, we could show that the nanoparticles indeed bind specifically to the bacteria. This gives a preview of what the final Taxi.Coli device could look like!
Figure 16: GFP-expressing E.coli are carrying CY5-labeled gelatin nanoparticles! The interaction is provided by the biotinylation of the nanoparticles and the chemical streptavidin-labeling of the cells. Though the cells are dead, this is a preview of the future device.
Microfluidics experiment :
We did a microfluidics experiment (MITOMI : Mechanically Induced Trapping Of Molecular Interactions) in order to visualize the nanoparticles digestion by the enzyme MMP2. We had some difficulties making the chip (one button was not working), so that in the end neutravidin was on the surface everywhere, instead of being only present on distinct spots. However, we were still able to see that our biotinylated nanoparticles were binding to neutravidin (Figure 17 A).
Additionally, it seems that the addition of MMP2 (in the first four channels) results in less fluorescence.
The experiment should however be repeated, since we had many problems with the chip."

AcsAB functionality was assayed by inducing AcsAB-containing cells with 0.1% Arabinose in 5mL LB supplied with 1% Glucose and Chloramphenicol. Overnight incubations were set up at 30 °C and 37 °C, and both empty vector controls and un-induced controls were also assayed. Cells were pelleted at 4000rpm for 10 minutes and the supernatant was kept for further analysis. Cells were resuspended in 1xPBS and sonicated for 3 minutes as on/off cycles of 15 seconds. Both the membrane and soluble samples produced after centrifugation were kept for further analysis. Congo Red was then added to the LB, soluble and membrane samples up to a final concentration of 20uM, and no Congo Red samples were also kept for further inspection. Samples were incubated for 2h at static conditions and at room temperature to allow for Congo Red binding. 96-well plates were inoculated for further absorbance measurements at 490nm.

Macquarie_Australia,2016,Team:Macquarie Australia#Singapore_-_-_TEXT.html,". Digests of the Ferrochelatase PCR product target, by the two Cas9 mutants, and the wild type Cas9.
Shown above are the in vitro confirmations of the functional CRISPR/Cas9 from NTU-Singapore. The three Cas9 proteins that were studied in this experiment:  wild type (Wt), 459 mutant (BBa_K2130002) , 462 mutant (BBa_K2130001) . All three were   seen to cut our Ferrochelatase PCR product target, amplified in earlier weeks. This digestion was confirmed against   the negative control without   Cas9, and the commercial Cas9, as the Ferrochelatase  was seen to be accurately cleaved into a 850bp fragment and a 150bp fragment, the lower band of less than 100bp is the excess gRNA duplex. From our efforts, we  have proven that their mutant Cas9 is functional in vitro, providing first evidence for the NTU Singapore team that these 2 mutants are functional nucleases."

Le DVS est composé d’un premier vecteur , tissulaire, de type bactérien, capable d’atteindre un tissu sans être éliminé par le système immunitaire. Et d’un second vecteur , crée par le premier, de type phagique, capable d’atteindre une cellule cible et de s’y internaliser, grâce à des protéines virales exposées à sa capside. Une fois sa cible atteinte, il libère un plasmide thérapeutique qui a une action contre la maladie.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," Conference is a TED-like forum jointly set up by CAS Computer Network Information Center and CAS Science Communication Bureau, inviting elites to share new ideas and discoveries. Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

We should read more paper, find the data we want, do job beyond yourself ,ignore what you will get ,be iGEMers ,be ourselves!      Do faint things meaningful out of people’s sight,      and show excellent job to world in the end. It’s the attitude we should hold, just fighting for it, fighting for you think, you want, just fighting for you future. Let’s do it!
As one iGEMer, I enjoy every single day in my lab and Life Science what owns deep philosophy inside. Synthetic biology can transform our fancy into actual perfect application. Our research could make contribution to society and improve our environmental quality. Besides this, I believe that a man who desire to be more than a normal student in his 20s, who working hard, studying day and night. For myself, I have so many hobbies like photographing, movies and so on.
Someone has said ,a life hit the biggest lucky, in his way of life midway, namely in the prime of life in he found his mission. For me,the real happiness is not how much honor to get, but to find the direction of the line, no doubt igem is part of my way forward. Perhaps the professional knowledge I have learned here is not too much, but I was able to comprehend the true meaning of cooperation and self-learning significance, benefit a lot, it is really a valuable learning experience.
Here is Yupei Yang. I come from Sichuan Province. My major is Software Engineering. I’m fond of coding and thinking and enjoying them all the time. I like exploring the principle which people are accustomed to. In addition, I’m glad to become a iGEMer. I think this summer will be the most meaningful summer during my campus life. Meanwhile, I’m pleased with making a lot new friends and get in touch with synthetic biology. Finally, as Tagore says: let life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves.
For me, iGEM means a responsibility ,  a belief, a memory. Participating in him is not only a competition, but also a process of working together under a team.In this experience, I feel the deep friendship between my teammates. I feel the hard work and the joy of overcoming difficulties. In the future, synthetic biology will be an important thrust in human development.We believe that IGEM brings us happiness and precious experience.

BGU_Israel,2015,Team:BGU Israel#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," drug are promoters – the 'switches' that turn on and off genes. Each cancer have its unique cocktail of promoters activity that allows it to create the proteins needed for its survival and proliferation. Analysing this hyper-activated promoters in each tumor within each patient, and inserting these promoters to our system allow our treatment to be personalized, and therefore effective and specific of every patient.
        Advantages to customers
        A drug that is specific and personalized to patient has a great advantage for both patients and healthcare providers. Patients, of course, are interested in a treatment that is the most effective against their disease and with minimum side effects. Even though such treatment is expected be more expansive than other drugs, governments and healtcare providers also have an interest in such a treatment. An effective and specific cancer treatment will reduce the huge expanses of hospitalization days, palliative treatments, lost of  productivity and death.
        Disadvantages or weak points
        In order to work effectively, our drug requires a systemic delivery into the patient’s cells.  Our drug is composed of three DNA plasmids that are packed in a viral vector for transfection and delivery. The biggest challenge in gene therapy today is a good delivery system with a high transfection rates. Our treatment's dependency on the effectiveness of external components, is a major weak point.
        Long Term Aim of the Business
        Our aim is to revolutionize cancer treatment with a highly specific, effective and personalized therapy.

COLLABORATIONS
This year we participated in two major and six minor collaborations with both high school and university teams. Our largest collaboration component was the publishing of 2 papers in an online peer-review synthetic biology journal called BioTreks.
We also collaborated with the Lethbridge high school team. We worked on an ethical review of their project, as well as provided an insight from the perspective of our faith.
Lethbridge worked with our parts to characterize them. Through this, we helped them answer different ethical and faith  related questions that they had.
For other collaborations different members of our team were interviewed by other teams on how iGEM affected both their education and personal life. We also began mentoring a team from a high school that has just begun their synthetic biology career, shared our research with a team that is over 6,263 miles (10079.32 kilometres) away from us in Taiwan, and participated in many, many surveys.
University of Lethbridge
Our collaboration with the Lethbridge team began in mid-August and consisted of their iGEM team testing our construct, and us conducting an ethical review. Originally we had planned to also test their project but due to the nature of their project (working with blood) we would not have been able to do any relevant testing, because we are working out of a catholic high school.
For the ethical review, we answered in-depth, four main ethical questions and one faith question.  The completed review can be viewed in pdf format by clicking here .  It's a great read and we strongly encourage everyone to take a look at it because it raises some very interesting ideas and considerations.
Once we had completed the ethical review of their project they then conducted tests on our project as they are working out of a university lab and so we hoped that they could perform tasks we were unable to successfully complete. They ran a gel for us and a miniprep since we were struggling to properly miniprep and isolate our plasmids from cultures.  However, due to reasons talked about in the 'Results' page the results from Lethbridge only further confirmed a synthesis error.
Two weeks before the jamboree (October 13th) we discovered why were having so many issues transforming, cloning, and miniprepping. "

Tsinghua-A,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," However, we failed to choose an orthogonal gene circuit from our results. We can just determine the circuit of warrior II and what AHL warrior I should secrete, as is shown below:
Fig.4 Gene circuit designed from the results
    We cannot design a warrior I that can be killed by warrior II but not killed by itself regardless of whatever receptor-promoter we put inside warrior I.    (More details can be seen at Orthogonality test )
V Killing test
    Because we use RFP to indicate the level of LacI inside the cell during Orthogonality test, we are not sure if the results will be the same when we use a complete circuit. Therefore, we designed two warriors and beggars as below to verify results got from Orthogonality test.
Fig.5 Gene circuit designed for killing test to verify Orthogonality test.
    According to results of Orthogonality test, the warrior I will be killed by itself when it is cultivated without warrior II. Furthermore, warrior II doesn’t kill itself but can kill E.coli from the other side successfully. All results we got here are consistent with our Orthogonality test! They greatly enhance the reliability of our previous data. (Fig.6)
Fig.6 Killing test results
More details can be found at Killing test
VI Improved orthogonal gene circuit
    The problem now becomes how to block warrior I’s response to C4HSL secreted by himself. Our model tells us if we design the warrior I as below (Fig.7), we can make it only be killed by warrior II by just regulating the RBS of TetR to an appropriate intensity.
Fig.7 Improved gene circuit. The one on the top is warrior I while the one below is warrior II.
See more details at Design of characters
    Results are shown below:
Fig.8 Performance of improved gene circuit
See more information at Improved gene circuit
VII Regulation of killing ability
    Sometimes, to mimic the situation we investigate in real world, it may be necessary to regulate killing ability to an appropriate level, like making two warriors have the same killing ability. What can we do to regulate the killing ability of warriors? Our model suggests that it is possible to regulate the killing ability of the two warriors by just changing the promoter intensity of some proteins! (Fig.9)

Biosensor design
    Our biosensors using as chassis Escherichia coli K12 and Lactobacillus lactis Nis+ are based on two modules, which show differences to the works previously reported (Hwan et al., 2013; Saeidi et al., 2011).  The first module has the genetic elements for the production of the protein LasR. This biomolecule is the sensor protein which binds to the homoserine lactone and activates the second module. This module has two devices, the alginate lyase gene and an antimicrobial peptide microcin or nisin.The use of microcin or lisin depends on whether E. coli or L. lactis are used as chassis, respectively (Figures 1 and  2, section PROJECT->DESIGN). The alginate lyase will destroy the Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm mainly made of alginate, and the bacteriocins or antimicrobial peptides will kill the pathogenic bacteria (Tielen et al., 2013; Saeidi et al., 2011). We selected the microcin gene to be expressed in E. coli, as this bacteriocin is produced by a probiotic E. coli G3/10 (Zschüttig et al., 2012) and also because it was available in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts  (Bba_K565004). In addition, although nisin, a bacteriocin produced by L. lactis has been reported in some studies that does not have effect on Gram negative bacteria, e.g. P. aeruginosa, Giacommetti et al. (1996) found that a high concentration of this antimicrobial, has an effect on P. aeruginosa viability. We decided to test the possibility that increasing the concentration of nisin in L. lactis Nis+, might have an effect on P. aeruginosa. It is important to indicate that although we might have positive results, the use of nisin in a biopatch should be analyzed carefully, mainly because nisin is accepted"

Description:
Contrary to popular belief, my full first name is just Max. I enjoy a variety of things such as model building, tennis and golf, but my number one passion would probably have to be eating. Eating is an art and I really love sitting down and taking my time to enjoy a meal.
In all seriousness, I really do love synthetic biology. The applications are endless and it can potentially solve our current world problems such as pollution, disease and provide renewable energy. If natural selection can achieve all of what is on Earth today, imagine what we can accomplish once we completely harness the power of genome manipulation. Like many of my teammates, I am on the pre-med grind and see myself continuing the struggle for the foreseeable future. This bio is getting long so I’ll cut it off here… if you’d like to know more, I take sandwich donations and I’d be happy to sit by a campfire and tell my life story.

Because we use phages in our projct, it could cause some safety problems if phages remain in environment. So we decided to use helper phage and phagemid for phage display, this will solve these problems because those phages cannot have next generation.

We improve the function of BBa_K1218011  from 2013 Stanford-Brown .
Cooperation with NCTU-Formosa Team on  modeling. We provide the data to NCTU-Formosa Team then they make the model for  us.
In  our project, we still need antibiotics to reduce the amount of bacteria. So we  come up with an idea : use 16S rRNA as CIRSPR's target to avoid co-effect of  antibiotic use. We have put it in our future work.

2. Purification of water
A. Description
The other aim of our project is to wipe V. cholerae out of water. The system has to produce antimicrobial peptides when water is contaminated with V. cholerae, i.e. when water contains amounts of microorganisms superior to the minimum toxic concentration (about 104 cells in one dose of water1). The AMPs used for the project have a broad spectrum of action against microorganisms, but they are particularly efficient against V. cholerae (Leucrocine I : MIC = 0.156 µg/mL3 (>52µg/mL4); D-NY15: MIC = 27 µg/mL4; cOT2: MIC = 29.22 µg/mL5). The goal is to produce these peptides until V. cholerae is wiped out so that water becomes drinkable or usable without danger.
B. Constraints
The AMPs have to be correctly synthesized and secreted.
They must be stable enough to keep their activities in muddy water for example.
The AMPs must properly diffuse to target bacteria.
Several factors have to be taken into account: temperature in affected countries (around 40°C /104°F), the viscosity of water, its pH, etc.
C. Priority
Purification of water contaminated with V. cholerae is the central part of our project: the priority is high. Without it,  which is the first goal of the project, the contract won’t be reached.
II. Technical specifications
1. Safety
A. Ingestion of the GMMs
The exchanges of molecules between the contaminated water and the compartment containing GMMs and producing the AMPs must be efficient but the GMMs must not go into water.  For the detection system, the CAI-1 molecule of the V. cholerae quorum sensing mechanism must diffuse from contaminated water to the compartment containing the detecting bacteria V. harveyi. For the purification system the AMPs produced by P. pastoris must diffuse from the compartment containing the GMMs to the contaminated water. However, class I GMMs must be kept out of the purified water.
B. Spreading of the GMMs
GMMs must not be spread in the environment. The compartment containing them must be impact- and break-resistant. People have to be aware that GMMs should not be disseminated in the"

Figure 3: Representation of the population’s high concerns about the future due to the pollution caused by fossil fuels’ abundant use.
Figure 4: The answers to “I would prefer using eco-friendly fuels although they may be higher in cost.”.
In our country, where lignocellulosic biomass is extremely abundant due to agriculture, we found out that a large number of people such as 92% weren’t aware that something called biomass energy exists and again another 75% didn’t know what bioethanol is. Thus, this data led us to widen our HP works to raise awareness of the public and gave us the idea of celebrating Biofuels Day in a park in the later processes of our project, because we wanted people to know that our country could benefit from such an energy type.
Figure 5: Representation of Turkish people’s knowledge on renewable energy sources.
Figure 6: Figure showing that 75% of the attendees in Turkey don’t know about bioethanol.
The chart below, obtained from our survey, shows how high the awareness is of Turkish people on energy dependence of our country since the largest amount of people answered right with choosing 70%-80%. Another indication of that fact is seen in our data which shows only a total of 11% thinks that our dependence rate is under 50%. This data indicates that the public would be more than willing to make adjustments in their lives, such as changing the fuel they use in their cars in order to decrease the burden on our shoulders and boost our economy.
Figure 7: Demonstration of Turkish people’s ideas on energy dependence.
We saw that 66% of people we surveyed had no idea that diesel cars can run on biodiesel and gasoline cars can run on bioethanol. They also didn’t know that the fuel on the market is compulsorily blended with varying percentages of ethanol. This again pushed us to the conclusion that people needed to realize those facts to make a change, thus, we intended to organize more human practice events to increase awareness.

Figure 9: The visualization of the answers to “I know that the fuel I buy is compulsorily blended with a certain percentage of biofuels.”.
Conclusion:
As we’ve obtained and analyzed all data that was compiled at the end of our survey, we came to the conclusion that fossil"
