Edinburgh,2009,Team:Edinburgh#mapxmllebanon_-_-_TEXT.html,"2007, Landmine Monitor identified at least 130 new mine/ERW casualties in Lebanon, of whom 37 were killed and 93 injured. LMAC recorded 69 of these casualties, MACC SL 70 and the Landmine Resource Center (LMRC) 69; 64 of the casualties recorded by MACC SL and LMAC were identical. Only 36 of the casualties were recorded in all three databases; in particular, information on military casualties was lacking. Landmine Monitor analysis of media articles identified an additional 27 casualties not recorded in any of the databases (13 LAF, seven foreign troops, two deminers, and five civilians).
The most common activity recorded was clearance (30), including at least eight LAF soldiers, seven MAG staff, six UNIFIL troops, four BACTEC staff, and one each for FSD, ArmorGroup, and SRSA (no details available for the two others). Ten of the clearance casualties were foreign (from Belgium, China, France, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Zimbabwe). Other foreign casualties were 10 Palestinian civilians (seven in Nahr al-Bared refugee camp) and seven Spanish UN forces.
Civilians were usually carrying out livelihood activities such as farming, herding, burning weeds, and collecting wood (28% of civilian casualties), or tampering (19% of civilian casualties), mostly by males (17). While shepherds were considered to be most at risk by LMAC, both UNDP and MACC SL stated that most people were involved in tampering, although this is not necessarily recorded as such.

As a student of philosophy I have taken on the job to take a closer look at the ethics concerning synthetic biology and the extremely important enlightenment of the broader public. I applied to iGEM because of the challenges along the way, the new acquaintances with equally curious people as myself, and last but not least the professional experience.

I am studying Biochemistry and Molecular Biology on my 5th semester. Participating in the iGEM competition has been very rewarding in all sorts of levels. Both when it comes to lab experience, but also with regard to how to work on a team project. The dry-lab has been my area of responsibility. I have always liked exploring everything in depth, so keeping track of sequences, designing constructs and having a theoretical overview of the project has come naturally to me. To transfer theory into practice is a passion of mine so it has been difficult to restrain myself from the wet-lab. For this reason I ended up spending many hours in the wet-lab too.

My motivation for participating in iGEM was to get a lot of experience in the wet-lab (which I have gotten) and to get a summer that was not like any other.  There has been many late nights working in the lab followed by cheap red vine and foosball, which has made this iGEM-summer awesome!

Substitute the expression in the integral ,we have:
That is the density of electrons in standard crystal.
Similarly, we can derive the concentration of holes in valence band as a function of Ef:
Let's consider about the situation that the semiconductor material keep electrical neutrality ,so we have :n=p
Substitute the expression for Nc and Nv ,we have:
Now Ef is called intrinsic Fermi level, it is proportion to the temperature where the semiconductor locates.
So we can derive the intrinsic carrier density：
We have to notice that the function is very simplified because we consider the CdS as the ideal crystal, neglect impurity and flaws, though inevitable in fact.
Band Gap:
Band Gap in quantum mechanics plays an important role to describe the circumstance when quantum leaping. Larger the gap is, harder the electron transit to the high energy band, making it be a carrier of electricity .It can be tested indirectly with Absorption spectrum.
Absorption spectrum can be measured in experiment and we can derive absorbance index α by:
T : material transmission of light with different wave length
d : the thickness of sample.
Thus we can get a curve of α as a function of wave length λ. To calculate the band gap of CdS we use, we can use the relationship between absorbance index and band gap:
We can get a diagram with axes (αhν)2 and hν from the experiment, deriving intercept on x axis by plotting a straight line that is tangent to the raising part of the curve[2]:
Fig. 3 | The curve of (αhν)2 and hν
Now we know the band gap in CdS attached to Shewanella is 2.51eV
(Relation of α and hν are not sufficient consistently because under 2.51eV, electrons don't have enough energy to transit .Beyond 2.84eV, situation become more intrinsic because we have to consider about both direct absorption and indirect absorption.)
Practice and Improvement:
According to the literature, CdS Nc is 0.224e+19/cm3 and Nv is 2.5e+19/cm3,[1] which is all measured under room temperature. The final intrinsic electron density of CdS on the surface of cell membrane is 5.6e-3/cm3, which is too small when compared to other semiconductor material (in room temperature, 1 atm):
We hope for more free intrinsic electrons in our material because that'll largely increase the"

Abstract
Here, we demonstrate that we made a functional prototype of our co-spun silk with natural B.mori silk and the sfGFP co-spinning module. Our resulting fiber had very strong fluorescent properties, but very weak mechanical properties. In the coming weeks, we will incorporate stretching processes that will greatly enhance the material strength of these fibers.
Introduction
To create functionalized fibers, we co-spun the GFP co-spinning module with native Bombyx mori silk. The GFP co-spinning module was designed such that the N and C termini have affinity to B.mori silk, allowing it to bind to the native silk upon spinning.
Methods for co-spinning silk with the GFP co-spinning module
In brief, we followed the standard process as highlighted in the literature [1] to produce a concentrated aqueous solution, or dope, of commercially purchased b.mori silk. We then added aqueous GFP co-spinning module to the concentrated b.mori dope so that the final solution had 750 grams of b.mori silk to 1 gram of GFP co-spinning module. We then extruded this dope into a coagulation bath of 90% v/v isopropanol and water and collected the resulting fiber on a godet. Detailed steps are as follows:
Degumming
Silk is comprised of two main proteins, fibroin and sericin. Fibroin is the structural protein of the silk and our protein of interest. Sericin serves as the ‘glue’ of the silk. Degumming separates and removes sericin and is an essential preparation step before dissolving the silk. We found that commercially degummed silk was not properly degummed for our purposes and this step had to be carried out in-lab.
To degum, we boiled 2.5 grams of B.mori silk in 0.02M sodium carbonate solution for 30 minutes.
Solubilization
The resilience of silk to many different solvents is well known. In order to dissolve silk, we used lithium"

Students learn best when they are able to relate what they learned in the class to a hands on experience. Thus, laboratory experiments are ideal for establishing and building upon foundational knowledge.  However, our lab cannot invite or visit all 29,000 students in our own district. As the Standards of Learnings are updated and more teachers begin incorporating synthetic biology into their classrooms, we are working to support them with the help of corporate partnerships.
This year, we connected with Jennifer Daugherty, the Regional Sales Manager for Maryland and Virginia, with Thermofisher Scientific to create a large scale program. The goal of this initiative is to improve student access to hands on synthetic biology experiences. We are currently working with Thermofisher and our community partners to create a program that will have the largest possible impact on the most students. Some program options create protective equipment kits including gloves, goggles, aprons etc. which would be distributed to students around the district. The other two programs connect researchers and iGEM members with students for a day of hands on experiences and challenges. The potential programs are outlined in this presentation .
We are in the early phases of this partnership, but the development of this program will benefit both the students who receive educational support, and the employees who have the opportunity to enjoy a day with science students in their community.

The part's codon usage is optimized for expression in lactobacilli. The codon usage of this part was optimized to balance DNA synthesis and expression in L. Johnsonii. Therefore, longterm and shortterm repeats had to be modified and biobrick restriction sites were removed. The part was modified for RFC10 at the prefix and suffix of the part.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," α-hemolysin into the liposome membrane will increase the fluorescence of the outer solution to a much greater degree, as the calcein molecules can now leave the liposomes via the α-hemolysin pore.
To test this hypothesis, we prepared two sets of liposomes. Lipid composition of liposomes was composed of DOPC and Cholesterol (cholesterol is necessary for the integration of α-hemolysin). Both sets of liposomes were prepared from the same batch microfluidic experiment. The same volume of liposomes was transferred into a solution with α-hemolysin and to an identical solution without the protein. Plate-reader measurements of fluorescence were then recorded, and results analyzed. As expected, in the absence of α-hemolysin (control), some background fluorescence was observed. However, in the solution where α-hemolysin was included, the measured fluorescence was significantly stronger (p < 0.0001 Fig. 10b) compared to the control group. That confirms the successful integration of α-hemolysin pore into the liposome membrane, explaining the increased fluorescence of the measured outer solution.
Fig. 10 a concentrated calcein encapsulated within liposomes: the outer solution fluoresces as some of the liposomes                                 inevitably burst releasing calcein into the outside; b box plot comparison of the control (without α-hemolysin) and                                 a group with inserted α-hemolysin; nonparametrical Mann-Whitney U test was used for the statistical evaluation:                                 the group with α-hemolysin shows statistically significant (p < 0.0001) increase in fluorescence

I've decided to join the HSHL 2018 iGEM team because I have a great interest in the project's topic and enjoy teamwork. Furthermore, I hope to gain a lot of practical experience in the lab. Boston's long and fascinating history and the beautiful location on the east coast intrigues me. I'd like to visit the Boston Harbor, too, and I'm looking forward to experiencing the city's atmosphere.

Edinburgh_OG,2018,Team:Edinburgh OG#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," contributor to restoring available NADH. From this, we surmise that redox may become a main bottleneck in PHA biosynthesis as phaB reductase enzyme will heavily depend on these conditions.
Additionally, overexpression of enzymes such as succinyl-CoA synthase may not favor PHA biosynthesis. Because PHA production does not favor the survival of the cell, it may prioritize other pathways to ensure maximal growth. Thus, the overexpression of the enzyme may in fact have the reverse effect as the reaction is reversible. Originally, increase in the enzyme activity was attempted using the COBRA Toolbox but showed no apparent differences from a native WT scenario. Thus, we decided to observe what changes would occur were the enzyme to be grossly deleted (representing a gene knockout).
In silico flux distribution of E. coli metabolism under sucCD deletion
Mapping out the redistributed flux showed that in order to promote growth, the cell would attempt to channel material through the glyoxylate cycle instead of the now incomplete TCA cycle. Of course, this would not be favorable as it would compromise on the production of GTP for energy. We were quite surprised to note that the reduction in the growth rate was less than 1%.
However, this turned out not to be the case when we grew various strains overexpressing sucAB (SC2) and sucCD (SC3). In fact, the growth of the strains were compromised when the TCA enzymes were overexpressed (seen in the plot).  With the presented data, we cannot yet discern between whether or not this impeded growth is due to the increased activity of the enzymes or the metabolic burden introduced by the plasmid. To investigate further, we should also test the capacity of the various strains to utilize propionate or the ability to synthesize higher titers of PHBV.

IIT_Kharagpur,2015,Team:IIT Kharagpur#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," year   batch, took the initiative. During their summer interns in various universities across the globe,   they  had  come  across  iGEM  teams  operating  in  the  respective  institutions.  Gradually,  they   came  to  know  about  iGEM  in  greater  detail  and  the  opportunity  we  had  as  a  commendable   participant  in  the  competition.  On  their  return  to  Kharagpur,  they  called  in  all  the  interested   students  from  the  third  and  fourth  year  batches  and  held  regular  meetings  to  discuss  about   iGEM  and  explain  its  significance.  Students,  who  had  poor  background  on  synthetic  biology   were given articles to read so that they cleared their funda. Finally, after a few weeks, towards   the  end  of  January,  we  had  a  fairly  motivated  team  ready  to  brainstorm  ideas  for  the  much   coveted competition.
Formulation & finalization of idea
For facilitating the idea formulation process, the entire team of third years and fourth years was   divided into five sub­teams, each composed of 1­2 fourth years and 2­3 third years. Each team   was allotted the task of going through literature and coming up with new ideas that could act as   potential bases for our iGEM project. Each team used to discuss independently, meet frequently   in the library, and prepare presentations on the idea that they thought upon. As the exams were   approaching and the deadlines were less than 2 weeks, the teams had to go through a really   rough patch. Some members were not able to come regularly due to some urgent problems and   the other members used to take up their job and do it religiously. It was real teamwork at display   then. On the day of the idea discussions, each team presented their idea before the fifth years and   other teams. It was subjected to rigorous scrutiny and a torrent of questions basing on which the   ideas were evaluated. Out of the five ideas, two ideas were eventually shortlisted and the entire   team  was  now  re­grouped  into  two  sub­teams  working  independently  on  the  two  ideas.  The   existing  knowledge  from  the  previous  level  was  augmented  with  in­depth  book"

Poor transfection efficiency for tri-color experiment  after transfection efficiency of almost 100% on previous Hef1A:rtTA3, TRE:Gal4-VP16, UAS:mKate  experiment (see [iGEM2011:TRE.GAL4 UAS Activation]). Also it looks like the UAS is leaky because even the control without rtTA had some background red. Did sequencing of eighteen samples and restriction mapped AVPR2 and other constructs. Transformed three AVPR2-TEVs-GV16 Golden Gate attempts, all of which yielded 50\+ colonies within 10 hours, and  plated an additional LR attempt with pDisplay-Vasopressin. Expression vector propagation. Ran FACS on the tricolor experiment, Notch Delta experiment, and Gal4 experiments. Data looks somewhat consistent with expectations but nowhere near ideal.

- Ethical considerations about our project
Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) are at the heart of a long-term debate on the use of biotechnology in day-life applications. Synthetic biology is also setting off strong opposing reactions and not only because of the use of GMOs. Often being questioned  about the fact that “researchers play God by modifying living beings”, and the prevailing societal distrust, we naturally developed a reflection about the possible limits to give to our project.
General Considerations
General Public:
Formerly, the field of biology matched its greek definition: bios meaning life and logos, study, biology was indeed the study of life and living beings. This has changed in the recent years since biology today does not describe life, but rather tries to rebuild some of its important functions.
This evolution induced a certain fear in societies marked by an historical creationism springing from monotheistic religions. In these societies, living beings are held to be untouchable, it is thus necessary to comprehensively explain what synthetic biology is, what our project is, as well as what experiments we are conducting in the lab in order to give clues and keys to people having no background in this field so that we can start to have a discussion with them. Indeed, since most people have a vague or no idea of what synthetic biology covers, they tend to be negatively prejudiced towards the unknown. As scientists, we have to take these fears into consideration and address them as best we can.
We therefore must question our vision of Science itself. Science cannot assume that the regulation and policies of Research has to be made by scientists only, rather it is its duty to communicate the results of the research"

Today, we took the results of the isothermal assembly from yesterday and did chemical transformation to introduce the plasmids into the Top 10 ChemComp bacteria, using our protocol for chemical transformations . They were left to recover for approximately 1.5 hours. We plated 2 dilutions, 10 ul and 50 ul, and left them overnight at 37* in the incubator.
Team Wolfe
Yesterday's lambda red plate had several large colonies--but so did the negative control plate. We will go ahead and do a PCR of the 1529620 locus (as previously described) on 12 of the colonies in case one of them happens to have the insert. The colonies were also grown up simultaneously in LB+kan.
Results: all of the colonies were cheaters
1529620 locus PCR 7/22/11
1529620 locus PCR part 2 7/22/11
In case these colonies do not have the insert, as we suspect, we will repeat lambda red with the thio kan-ZFB-wp-his3-ura3 insert
1mL culture for each condition, 210 ng DNA
time constant for thio insert sample was 5.0

Final Product Design
Thinking about out final product, we decided that for long term product use and transport, it would be best to have the bacteria, and the media, in dry form, activated by adding liquid. We previously looked into anhydrobiotics which, while not feasible for us in the short span of the iGEM competition, would nevertheless be a viable way of storing and transporting the bacteria. In order to test whether the media could also be used in this way we added 2.5g of E. coli FastMedia (TM) from InvivoGen to 250ml of cold sterilised water, added bacteria and left at 37 degrees in a shaking incubator overnight.

Experiment 4:
In search of potential enzymes that degrade catechu!
Literature survey and screening of various enzymes that break bonds in molecules having similar structures as that of components of catechu!
Learn More
After having the sequencing results in hand we did a thorough literature survey to find out the potential enzymes present in the isolates which could degrade components of catechu. We used softwares like BRENDA, PUBMED, UNIPROT to obtain relevant information.  The major candidates from our literature survey were tannases and catechol dioxygenases.
On these grounds we also looked at various team wikis from past years in search for similar projects. We found that Team Paris-Bettencourt has worked with catechol dioxygenases. We got in touch with them and they sent us their cloned enzymes [catechol-1,2-dioxygenase (CatA) and catechol-2,3-dioxygenase(XylE)] which we could successfully transform into DH5alpha cells. We tested these transformants on catechu and slaked lime media and the results were flabbergasting.
A distinct zone of clearance was observed around the streaks and spots of the growing culture on the catechu and slaked lime solid medium. Hence, we decided to proceed with these cultures as well our natural isolates.

Wu Zishan and Shen Liuxing will prepare the lecture and posters which will be used in our planned tours to a couple of high schools in Shenzhen. We are going to introduce synthetic biology and our project to them. Chen Yao and Qie Boyu will optimize our program and finish our web page.
Week 3
9.16.2012-9.22.2012
9.17.2012
After all the material we bought arrived, we started our lab work again in our school. It’s a hard work to develop our own laboratory. But we had fun at the same time.
We did a digest and amplify GFP & RFP with PCR.
9.18.2012-9.20.2012
We visited 3 high schools and gave presentations to their students on synthetic biology and our IGEM projects. There are many students being interested in biology and some of them would like to join this competition. We think our major goal has been achieved. We also did a ligation to connect GFP, RFP and the plasmid together. Then we did a transformation.
9.21.2012
Today’s morning, we saw that control group almost exist only few of bacterial colony and the experimental group grow lots of colonies. I think it is a positive suggest. So we did a colony PCR to test whether the ligation is successful. We picked up 10 colonies to test and three of them is positive ligated by three parts and all the colonies are positive ligated by two parts.
9.22.2012
We picked up those colonies which are positive.  Through the bacterium culture in shake-flask more than 12 hours, we can do plasmid miniprep.
We also started to record our open classes.
Because the deadline of wiki is coming so almost every team members are busy in writing their parts.
Week 4
9.23.2012-9.27.2012
This is the last week to edit our wiki, so does our project. So our team members spared no efforts to accomplish the work. Thankfully, we finished our work before the deadline.

Cell Lysis and Protein Extraction of MaSP2 9-mer and 12-mer constructs from BL21(DE3) cells
Followed using the protocol from Teule, et. al. 2012.
Lysis resulted in an extremely thick and viscous supernatant, with a clear yellow/tan color.  Initial addition of deoxycholic acid to the cells seems very extreme; 1.5g/g of cells in lysis buffer.  Results in a very thick paste forming; not quite sure if the membrane proteins are truly precipitating.
Additionally, a white, film/fibre like substance formed a layer on top of the lysate.  Not quite sure exactly what this debris may be, but will run on an SDS PAGe gel tomorrow to analyze debris content.
Pellet saved after supernatant formation  is viscous and snot like in nature; may possible be genomic DNA.  Residual genomic DNA in the sample must be digested using DNase (3 uL total), to remove DNA from the solution before IMAC purification."

This year we designed the genome sequence of MitoCRAFT and initially verified the de novo synthesis of this genomic    DNA. Due to the cumbersome and synthetic difficulty of the synthesis of this genome, we have not yet converted and    functionally verified MitoCRAFT, the real application of MitoCRAFT still remaining a long way to go. Although this    year's competition is coming to an end, the pace of our exploration of the limits of life shall never stop. We have    been deeply enchanted by the MitoCRAFT project and pledge to continue to complete the testing and optimization of    MitoCRAFT after the competition.
The following are our detailed plans:
1. Transformation of the MitoCRAFT genome
The transformation of mitochondrial DNA has been a focused scientific problem in academic research. Our consultant,    Professor Gu Zhenglong from Cornell University, has also been exploring efficient methods of mitochondrial genome    delivery. In the light with their current experimental results, it can be known that they have achieved efficient    transformation of the mitochondrial large genome (150 kbp) based on the gene gun method, which is indeed good news    for us. Prof. Gu has agreed with us that after the completion of our genome sequencing, he will assist us in    transforming the MitoCRAFT genome.
2. Functional verification of MitoZero
According to our goal, MitoZero is supposed to have normal transcriptional translation function and maintain a    certain aerobic respiration. We will use the characteristics of S. cerevisiae Rho0 cells (missing mtDNA) that they    cannot grow in a medium containing a non-reducing carbon source to screen for Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing    MitoCRAFT that can maintain aerobic respiration.
If we can access effective cloning, we will draw on Dr. Xue Xiaoli, who have successfully achieved the fusion of 16    chromosome genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae into one this year [1], to measure the changes in the relevant    metabolomics and transcriptomics parameters of this S. cerevisiae.

The Theater Project: Re-Engineering Life
Where does life begin? Do we feel like working with living creatures when handling bacterial cell cultures? Where is the difference between natural and artificial?
These were only some of the questions we were faced with when agreeing to contribute to the Freiburg participation in an Europe-wide theater project in the framework of SYNENERGENE called “Re-engineering life or Do we want to be unlimited”. The aim of this european initiative was to initiate a discussion about the rise of synthetic biology with its risks and benefits and accompany the development from an artistic perspective. The project was organized by a group of humanities' students collaborating with directors and researchers from the University of Freiburg and the Theatre of Freiburg.
New Aspects of All Day Work
At first, four members of our iGEM Team took part in a discussion with the participants of the project. We were really surprised to get to know a group of students which was not only interested in scientific facts and in our participation in iGEM but also in our personal attitude towards ethical implications of science. It was interesting to see two groups of people from totally different backgrounds coming together and exchanging their thoughts. Questions from a philosophic point of view were answered in the context of science what led to amazing conversations. All of us tried to find a common language, no matter what background we were coming from, humanities or natural science. This was extremely exciting and and offered everyone the possibility to get new perspectives. The concern that we would be confronted with deep distrust towards synthetic biology soon vanished and we were able to have an open discussion with the other students instead. In fact, we were astonished of how much they wanted to know about the science of synthetic biology.
Communicating Science"
Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," six of us took a train-ride to Hannover, which is roughly 3 hours away from Duesseldorf.
Right at the entrance we met some good friends: the iGEM Bielefeld was also attending! We had a nice chat with them and then delved into the fair.
The fair-grounds consisted of an enormous hall where every company attending had a booth. Zymo research, molecular devices and sigma centrifuges were big eye-catchers but there were so many others that we immediately realized we would have a hard time talking to everyone. We tried anyway!
Going around and looking at the new and exciting ideas everyone offered was wonderful! Attending the fair also provided us with the opportunity to personally talk to many of the companies’ representatives.
Among others we talked to people from Sigma, who are experts in centrifuge-design. They were happy to provide us with our own centrifuge, which has been an invaluable addition to our laboratory setup! We also had the opportunity to meet up with Maike Wirth, who is the Molecular Devices Sales supervisor for Germany and Austria. They lent us a plate-reader which we desperately needed for many of our subprojects!
Next, we got together with Socorex, who excel at fabricating pipettes. They let us test some of their products, which have been used to pipette substantial amounts of liquid.
Zymo research was another company we were very happy to meet. They are now one of our most important sponsors, providing us with wonderful products such as DNA-purification and Gel clean-up systems.
While there were many companies who knew about iGEM, there were also some who had never heard of the competition before! We therefore made a point of informing everyone we could in order to further increase iGEM's reach.
At the end of the day we went home feeling exhausted but full of accomplishments. The ride home took much longer than before but still we all agree that it was a worthwhile trip!"

UC_Chile,2012,Team:UC Chile#Bactomithril#notepad_-_-_TEXT.html," after the vacations of February. We discussed our scheduling and divided ourselves in two groups: Cyanolux and Bactomythril. The leaders of each group were elected: Carla (Cyanolux) and Claudia (Bactomithril).
Cyanolux: Wetlab: Simon, Seba / Drylab: Carla, Tamara, Isaac Bactomithril: Wetlab: Ulises, Bryon / Drylab: Claudia, Emilia, Max
Carla and Max were chosen to maintain the wiki updated.
Bernardo and Rolando are going to collaborate with both groups.
Also, we scheduled meetings of the whole team every Friday or Tuesday (depending on the availability of the majority of the team), and meetings with the whole team and our advisor, Professor Rodrigo Gutierrez, every other Thursday. Likewise, each group should have their own meetings.
Finally, we decided to work based on delivery dates. Each member should compromise to complete a task in specific time intervals.
March, 12 - 18, 2012
We registered our team in iGEM. Now we are officially part of iGEM 2012! Also we began to learn how to use our wiki. Our Bactomithril project is still in its initial stage, so we began to read as many papers about recombinant spider silk and protein modeling as we could.
Some of the most relevant papers we found are
- Xia et al. 2010 - “Native-sized recombinant spider silk protein produced in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli results in a strong fiber”
- Widmaier et al. - 2009 - “Engineering the Salmonella type III secretion system to export spider silk monomers”
We learnt about interesting protein modeling and simulation software (e.g. Rosetta, Foldit), and some protein visualization software  (PyMOL, VMD, Chimera)
Additionally, we began to send emails requesting genetic sequences from spider silk to scientists from other countries. According to what we know, in Chile nobody works with natural or recombinant spider silk proteins or its genetic sequences. So that this is a real challenge to us.
March, 19 - 25, 2012
The iGEM team Slovenia 2009 had a project potentially useful for our own project. For that reason, we sent an email to them asking if they could share their biobricks Bba_K245005 and Bba_K245113 with us. They answered us and offered their help. But their shipment never arrived. Anyway, later we realized that those parts are not"
SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Introduction1Fr_-_-_TEXT.html,", les barrières à traverser sont des systèmes très complexes faisant intervenir plusieurs éléments (épithélium, endothélium, membrane cellulaire) et plusieurs composantes (barrières mécaniques et physico-chimiques et barrières enzymatiques). L’obtention de concentrations thérapeutiques au niveau du site d’action ne peut donc se faire qu’au détriment d’une importante déperdition de médicament vers d’autres tissus ou cellules ce qui entraîne des effets toxiques importants et parfois rédhibitoires.
D’autre part, le développement des biotechnologies a donné accès à des protéines recombinantes et à des gènes clonés, en grande quantité. Parallèlement, les progrès de la chimie organique sur support permettent la création d’oligopeptides et d’oligonucléotides. Ces molécules sont, sans doute, à la base des médicaments de demain : très sélectifs au niveau moléculaire, ils conduisent à des métabolites endogènes, c’est-à-dire non toxiques. Cependant, les caractéristiques physicochimiques et biomimétiques de ces molécules les rendent très difficiles à administrer. Elles sont, en effet, toujours mal absorbées (au niveau cellulaire et tissulaire) et souvent très rapidement dégradées et métabolisées et incapables d’atteindre leur cible au niveau tissulaire ou cellulaire. C'est l'une des principales limites au développement de ces molécules comme médicaments.
C’est pour toutes ces raisons que le développement de vecteurs de principes actifs a pris un essor considérable au cours des dernières années. S’appuyant sur de nouveaux concepts physico-chimiques, la recherche galénique a permis d’imaginer des systèmes submicroniques d’administration, biologique ou chimique, capables : (i) de protéger la molécule active de la dégradation et (ii) d’en contrôler la libération dans le temps et dans l’espace.

IIT-Madras,2016,Team:IIT-Madras#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," a person opt for GM food consumption? Is it better knowledge and understanding of GM?
Considering these, we designed our survey. We conducted our survey in colleges of four different states with the help of SVCE Chennai , IISc Banglore , IIT Delhi and IIT Kharagpur (total 330 responses). We surveyed undergraduates, post graduates and professors across various departments and later on categorized them into two groups Biotechnology related and non-Biotechnology related departments. We also made sure that we have enough responses in each category. You can view the survey questionnaire here .
An application for approval of a GMO in india has to go through the following committees:
IBSC: Institutional Biosafety committee
RCGM: Review Committee on Genetic Manipulations
MEC: Monitoring cum Evaluation Committee
GEAC: Genetic Engineering Approval Committee
ICAR: Indian Council of Agricultural Research
Analysis
We believe that GM crops/foods would be a very important part of our life in the future, if not today. Genetic Modification technology would be developed to an extent that all of us would be satisfied with its technical, economical and political implications. We believed that the answers to all of our questions would be 'YES'. Therefore, we have looked at the patterns, which give us 'YES' answers in our questionnaire. The percentage of people responding 'YES' have been color coded like: 0-40% red, 40-70% yellow, 70-100% green. In this way, we can also estimate that how close are we to go green! We found interesting results in accordance with our hypothesis. We had divided our participants into six groups: Undergraduates, Graduates and Professors, each from Biotech or non-Biotech. A comprehensive analysis of our results can be obtained here . Below is the tag cloud representation of the comments, which we received in our survey.

Surviving in the BioValley was an orienteering event but combined with quiz of synthetic biology, molecular biology and biochemistry, which allow all participants to broaden their biological knowledge in an entertaining way. There is no need for the participants to worry that they can't solve the problems. Every team is allowed to research the answers by various?ways, such as finding answers in the books, Internet and so forth. The fastest team finish all the games will be the biggest winner. Now, let's begin the game!

The first stop is the synthetic biology venue. Here we borrow the projects of Fudan team and SDU_CHINA team in 2017 iGEM. In the first project, you need to construct the ""stripe"" to response to different intensity signal input. In the other project, you should construct two plasmids based on CRISPR technique to cleave PD-L1 gene in cancer cells and make sure they are safe for normal cells simultaneously. The guide will tell you the function of every part. If you can't decide how to construct the plasmids, you can skip this part, but with total time increasing 20 minutes.

The second stop is the venue of molecular biology. In this level, you can engage in Dodgeball of gene. Choose a theme, then knock the uncorrelated cups down with a ball. For example, in transcription theme, there are seven cups marked with telomerase, enhancer, promoter and so on. So you need to knock down the cups labeled with telomerase.

geekStarter Workshop
On June 10, 2017, MindFuel’s geekStarter graciously hosted an event where teams sponsored by geekStarter were able to gather together, present their projects, and receive critical feedback from a panel of expert judges. Hosted at Notre Dame Collegiate High School, we were able to witness the presentations of innovative projects from other high schools, as well as present our own.
The next day, we got in touch with other iGEM teams at geekStarter’s iGEM meet-up, hosted at the University of Calgary. The UAlberta, Lethbridge, Lethbridge HS, and Calgary iGEM teams were present at the event. With the other teams, we were able to discuss a few of our problems and hear about the other team's progress'. Overall we had a newfound sense of direction for our project and had been invigorated towards starting the next step of our iGEM journey.
aGEM
In the final preparations for the iGEM 2017 Giant Jamboree, five geekStarter teams from across Alberta gathered for aGEM 2017, hosted by geekStarter, which occurred from September 23-24 at the University of Alberta. Again, our team was grateful to have been able to experience an event like aGEM. The iGEM teams present at the event were UAlberta, Calgary, Lethbridge and Lethbridge HS. We were able to practice presenting our work in a fully supportive environment, and also gained invaluable feedback. Furthermore, we gained insight into how other high school and undergraduate teams approached their project within the context of iGEM.

Bioethics
Comprehensive Environmental Assessment was extremely helpful in providing guidance for research priorities; however, we thought it necessary to address ethical concerns associated with our project. As such, we designed our project in accordance with the ethical principles identified by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues (2010). Our primary motive is public beneficence: to improve global public health by monitoring the safety of drinking water. We have also demonstrated responsible stewardship by considering the environmental implications of our project; the ecological impact of placing our genetically modified strain in water would be minimal because our filtration system will not allow bacteria to escape. S. oneidensis MR-1 is native to North America and poses no known threat to biodiversity or humans; however, before field testing, we would engineer our strains to be auxotrophic. We have spoken directly with Environment Canada representatives who confirmed our recombinant S. oneidensis-based biosensor is easily approvable for field deployment.
In addition, the electrochemical biosensor is an intellectually responsible pursuit: our project cannot foreseeably be used to cause people harm. In the spirit of democratic deliberation, the human practices component of our team seeks to account for others’ ethical concerns about our project. We have begun consulting with local citizens as well as public authorities in order to fully understand the possible impacts of our project. Our proposed system would be easy, cost-effective, and potentially usable on a global scale, demonstrating justice and fairness in its intended implementation. Additionally, the modularity of our biosensing platform allows it to be adapted to the needs of different communities, in order to best serve global populations and environments.

Guidance
We asked supervisors present at the meetup to moderate each table. They would be impartial moderators that would ensure everyone had the opportunity to speak and that would ask “Why?” questions if the discussion was superficial. Per topic, we also prepared questions that our moderators could ask to steer the discussion away from dead ends and opinionated sources that could trigger a fresh discussion topic. The moderators were free to use these if they thought they needed them. We introduced the workshop to them in a short presentation the day before so that they had time to prepare.
Time per round
We decided on 30 minutes per round, of which 5 were to introduce the topic, 20 to discuss in groups and 5 minutes to discuss plenary.
Preparation
We decided against asking participants to prepare something beforehand, as we wanted them to come to the discussion with an open mind.
3. Materials
For the workshop, you will need:
In general
A room with a screen,and an audio installation.
A wireless microphone (so you can walk around and ask participants for their opinions).
A presentation with your introduction slides and (optionally) movies on it.
Tables and chairs.
(optional) A good camera to take some pictures.
Per discussion group
Big sheets of paper to draw ideas on.
Pens/markers.
Sheets of paper with the group numbers on them to put on the tables.
For the moderators
A short introduction presentation or document so that they come prepared.
(optional) Guiding questions or opinions that they can use if they want.
4. People
The people who help make your workshop a success:
Your participants!
Moderators per table, who guide the discussions when needed.
A presenter who introduces each topic and keeps track of time (can two or several as well).
Someone who films and/or takes pictures (ask if all participants are okay with this at the start of the workshop).
5. Documentation
Please think of the way you want to document your workshop beforehand, if at all. Keep in mind that you ask for permission and that your documentation does not interfere with the workshop ambiance. A good way to document is to ask people for quotes.
6. Recommendations
From our own experience, we would like to give some recommendations on parts that did not go according to plan.
Different from our plan was that we had bigger groups of 15 to 20 people, because we did not have enough moderators to enable smaller groups. The discussions were still interesting, but this did mean that some of the depth we had hoped for was lost. Feedback from our moderators was that 20 minutes was not enough"

Our research work
Research work
Finding a suitable topic was very challenging and time consuming. Initially, we looked through projects of prior teams and assembled a list of possible topics.
A big influence was a new method for assembling genes in a manufacturing manner which was being developed by a research group on our university. Based on the quick and easy synthesis of proteins a first idea was the creation of enzymes that could convert blood groups. Also working with cyanobacteria was an option we considered.
After many seminars, we established the idea of metabolic channeling using dCas9 as our main project. One of our advisors also worked with membraneless organelles and suggested this approach for achieving metabolic channeling and therefor our secondary project with LLPS.
We thought about using either violacein or beta carotene as exemplary pathways for our increased production but finally decided for beta carotene. This brought many new challenges in the form of understanding the pathway and implementing it in E. coli.
Also, we very worried that an increased output would end up consuming too much precursor substrate and hinder growth of the transformed cells. Additionally, we found that team Edinburgh/Glasgow had problems with toxicity if the enzymes of the beta carotene pathway were in a specific order.
But all the planning was for nothing when we realized that some of the enzymes of the beta carotene pathway were localized in the membrane and therefore not suitable for our metabolic channeling approach.
After planning the design more precise we eventually arrived at our scaffold design of a low and a high-copy plasmid.

Chemically competent e.coli cells transformed with fluorescent construct Gibson product from 07/08/12.
E.coli cells also transformed with sfGFP Gibson product made earlier today in triplicate.
All transformants plated out on 100 μg/ml ampicillin.
sfGFP fragments have produced successful Gibson products in the past, so this will act as our positive control. If cells grow with the plasmid and fluoresce properly, we will know the master mix works. Otherwise, we will remake the master mix.
Results: there is growth on the ampicillin plates but very little- we suspect a problem with positive control fragments DNA concentration being too low. (13/8/12)

A second modified version was released with changes in the descriptions and choices of the questions so to avoid the equivocation occurred in the first one. The second version is translated into English version as well, and they were posted in the IGEM community as a collaboration request. However, the sample space is unsatisfactory with only 10 responses in total. After all, the survey provided us with information about the public opinion from their knowledge on colorectal cancer to their expectations of the treatments. The survey intended to leave free response in many of the questions to avoid limiting the choice of response, and we did get a few interesting answers on some of the questions, showing different perspective of different people.
There are 3 versions of questionnaires, even though the questions haven’t change much, the consolidation of the result is quite hard since adjustments have been made to the expressions.            In sum, among the 342 responses, 47 of them haven’t heard of colorectal cancer before, and among the 218 people who have heard of the disease, only 37 of them have knowledge about it.
Most of them do not have relatives or friends being suffered from it, however still 80 out of 342 reported having this case.
The most painful parts of having a cancer for most responses are the fact that many patients failed to discover their illness at the early stage of tumor development as well as inability to cure or even treat the disease. Other also chose the choice: physical pain brought by the disease.
However, analyzing the part about attitude toward current diagnosis techniques. Most people do not have a clear idea about the pros and cons of the techniques along with problems with sample spaces. The Chinese version mainly focuses on the experience and the cost. While the English version focuses on experience and privacy. Sample space from second trial is too small to make solid conclusion while comparing the results in the three surveys, the dominant answer choices are different reflecting certain degree of diversification between different group of people. If this project wants to fully develop into clinical uses, further surveys on public opinion have to be made and released between different groups of people.
Clearly, accuracy and efficiency is quite prevailing when asked about the future direction of developing techniques of diagnosis.
And most people think that the development in cancer related treatments should be more focused on methods of curing or at least alleviating, the disease and its diagnosis.

NEAU-Harbin
OUR TEAM
Back in 2009, some intelligent students in the college of life science of NEAU learnt about iGEM and they suggested teachers to let them join the competition. Unfortunately, because of many reasons, they failed. However, they left the iGEM community of the college of life science to their juniors. So in 2012, four staffs of iGEM community knew that HIT joined iGEM since 2011. They participated HIT-Harbin and then for the love of iGEM and scientific research of life science, one of them joined the jamboree following the HIT-Harbin. Next they suggested teachers to let them join the competition and they got success! So NEAUHarbin was established. Now the members of NEAU-Harbin are almost from the college of life science of NEAU. But the iGEM community is planning to make the team stronger and better!
PROJECT UPDATE
Now we are still construct our standard expression vectors. We are trying to eliminate NotI restriction enzyme cutting site on our expression vectors. But we have already constructed 3 kinds of non-standard expression vectors with 3 kinds of chromo protein genes. And we transformed them into Agrobacterium and co-culture with A.Niger. But now we don’t see any colorful A.Niger. We deduce the chromo protein parts that iGEM HQ provide is codon optimized for prokaryote, not for mold. So we decide to codon optimize the chromo protein genes for mold and synthesize it in this week.
PLAN FOR FUTURE STEPS
Construct our vectors, and watch the results of the A.Niger’ color. Codon optimization.

PROJECT UPDATE
So far we have accomplished two circuits, which endow the CL-1( E.coli engineered strain ) the ability of the chemotaxis. Then the engineering bacteria could be regulated by IPTG and L-Arabinose; pBAD and pLac promoters control the expression of Lac I and CheZ. Besides, when we use IPTG as an inducer and L-Arabinose as an inhibitor to take control of the chemotaxis of the engineering bacteria, we can get a good characterization in the semisolid plate.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," allowing us to identify gene doping in blood samples with our method ADOPE.
Before establishing a targeted library preparation protocol, we produced and analysed the functionality (in vitro and in vivo) of the fusion protein. We evaluated three different types of chromatography (nickel affinity, heparin, and monoQ chromatography) to develop a new downstream process for the fusion protein. Once the fusion protein was successfully purified, we evaluated the in vitro functionality. We tested the ability of the fusion protein to load the adapter sequence and bind to target DNA facilitated by sgRNA with electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Finally, we tested targeted integration of the adapters by PCR of the obtained cleaved fragments and subsequent gel electrophoresis. Additionally, we developed an in vivo screening platform to evaluate the effectivity and efficiency of the fusion protein. The fusion protein was guided with a lacZ sgRNA carrying kanamycin resistance donor DNA, allowing us to perform a dual screen: blue/white colony screening and kanamycin resistance screening. A scheme of this work pipeline is depicted in figure 6.
Figure 6. Design, construction, purification and functionality tests of fusion protein dxCas9-Tn5.
3.1 Background Information
The fusion protein consists of a catalytically inactive version of xCas9 (dxCas9, BBa_K2643001 ), fused to a hyperactive transposase (Tn5, BBa_K2643002 ) via a short linker ( BBa_K2643003 ) of 18 amino acids and cloned into the pACYCDuet-1 vector.
dxCas9
We chose to work with the newly evolved Cas9 variant to guide the fusion protein to a specific DNA sequence. This variant is derived from the common Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9). The benefit of the xCas9 variant is that it has the broadest known Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence including NG, GAA and GAT, and a greater DNA specificity compared to SpCas9, resulting in significantly lower off-target activity ( Hu et al, 2018 ). The catalytically dead version of xCas9 (dxCas9) is thus an excellent choice for the component responsible for guiding the fusion to a specific DNA sequence. The variant was evolved in 2018 by phage assisted continuous evolution and has 6 point mutations (amino acids E480K, E543D, E1219V, A262T, S409I and M694I) ( Hu et al,"

The sequencing results were returned from the samples of J13002 + LuxO D47A + B0015 on pSB1AK3 that I sent down last day. These were confirmed positive. I have included the sequencing results for one of the samples and the alignments immediately thereafter. These results are the same for both of the samples that I tested, indicating that the colonies that I tested have the proper sequence for J13002 + LuxO D47A + B0015 on pSB1AK3.

Initial computer predicted results for these RBS and promoter efficiencies predicted that a much greater difference should have been seen between the high efficiency RBS and promoter pair and the low efficiency RBS and promoter pair. Predicted transcription rates for the RBS’s were: RH2= 0.914 and RL1=0.007. Theoretical translation rates for promoters were: PH2=0.86 and PL1=0.06. It is not yet determined why this discrepancy exists.

Program Design
BioMORTAR is web-based, and can be found linked to by our iGEM wiki page. BioMORTAR uses different coding languages to perform different functions more efficiently. IMPtools and the plasmid designer are coded in Python since the language is so versatile, whereas the cell modeling part of BioMORTAR is coded in MATLAB since COBRA provides many of the tools necessary to model cell performance. The user interface for all of BioMORTAR is programmed in Django, a high level Python web framework that allows for a simple user interface, in our case, and a simple setup for hosting the program on our server. The server is owned and operated by the UIUC iGEM team, and it currently runs from its location at the University of Illinois.

Friday is cleaning up visuals (resizing windows, confirming working buttons, etc.) and (hopefully) releasing.
Saturday is slack day.
I'll try to get a week's worth of pictures this week. We'll see how much time coding will take from me.
July 26, 2008: ALPHA VERSION RELEASED
We're done with the Alpha release. From my understanding the road should be smoother from here on out. Unfortunately, no pictures for this week. Like I said above: We'll see how much time coding will take from me :). But, without further ado,
HERE IS THE LINK FOR THE ALPHA VERSION OF CLOTHO
If you do not see the link to the download on the above page, it is most likely because you came here way too early and Doug has not yet uploaded the release to his wiki. Plans are that it'll be uploaded by the end of Saturday. I'll keep everyone updated.
July 28, 2008: Release Confirmed
The Alpha release is official. Download it while it's still hot!
I'm going to be working on the website most of this week. As well prepping for the GRE. Graduate school business is coming up quickly!
October 21, 2008: Things are really starting to shake up
Been a few months since last update. GRE's went great! I got my 800 in math, a 530 in verbal =(, and a 5.5 on essay. Now letters of recommendation left, and those are coming along pretty well. We've gone through a bunch of changes to the site and Clotho, but lately I've also been bombarded with schoolwork and societies and such. Jamboree's coming up so fast! We're working hard to ensure all of you see a great product. Watch out, MIT!

Preliminary Testing Phase
2015.03.27: Tested printing bBSA directly on three activated TaO5 glass slides (without GOPTS). iRIF measurement failed because one of the tubes was congested. Two of the glass slides remain in the fridge for measuring after the weekend.
2015.03.30: Continued the measurement on the residual two rif-slides.  Slide S303: stamped bBSA visible via iRIF, though some bubbles entered the flow-cell. Fluorescence measurement revealed that the stamps looked fine. Results are saved under „150330_bBSA_StrepCy5_S303“.  Slide 024: tried two times, both times the cell (probably) collapsed because some input flow might have gotten behind the PDMS flowcell. iRIF results we're not saved since nothing could be seen.
⇒ Conclusions: iRIF worked for at least one slide. We'll have to try one of the two new flowcells prepared by our team to prevent further collapse. Also the stamp appears to have been partially dried out before stamping, a faster transition from protein-incubation and stamping is advisable.

(3) Insights gained from modeling have been effectively applied to our experiments
Several modeling, simulation and data analysis have been conducted along with wet lab experiments. Results of modeling have been considered when determining conditions of experiments. As far as our project is concerned, it is not exaggerated to say that successfully culturing our microalgae is prior to all other experiments. Precise growth curve should be illustrated before any experiment related to microalgae was carried out. Conspicuously, the simulated growth curve is highly correlated to the experimental one.
See more detail: Modeling
(4) A myriad of pigment sequences has been investigated and constructed
Photosynthetic efficiency is crucial to growth and oil accumulation in microalgae. In our project, several aspects including synthesis, expression and characteristics were deeply investigated. Genes related to the pigments have been constructed. We intended to transform pigment sequences extracted from other species into microalgae to compare wavelength absorbance and photosynthetic efficiency between color combination.
This figure is the variation of starch content per cell per day of CrtZ transformants. The result implied that CrtZ transformants could produce more starch per day than the wild type and had better photosynthetic efficiency.

(5) NrtA protein has been proved valid
Photosynthetic efficiency is crucial to growth and oil accumulation in microalgae. In our project, several aspects including synthesis, expression and characteristics were deeply investigated. Genes related to the pigments have been constructed. We intended to transform pigment sequences extracted from other species into microalgae to compare wavelength absorbance and photosynthetic efficiency between color combination.
The bar figure shows nitrate concentration of cell lysate, and the table represents Dunnett’s T3 test of nitrate concentration of cell lysate. Both of the result clearly demonstrate that nitrate and nitrite concentration of competent cell and NrtA was significant different, which verifies NrtA protein’s capability of capturing nitrite and nitrate.
See more detail: Nitrogen Starvation - NrtA Functional Test
(6) Pigmentation genes collection
Aside from CrtZ gene, we also obtained other pigmentation genes from distribution kits and bacterium. PCR products were successfully acquired through templates and well-designed primers. The gel electrophoresis results demonstrate our effort to construct the pigmentation genes collection. The followings are MelA, Lycopene’s upstream, Lycopene’s downstream and IndC gene.

We would also like to thank Dr. Maurice LING from AdvanceSyn, who helped us perform sensitivity analysis using the AdvanceSyn Toolkit, a suite of open-sourced tools for model development and model analysis;  with an emphasis on systems biology, synthetic biology, and metabolic engineering.
PART 6: COLLABORATIONS
Collaborations have undeniably opened up more possibilities for our project.  This year, we are very grateful to build meaningful collaborations with 4 teams: Team CUHK 2018 , Team NTU 2018 , Team Toulouse-INSA-UPS 2018 , and Team ULaval 2018 .
At the start, our team wanted to work with aptamers. Unfortunately, we have been unsuccessful in our constructions.  The wet-lab team from CUHK helped us to redesign our constructs involving aptamers,  as well as the primers for these constructions, which led to eventual successful constructions.
We would like to sincerely thank Team NTU for helping us to characterise our new biobrick parts: BBa_K2819000 and BBa_K2819206 .  Their expertise in real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was extremely useful in helping our team generate quality characterisation data for our biobrick systems.
Team Toulouse and Team ULaval helped us develop a comprehensive coverage in our education and engagement activities.  The three teams worked closely together to produce a handy and engaging booklet which comprehensively summarises the pertinent issues surrounding synthetic biology  - Team Toulouse authored a section on ethical concerns in synthetic biology, Team ULaval authored another section on the cultural and social aspects of synthetic biology.
PART 7: EDUCATION AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
Our education and public engagement events would not have been possible if not for the support of the NUS Biomedical Engineering Club, NUS Tembusu College, and NUS Ridge View Residential College; they provided us with an invaluable platform for us to anchor our education and engagement events.  We would like to thank the researchers who have taken time off from their busy schedules to speak at our events,  and the staff of the pre-university institutions in Singapore for being so forthcoming in sharing details of our events with their students.
In particular, we would like to thank Assistant Professor Raye Yeow, the advisor to the NUS Biomedical Engineering Club,  as well as the chairperson"

Orthogonality test
I Background
     In our project, we hope that the warriors only kill the bacteria from the other side, but not from its own side. In other words, the orthogonality of the gene circuit must be good. Necessarily, it means that the AHL molecules secreted by warrior I can just activate the promoter inside warrior II, but cannot activate the promoter inside itself and vice versa. (Note: In this text, we mean the same when we refer to response intensity of AHL promoter and killing effect of warriors. That is to say, if the response intensity of the promoter to the AHL secreted by warrior A inside warrior B is high---A may equals to B, which means that the warrior A can be effectively killed by warrior B and vice versa.)
    To help us choose appropriate circuits of the two warriors, we should know how specific receptor-promoter combinations respond to specific AHLs.
    This is characterized by ETH_Zurich 2014 . However, we cannot use their results directly. The detailed explanation is shown below:
    The response concentration of some receptor-promoter combinations to AHL molecule may be too high or too low that they exceed the concentration range that ETH_Zurich considered. For example, in our project, we want to design two kinds of E. coli which can synthesize two kinds of AHLs and respond only to the AHL secreted by the other. Therefore, according to results from ETH_Zurich 2014, shown below (Fig. 1), we may design the gene circuit of our"

89% of participants have same opinion with us, which      is that iGEM should sub-categorize the “WORKS” comment into 1) “Quantitative”      for parts which are characterized with experiments and 2) “Qualitative”      for parts which are not characterized will be an appropriate measure      for standardization of Biobrick database.
In order to overcome these problems we suggest enforcing the working     conditions title for the registry entrance, in order to collect quantitative     experimental details on submitted parts, which might slow down the registration     process but will definitely increase the quality of the database.
61% of participants agree that POPS (Polymerase Per      Second) should be assigned to every part or biobricks with a promoter,      where appropriate. - 57% of participants have been agree that RIPS      (Ribosome per Second) should be assigned to every part or biobricks      with a RBS brick.
Though most participants agree the need for POPS and RBS information     , they are concerned about the workload it would bring to individual     labs.
“To do this, the Registry need to define a reliable and easy method     of determining the PoPS for teams to use. However, I would say that     there are better systems for quantifying promoter output than PoPS,     and they should be used instead, if possible”.
67% of participants have thought that entering POPS      information should not be mandatory while submitting new parts.      Similarly, 65% of participants disagree that entering RIBS information      should be mandatory while submitting new parts
Even though the researchers feeling the need for this information     they are shying away from requesting it as a mandatory title for parts     registry as it would be difficult for underfunded and inexperienced     groups to perform these measurements.
We strongly suggest starting a forum on how to quantify the performance     of promoters and genes to bring an easy to measure standard for the     efficiency of the parts. Additionally iGEM should the responsibility     and provide the measurements for the each promoter and gene included     in the distributions. The second choice would be even better in terms     of standardization as all the measurement will be performed by one center     under similar conditions and with experienced researchers, which will     allow user to compare and contrast the efficiencies of the parts more     accurately.
82% of participants have thought that information on      working conditions of the parts should be mandatory while submitting      new parts. Most find submiting the detailed experimental      information and working conditions is crucial and even easier than      submitting measurements of POPS or R"

Both are the same amino acid sequence except for the XhoI site and the histag at the end of the original.
The steps to order the construct is the following.
Go to IDT Sign in go to gblocks gene fragments name copy paste sequence in test complexity add to order say no to everything for payment:  my account, oligo card, send to david, notify igem or david
Some suggestions from Fasih were the following.
Design the primers before ordering.   a) For XhoI and NdeI sites include handle of 6-8 basepairs b) igem prefix and suffix.  With two stop codons before the suffix.  This will go into psb1c3 perform digest and ligation on benchling Use snapegene for plasmids Need BL21 (DE3) with T7 polymerase for expression in pET22b
-Design of primers Primers were designed using Benchling For expression:   These are the NdeI and XhoI sites obtained from Benchling. NdeI:  5’-CATATG-3’, 3’-GTATAC-5’ XhoI:  5’-CTCGAG-3’, 3’GAGCTC-5’ The handle used was ACTGAC
For iGEM:  The iGEM prefix and suffix were used as stated previously.
Conclusions:  It seems as though the primer lengths may be too long, and that the melting temperatures are too high.  A second opinion may be needed tomorrow.  The order for just the PCquad optimized will be made in addition to primers to make it usable in the Pet22b vector, and for iGEM.

Proof of Concept
Cell-free Mechanism
Based on feedback from various stakeholders during our Integrated Human Practices work, we decided to perform a proof of concept experiment to detect other sweat metabolites using our system. We aimed at detecting glucose instead of ethanol in our Cell-free Mechanism , because of its obvious healthcare applications for diabetes patients.
To do this we replaced the Alcohol Oxidase in our system by Glucose Oxidase (GOx, EC 1.1.3.4).
This successful proof of concept experiment not only showed that our system is versatile and robust, but it also provided data for the modelling and systems testing of a prototype for our AlcoPatch.
The assembled proof of concept system worked as follows: GOx oxidises glucose into D-gluconolactone[1] and producing H2O2 as a by-product (figure 1). In the subsequent reaction, HRP is used to oxidise its substrate ABTS in the presence of H2O2, which acts as an oxidising agent.

We used real-time spectrophotometry in a plate-reader to track the kinetics of the formation of the green oxidized ABTS, to characterize the response characteristics of our glucose sensor system (Figure 1).
Figure 2. Absorbance at 420nm of reaction through time after the inoculation with glucose, showing an increasing absorbance O.D which implicates the increasing production of a coloured product.
Based on this, we decided to further investigate on the optimal concentrations of GOx, ABTS and HRP to achieve the strongest possible green colour signal in response to physiologically relevant concentrations of glucose (matching those reported in human sweat) [2] (Figure 2).

These experimental data not only establish proof of concept for our detection system, but they were also used to validate the ensemble model , by comparing the probabilistic outputs of the model with the data (see understanding the"

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Policy_-_-_TEXT.html," strategy for the policy we were aiming to create. The first part of the policy is an introduction to all current regulations regarding GMOs, live biotherapeutic product (LBP) and drug delivery systems as a first step to understanding how all these parts are perceived to-date. Further on, all the background information was analysed and a solution is proposed that assures the safety in the usage of LBP’s. The developed solution proposes an evaluation of Human Safety, Environmental Safety and risk assessment before any product with these characteristics can be approved for human use. Additionally, several final considerations on how clinical studies should be performed are also explained.
Together with the advices from Katarina, Åsa and Erik, we also incorporated the society's views on GMOs into our policy. For this reason, we thought it would be a good idea to host a GMO debate, where we would bring experts with different knowledge and opinions about the use of GMOs and initiate a discussion where the public could actively be engaged and build on an opinion on the subject. This event was held in collaboration with Uppsala University's iGEM team. The result of the panel discussion exceeded our expectations and was implemented into our policy.
However, we wanted to take the next step in the successful implementation of the policy we had been working on. Because of this, we handed the policy over to the Medical Products Agency, since they are the head governmental agency handling, regulating and in the end accepting new medicinal drugs in Sweden. Our goal is that in the future they use the policy we developed for the evaluation of future applications.

Réseau BIOTechno is a French network and a unique organization in Europe, uniting 12 doctoral students and PhDs associations of Biotechnology spread over the whole country. The aim of the event “Forum BIOtechno 2017” organized on June 16th, was to enable PhD students to highlight their skills transferable from Academia to industry. We took advantage of this opportunity to present our project to biotechnology experts. It was also a great opportunity to train ourselves to pitch the project.

VivaTech is the world’s rendezvous for startups and leaders to celebrate innovation together. It’s a gathering of the world’s brightest minds, talents, and products. On June 17th, we had the opportunity to present our project to several enterprises, get feedbacks and discuss potential partnerships.
French Ministry of Environment
On August 8th, 2017, we met Mr. Hubert Holin, in charge of air quality at the Ministry of the Environment. We introduced him to iGEM, our project, and the application scenario we envisioned. M. Holin cemented our idea of ​​targeting indoor pollution. Indeed, he explained that when cleaning outside air, it is better to fight the sources than to offer a solution downstream. He also confirmed the advantage of an energy autonomous device, specifically for some emerging countries, where access to electricity is not always guaranteed. He told us that it would be interesting to have a first commercial phase (in the scenario, we considered rather a free distribution) on a smaller scale (10,000 copies for example). Such an approach would show the politicians that there is a true market for the general public and that there is a real solution to the problem of indoor air pollution. By mapping the pollutants, we could also sound the alarm. Finally, Mr. Holin gave us valuable advice on how we could get funding for aether.
City Hall of Paris
September 11th, 2017, we presented our project to City of Paris. Mrs. Caroline Daude, Transport Consultant, and Mr. Serge Orru, WWF France Advisor and Former Director, welcomed us to discuss aether.

Assembly fragments were designed to have 35-40bp overhanging regions of complementary in the primers
PCR fragments were generated using a KAPA HiFi polymerase reaction. Fragments were verified on an agarose gel and treated with DpnI restriction enzyme
The following reaction was set up: 0.5 pmols of linear fragments, at least two fold excess of inserts and 75ng of vector backbone; 10μL of 2x NEB Gibson assembly master mix; water to bring entire reaction to 20μL
Gibson reaction was run in a thermocycler at 50°C for 1 hour
2μL of the above reaction was transformed into NEB 5-alpha competent E.coli
Cells on plates were subsequently screened using standard colony PCR and verification digest methods

Project specifications
Synthesis: The system is generic and potentially able to manufacture any type of polypeptide.
Purification: In The E.ncapsulator, protein production (module 1) and encapsulation (module 2) of the cells occur in the same place. This dual production and delivery platform means that there is no need for expensive downstream purification processes.
Storage: Freeze drying in the encapsulation phase and secondary encapsulation allow for storage of The E.ncapsulator.
Quality Control: If one cell fails to produce the protein or polypeptide of interest, it will have minimal impact on the whole system.
Safety: In order to reduce risks associated with our product, we have chosen a GRAS (generally recognised as safe) chassis. Furthermore, all the genetic material is destroyed prior ingestion to prevent any risks of horizontal gene transfer after colonisation by the cell.
Our Solution
The E.ncapsulator is a novel protein manufacture and delivery platform designed to overcome these difficulties. Hover over the different parts of the image below, to learn more about each module of the system:
Growth
Growth
The cells are grown to a critical cell density, before the system is started. It allows the culture to reach a sufficient cell number before the the cells are triggered to begin protein production. This is because protein production can slow cell growth.
Module 1: Protein Production
Module 1: Protein Production
The first module is induced with IPTG, which triggers the production of the protein of interest. As part of this project we have looked into two proteins and a peptide of interest.
Module 2: Encapsulation
Module 2: Encapsulation
The second module is where the cell, after having produced the peptide of interest, produces colanic acid. This creates a protecting layer around teh bacterium to shelter it from the acidity of the stomach.
Module 3: Genome deletion
Module 3: Genome deletion
Module 3 occurs after encapsulation of the cell containing the produced peptide of interest. This module makes the bacterium non-viable. It does so by over-expressing restriction enzymes which subsequently cleave the genomic DNA into small fragments. The cell is thus unable to produce any proteins and therefore unable to survive.
Secondary Encapsulation
Secondary Encapsulation
Several manufacturing considerations regarding the post-processing of the culture have been investigated. Post-processing of the culture allows the polypeptide filled cells to be converted into a pharmaceutical tablet, that can be taken orally.

Duke,2018,Team:Duke#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," from waiting to collect in the spring and summer months when park peels easily, to the more than nine months for drying, extraction and recrystallization process. [6]  Furthermore, harvesting bark will cause the tree to die, so the process is ecologically expensive. [1]  There are many possible solutions to the the supply problem, including producing semisynthetic compounds and isolating taxol derivatives from other parts of the tree. However, each of these methods come with their own barriers.
The active ingredient in Pacific Yew trees is paclitaxel; about three mature trees are needed for one patient. One method discovered to circumvent harvesting Yew bark from the fragile Pacific tree species was harvesting docetaxel from the more common European Yew, Taux Baccata. [8] As a drug, docetaxel is newer, semisynthetic. Taxol can also be synthesized  from this precursor in a four step process. Docetaxel, however, is also slightly different that it is more effective in breast cancer, while paclitaxel is more active in ovarian. [8] [2] Though the ecological cost of docetaxel is lower, it brings much higher rates of negative side effects, including hematologic toxicity and neurotoxicity. [13]  Another potential is plant tissue culture; however, taxol has 11 chiral centers and its biosynthetic pathway is difficult to define. [6] Natural molecules in general are very complex, however as drugs they tend to have less contaminants and toxic side effects compared to chemotherapy, and don’t hurt healthy cells of the patient as much. [13] Total synthesis of taxol was produced by the Nicolaou and Holton groups, but the process was too long to be of commercial value. [3] Instead, the discovery of the pathway may be more useful in manipulating genes that affect enzyme activity involved in biosynthesis. This pathway can be transferred into a biofactory, such as E. Coli, a rapidly growing bacterium, which is what our team aims to tackle.
Other Barriers: Low Solubility
Another barrier and contributor to taxol’s unusual path of clinical development is insolubility of the molecule in aqueous solvents and high dosage requirements causing high toxicity, which almost caused the drug to be dropped from clinical trials. Eventually, to create a feasible parenteral formula, Cremophor EL was added as a large component of the drug.  [6] However, Cremophor EL is believed to cause hypersensitivity to other drugs"

Usage
RestrictionDB takes one file as source, which has to be at the moment an enzyme information text file from REBASE . However, the code is optimized, to adapt easy to accept multiple files at once, which can be from additional providers. The default call of restrictionDB is
python restrictionDB.py <input file>
M.A.X. takes only one source of data as an argument, where the data must be the output from restrictionDB. The default call of M.A.X. is
python MAX.py <restrionDB output>
The graphical user interface opens after loading and parsing the given database (figure 7). The top text field can take inputs of multiple types depending on which of the radio buttons on the right side of this text field are chosen. For a search in enzyme names, the input consists of short strings. The database will be checked for enzyme groups, where at least one enzyme name contains the given string as a substring. The input of multiple strings separated by spaces is possible, so only enzyme groups, where all given strings appear in some enzyme name as substring are returned in the output. The Output is then listed in the table on the bottom half of the graphical user interface (Figure 6). It consists of the enzyme names, recognitions sequences containing the substitution char “#” and aligned to the extended sequence, the original base on the position of the substitution char, and the original recognition sites with displayed cleavage sites. Individual enzyme groups are separated by lines of minuses. To start the search, just press the return key on your keyboard. If you just want to display single results, which trigger the hit and not the whole enzyme group, uncheck the checkbox “show whole group”.

Secondly,  the lecture of an expert in biosafety taught us many things we have to pay  attention to as a scientist. When we thought about the comment for the first  question “it is necessary to find out whether the problem comes from the  bacteria or the substances”, we came to the answer that the problem came from  the bacteria we use. After this lecture, we gave close attention to the waste  liquid treatment. When the waste included E. coli, we made sure it was thrown  in the Biohazard waste bag. All the experiments were carried out with more than  one person, so that we can check each other’s mistakes.
From  these two approaches, we were able to see our educational tool’s effect and  learn about the points scientists need to be aware of. We can say that these  feedbacks gave many good effects for us.

Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," about developing a mosquito trap without maintenance. In this trap, there will be different types of E. coli. One type of E. coli will produce a toxin. It’s an α-toxin derived from a scorpion and it targets voltage-gated sodium channels. Another type of E. coli produce different types of odor baits, for example lactic acid, myristic acid and 3-methyl-1-butanol. We also try to inhibit the growth of our bacteria so that they could be alive for a long time. Another important component of our trap is a co-culture with cyanobacteria, which will provide nutrients such as glucose for our E. coli.
Dr. Hammond: How far is your project? Do you already have your genetically engineered bacteria?
iGEM Hamburg: We already have some constructs finished. At this moment, we are not sure, whether our growth inhibition module will work. Instead, we have finished establishing the bacteria which produce lactate. We’ll start testing our toxin as well as the odor baits with Anopheles gambiae next week.
Dr. Hammond: How do you plan to test these with the mosquitoes?
iGEM Hamburg: We will prepare cell lysates and add some sugar, with which the mosquitoes are usually fed. Then we are going to observe, how many mosquitoes will die within which time period.
Dr. Hammond: And you will feed them with your cell lysates with the toxin and a control cell lysate from bacteria, which do not produce any transgenes? Then you will compare both?
iGEM Hamburg: Yes, exactly. We will hopefully prove, that this toxin works as it is shown in the literature. It was ensured, that this toxin is only toxic to insects and does not have toxic effects on mammals. Furthermore, we built a test tube for the examination of our lure substances. If you do not have any further questions at this point, let’s continue with talking about your work. It’s very exciting, what you have published recently. Maybe we could make a little excurse about what you’ve done and then come back to our project.
Dr. Hammond: Sure.
iGEM Hamburg: In your opinion, what is the biggest problem about malaria and do you have the feeling, that research on malaria became much bigger in the last years? Could you give us a quick overview about the recent malaria research?
Dr. Hammond: I think people have studied on this and got a lot of data about how much money there is used for the research of malaria, but I wouldn’d be able to give you “the right answer"

INSA_Toulouse,2013,Team:INSA Toulouse#contenu#lab practice#parts#submitted parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"Cph8) protein requires phycocyanobilin (PCB) biosynthetic genes for PCB formation (ho1 and PcyA). The exposure to red light (660nm) inhibits the activity of the EnvZ histidine kinase domain. In the dark, the EnvZ histidine kinase phosphorylates endogenous OmpR, a transcription factor which activates transcription from the OmpC promoter. This part must be used in E.coli deficient in wild-type EnvZ.
The heme oxygenase (ho1), ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PcyA) and tetracycline repressor (TetR) are under a constitutive promoter. Ho1 and PcyA are genes required for phycocyanobilin (PCB) biosynthesis and TetR binds to the p(TetR) (Part:BBa_R0040) that regulated light sensor (Cph8). aTc (anhydrotetracycline) binds to TetR and allows Cph8 production.
The RFP is positively regulated by OmpR-controlled promoter. Phosphorylated OmpR binds to the operator sites and activates transcription of RFP. This is a test Biobrick for the red light responsive system with the RFP protein as output.

BBa_K1132018: FixK2 promoter-rbs-mRFP-term
This biobrick was created by assembling two preexisting biobricks: a gene encoding a mutated version of the red fluorescent protein (BBa_K081014) with rbs and terminator and put under the control of  FixK2  (BBa_K592006), a blue light sensitive promoter (465-482nm). FixK2 was previously described by iGEM11_Uppsala-Sweden as working with FixJ.
When FixJ is phosphorylated, it can bind FixK2 and thus activate the downstream system.
In the litterature, FixJ is phosphorylated by YF1 in darkness and unphosphorylated in light. BBa_K592016 is a composite part using YF1 with FixJ.

They encode for the viral coat proteins and for lysis proteins. These late genes are expressed with a delay after the delayed early genes, which results from the threshold concentration of Q that has to be accumulated to overcome the tR’ terminator.
Figure 1.2: Regulatory genes of the lambda phage.
In contrast, the lysogenic state is also initiated during the transcription of the early delayed genes: 1. Under lysogenic conditions, cII is able to accumulate over a threshold level. Then it can bind to the pI, pRM and paQ promoters, thereby initiating the expression of int, cI and repressing the expression of Q, respectively. The int gene encodes a protein called integrase, which integrated the phage genome into the host genome.  2. CI binds to the early operators oL and oR and represses transcription from pL and pR. Repression of transcription from pR inhibits the transcriptional activation of the ori of the lambda phage genome and thereby replication. So cI maintains the stable lysogenic state after cIi has switched the genetic cascade of the lambda phage in favour of lysogeny. 3. During the prophage state, cI is expressed continuously. If another phage injects its genome into the host cell of a prophage, cI binds to regulatory sequences on this second genome and prevents any transcription, thereby making the host immune to super infections.
Whether to undergo a lytic or a lysogenic mode depends on the multiplicity of infection and the physiological conditions of the bacterial cell. Many phages infecting a cell favour lysogeny. Rich nutrition of the bacterium favours the lytic state, because it increases N expression levels. Since lytic and lysogenic genes are under the control of the same promoters, the critical point for the decision of a state are the RNA and protein levels, influenced by the activity of degrading enzymes [4][5][6][7][8][9] .
Our work focused on engineering a non-lysogenic phage, because we wanted to produce an efficient killing module for the probiotic bacterium. In preventing the phage from undergoing a lysogenic cycle, we assure that it will kill the target bacteria as fast as possible and without extern triggers. For this task we aimed at discarding the int gene from the phage genome, so that it would be incapable of integrating into the host genome.
Cloning work with the lambda phage genome is tricky"
