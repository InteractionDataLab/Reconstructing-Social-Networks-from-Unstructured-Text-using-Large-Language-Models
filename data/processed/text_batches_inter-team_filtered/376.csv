SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2012,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Project#project2.3_-_-_TEXT.html,". Sulfur in crude oil could contribute to global warming, acid rain, and various health issues.
Biodesulfurization of fossil fuel could help upgrade the quality of fossil fuel and thus the whole environment. To upgrade this system, we aimed to link related enzymes to orderly organized membrane anchors, which would accelerate desulfurization pathway remarkably.
Desulfurization Pathway
Four enzymes are involved in the 4S desulfurization pathway. Dibenzothiophene monooxygenase (DszC) is responsible for converting DBT to DBT-sulfoxide and finally to DBT-sulfone (DBTO2). DBT-sulfone monooxygenase (DszA) then carries out the next step in the pathway, producing 2-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinic acid (HBPS). HBPS is then converted to the final product by HBPS desulfinase (DszB), producing 2-HBP. The sulfur is released from the hydrocarbon in the form of sulfite.
Note that the first three steps of the this Desulfurization pathway require FMNH2 as a reductant. In order to regain this power an Oxidoreductase (DszD) uses NADH to recycle the FMNH2, allowing the reaction to proceed. For more information, click Wiki of team Calgary
Fig3: The 4S Desulfurization Pathway, showing the desulfurization of the model compound DBT by DszA, DszB, DszC, and DszD.
Design of Experiment
As shown above, DszD plays a special role in this Biodesulfurization pathway: offering FMNH2 for DszC and DszA. Ideal organization of the four enzymes should be DszC, DszA and DszB aligning together, with DszD paired with DszC and DszA respectively(Fig.4). In this way, metabolic flux in desulfurization pathway could be facilitated and accelerated. All intermediates could be passed to downstream enzymes efficiently. Furthermore, paired DszD could offer sufficient amount of FMNH2 for DszC and DszA in time.
Fig4: Ideal organization of DszA, DszB, DszC and DszD in desulfurization pathway. In each assembly two DszD should be paired with DszC and DszA respectively to offer FMNH2 timely
This ideal organization of enzymes is hard to achieve with"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With"

Figure 8. Gene expression level of F3’H gene in pBrep-F3’H-pTet-FNS plasmid and pBrep-F3’H plasmid
As shown from the above bar charts, F3’H and FNS genes level is confirmed. While this is expected for the F3’H gene, for its blue light repressible promoter acting like a constitutive one in dark conditions, FNS gene under pBAD promoter shows expression even without arabinose induction.
It is worth to notice that the RT-PCR efficiency might be different for different genes due to the sizes of their PCR products and that the formula used above is assuming the PCR efficiency to be 100% that eventually resulted in 2 copies of products.
 How They Helped Us?
We appreciate and thank Team NUS_Singapore-A in helping us by validating the construct in our adenine base editing project. With only growth on Kanamycin when both plasmids were induced, they verified that our system works as proposed and regulation of these two plasmids is indeed tight.  The detailed experimental procedure can be found here.

 Our Collaboration
This year, in our collaboration with Macquarie University Australia, We performed qPCR measurement for two of their constructs to verify plasmid gene expression profile upon IPTG induction. In return, we leveraged upon their protein purification and analysis technique to perform an EMSA shift in hope of observing improved DNA or gRNA binding by our improved tCas9 variants. Two improved variants with site-specific mutations were sent for analysis – Rec2_HNH 5_6_10_15 HNH-pK and 3ple 5_6_10_15 HNH-pK. Following figures show the results they obtained.
Constructs were tested against their unimproved variants (without 5_6_10_15 HNH-pK). Results were depicted as protein gel (bright green) overlaid against nucleic acid gel (black). Results indicate that all tested tCas9 binds to target DNA efficiently. Further repeats should be done with normalized, high"

PoPPY-switch
The expression platform of the hammerhead ribozyme has been altered to be more accommodating to the attachment of arbitrary RNA aptamers, giving us the modularity and cross-domain function needed to create our sensor. With this new information, our project then became the creation of a novel single gene reporter system.
Win and Smolke (2007) published research on the hammerhead ribozyme, which works across varying domains, where they increased the modularity of the expression platform by adding two small nucleotide sequences labeled as the switching and competing strands as seen in Figure 6 [31] . This system allows for the combination of arbitrary aptamers with the hammerhead expression platform. In its active state, the hammerhead ribozyme causes a cleavage event in the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of the transcribed mRNA, resulting in accelerated degradation of the mRNA strand. Depending on the location and sequence of the switching and competing strands, the hammerhead ribozyme can be either constitutively active or inactive, with ligand binding switching it to the opposite state.
The riboswitch will consist of the hammerhead ribozyme expression platform, a progesterone-specific aptamer, and switching/competing strands oriented so that the ribozyme is constitutively active and then inactivated by rising progesterone concentrations.
Figure 5: Graphic adapted from Win and Smolke (2007) showing the modularity of the hammerhead ribozyme (HHR) with arbitrary aptamers. Different aptamers (dashed boxes) can be used with the same expression platform while still showing a change of activity upon binding of a specific ligand. We will use this system with our progesterone aptamer.
For our purposes, hrGFP will be the transcribed reporter gene. Progesterone bound to the aptamer will halt the degradation of hrGFP mRNA and allow our Y. lipolytica cells to produce GFP product. In this way we can detect the presence of progesterone by the fluorescence of GFP when progesterone is bound, and we can use SELEX to create aptamers that are less sensitive to progesterone and will show visible fluorescence when the culture reaches medically useful levels.
We need to engineer the riboswitch into the genome so consumers can always have a visual representation of when their culture is ready for use. Cory Schwartz from UC Irvine donated the pHR-D17-hrGFP plasmid to us,"
JMU_Wuerzburg,2018,Team:JMU Wuerzburg#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," InterLab study, as well as a protocol (Appendix: Protocol Vibrigens Interlab.pdf) and a team-prospect.
The cooperation was about conducting an InterLab study which was designed by team Marburg with V. natriegens instead of E. coli.                  The InterLab study contained four steps. Transformation, cell growth, sampling, and assay and should be done in about three days.                  We spent the first day preparing solutions, media and an overnight culture of V. natriegens.                  The second day we prepared the cells for electroporation, transformed them and watched them grow.                  The protocol provided clear instructions and was very easy to understand. (Appendix: JMU_Wuerzburg.xlsx) But unfortunately, because of our electroporator, the cell-transformation failed.                  Luckily team Marburg was very supportive and sent us ready-transformed colonies of V. natriegens, so we could finish the InterLab study successfully.
After this little complication the rest of the laboratory work went very well.                  We made an overnight culture of ready-transformed colonies and measured absorption and                  fluorescence of the transformed cells (Appendix: Interlabstudy Marbug Plate Reader.xlsx), following the protocol.                  After sending our data over to team Marburg our collaboration was completed successfully.                  During the whole InterLab study communication via Facebook and E-Mail was always very pleasant and purposeful.                  Team Marburg used to ask about our accomplishments in the lab and replied quickly when there were any problems at any time.                  All in all, carrying out the growth curve experiment with iGEM team Marburg and                  being able to work with V. natriegens for the first time was both intriguing and exciting for us.

2. Calculation of the Minimum Free Energy Change of Stemloop Formation[3]
Assume i.j is the closing base pair of the loop
G（i,j）= min { GH ( i , j ) , GS( i , j ) + G ( i + 1 , j – 1 ) , GBI( i , j ) } ;
GBI ( i , j ) = min{ gbi( i , j , k , l ) + G( k , l ) } for all  0 < k – i + l – j - 2 < max_size
G(i,j) is the minimum free energy change of stemloop formation. GH is the free energy change to form a hairpin loop. GS is the free energy change to form a stack. GBI is to calculate the minimum free energy change of structure containing 2-loop. gbi(i,j,k,l) is the free energy change to form 2-loop.
3.Calculation of T Tail Score
Here we consider 15 nucleotide in the downstream of stemloop. T tail score nT is calculated as follows :
In our program, if the length of the T tail( n ) is less than 15, we will only consider n nucleotides. If TL is more than 15, we will only consider 15 nucleotides.
4.Calculation of Score
Score = nT * 18.16 + deltaG / LH * 96.59 – 116.87
Here nT is T tail score. deltaG is the minimum free energy change of stemloop formation. LH is the length of stemloop.

Newcastle,2018,Team:Newcastle#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," work was very formative and enforced my enthusiasm for plant science and photosynthesis research. My PhD led to a period of postdoctoral research on plant molecular evolution in Prof. Dmitry Filatov’s lab (Oxford) where I began developing my independent research vision to combine evolutionary analysis with my background in photosynthesis and apply this to the evolution of the major CO2 fixing enzyme, Rubisco. In 2013, I was invited by Prof. Spencer Whitney to work in his lab at Australian National University within the Gates funded project 'RIPE: Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency for sustainable increases in crop yield'. Using chloroplast transformation in plants I showed current limitations of interspecies Rubisco translocation and how they could be overcome by co-expressing cognate Rubisco chaperones. Working with RIPE made me aware of global challenges in food security. In September 2017 I started as a Senior Lecturer at Newcastle University.

Improving existing biobricks and project: RNA Reporters for Promoter Activity Measurement
Previously, the Technical University of Denmark 2014 team utilized the tRNALys3-Spinach2.1 (BBa_K1330000) for measurement of the Anderson promoter library. Due to the illegal site of the Spinach2 sequence, they designed the Spinach2.1 RNA Reporter which has lower fluorescence than the original Spinach2.
Despite the brightness of Spinach2, It has a melting temperature of 38°C. This means the characterization of heat-induced promoters is not favored by using this reporter. On the other hand, our collaborating partner NUS iGEM 2018 is trying to develop a RNA reporter connected with the chaperone promoter phtpG.
To overcome the obstacle of (1) brightness and (2) temperature sensitivity, we constructed 3 new RNA aptamers for the iGEM registry, all using the tRNALys3 scaffold of the original biobrick. The biobricks include miniSpinach, iSpinach and dimeric Broccoli. Their in vivo fluorescence are tested in E. coli.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#20 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," it is as such, but my guess is that different type of cells absorb different amount of wavelengths.
2. The fluorescent levels of the cells that were grown for an extra 5 hours in the shaker were lower than the cells that grew in the plate reader, except for the cells that were diluted with fresh LB media. As above, I do not know the exact reason. Perhaps it is because the cells have already reached their 16~20 hours of growing overnight, growing for an extra 5 more hours at 37˚C killed the bacteria, decreasing the production of GFP, while the growth of the cells that were stored in the plate reader for an extra 5 hours slowed down due to a relatively colder temperature, thus being able to produce GFP more stably.  As for the diluted cells with R0040+GFP, because they were transferred to a fresh media before the additional growth of 5 hours, storing them in the shaker at 37˚C led to faster replication, which sped up the production of GFP, while storing them in the colder plate reader slowed down the replication, which slowed the production of GFP.
2. Sequencing results
The sequencing results of Pqrr4+B0034+K082003 came back today. Unfortunately, B0034 was still not there despite the change of Pqrr4+B0034 colonies from C9 to C1. Surprisingly, the sequence for the previous construction that used Pqrr4+B0034 C9 actually match the sequence that came back today, which used Pqrr4+B0034 C1. (99% match) The following is the alignment of the two sequences:
>lcl|28877  Length=801
Score = 1472 bits (797),  Expect = 0.0 Identities = 800/801 (99%), Gaps = 1/801 (0%) Strand=Plus/Plus

Workshop
September 16, 17, 18, 2014
An intensive course, Where Science encounters Arts: BioArt: Painting with E. coli ink, was held at KIT. iGEM members served as TAs and gave lectures on BioArt. Participating students first learned how to cultivate GFP expressing E. coli, formulate the ink and in the subsequent workshop they created their artwork on their own.
Day 1:  A lecture on the basics of science of BioArt and how to actually create BioArt work.
Day 2:  Students created their own artwork in groups.
Day 3:  Critiques of the works and an announcement of awardees.
Groups in workshop consisted of students of biology major and those of design major. Students of biology major were thrilled to see artistic works. For most of the design course students, this was the first time to learn about biology. They were excited to exchange inputs from different perspectives. BioArt served as an excellent tool to connect them with biology. The participants told us how they enjoyed and were thrilled with BioArt.

All lab keys and our office key can be found in our own locker. Ask Julian for the numbers of the combination lock!
6.) Time table
We agreed on creating an overall time table that will be uploaded into the Dropbox and updated so that everybody knows exactly what has been done so far in     the lab and has to be done in the next days!
7.) Lab equipment lending
At least one person of each group has to come tomorrow 17th March at 10:30 p.m. to lend lab equipment the groups will need the     next weeks.

Missing: Sindhu
1.) Sponsors:
We need to wait 2 weeks until we hear from the GZMB about funding. This means we will have to pay the late fee for iGEM. Any sponsor bills for sponsors we     find until then will be held back until we have a thumbs up from the GZMB funding.
Avi will put a new file with sponsors into the Dropbox, to see if everyone can edit it. The list will be updated with additional contacts
Debbie has received two no answers and no other replies.
Julian: No news from Sparkasse, another contact will be updated once he can reach Prof. Stülke
Add more local sponsors
Joschy will call his own sponsors, who haven't replied
Will ask Verena to contact VW again, but without calling it sponsoring (differences in taxation)
2.) Lab updates:
D: growing bacteria is tricky; two of 4 cultures may be growing but are very slow. They were plated on solid medium in order to see if they will grow there.     The first media and trace elements didn't work. But have been redone now. The two cultures that have grown so far will also be extracted (tomorrow).
E1: designed primers for esterase and phosphatase in order to fuse it with dockerin and plasmid. The plasmid has a His-tag. Tomorrow they will do the first PCR     with the primers for the phosphatase. Will ask Gabrielle about Cycler.
E2: nothing so far.
3.) Website:
Alex, who studies economical informatics, has joined our team and will work on the website and help with the Wiki. Julian will contact Cedric about login     for the website. All company logos shall be added to the Dropbox when they are received.

MIT,2010,Team:MIT bioethics_-_-_TEXT.html," intellectual property space.    Co-founder, president, and COO of Advanced Tissue Sciences, Inc., Gail Naughton made it a point to secure core technology. ""We have very strong patents that we defend,"" says Naughton. ""Getting the patents was always among the first three issues on which we spent a lot of time and talent. We kept abreast of all the new inventions at universities.”
However, the very same bioprospecting that made biotechnology so spectacularly successful cannot be said about its latest conception: synthetic biology. The life sciences' next transformative innovation, synthetic biology facilitates not just the transferring of segments of DNA among organisms but the complete redesign and construction of biological systems via entirely artificial genetic circuits from a toolkit of standardized biological parts.   Through the rational and systematic design of biological systems to display functions not found in nature, synthetic biology promises to produce pharmaceuticals, cure cancer, and generate post-petroleum fuels- all remarkable assertions reminiscent of those made a generation ago at the start of the biotechnology boom. This time, however, inventors and entrepreneurs cannot simply rely on patents to facilitate industry growth.
The emergence of such a new technology raises the question of whether the patent system, historically designed to protect mechanical and chemical products, is suitable to protect inventions in fields as new as synthetic biology. Adopting common practice in other engineering disciplines, synthetic biology standardizes genetic analogues to logic gates, oscillators, and circuit components.   This process of standardization lays the template for the creation of truly artificial, man-made biological circuits to act in a rationally designed way. DNA is used to make parts; parts are assembled into devices; devices are assembled to make systems. This hierarchy in design introduces roadblocks in a product's path to commercialization. “A product generated by synthetic biology [...] can involve hundreds of different parts that [...] might all be protected by different patents that are probably held by several rights holders, thereby creating a so-called patent thicket,” wrote Berthold Rutz, a patent examiner specializing in synthetic biology.   Specifically, as new technologies build upon old technologies, they become necessarily more complex, and as a result, are often subject to the protection of multiple patents, spanning both the new and old technologies. This effect, known as the tragedy of the anticommons, guarantees that everyone- the patent holders, manufacturers, and consumers- who could have benefited from the technology loses.
Moreover, the interdisciplinary nature of synthetic biology requires patent offices to be proficient in a multitude of technical domains from computer science to nanotechnology, resulting not only in a shortage of synthetic biology examiners but"

British_Columbia,2018,Team:British Columbia#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," if all previous steps had been successful, you would apply to make your compound an investigational new drug in the regional body of your country of interest. If this application were successful, you would proceed to clinical trails, of which there are 3 phases. These trials are generally extremely expensive and to move from phase 2 to 3, most groups require a large company to act as a sponsor due to the phase’s otherwise prohibitive cost. In phase 1, you would perform toxicity tests in humans and identify the dose to use in further experiments. Phase 2 would test efficacy in a small sample and phase 3 would test efficacy in a large sample. If your drug was successful in all of these phases, you could then apply to bring your drug to market. Overall, this interview emphasized how long and arduous of a process it is to bring a new therapeutic to market. Outside of drug development, Dr. Murad emphasized the importance of tailoring your speech to your audience (including investors). He also expressed that people outside of science often don’t have a good idea of what a scientist’s average workday looks like. In his view the starting idea of a project is important, but you have to package it well and put it in context to make it meaningful.
A: This interview identified and crystallized the difficulty of developing therapeutic drugs for our team. In our earlier interview with Dr. Yadav, he mentioned that our product had two valuable parts: the product and the system. In otherwords, both Kaempferol production and our coculture system were key selling points of our project. The interview with Dr. Murad showed us that it would be exceptionally difficult to examine Kaempferol’s potential as a drug in the context of a 1-2 year iGEM project. With this in mind, we will instead try to highlight the usefulness of our coculture system.

A: When going into the interview the UBC iGEM team anticipated that we would receive information about how we approach making our own journalism piece for our iGEM project and any tips and tricks from a science journalist who has varying experiences in curating a piece through interviews, e-mails, and parsing through appropriate research articles. We were also wanting him to provide us information about how to interview other individuals in the science field and how we would accurately and precisely receive the information we need through an interview and efficiently conduct several when writing our journal piece.

Leukemia is a serious disease and its remedy has been never found yet. People are afraid of it not only because it is incurable but also it is unpredictable what will happen and when it will happen. Patients have to put up with both of them.
Here we propose the convenient testing kit for leukemia which makes its symptom visible. To accomplish this we are developing leukemia disease models in ''Drosophila''. The usefulness of this kit will be evaluated by characterizing the ''Drosophila'' model. This kit may provide a guideline to overcome fear and pain which have not been immeasurable and relieve the fear for leukemia.
Our team, KIT-Kyoto challenges making a leukemia disease model in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. ''Drosophila'' is being used as many hereditary disease model because over 70% of known human disease genes have similarities to Drosophila genes.
This year, we focus on a leukemia in which the etiology and the therapy have not been established. We therefore decided to make a leukemia disease model in ''Drosophila''. We insert human leukemia genes into ''Drosophila'' genome and also fuse a green fluorescent protein(GFP) with a leukemic protein to monitor its expression in ''E. coli'' or ''Drosophila''. We expect that establishing a leukemia disease model in ''Drosophila'' will be a first step to determine the etiology and to establish the method of therapy in the future.

Printing prices are estimated with Cura, actual cost may differ concerning your choice of filament and such.
How to print
We decided to use ABS plastic because of its better mechanical strength towards PLA. Our print settings are optimized for that.  It uses Cura's ""high quality"" setting with all standard settings, except for the heating bed temperature that was set up to 100°C. We printed with a 0.4 mm nozzle on Kapton foil, which makes the material stick, but also easy to remove when cold. Additionally, we dabbed the foil in acetone dissolved ABS, to make it stick even better. All parts were printed with standard 20% infill, except for the connector, that was printed with 100% infill.

I.Can’t use ‘TaKaRa-One Step SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit II’,cause our sample is DNA.
II.We forgot to add ‘PrimeScript Enzyme Mix’ at the beginning,which may cause inaccurate results.
III.We forgot to change pipette tips during the dilution,which may bring huge deviation.
IV.Two-step PCR has a low amplification efficiency in our experiment.To increase the efficiency,we need to use three-step PCR.

5 Marketing Plan
Industry Description
Our product is applicable to two industries: eduction and small-scale research. The biotechnology education market is steadily increasing as new discoveries come to light and equipment costs decrease. As biotechnology becomes more relevant to daily life, interest in biotechnology eduction has surged, from GFP transformation kits to participating in iGEM Highschool . There is also a growing applicability of biotechnology in a variety of contexts, from textile restoration to citizen science.
Target Markets
We have identified three markets: Education, Citizen Science and Field Research.
Education: Our primary market is science education in UK secondary schools. At present, schools are reported to have too little equipment for effective practical work and unable to offer a full range of practical lessons.  Better science laboratory facilities in schools should be a top priority . New facilities enable the pupils to gain a better understanding of the subject through more ‘hands on’ experience .
Field Research: A range of fields, from textile conservation to evolutionary biology, require the use of biotechnology, in particular PCR.
Citizen Science: Citizen scientists is a term used to described amateur or nonprofessional scientists that has gained popularity in recent years, including in research , science magazines and the maker community . As it is is difficult to estimate an accurate figure of molecular biology citizen scientists, we choose to approximate the size of a group by using the example of the DIYBio network. DIYBio presents a growing citizen science community of molecular biologists, biotechnologists and bioartists. Projects range from microbe mapping to yeast printing . DIY Science can be considered as an alternative approach to scientific experimentation . One common barrier is access to the technology, where cost and skills are both problems.
Market Analysis
As of January 2013 there are 3,281 state-funded secondary schools in the UK with approximately 3.2 million pupils. Science departments receive £9.89 per pupil . Schools submit yearly budgets on the July 31 . This results in approximately 32 million pounds allocated yearly towards secondary school science education.
We choose to approximate the citizen science group by examining the DIYBio network. As of October 2013, there are 42 groups DIYBio"

Galilea 2000 institution
In the Galilea 2000 institution, an informative talk was given to people who have gone through or continue to go through very complicated situations in their lives, from economic to health situations, to which they are supported with follow-up and specialized help.
The talk was with the intention of complementing the help they receive, because when talking about diseases that are not always visible (such as depression and anxiety) people could realize the seriousness of these problems, they were also given information that I could channel them to an expert on the subject if they had the symptoms that were mentioned.
Informative talk in a  school
Due to the stigma that exists in subjects of genetically modified organisms (GMO) and the lack of knowledge that usually exists in primary and secondary schools, an informative talk was given to 80 students with the intention of eradicating misconceptions about these topics.
The reaction of the children was incredible since they presented genuine interest in the topics and saw how many products they enjoy today thanks to science and biotechnology.
Movie against depression
The film ""It's kind of a funny story"" was screened to university students with the intention of showing the optimistic side of the coin. That is to say, that after depression there is always more in our life and with the necessary help it is possible to leave that episode of our life to be able to enjoy the whole story.
The film was able to achieve this reflection in the attendees.
Panel with experts
A panel with experts was developed in which students and parents attended to have a clearer idea of topics that are often taboo to society, such as depression and anxiety.
Expert psychologists solved doubts of the assistants and clarified the most important points about these diseases, being able to eliminate disinformation in the group of people that attended. Thanks to the assistance of the experts, it can be guaranteed that the information was reliable.
Information and awareness campaigns
Informative and awareness campaigns were carried out on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, to publicize our project and"

ZJU-China,2016,Team:ZJU-China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," products can be transported or not depends on their staff’s inspection. They will provide on-site service.
    c. There are no specific regulations towards biological products.
 
Scanner seller
    We found a scanner seller online. On the online shop, we could only find hand-held metal detector which can only detect metal products. The inspection machine used in the train station and airport can not be sold online.
 
Reflection
 
    We do not deny the possibility that our investigation is not general and complete enough. However, according to what we got so far, the regulation of biological products transportation is still not so clear to the public. We attributes this to the lack of popularization in biology field, which make the public do not have comprehensive understanding of biological products, and always get misled. The relevant department are aware of that, and choose to avoid public panic by control biological products in an inconspicuous way sometimes (such as do not announce the emergency plan for biological products leak), while the regulations are still sound.
    The field of synthetic biology is expanding and the industrialization of it is paid more and more attention. According to this trend, the policy maker should pay more attention to the regulation of biological products transportation on the one hand, for it might be a double-edged sword. On the other hand, we have to admit that the education for the public is still not enough, and more public engagement activities are needed.

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams.

Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse the degradation of the dxCas9 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 6% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol.The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:
Figure Different sample gel preparation conditions. 12% SDS PAGE of dxCas9 (expected size 158.3kDa)  Lane 1 molecular ladder (kDa), lane 2 95 deg C 60min, lane 3 95 deg C 30min, lane 4 95 deg C 15min, lane 5 95 deg C 5min, lane 75 deg C 7min, lane 7 No boiling, lane 8 molecular ladder (kDa).
On the 6% tris-glycine SDS PAGE a single band for dxCas9 was observed for all conditions, suggesting that the double band might be some artifact of the 12% SDS PAGE. To further confirm these results, both bands from the 12% gel were excised and sent for mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry confirmed that both bands were full length dxCas9 with both the N and C terminal intact. This concluded that there was not any protease digestion and that the results are potentially due to a gel artifact. As a result, the purification will continue.

This year our team consisted of 8 molecular biologists, a life scientist, a computer scientist, a forensic scientist, a chemical engineer and an English student. We bring different branches of expertise together and are a true example of an interdisciplinary team. We decided on our project idea during April, after months of intense and independent discussions. Unless otherwise stated, all the experiments, constructs, code, wiki and results documented on our Wiki were performed, written and collected by the Sensynova team.

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#SYNENERGENE#Application Scenario_-_-_TEXT.html," in the environment we are attempting to protect. Our first line of defense would the build of the phosphorus reclamation module (PRM), the beads used to hold and suspend the bacteria need to be engineered and refined to reduce the risk of leaching (bacteria escaping). Filters would be installed on the input and output flows of the PRM. Both to prevent sediment build up in the filter housing and to prevent bacteria from being released through the output.
Our team has considered the practical and theoretical constraints of a kill switch capable of causing self-destruction if the integrity of the PRM becomes compromised. This killswitch would lower the likelihood that a viable cell could escape the PRM and propagate in the wild. While be believe in reducing the risk of release, cell or colonies do not appear to pose as huge a risk as the engineered system might.
Dual-Use Technology: In the most simple terms, our project takes a resource (Phosphorus in the form of orthophosphate) that is dispersed in the environment and collects it into a highly concentrated form. This allows it to be more useful, removes it from the environment, and increases the value of the concentrated product. However this can pose several obvious risks of abuse.
Calcium phosphate (commonly found in rock deposits), can be mixed with carbon and heated to produce White Phosphorus (also called yellow phosphorus or tetraphosphorus) which was used in smoke, tracer, illumination, and incendiary munitions. There has been debate on whether munitions of this type qualify as incendiary weapons, which are prohibited by Protocol III of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (part of the well known Geneva Convention). While smoke munitions, the most common use of phosphorus, are given an exception for use, the danger still remains that the collected phosphate may be a target for those seeking to do harm.
Munitions aren’t the only dangerous use of this collected phosphorus. The collected phosphorus could be used for the result it was built to avoid. Accidental (or intentional) release of concentrated phosphorus could spur algae blooms in the region our system is in place to protect, as phosphorus is generally the limiting resource, this creates a vulnerability in our system as any puncture of the storage container could result in contamination of the body of water.
Our system was designed to collect phosphorus, however we acknowledge that this system can be applied to collect other chemicals or nutrients of interest. Our model could be used to collect herbicides, harmful chemicals, and could be used in consort with other iGEM projects such as the 2013 project of"

BACKGROUND
Although the iGEM competition for high schools has existed since 2011, there has been low involvement around the world. We believe that many students would be interested in participating but do not know that the competition exists or are unsure about starting an iGEM team. Most of the high school lack the resources, funding or contacts with research labs to start a research project around synthetic biology.
AIMS
The main objective is to promote the iGEM High School competition. We want to create an easy-to-use and cohesive platform that encapsulates video, text and interactive tools. Moreover, by this, promoting Synthetic Biology education and developing a dynamic community and network able to support the platform after the 2014 Jamboree
ACHIEVEMENTS
Created a MOOC with 21 lessons to help high school students build a team
More than 50 people annotated text in Genius and 15 teachers will use the tool next year
20 organizations and iGEM teams around the world have agreed to promote it
A student club was created in CRI (Paris) to continue the support for MOOC iGEM HS

7. Characterize an existing part
BBa_K309007 (Please click the part number to see more details.)
Since our project also focus on Optogenetics, we want to express channelrhodopsin in C.elegans. There are many kinds of channelrhodopsin now, but we want to start with the most traditional one, ChR1 or ChR2. Then we search in the iGEM database and we find this part submitted by iGEM10_Queens-Canada. The iGEM10_Queens-Canada focus on establishing some basic parts for later users to use in C.elegans. So we decide to make use of this part, not only establish our own project but also test this part and characterize it. However, we find it being defined as ""sample It's complicated"" by iGEM. What’s more, there are no samples of that part are available in distributions. So we choose to have the part synthesized according to the sequence submitted by iGEM10_Queens-Canada. And we have YFP in our lab in Tongji University, so we use overlapping PCR to link the sequence of YFP and ChR2, thus constructing a fusion protein, ChR2-YFP.
We ligate pmyo2-ChR2-YFP and pmyo3-ChR2-YFP into PPD95.75. Then we micro-inject the PPD95.75-pmyo2-ChR2-YFP and PPD95.75-pmyo3-ChR2-YFP into the C.elegans. All the results of our testing on C.elegans( pmyo2-ChR2-YFP) and C,elegans( pmyo2-ChR2-YFP) are displayed on BBa_K309007 .

Peking,2012,Team:Peking#Project#Communication#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ck, the light emitting related genes are placed under the pBAD promoter, and the cells are able to produce relatively strong blue-green light under the induction of L-arabinose. Therefore, we decided to use this part to construct light emitting cell for bio-luminescence communication.
Figure 1. TOP10 cells transformed with luxbrick which is a biobrick constructed by Cambridge 2010 iGEM team
Set-up
The next issue we placed our focus on is how to build a device to enable cells to talk through light in an easily observable way. To obtain this goal, we first had to solve some problems:
1) As the intensity of bacteria luminescence may not be high enough, we had to place light emitting cells and the sensing cells in close proximity. However, it has better not mix the cells together due to the need to observe the reaction of the sensor cells separately.
2) The light emitting reaction highly depended on the availability of O2 in the environment. Therefore, our means of maintaining the concentration of O2 was an important issue.
3) As our light sensing cell is very sensitive, which has been shown in the characterization of our Luminesensor, it’s important to exclude the influence of other sources light.
To solve the problem of O2 maintenance, we decided to put the light emitting cell in a conical flask and keep fresh air pumping into the culture. We put a test tube containing light sensing cell in the conical flask, immersing the sensor cell culture into the light emitting cell to keep them in close proximity. To exclude the influence of the other sources of light in the environment, the whole set-up was wrapped tightly with aluminum foil. Finally, the whole set-up was kept on a shaking incubator at 30oC. The set-up is shown in the figure below:

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," difference to the tree structure (Huffman code of each node) if they are exchanged. Hence, several equivalent chains should be matched to a certain set of chains in the species only once.
The algorithm of species matching is of the most importance since it provides technical support for structure-based description of species and reactions. It costs most of the running time. We will try to increase the efficiency of the codes of this part.
Generation of products based on reaction templates
Within MoDeL definitions, product templates are composed of both ST parts and NST parts. The ST parts are all transfered from reactants or modifiers. A transfer table is defined in each reaction template to label where does each ST part comes from and goes to. It seems to be very easy to generate Chain-Node structure of products from reactants and mod modifiers based on the transfer table. However, it doesn't.
Consider first a template reaction with one reactant, X-A-B-Y, where A and B are both NST parts and X and Y are both ST parts with type ANY. If it could be digested by a certain enzyme, the products should be X-A and B-Y. In the real biological system, if there is a species with structure C-A-B-C, where the first part C and the last C binds to form a tree node. If we try to digest the A-B bond, the species would not be split into two pieces as expected because the two products are connected by the tree node. To generate the structure of products correctly, we design a three-step mix-trim-split algorithm to solve this problem.
Mixing, trimming and splitting: three-step algorithm to generate products.
The first step is to mix reactants and products. The mixture includes all chains of reactants except for those which are matched to the templates as well as all trees. It also includes all chains and trees of products. And now we have a mixed species with chains and trees from different sources. It is worth noting that chains and trees of modifiers will not be added into the mixture. The next step is to trim the trees. Trees with leaf nodes that are not defined in chains will be removed from the forest. The last step is to split the products out from the mixture. This is because the mixture may not be one standalone complex. For example, it may have two unbound and uncorrelated chains. In other words, some chains that are not connected with others via tree nodes should not be incorporated into other species. The final standalone split species are real products in the system.
We provide an example to illustrate the product-generating procedure. The reactant has"

Overview
We constructed several genetic circuit either to act as sensors or act as expression device. Through our visit to Qiumei's Lab in Hangzhou, we gained priceless data concerning the salt content of their products. You have already seen nitrite natural decomposition rate, we will use that information as working environment for our several sensors. We also will include the nitrate content information in their products to be used as working environment for our several sensors. We constructed and standardized several expression device as well, some we tested, some we didn't. By submitting parts to registry, we hope latter years' iGEM teams can further our research and pick up some of our characterization to be used in  their own design.

The main goal of the iGEM NU Kazakhstan team 2018 was not only to create the cyanobacteria which can transform toxic hydrogen sulfide compound to elemental sulfur and hydrogen gas in laboratory conditions but also to investigate how to integrate this project in the real industrial situations.
Kazakhstan is commonly known to be the major producer of oil in the world; it has an enormous amount of oil resources: 30 billions of barrels, 172 oilfields, 1.8% of global oil reserves [1]. The figures speak for themselves, and Kazakhstan tries to fully use its potential. However, the major problem of an oil refinery which challenges not only our country but also other global oil exporters is the presence of hydrogen sulfide in crude oil. Decayed organic matter (kerogen), which is trapped in sedimentary rocks, serves as the main reagent of thermal conversion, in which the oil is formed as a major product. Kerogen, which is highly concentrated with sulfur, releases hydrogen sulfide during the reaction and this gas stays in crude oil.
Hydrogen sulfide is highly toxic gas, which in high concentrations can interfere with the organism’s capability of cellular respiration. The human body can block its effect by transforming it into sulfate, using hemoglobin-bound enzymes of blood or liver cells. However, when the concentration of hydrogen sulfide is too high, the organism’s ability of detoxification is overwhelmed and it eventually leads to death. Besides these health risks, the presence of H2S in the oil can lead to the corrosion of pipes and it is of the high cost to replace them periodically.
Our team decided to know more about the process of hydrogen sulfide purification and details related to the integration of the project by contacting with the variety of industrial companies in Astana, Atyrau and Almaty. Our team representatives met with one of the largest oil company directors in Atyrau, as they are located there and most of Kazakhstan’s oil reserves are from the Atyrau region. Below you can see the list of meetings and some outcomes of these meetings.

Protocol for amyloid protein verification
Fig 1.2: We set MG1655 Wild Type as positive control group, ΔCsgA-MG1655 with pET28a plasmid as negative control group, ΔCsgA-MG1655 with Ptac promoter-CsgA-SpyTag as experiment group.
We discover [Fig1.2] that colonies of CsgA-SpyTag and the positive group show similar color and spreading pattern, while the colonies of the negative control group was colored to dark purple. Thus, our CsgA-SpyTag amyloid protein was successfully expressed.
We designed another experiments to measure the capture ability of CsgA–SpyTag [Fig 1.3]. We used sfGFP – SpyCatcher protein as the indicator [Fig 1.4]. Gene CsgA on the plasmid of pET28a was transferred in to ΔCsgA-MG1655 as control group. Gene CsgA – Spytag on the plasmid of pET28a was transferred in to ΔCsgA-MG1655 as experimental group. We used a sfGFP – SpyCatcher protein containing reaction stock, of which the fluorescence is measured, to react with the palette of both groups for 1 hour. Then, we centrifuged the reaction system and measure the fluorescence of the supernatant. The decrease of florescence indicated the amount of sfGFP – SpyCatcher protein the biofilm captured.

As can be seen from the result, the experiment group showed the most decrease of sfGFP-SpyCatcher protein. The difference between the control group and experiment group is significant. Thus we can confirm our CsgA-SpyTag system is functional.
After that, we test our biofilm’s ability to attach to surfaces for our hardware design. We induce ΔCsga-MG1655 with Ptac promoter-CsgA-SpyTag while PHA plastic beads were also soaked in the culture [Fig 1.6]. The"

Safety
To avoid confusion about the terms ""biosecurity"", ""biosafety"" and ""biohazard"", some people gave a definition of each of these terms.
✵ Biosafety describes principles, technologies and containment practices put in place to avoid accidents and unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins.
✵ Biosecurity describes the protection measures put in place and management of important biological materials in laboratories, in order to prevent them from being accessed without authorization.
✵ Biohazard includes, in this case, both biosafety and biosecurity.
Reference : http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/Biosecurite-dans-les-laboratoires
The team who worked in the lab received instructions of lab safety with safety training. We learned how to act in the case of an accident, where to find emergency showers, fire extinguishers and emergency doors. Some basic safety requirements were discussed such as wearing gloves and a lab coat for most procedures. In some cases, during the use of ethidium bromide, nitrile gloves are mandatory. Other experiments must be conducted with safety glasses. It is also recommended to wear clothes offering a minimum of protection. We also learned about working with chemical products and how to dispose of them. Most products used are classified as non-hazardous (even for the sulfation protocol). Chemical products are just irritants and so need to be handled with gloves. In the lab, there is a specific solvent cabinet for liquid wastes. Moreover, all biological waste will be autoclaved before disposal. All work is done on benches or under open-front hoods.
Since we worked with non-toxic organisms as Escherichia coli (DH5α) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Invsc1), all waste that has been in contact with bacteria was put to bacterial waste in aseptic conditions but no specific security procedures needed to be put in place.

After confirmation of the construct, Kozak Sequence – FadR coding sequence – NLS was cloned into pEGFP-N1 that contains mammalian constitutive CMV promoter. The pFadBA promoter and FadR protein constructs were to be co-transfected in HEK293FT cell and selected using different drug selection markers – Puromycin for BBa_J176171 and Neomycin for pEGFP-N1.
After co-transfection of two constructs to HEK cell, no EGFP signal could be detected from fadBA promoter construct. We believed that even though we have introduced Kozak and nuclear leader sequences to protein coding sequence, difference in prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription mechanism gives fadR protein low possibility to be expressed in mammalian cell.
After transfecting to mammalian cells, these promoters will be induced by Fatty Acids or its oxidation products, leading to expression of EGFP. By comparing the image of the intensity of EGFP using Fluorescent microscopy, we will be able to quantify their expression and determine the desired sensing mechanism which is most efficient for Glyoxylate genes expression.

Both transformations were a success, as can be seen in the above photograph.
Stochastic Switch Team
Goksel and Jess are all prepared for the Bacillus subtilis transformation procedure with these solutions made up
Today we are trying to transform Bacillus subtilis with pGFP-rrnB integration vector. Metal sensor team kindly inoculated B. subtilis cells into flask tubes and placed them into the shaking incubator. We labelled them as 1,2,3 and control.
We prepared four plates
LB + Bsubtilis (+ Control, cells should grow on this plate)
LB + CHL + B. subtilis (- control, cells will not grow on this plate)
LB + CHL + B. subtilis + plasmid DNA(Cells should transform with the DNA)
LB + CHL + B. subtilis + diluted plasmid DNA (Cells should transform with the DNA)
2xcompetence medium and 2xstravation medium were prepared.
We used the 2nd and the 3rd tubes for the tests
Incubated the samplesfor three hours at 37C
Added the starvation medium and incubated for another 2 hours
For each of the two cultures, added 0.4ml of the final solution from the culture and 10ul of DNA into an eppendorf tube.
Placed the tubes in the shaking incubator for an hour. To do this we taped the tubes to the base of the incubator. N.B- Chris in the lab swapped the temperatures of the incubators, so we used the one that is opposite the -80 freezer. The starter overnight cultures are also in this incubator -these are labelled 1,2,3 control (we used 2 and 3).
The cultures were plated out using glass beads and put in the 37 incubator.
Sporulation Tuning/Chassis Team
Today, we made our first attempt to recover the cwlD spores which were kindly sent to us by Anne Moir from Sheffield University as mentioned on the 4th of August.

     First of all, we used DPV to check whether our bio-sensor can detect curcumin. As we mentioned above, DPV method tested the current change when curcumin binding. Therefore, we compared the two kinds of chips, the red line was the general chips, and the blue line was the chips modified with αS1-casein (Fig. 4). As long as our bio-sensor contacted with the standard samples of curcumin (from Sigma Aldrich), its current value would become larger. We could easily observe that our bio-sensor with αS1-casein produced more fierce Redox reaction than another. Figure 4 also represented that the bio-sensor modified with αS1-casein have more effect of detecting curcumin than none.
Figure 4. Pretest of curcumin bio-sensor in DPV. (Reduction)
Applications
1. Determine Standard Curve and Create the Formula
     We used the standard samples of curcumin and diluted it in dilution buffer. Next, we detected the diluted curcumin samples by curcumin bio-sensor and made the standard curve. Since it was the logarithmic function, we put the curcumin concentration into the natural logarithm, and did the polynomial curve fitting. We obtained the result in Figure 5, R2=0.9995. This represented the prediction of real samples from the following formula was really close to real value.
$$y = -2\cdot 10^{-5}x^5+8\cdot 10^{-4}x^4-0.0127x^3+0.082x^2-0.049x+1.5\cdot 10^{-3}$$

     Our final goal is to predict the concentration of curcumin in real samples by the bio-sensor. Therefore, we prepared the most curcumin content part, the root of turmeric to pretest our bio-sensor. First of all, we milled the turmeric root and divided the powder into two groups. One of them was added with extraction buffer but not underwent the extraction protocol, and the other was added with extraction buffer but underwent the extraction"
UC_Berkeley_Tools,2008,Team:UC Berkeley Tools#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," Figure 6 illustrates Clotho's overall system architecture.
Clotho is based on a core-and-hub system which manages multiple connections, in which each connection serves an independent purpose in a self-sufficient manner. For instance, while one connection may be in charge of viewing/editing a sequence in an ApE -based manner, another connection may connect to databases, and will allow the user to receive and submit parts. Each connection may also perform more integrative tasks by passing data to each other through the core. If a user were working through the sequence view and database manager, for example, then the two connections could talk to each other if the user wished to edit a part in the sequence view and then resubmit the part back to the database.
Clotho Software Architecture : Figure 6
Also of interest is the separation of the individual user interfaces from the connections which provide the functionality. In this way, if the look and feel of Clotho is not right for a particular user, it is much easier for them to create a new visual interface while still reusing the underlying code.
There are many aspects to Clotho shown in Figure 6 . The following sections will describe each of these pieces of Clotho in more detail.
Project Details
Overall Timeline
The Clotho project has its roots in initial conversations between Douglas Densmore and Prof. Chris Voigt at UCSF in the summer of 2007. From these initial meetings it became clear that there was a need for a system to design, manage, and deploy systems based on standard biological parts. This section provides some insight into the progression of this process.

Recently, several studies have shown that non-invasive liquid biopsy methods are a promising way to detect cancer relapse and monitor tumor regression ( Heitzer et al., 2017 ). Liquid biopsies represent a fast, reliable and easy way to obtain samples compared to the invasive nature of solid biopsies which are generally time-consuming, difficult to perform frequently and not without some risks to the patient.

ctDNA - A look at the tumor DNA
Circulating free DNA (cfDNA) is a common term that refers to all the DNA fragments that are present in the blood. This fragmented DNA is thought to originate from apoptotic cells ( Harris et al., 2016 ). In cancer patients the proportion of cfDNAs from necrotic tumor cells - known as “circulating tumor DNA” (ctDNA) -  represents a large part of the circulating DNA.            These short DNA fragments of size ranging from 100bp to 200bp - with a peak at 145bp ( Underhill et al., 2016 ) - contain virtually all the possible genetic defects that can be found in the original tumor cell population, including somatic point mutations and translocations ( Harris et al., 2016 ; Calapre et al., 2017 ). Moreover, literature has shown that levels of ctDNA in the blood are correlated with progression or remission of disease in several cancers, including melanoma ( Gray et al., 2015 ; Girotti et al., 2016 ; Tsao et al., 2015 ; Calapre et al., 2017 ).
Our goal using ctDNA as biomarkers is to come up with a personalized follow-up, and the personalized touch comes back again from our implemented bioinformatic software : Ginga. Indeed, Ginga takes as an input the genetic sequence of the tumor, to generate not only a list of neoantigens that will form the basis of our vaccine , but also a library of another molecular alteration specific to the tumor, namely chromosomal rearrangements, that we will target for relapse detection.
Figure 2. Overview of the release of ctDNA in the blood by necrotic cancer cells. These are, along with some miRNAs, promising biomarkers present in the blood.
Vaccine monitoring through point mutation

From our initial idea, the design of our toehold switches and our model to the future applications of our project, the opinions of specialists have been vital in influencing our work.
Here, we have broken our project down into its different parts. For each, we explain the role feedback played in improving the aspect of the project, and why we changed what we did.

Dr Kirsten Jensen
Our initial constructs used a constitutive promoter. After cloning our construct in pSB1C3 plasmid, we attempted to amplify them in E. coli. However upon sequencing the amplified inserts, none of the sequences were what we expected to find.
We asked Dr Kirsten Jensen, an expert in synthetic biology at Imperial College London for advice. She inspected our sequences and suggested that the transcripts from our constructs were toxic to E. coli. She therefore suggested that we switch our promoter to an inducible promoter to avoid synthesis of the transcript during amplification in E. coli.
Following her advice, we used an arabinose inducible promoter, which resolved the issue for the 15b-5p switches and allowed us to continue with our experiments. However, the 27b-3p switches were still toxic.
See the results page for more details.

Cancer-targeting and invasion module
Type I pilli, surface rod-shaped organelles of 7nm in diameter and 1μm in length, are the best studied system of bacterial adhesion [ 15 ].They are heteropolymers of four proteins with FimA being the main structural protein  of the pilli, which polymerizes approximately 1000 times to form a right-handed helix that constitutes the main axis of the structure and includes smaller concentrations of FimG, FimF and FimH [ 16-18 ]. FimH is the functional component of the structure as it alone confers the ability to bind to a-D-mannose of various eukaryotic cells and is located at the tip and the shafts of the pilus, whereas FimF and FimG seem to be responsible for docking  FimH to FimA [ 19-20 ]. To achieve selective adhesion to colorectal cancer cells using type I pilli we need to disrupt their natural ability to bind to a-D-mannose and introduce a mechanism to facilitate adhesion to CRC cells by a mannose-independent mechanism. A mutation in the 49th amino acid of FimH has been demonstrated to completely abolish mannose binding [ 21 ]. In addition, a small peptide called RPMrel has been identified through phage display assays due to its ability to bind to five different colorectal cancer cell lines as well as cancerous tissues obtained by biopsies and not to other kinds of cancer [ 22 ].  Taken together these two modifications perform both the functions specified for CRC selective binding and have been successfully used by previous iGEM teams, iGEM Harvard 2015 and iGEM Ankara 2016 to that end. We employed the same part BBa_K1850011 that was submitted by iGEM Harvard 2015, in a fimH KO strain. Having achieved selective adhesion"

While waiting for the arrival of a speaker, a discussion about the ethical aspects of the synthetic biology was stimulated. During this exchange between the participants, the iGEM competition was mentioned multiple times as well as the limits between ethics and the desire of innovation.
Attending this symposium was an enriching experience for us because we deepened our knowledge on synthetic biology, we met and discussed with researchers and we received feedback and support for the success of our project!
We are very proud that our project could kindle so much attention, and that's why we worked harder to accomplish our goals.
The Parisian Meet-Up : The European Experience
From left to right : Hiba, Linejy, Heiko (from iGEM Hambourg), Noémie and Maurene
On the first week-end of July, iGEM Bordeaux team went to the European Experience organized by iGEM IONIS and iGEM Evry. We travelled by bus with an iGEMer from iGEM Hambourg, it was nice to share different things during this travel.
The first day in Paris was really amazing, the parisian iGEMers were very well organized. After the breakfest reception, we established our poster and prepared ourselves to present our project Sleep with epicElegans. Many iGEMers came to our poster because they were interested about our project, linking sleep troubles and epigenetics is ambitious. Going to the meeting was interesting for us because we met an insomniac guy who gave us his opinion on our project. We also learned a lot and deeply about his troubles and how a solution as our project could facilitate his life. After our presentations, we enjoyed the posters of the other teams. We were impressed bymany projects, especially :
iGEM Shefield one’s which attracted us, because they designed their poster with Game of Thrones theme. Their project is interesting, they wanted to use E. coli to fight antibiotic resistance. They worked on a system which detect infection from a sample of blody fluid, thus may eliminate wasted uses of antibiotics
iGEM Paris Bettencourt presented a project linked with our region ! They worked on vine stain, they try to build a system which degrade pigment molecules from wine stains. As collaboration with this team, we are going to design and implement a series of assays in order to identify different enzymes and microbes from environmental samples
The lunch break was an occasion to discuss about our experiences and how works each team. We also"

Before producing these parts, assaying their behavior with PCR using 5Prime MM first is a good idea. 5Prime MM should be used for all colony PCRs and all options where extremely high concentrations of highly precise product are not needed.
⇒ To continue the assay, the four lanes corresponding to 5Prime and Phusion were combined, purified, and are being cut with E and S to determine prefix/suffix integrity.
From this, proper bands appear at 260, 170, and 120, indicating the parts have been properly cut and possess correct integrity from the PCR.

⇒ pSB1K3-J04450 BL21 transformation test from 8/12/2011 was successful, yielding red colonies indicative of RFP expression. Lingering concerns about LacI functionality prompts a second transformation with a low copy plasmid carrying RFP.
⇒ Transformed BL21 with J63009-J04450 (plate 1 well 1A of 2011 Spring distribution), it is a low copy fusion plasmid containing the same RFP expression part used in the 8/12/2011 transformation.
⇒ Inoculate 1 mL of BL21 transformed with each His-tagged ZFPs in LB/chloramphenicol, the quality of transformed cells may be sub par as the plates were left in the 37degC incubator for 2 days and for both plates half of the agar is dried.

⇒ Colonies from the ligation were observed, but were few and far between. They will be grown for ~18 hours before colony PCR is attempted.
⇒ PCR was run on a Gli-OmpA hybrid part. Unfortunately, stocks were confused and this part turned out to be OmpA. PCR was re-run on a confirmed correct part, for use in assembly with J04500 via 3a construction.
If all goes according to plan, PCR should become an integral component of cloning efforts. Inserts can be produced in high concentration with no backbone to screen against in 2-3 hours, instead of 16 hour overnights, and purified in 20 minutes instead of miniprepping. Higher concentration of backbone can"

TU_Dresden,2017,Team:TU Dresden#Project#Peptidosomes_-_-_TEXT.html," membrane
As one can clearly see in the images above, some cells are completely or only partially integrated into the membrane of the Peptidosome (Figure 14, B). These cells, which are  found on the outer surface of the membrane, if released, can result in bacterial growth outside of the Peptidosome.
To address this issue, we designed a second growth experiment, in which we also plated the supernatant of each Peptidosome to check the amounts of the ""released"" bacteria.
During this experiment two additional counter measurements were implemented, the first one consisted in adding “washing” step, were the Peptidosomes were transferred twice to fresh media before their incubation. We hypothesized that the bacteria on the outer membrane would be released and left behind in the course of the transfers. The second treatment that we tested consisted in pre-incubating of the Peptidosome in LB broth adjusted to an acid pH, this should guarantee an increased closing of the membrane by triggering the self-assembly of the any unreacted Fmoc-FF solution still present in the Peptidosome membrane.

By introducing the treatments, the number of colonies was dramatically reduced from several hundreds to an average of 0.7 for the washing steps and 1.7 for the low pH treatment (Table 2). From here, we concluded that the washing steps are important to reduce the number of cells released in the supernatant, whereas the treatment with acid broth does not add a significant effect on top of this. By introducing the washing steps and also reducing the concentration of cells in the Peptidosomes, the amount of bacteria present on the outer surface of the membrane was dramatically decreased. We also confirmed this by performing a second round of cryo-SEM, shown below.

Jérôme Bonnet, Gregory Tufo and Volker Döring expressed their views on our project and gave us interesting advices on which applications would be performed thanks to our project.
Pablo Carbonell provided helpful advices about the modelling part of the project.
We received instructions for lab safety and security from Dominique Zeliszewski (iSSB).
Rose Berthomé, Jérémy Armetta and Yanis Khenniche, who were in the Evry Paris-Saclay iGEM team last year, provided critical advices on creating and managing an iGEM team and continuously supported our team.
SPECIAL THANKS
A special thank to Ioana Popescu, who has encouraged the creation of our team and who has been there at every steps of the project. More than a supervisor she provided help and emotional support to us. The success of this project is largely due to her.
A special thank to Manish Kushwaha too for his continuous help during the designing and experimental steps of the project. His knowledge of molecular biology and of modeling has been a real help for the team. We also thank him for correcting our English texts and helping us with scientific vocabulary and communication rules.
We thank Steff Horemans who was there since the first brainstorming of the project and who provided precious advices to manage the team and to get nice results, especially for the Modelling part.
We thank Nazim Sarica who also was there since the beginning too and who helped us in the experimental work. He has been really helpful for debugging some experiments and for understanding implications of our results.
DISTRIBUTION OF THE TASKS
Esteban Lebrun naturally took the lead of the team. With kindness, firmness, and impartiality, he managed to coordinate every pole of the team to build a homogenous project. With the help of Angelo Cardoso Batista, he designed the scientific project (bibliography, constructions). He also helped defining the experimental strategy (workflow, primers, strains…), lead the public relations, took care of most of the administrative tasks, took our photographies and designed the interactive rug. Finally, he continued the BioLab project which was initiated by the last year team.
COMMUNICATION
Suzanne Phengsay was our illustrator and head of the Communication. She designed and drawn all our posters, chibis, banners and goodies. She managed to give a nice visual identity to our team and she directed the social networks. She also contributed to the creation of equipments for the events, such as the"
ASTWS-China,2018,Team:ASTWS-China#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," He listed the ways heavy metal polluted waters could be treated, which are very efficient and environmental friendly already. However, the regular testing of water quality is not as easy as treating them. Especially for those poor villages in the middle of nowhere. They don't have good access to the testing equipment, and they are among the group of people with lest health care in the nation. So we adjusted our design of proposal, changing from Methanibactine synthesis and real-world application to find a more accessible way to moniter copper pollution (by naked eyes).
Visiting local sewage treatment plant
Other than the interview of both professors, we have also visited a local urban sewage treatment plant, to learn the modern treating methods of sewage by bacteria. This urban sewage treatment plant uses bacteria to process the sewage from Hangzhou, which gives us inspiration in designing our own processor for our product. For example, when designing our prototype, we extra added the use of germicidal lamp and the settling basin to eliminate the public fear of bioengineering methods.
Dr. Guanda Lu
Professor from MIT
During the time section of experimenting at Zhejiang University, we are lucky enough to listen to the report of Dr. Lu, a professor from MIT who has extensive experience in the field of synthetic biology, about genetic engineering. We also have asked him for the opinion about our project, such as how does he see the suicide system we designed in our project. Dr. Lu first affirmed our thoughts and pointed out that the design of synthetic biological components must meet the actual needs. Based on his useful advice, we have further improved our project plan, including biosafety of placing the engineered bacteria into environment, further improved the parts design to more closer to actual needs, etc.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Concept1_-_-_TEXT.html,"ity than improve the resistance, we have chosen this last factor for the selection.
At first, we list bacteria presenting a resistance to the immune system. The four most known are:
- Mycobacterium tuberculosis, responsible agent for tuberculosis;
- Legionella pneumophila, responsible agent for Legionnaire's disease;
- Listeria monocytogenes, responsible agent for meningitis;
- Coxiella burnetii, responsible agent for Q fever.
These four are of course highly pathogen, we looked then at their homologous or under-species less pathogen for humans.
Mycobacterium avium (M.avium) is the bacterium which retains the most our attention. This last one belongs to Mycobacterium specie, and more precisely to the Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC).
M. avium is less pathogen than its homologous Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The only clinical manifestations it can induce are: productive cough, tiredness, fever, loss of weight and night sweat. These symptoms result from the colonization of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tractus and the possible diffusion in other parts of the body. Immunocompetent subjects having not a subjacent disease have a low risk to present infection symptoms by M. avium. Epidemiologic reports recently show that we find more and more the presence of M. avium in subjects, notably women who seem to have no pulmonary or immune predisposing trouble. Most of healthy subjects infected by M. avium have a localized infection ; in contrast, we notice infection by M. avium disseminated in an important percentage of patients infected by AIDS (80% of colonized patients), as in other population of which the immune system is deficient, like subjects having a severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome or which received a transplantation and in patients treated by corticosteroids or cytotoxic medicines.
M. avium seems to be one of the most interesting candidates to be the tissue vector. This bacterium resists to immune system and is few pathogen for Man.

Immune system resistance of the tissue vector [3,4,5]
Immune system can be a terrible enemy, detecting and eliminating any element considered as foreign for the organism. Impossible to be stealth to it, it must be “hardened”.
For that the tissue vector has two assets, a system to divert the immune system and a robust wall.
Immune system resistance mechanism
Bacteria like Mycobacterium avium developed resistance strategies highly specific to foil the Immune system .

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#HP#FutureScenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," after the interview we had at the Groninger Archives; Jan Jaap Hoogstins,    collection manager from the Groninger Archieven, explained us that now    most of the documents are being changed from analogous data storage to    digital data storage, and one of two most important things that a    storage system must fulfil is the durability, which means that the information    stored must be conserved for a long period of time.
Spores of Bacillus subtilis are a reliable    option since they have shown its long-term resistance.    Actually, in 2000, a spore-forming Bacillus strain was    isolated from a 250 million years old salt crystals. Moreover, DNA itself is a    more stable data storage medium when compared to magnetic and optical    medial, because it can remain intact for at least 700 000 years at    -4˚C. [3] Even in harsh    environments, DNA has a half-life of over 500 years. [4] Contrastly, current magnetic storers of    information have lasts at most 30 years. [5]
However, is the DNA that contains the encrypted information in bacteria able to mutate through this period of time?
A complete discussion about mutation in Bacillus subtilis spores can be found in the Modelling Section .

Third fictional scenario
This fictional and extreme scenario provides an example of the    future applications of CryptoGErM based on the current files and    archives that have been stored successfully in DNA.
Currently, big companies such as Microsoft® have shown interest in the    storage of information in DNA. This gives us an idea that DNA storing    has started to become one of the most promising methods to store    information in the upcoming years. This is mainly given by the capacity of    storage that DNA posses; Church, Gao and Kosuri showed that 0.5    exabytes of information can be stored per gram of single-stranded    DNA. [6]
A big breakthrough happened in April 2016, when Microsoft published an extensive    paper in a joint project with the University of Washington [7] in which they explore the    potential application for the use of DNA as storage medium.    According to this work, DNA storage has a higher    durability in comparison with current systems. Within the applications    of storing information in DNA, this group stored in a DNA sequence and    recovered succesfully three images that originally were in JPEG format.    This shows that nowadays, it is not only possible to store text and    information as we did in CryptoGEr"

January
Our junior and senior students were attracted by the recruiting announcement for the iGEM 2015 in our university. After several interviews and competitive selections, our team was basically created.
February
Our team was growing. We communicated with previous iGEMers in our school to get more insights into iGEM. Meanwhile, we started to watch successful iGEM cases of previous years.
March
We wandered among wikis and gradually realized what the basic factors are for a good project. Brainstorms and weekly meet-ups promoted us to discover the quintessence of iGEM.
April
We urged ourselves to get deeper insights into those previous cases to catch their inspiration. After meet-ups with teammates and our instructors, a draft idea of a yogurt guarder came to our mind. To make sure our project was worth proceeding, we did a survey to find out how much attention people would pay to the quality of yogurt. Fortunately, we got the expected results, although we knew we still had a long way to go.
May
 
We primarily designed the basic structure of our project. Then we read numerous papers to make an integrated protocol of our lab work.Besides, we visited a dairy factory to learn the microbiological detection methods used in practical production of yogurt. We discovered that our method to be developed should have advantages over the traditional methods, especially in portability. 
In addition, it was essential for us to adapt to the wet lab work. We started with laboratory safety training. With the instruction of our instructors and previous iGEMers, we learned a lot of techniques in molecular biology.
June
With efforts, our wet lab work went smoothly.
July
This month, we organized public activity to popularize the knowledge of yogurt production and its quality inspection, and remind people to store yogurt properly. 
In addition, we did a survey to confirm the key factors which will attract customers’ attention if our yogurt guarder is developed into a real product. 
August
On 13th-15th, we attended the summit of Central China iGEM Consortium held by Peking University. We shared our experience with other teams and really learned a lot from other teams. Here we want to express our sincere thanks to them! 
Meanwhile, our lab works still proceeded. We encountered difficulty in the electrotransformation of bacteria, which delayed our project but was eventually resolved after multiple attempts.
September
Time flies. We seized the time to make everything done and put great efforts to the wiki building and preparation for the Giant Jamboree.
