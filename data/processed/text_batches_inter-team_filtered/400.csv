At last, for the upper level, the potential topologies are selected also with genetic algorithm. And the fitness functions are the similarity between the dynamic behaviors and the target, which are measured by the standard error.
Optimization Processes of GA
Step1: Randomly generate a population of topologies.
Step2: For each topology, generate a population of networks with a serial of random interaction forms.
Step3: For each network, obtain the fitness score by optimize the parameters.
Step4: Obtain the fitness score of a topology by searching the most favorable network.
Step5: Evolutes the topologies with each fitness score.
Parameter For GA
Population: the number of members in one generation
Mutation ratio: the ratio of each gene alter its status in a generation
Recombine ratio: the ratio that whether a gene change with its allel in mating
Max_cycle: the maximum number of generations considered for the evolution
Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO)
Introduction to PSO
What's PSO
Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) is an optimization algorithm based on swarm intelligence theory. Motivated by the evolution of nature, a series of evolutionary computation techniques, such as evolutionary programming, genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies, are proposed, in which a best solution is evolved through the generations. In contrast to evolutionary computation techniques, Eberhart and Kennedy developed a different algorithm through simulating social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. In a particle swarm optimizer, instead of using genetic operators, individual swarms are evolved through cooperation and competition. Each particle adjusts its flying according to its own flying experience and its companions' flying experience. The position of each particle represents a potential solution to a problem.
The following is excerpt from"" http://www.swarmintelligence.org/ "", it shows clearly how PSO works: ""Each particle keeps track of its coordinates in the problem space which are associated with the best solution (fitness) it has achieved so far. (The fitness value is also stored.) This value is called pbest. Another ""best"" value that is tracked by the particle swarm optimizer is the best value, obtained so far by any particle in the neighbors of the particle. This location is called lbest. when a particle takes all the population as its topological neighbors, the best value is a global best and is called gbest.
The particle swarm optimization concept consists of, at each time step, changing the velocity of (accelerating) each particle toward its pbest and lbest locations (local version of PSO). Acceleration"
SDSZ_China,2018,Team:SDSZ China#cf_-_-_TEXT.html,", we used chitosan to produce all kinds of products from drugs to cosmetics. But there were too many risks.” He explained to us that the current industrial production method—using concentrated hydrogen chloride and sodium hydroxide—imposes a lot of danger on the factory workers operating the machine. Moreover, the industrial wastes that comes with the production was too much for them to treat.
Despite that it differs from what we have expected initially, we have benefited a lot from this trip. We have identified safety and sustainability as two issues we should address with our design. Treating crystalized chitin with enzymes produces little side product but some harmless organic acetic salts. By incorporating our system into a machine that monitors the fermentation process automatically, we have also minimized casualty potentials.

Influence of Primary School Experience on our Experiments
When we gave the lecture in the Beijing 2nd primary school, the kids there left us deep impression. They were so eager to learn more about what we introduced. For most of them, it may be the first time for them to learn synthetic biology. Even if some concepts for them may be hard to understand, their curiosity to the beautiful natural world, their passions to synthetic biology, and their dreams to their promising future impressed us a lot. As the presenters for the lecture, this experience made the reminiscence of our childhood, when we were curious to the biology. We were eager to utilize the microscopes, to observe the behaviors of different insects, and to combine different chemical reactants. We have found that, it is the long-term interest and pursue of biology that tied us together: we are a group with same biology dream. As a result, every time we discussed our research design together, an invisible tie connected us: we were better to collaborate. When we were facing some difficulties, we were more likely to get through, because this was the opportunities for us to realize our dream since childhood. We were inspired to enhance our project.
In addition, during the presentation, we have found that many students were unfamiliar with synthetic biology. For instance, few of them understood the concept of “enzyme”; in fact, few of them even know the Chinese character “enzyme.” Therefore, we tried different approaches to address our project, in order to make it more accessible and understandable. We used several models of crabs and shrimps to arouse their interest. We explained that enzyme is a kind of substance that can make chemical reaction more effective, for instance, in our bodies. We came up with real-world sceneries to express the obscure concepts of synthetic biology. We emphasized"

Objective: To continue growing biofilms and determine if certain cleaners will prevent further growth of the biofilms
Procedure: Same protocol used as June 30. Instead of using crystal violet dye, we are using E.coli DH5α cells with RFP (PSB4K5). 2 μL of KAN was added to 2 mL centrifuge tubes along with 1980 μL LB and 20 μL of culture.
300 μL of mix was pipetted into wells of 96 well plate. Biofilms left to grow 24 hours in 37˚C incubator.
Bees: Preparing Solutions for Oxalic Acid Gradient using Potassium Permanganate.
Objective: Solutions were prepared to be used for the oxalic acid assay that will see KMnO4 being oxidized by oxalic acid and therefore detect the presence of oxalic acid.
Procedure: To prepare the 1% and 20% Oxalic Acid concentrations, solid oxalic acid was weighed for a solution of 50 mL. 0.5 g of oxalic acid was weighed out and placed in a 50 mL falcon tube. 50 mL of d2H¬2O was added to the falcon tube to dissolve the oxalic acid and  create the 1% Oxalic Acid concentration. Two falcon tubes of 1% Oxalic Acid was prepared.
10 g of oxalic acid was then weighed and dissolved in 50 mL of d2H¬2O in a 50 mL falcon tube for the 20% oxalic acid concentration. The 50 mL of 20% oxalic acid was then placed in the 60˚C oven to help dissolve the oxalic acid.
In addition 1 M H2SO4 was created using stock 5 M for the Wieden Lab. Both the 1 M H2SO4 and 1% oxalic acid were stored in the 4˚C fridge in E770.

New gel to check
- Miniprep plasmid from growth bottles (I746001, I746101 and PNZ8901); from plates (I746001, I746101 and PNZ8901).
- Do single digest for PNZ8901 (one with PstI, one with SalI)
- Run a gel with : PNZ8901 from friday, PNZ8901 digest with PstI, PNZ8901 digest with SalI, 3 samples from growth bottles, 3 samples from plates (to check the size of the uncut vectors)
Result from this second gel
The ladders are really bad! But the size of our biobricks and plasmid are too big! So we can not trust these big cultures. They is a problem.  With tests from the first week, we know that biobricks are right, so we are going to grow new cultures from these first cultures, to make stocks.
Concerning the vectors, they are from last year, so we are not sure of what they are. Since we ordered new well defined vectors (we should receive them on friday), we will use them in the next steps"

We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.

Plasmid isolation of pJET_cfp_cepI was performed and correct cloning was verified by restriction digestion with SacI and PstI.
On the analyzing gel (Fig. 1) we saw the three bands we expected: One just below 3000 bp (vector backbone), one around 1700 bp (cfp_cepI) and one at 400 bp (smaller part of the backbone).
The clones 14 and 17 were sent for sequencing. Clone 17 showed no mutation. The remaining plasmid of clone 17 was cut with HindIII and SpeI for a preparative agarose gel. The resulting band for cfp_cepI was purified to be further used for the Gibson assembly of pCERI.
We conducted plasmid isolation of transformants containing pSB3C5_BBa J04421 (cfp) and size verified correct cloning by restriction digestion. Correct clones are stored on 4°C to be used as positive controls for the analysis of pCERI.
As the previous site directed mutagenesis attempts to correct the mutation in esaR did not get us the results we hoped for and only showed the same deletion as the template DNA we repeated the site directed mutagenesis-experiment with altered experimental parameters, prolonging the DpnI digest from 1h to 12h (overnight) to make sure to get rid of all template DNA of the PCR. This resulted in significantly less clones on the LB-Amp plates after transformation into E.coli Top 10. These clones will get sequenced next week.
This week we also made our first Biobricks. PCRs to attach the Biobrick suffix and prefix to the sequence verified gBlocks of PaidA_mRFP, PesaRC_cfp, cepI, esaI and cepR were performed. PCR-products were digested with EcoRI and PstI and purified. All products were ligated into linearized and dephosphorylated shipping vector pSB1C3. pSB1C3_BBa_K1670004 showed no transformants on the plates and thus transformation was repeated. Clones of all other constructs were streaked out again for plasmid preps and correct cloning was verified by restriction digests (Fig. 2-4). Clones containing size verified inserts were sent for sequencing.

Also, early in the process, ways of creating a long-term relationship between Makerspace and current as well as future iGEM teams were discussed with the goal of making the attendees independent and 'self-learning'.
The Workshops
The purpose of the workshops held at Makerspace was to teach the participants how to use and work with basic lab equipment in order to pursue simple but important experiments in synthetic biology. By attending all three workshops (with many more to come) this would be possible even for the least experienced person!
Workshop 1 - Lab Basics
In this workshop, held the 2nd of October 2016, participants had the opportunity to learn how to use a pipette and different microscopes. The workshop opened up with a presentation by Sina from Makerspace and Oscar He from the iGEM Stockholm team where they introduced Makerspace and iGEM, what the outcome of the workshops would be and answered some questions.
Your browser does not support the video tag.
The workshop was divided into two stations; pipetting and microscopy. The pipetting workshop had two different tables, one where the participants were given several dilutions with given volumes written on the board. Following the dilution instructions and using different working stock solutions of food colouring with water made up by the instructors, participants had to make the dilutions and lastly make a final dilution but with unknown volumes. This way, participants had to think for themselves how to dilute and create the correct concentrations! To confirm they had reached the right concentration, the absorbance was measured and compared to a pre-made sample by the instructors. This generated a lot of fun and a bit of a competitive spirit!
During this time, half of the group had another assignment at another table. Here the participants had to mix coca-cola and milk using pipettes to take certain volumes. To make sure the samples were mixed, they had to use a vortex and in order to separate the precipitate from the solution, they used a table-top centrifuge. Then they used the pipette to take out the water, just as if they wanted to save a cell pellet.
Workshop 2 - Cultivation
The second workshop was held on the 9th of October. This time participants learned the basics of cultivating bacteria in terms of medium, growth, collection and plating, and working in a sterile environment.

Using a non-living biosensor is another approach that came to mind. This way, even if the sensor is accidentally released into the field, it will not be able to sustain nor to propagate itself. We opt to use a cell-free transcription-translation system (CF TX-TL) system as the chassis of the non-living biosensors.

Michigan,2018,Team:MichiganState#HP Expert Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," small local seed company, Ann Arbor Seed Company, who seemed justifiably nervous about GMO due to risks they have to their business model and the vision of importance of genetic diversity of seeds that we’re losing so quickly. Huge numbers of people growing the same seeds means specialty varieties may become scarce because seeds are not saved or lost. Small companies are even being sued by huge corporations that have GMO seed sovereignty and patents.
Do you shop specifically for non-GMO products?
I shop specifically for organic products, which by definition means I shop for non-GMO products. I appreciate GMO labeling, because people have the right to know what’s in their food and how their food was grown. Preventing somebody from labelling is surprising and unfortunate. But, I also have options of local or non-local organic products. I try to find local, non-GMO, and organic food when shopping, and I can’t always find food that meets all of these criteria. Non-GMO is not as important to me as shopping local though.
What effects do you believe GMO products have on human health?
I have looked at some research on it, mostly older research shared among the organic farming community. One study found that cows chose non-GMO corn over GMO corn when given the two options. In grad school, I learned that higher lignin content in GMO corn may make it taste not as good as non-GMO corn. Early studies have also shown liver and kidney issues, such as studies with the Flavor Saver tomato. I am a follower of the precautionary principle for toxins, herbicides, GMOs, et cetera. However, many of the crops in the United States have skipped the precautionary time period. There has not been enough time to do long range testing on new products to make people feel more comfortable. GM crops came too quickly. Lower income folks felt there was no choice to opt out of this large scale experiment when we converted large portions of corn and soybeans to GMO.
Do you have any other comments or concerns you would like to discuss with us?
The curve of acceptance among GMO farmers was very steep, 90 or 95% acceptance, in crops, but has now leveled out due to price and economic farmers. Some conventional farmers are now relying on non-GMO products. I’ve also talked to conventional growers in West Michigan who have stated that GMO is not worth it anymore. They can get the same yield from non-GMO hybrids as GMO. In some cases it’s simply too expensive to keep growing GMOs.

- E coli control: 5mL of the combined solution from the centrifuge tube (2-i step) were plated. This is to make sure the bacteria stock was not contaminated
- Check up on phage + bacteria viability in 24 hours.
IV) Results (April 6 at 4: 45pm)
1) The two control plates (Left -> E. Coli control; Right ->Agar control)
No contamination observed on these two plates. This confirms that there is no contamination in Agar, LB, or E. Coli stock. Uniform lawn of E coil BL21 observed in E coli control plate. This suggests that our E coli is growing normally
2) Spot test + control plates (Top -> 2 spot test; bottom left -> E coli control; bottom right -> Agar control)
No phage clearage is observed. Some small dots on agar can be seen, but they are too small to be resulted from phage lysing E coli. It’s more likely that they are the result of either residue air bubbles or puncture marks made by pipet tips during the spot test.
V) Conclusions
- E coli BL21 is viable, but the T7 4104 phage does not form plaques on BL21. Or we did not use a big enough volume of phage stock solution to observe a significant lysate.
- Another reason for why we did not see phage plaque is that we used the mutant phage without the complete genome: T7 4104 vs T7* -> T7* might actually be the WT phage.
VI) Proposed next step
1) Perform the same experiment with a larger volume of phage stock solution.
2)  Test T7 phage survival on E coli W3110.

Global Perspectives Outreach Overview
Many iGEM teams seek to contextualize their work by getting input from professionals who have been working in the field for years or even decades. However, once teams gather this information, they put it in their Jamboree presentation and on their wiki, but after that, the information sits unused. The goal of this effort was to collect information about the future of the biomanufacturing industry and research from major stakeholders in science and beyond. To do this, we recruited other iGEM teams from around the world in order to establish a common set of questions to ask people from several fields that are essential to the proliferation of biomanufacturing (e.g. academia, business, public policy,), and recorded the answers we got from experts around the world. We wanted to understand how people in different parts of the world feel about the promise, feasibility, and drawbacks of biomanufacturing, so the we needed to have as many teams from as many places as possible participate in this effort. The questions we compiled were general enough that any biomanufacturing-related project could make use of them. We hope that future teams will continue and expand this effort, building off of the questions and answers we have assembled here. Eventually, we would like to see a massive effort to standardize the way iGEM teams get input from expert sources, almost like a survey version of the Interlab Study!
Thank you to all the iGEM teams who participated in our global effort!

Findings
This survey was a first attempt at starting something that will hopefully grow and become more rigorous over time. The results that we collecter are not “statistically significant” and we cannot make any sweeping generalizations about the future of the field based on this survey, but there were a few prevalent trends among the answers that we received to the survey. In general, the respondents felt that the major barriers to progress for biomanufacturing are cost and efficiency. Furthermore, there is a generally positive outlook on the future of biomanufacturing. 80% of survey members who identified themselves as"
Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#News#Alberta Events_-_-_TEXT.html," companies should be targeted for sponsorship. Additionally, some students practiced making pitches, receiving valuable critique from Ms. Yez and the other students.
Jesse Johnstone led the wiki workshop, and gave students useful information in designing navigation for ease of use. Students examined the successful aspects of a few of last year's wikis, and looked at some website designs (the good, the bad, and the ugly). We also learned the method of applying templates, which is extremely useful in keeping code clean and easy to edit. At the workshop, teams were able to troubleshoot their respective coding problems with Mr. Johnstone and the other students (eg. fixing Lethbridge's picture links and troubleshooting Alberta/Calgary's CSS problems).
The weekend gave all of us valuable advice for presentations, fundraising, and wikis. It was also an incredible opportunity for team collaboration and getting to know one another. :)
U of C iGEM team wins provincial competition: Alberta Genetically Engineered Machines, September 18th-20th
With smiling faces and heightened team pride, the U of C brought home the aGEM trophy after placing first in the Alberta Genetically Engineered Machines (aGEM) competition, which was held in Banff from September 18th -19th. aGEM is the Alberta Genetically Engineered Machines Competition. aGEM facilitates a sense of regional spirit and gives students a chance to compete and critique each other’s work as the three Albertan teams (U of C, U of A, and U of L) prepare for the iGEM Jamboree in the fall.
The University of Calgary team members drove down to Banff on the 18th- the night of the aGEM wiki and poster presentations. The students arrived early to set up the poster, prepare handouts (lab, modeling, Second Life and human practices) and set up iMacs to present their wiki and facilitate tours of our 3D virtual world in Second Life. The team distributed and organized themselves around each station so that there was always someone there to explain the project and address questions.
This was great opportunity for all of the team members to practice presentational skills, demonstrate a cohesive understanding of the four components of the project, learn about the other projects and of course, impress the judges! Our audiences were from various backgrounds and professions beginning from entrepreneurs to analysts, biologists, engineers, professors and students. The high level of energy and enthusiasm of the U of C students quickly engaged the audience and drew more and more people to our booth. As team members explained each of the four components of"

Find colonies in the plate with both antibiotics (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4) strongly suggest that the bacteria had a Plug&Play plasmid where occurred the PCR-product recombination into the lox71 site. We counted the number of colonies in both plates: 36 colonies grew in the plate of bacteria transformed with 10 ng of PCR-product and 611 for the plate of bacteria transformed with 100 ng of PCR-product.
The kanamycin gene that we used cant express or replicate without being in the plasmid, it has no promoter or replication site, we cloned just the ORF of the gene. This gene will be expressed as long as IPTG is present in the culture medium.

Conclusions
Our results suggest that this technology is possible, that the recombination system is able to circularize the PCR-product as soon as it enters in the cell, and before it is degraded by the cellular nucleases. This was also predicted in the results obtained from the mathematical model.
Based on the report made by the igem2010 UT-Tokyo team and some papers [3] , the lox71 (BBa_I718017) from the registry was wrong, it had a cg instead a gc in the 8bp spacer sequence between the arms. Apparently, this part was corrected by the  iGEM11_WITS_CSIR_SA team (BBa_K537020), but the sequence of this group had the same error.

Formal Lab Session - 30th July 2009
Introduction
In the previous lab session, a number of different things happened. The team digested the three sets of mini-preps originating from E. coli transformed with BBa_C0056, BBa_B1002 and BBa_R0077 with EcoRI and PstI; when run on agarose gel it could be seen that the correct DNA had been transformed!. Also in the previous lab session the team attempted a second transformation of JM109 E. coli cells with BioBricks BBa_C0077 and BBa_C0076. And finally the team chose some cells to be frozen down for long term storage and grew those selected cultures up in LB solutions.
Today's lab work will involve completing the freezing down bacteria procedure. It will also involve observing the LB + Kan plates for any BBa_C0077 and BBa_C0076 transformants; if there are colonies then mini-preps will be conducted and if the transformations have failed then a final attempt at transforming E. coli cells will commence. The team will also be given a lesson by PhD student Chris Birchall on how to pour LB agar plates the way in which Dr. Phil Aldridge pours plates.
Practical Outline
James preparing to freeze down E. coli cells
These are the tasks the team need to complete by today:
Observe BBa_C0077 and BBa_C0076 transformants on LB + kan plates
If successful inoculate 5ml LB with colonies for mini-preps tomorrow
If failed conduct a final set of E. coli transformations
Prepare and pour some LB agar plates according to Dr. Phil Aldridge's method
Freeze down cells for TPA collection

The Project
The Columbia-Cooper iGEM team is working with Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans to create a light-controlled printed circuit board manufacturing process. This bacteria’s metabolism relies on its ability to oxidize iron; the iron can then be used to oxidize, and in turn solubilize, copper. By genetically altering the bacteria, we intend to install a light sensitive mechanism which will enable us to etch copper in a desired pattern, leaving a finished circuit board. Once a blank printed circuit board is placed in a thin layer of solid media, the bacteria will be applied onto the surface of the media and light will be focused on it in a desired pattern. The light sensitive mechanism in ferrooxidans would activate and self-destruct in the pathway of the light. In the end, the circuit board will be ""etched"" by the bacteria everywhere but the illuminated spots, leaving the desired pattern behind on the circuit board.
iGEM
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method. In 2011 iGEM expanded to include a High School Division and an Entrepreneurship Division is 2012.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," We had a meeting with James, who is assisting with the design of our wiki page (see attributions) to discuss the concept in greater detail
Friday 29th July
Amandeep, Abbie and Michelle gave a presentation about synthetic biology and London to year 8 students as part of outreach activities at UCL - attach photos etc
August
Monday 1st August
Amandeep is working on developing the crowdfunding page - experiment for UCL iGEM.
Abbie updated our social media platforms describing our outreach experiences and promoting our ' about our project video CHANGE THIS TO ACTUAL UPLOADED FILE ' on youtube. She also spoke to RICE iGEM team about collaborating with their humans of synbio project and has been interviewed to feature. Abbie spoke with various teams regarding feedback on current gene circuit designing platforms and collated this for AlphaBrick and with EPF Lausanne iGEM team to participate in their blog idea which helps to put all iGEM teams in one place. Abbie contacted a Kings College London students who wanted to advise our team - we want to keep him involved.
Tuesday 2nd August
Abbie updated the wiki notebook, looked through what Amandeep did on experiment, constantly updating the wiki with content. Abbie and Amandeep is also working on developing the design of the wiki (building the design of the website with James). Neythan has created the basics of the app (biobrick game) that we are hoping to be a way to get synthtic biology more known - make people more aware of it. Exciting times - hes been able to develop a workign prototype that we hope to run a test with tomorrow.
Wednesday 3rd August
Abbie attempted to remove the illegal restriction sites for the vitalogelin circuit. We also contacted transcriptic, hoping to use their automated robots for one of our ideas. Amandeep worked on developing the wiki as well as re-writing the experiment crowd funding page and developing some more ideas for our human practices. Kamil was working on creating the final proposal for the vitaliginin circuit. Amandeep wa also working on giving Neythan feedback on the app he has developed - I was able to do a trial run through.
Thursday 4th August
Amandeep is starting to make the proposal (make the circuit) for the SOD gene therapy idea. We had a meeting with Darren.
Friday 5th August
finally, after constant perseverance we got our Experiment page approved and ready to be released (crowdfunding). Abbie is focusing"

An awareness drive was conducted at the local Government school of Hasampura, a small village in the district Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, India. Almost all the students of the school came from families with farming and agriculture background. The students were made aware of the importance of science in their life and how crucial it can be when GM crops are introduced at a large scale in the agricultural fields. Various parameters were discussed with them which included the quantity of GM seeds, amount of manure and fertiliser used, nutritional value, cost calculations, insecticides and pesticides usage etc, which were then compared with the conventional technology currently used. Various governmental policies regarding GM crops were also discussed. The students responded well and conveyed the message to their parents. In this way, we were able to spread awareness about the importance of GM crops and how can it revolutionize their lives.
Educating consumers about GM foods
With our survey we realized that most of the people even from academic backgrounds were not aware about GMOs so we decided to go to public directly and explain to them about the science of GM in simple terms.
We went to nilgiris (a supermarket in our locality) and were interacting with the customers to get an idea of how much they are aware about GM foods. While interaction we explained the science of GM, listing the pros and cons of GM in simple terms and gave away the following pamphlet .
The above ‘GM foods’ content was made focusing on the biological terms, so some of the people whom we met felt difficult to understand it.
We came up with one other GM science content (also translated it to our home state language-Tamil) where we focused on explaining in agricultural context:You can view both files here .
The power of social media in sharing information is very fast and effective so the above discussed points were spread to the public via Facebook, Whatsapp.
The Facebook pages where we posted our information are listed below.

The density of type A bacteria $\rho_A$ might evolve over multiple     timesteps in $[t;t+\Delta t]$ due to decoupling of timesteps (see     Matching below), therefore we compute an average over the entire     interval and use that in the discretization scheme. Furthermore,     the degradation term can be incorporated in a Crank-Nicholson manner     since they do not depend on neighboring grid points and therefore     do not influence the shape of the matrix.     We define $r_x$ and $r_y$ as in (29).
$$     r_x = D\cdot \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}     \;\;\; \text{(29a)}     $$     $$     r_y = D\cdot \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta y^2}     \;\;\; \text{(29b)}     $$
Inserting these in (28a) and moving all implicit terms to the left-hand     side and all explicit terms to the right-hand side gives (28b).
$$     \Bigg(1+\frac{1}{4}\cdot k \cdot \Delta t - \frac{1}{2}     \cdot r_x \cdot \delta^2_x \Bigg) \cdot C^{n+1/2}     = \Bigg(1-\frac{1}{4}\cdot k \cdot \Delta t + \frac{1}{2}     \cdot r_y \cdot \delta^2_y \Bigg) \cdot C^{n} + \frac{1}{2}     \cdot \alpha \cdot \Delta t \cdot \rho_A^{\bar{n}}     \;\;\; \text{(28b)}     $$
The next half timestep is analogous, but with the finite difference     in the y-direction taken implicitly.
$$     \frac{C^{n+1}-C^{n+1/2}}{1/2 \cdot \Delta t}=D \cdot     \Bigg( \frac{\delta^2_x C^{n+1/2}}{\Delta x^2}     +\frac{\delta^2_y C^{n+1}}{\Delta y^2} \Bigg)     +\alpha \cdot \rho_A^{\bar{n}}     -k\cdot"

The next step. Another advantage to the bypassing of gene assembly enabled by our platform is the increased ability to automate system construction. Microfludic systems are those which control the movement of small volumes of liquids (10–9 to 10–18 litres) using a variety of methods, which may be used to perform biological experiments. These devices have a number of advantages over traditional, manual, lab methods. They only use a small amount of liquid, which means less reagents are consumed and the time taken to perform experiments is reduced. These small amounts of liquids are easier to manipulate than larger volumes, meaning there is greater control over reactions resulting in a high degree of sensitivity (Whitesides, 2006). However, many devices do not have the ability to control temperature, which is important for many methods of gene assembly. Cell mixing, as opposed to gene fragment assembly, is more suited to automation on these platforms, as there is no requirement for precise temperature control. Also, the increased control over small volumes of reagents allows the screening of precise cell ratios. Additionally, programs are in development for the automation of protocols on microfluidic, which will allow the rapid combination of a number of variant biosensor components. To utilise this advantage, we developed software for the simulation of microfludics experiments

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Notebook#normal_-_-_TEXT.html," Dr. Mike MacDonald from the Institute for Medical Science and Technology (IMSAT) to discuss plans for building a physical device. They learned from him the importance of following international standards of operation (ISOs). From this point on we endeavoured to follow ISOs 13485 (medical devices) & 9001(general quality management) so that, if the device were to be taken on by a company, our design and parts would be easily replicable.
Week 12
After western blotting the BDSF system, we obtained results which showed that both BCAM0227 and BCAM0228 were both being expressed. We then set up for an inducible GFP production assay, by spiking overnight cultures of transformed E. coli MC1061 with a range of concentrations of synthetic BDSF. Unfortunately, GFP appeared to be expressed at all concentrations, including 0 µM! This experiment clearly needed to be repeated... The cloning of the two PAI-1 sensors was continued, by ligating two different promoters downstream of LasR; Plasb and PluxR. The Device Committee were having a great time designing the L.A.S.S.O.; a cavity here, a plunger there, maybe some springs... taking into account the ISO requirements as specified by Dr MacDonald.
Week 13
Dimitrios has been busy and managed to biobrick PcblD.
The growing PAI-1 system was complemented with the addition of the nanoluc BioBrick. The dry team set about modelling the potential savings that could be made from the implementation of The Lung Ranger/L.A.S.S.O. They began by investigating the cost for the NHS of keeping patients in hospital for treatment, which could be given domestically if the need was identified earlier. Also under consideration was the amount of days taken off work by the patients when ill or visiting the clinic – a concern raised by some patients we met at the clinic.
Week 14
The biobrick man strikes yet again.....PmanA was successfully cloned into pSB1C3.  More L.A.S.S.O. testing with V. fischeri – this time with plates containing different amounts of bacteria, obtained by serial dilution of an overnight culture. This resulted in our first attempt to map the sensitivity of our device vs. c.f.u. of bacteria. The BDSF GFP blot was repeated with similar results, and the decision was made to begin removing genes from the system until we identified which one was causing the problem.
Western blots of the DSF system showed successful expression of all three proteins; RpfC, R"

Anthracene disintegrates in the Britton Robinsoon Buffer. But it could be observed, that there is less anthracene measurable with the LC-MS. The results indicate, that the laccase is able to degrade anthracene (Fig. 13). Estrone (Fig. 14) and estradiol (Fig. 15) were degraded as well. Using estrone it could not be identify any degradation products. The reason for this could be that the products are not detectable with LC-MS or with the applied methods. Peaks in the degradation of estradiol have been shown but we were not able to identify them. It could be degradation products. In the following figures the results of the LC-MS measurements are presented.
Figure 10: Ethinyl estradiol + TVEL0 measured by LC-MS. It is shown that the over night sample has only half of the substrate left.
Figure 12: Anthracene + TVEL0. In the over night sample there are no detectable amounts of anthracene left.
Figure 13: The negative control for anthracene without laccases. It is shown the concentration of anthracene decreases. This is caused by the Britton Robinson Buffer.
Figure 11: Our ethinyl estradiol negative control without laccase. Variation on the peaks is probably caused by a pipetting mistake.
Figure 14: Estrone + TVEL0. The peaks shows that estrone is degraded but after incubation over night it is still estrone left.
Figure 15: Estradiol degradation analyses with mass-spectrometry. On the X-axis the retention time is listed. The Y-axis shows the mass/charge ratio. From white to red the intensity of the measured samples is presented. On the figure above you can see the t0 estradiol while the figure below shows the degradation. The analytes retended in the first minute are the media soillings. Since we know that the retention time of estradiol is on min 5 we could see that over night no more estradiol is left and some other peaks appear which are probably degradation products
We also tried to measure the degradation using mass-spectrometry. Since quantification via mass-spectrometry is difficult regarding the ionization of the analytes, we quantified our substrates by UV-light. Nevertheless, mass spectrometry enables identification of possible degradation products. We analyzed estr"
NCTU_Formosa,2016,Team:NCTU Formosa#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,". This year Mingdao iGEM team constructs a biobrick that can express enzyme, alcohol oxidase (AOX), on the surface of E.coli. The long anchor of the E.coli is from the concept of 2015 NCTU_FORMOSA.
Method: We cultivated E.coli BL21 3mL containing the biobrick selecting with Chloromycetin, and the other one is the control which doesn’t have the plasmid. Then we centrifuged 1mL bacteria solution and added PBS to adjust the OD values are almost the same. Then we added TMB, a substrate of oxidase and react in the dark. The product can be analysis by OD650. Ultimately, we proved their biobrick is valid.
On the other hand, Mingdao iGEM team also characterized our Biobrick is valid to express the target protein. They run an SDS-PAGE of our Pantide and no plasmid bacteria. The result shows that our Pantide is successfully expressed.

Alberta,2011,Team:Alberta#HumanPractices#CostAnalysis_-_-_TEXT.html," average Canadian family with         two children and two working adults earned $85,600 CDN         in 2009 according to Statistics Canada. After adjusting         for inflation that would be approximately 90,000 CDN in         2011.xiii Given the 3.8% expenditure on motor         vehicle fuel and applying this to the adjusted income         yields $3420 CDN, an estimate on the total amount of money         spent on gasoline and fuel products for a typical Canadian         family. Again, this value could be reduced by 32%, yielding         $1094 CDN in annual cost savings.
Conclusion
If our product can successfully scale into commercial         production it holds much potential to change the future of         energy in countries. Our estimates clearly show the potential         economic viability of such an alternative fuel. Therefore,         not only environmentally, but also economically as seen         here, there is significant reason to further investigate         our approaches as a means for providing lower

Three Plasmids
Three Parts & Three Plasmids in a Glee
In a synchronized oscillatory system, three important parts should be included: the oscillator, which is the biochemical machinery that generate the oscillatory output; the coupling pathway that ensure the connection among cells; and output pathway, which is also known as a reporter that reflect the state of the oscillator to downstream targets (Fig. 2-1).
Fig. 2-1 Circuit working mechanism
Oscillator
Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-to-cell signaling mechanism that refers to the ability of bacteria to respond to chemical hormone-like molecules called autoinducers. When an autoinducer reaches a critical threshold, the bacteria detect and respond to this signal by altering their gene expression. In our circuit, QS (from Vibrio fischeri) is installed as a positive feedback while aiiA (from Bacillus Thurigensis) acts as a negative one to compose an oscillator together. In the quorum sensing part, the luxI gene is at low expression level and produces LuxI protein that synthesize a kind of acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), which is a small molecule that can diffuse across the cell membrane and mediate intercellular coupling when it reaches the threshold as enough biomass accumulated. AHL will bind intracellular protein LuxR, which is also consecutively produced by luxR gene. The LuxR-AHL complex can activate the luxI promoter, and the positive feedback loop is built. At the same time, the aiiA gene, which is under control of the same promoter is expressed and produce a lactonase enzyme known as aiiA that hydrolyzes the lactone ring of AHL. (Fig. 2-1) In this system, the activ"

[2] Eutrophication results in the development of harmful algal blooms, triggering hypoxia and hurting the delicate balance of aquatic ecosystems.
Through our project, we hope to undercut the production of fertilizer and reduce its harmful environmental impact. Through having plants synthesize their own nitrogen compounds we eliminate the need for that artificial nitrogen source. By working in E. coli, it is the team’s hope to develop tools for experimentation with nitrogen fixation in other organisms. E. coli holds the distinct advantage of having rapid growth cycles, enabling quick experimentation with different biological technologies.

Tianjin,2015,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," added into the system. And Plastic+Janus means plastic had incubated with Janus before adding enzyme. And we also conduct these incubation separately in 4℃,37℃.50℃, values at 50 degree are higher than that under the other temperature.
Based on the experiment above, we compared these two different ways with simple mix, here’s the result.
Figure 5. We can conclude that pre-incubation does increase the hydrolysis rate, some ways(Plastic  pre-incubated with sJanus) even boost 200%+ react rate comparing with Thc_cutL1* in our conditions!! Another interesting phenomenon is sJanus usually works better than inJanus, and the reason behind it need our further exploration. On the whole, Our Janus works a lot!
Additional experiment
Overview
To test the universality of conclusion above, we used another cutinase FsC we expressed. We tried incubated plastic with Janus and FsC with Janus but data shows differently comparing with our expectation. In the contrary cutinase without incubation performed better. We are still working on the explanation.
Result
After incubation (PET&sJanus, PET& inJanus, FsC&sJanus, FsC&inJanus) for 16h, we added FsC or PET piece into EP tube. A group of tube without incubation were also set as control.
Figure.6 Different columns mean different ways of incubation. Control means incubating PET in the buffer system without Janus before adding  enzyme or incubating FsC in buffer system before adding Plastic.
As the picture shows, after incubation for 16h sJanus performed better than inJanus. That is in accord with conclusion we made above. Unfortunately, the control group had a higher value. The reliability of this result needs our repeat and confirmation and the explanation behind it still need our further exploration. We are working on it.
Further exploration
Overview 
We successfully build a fusion protein which attached cutinase Thc_Cut1 to our Janus (sJanus-m).
The fusion protein has much more better performance than the cutinase before.
Result 
The procedure in this part is likely to the pre-experiment, we use different concentration of fusion protein. And we compare the data to the value we conduct with Thc_Cut1 before, found that fusion protein hydrolysis more, especially in high concentration.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#Selection#Bacterial Two-Hybrid System_-_-_TEXT.html," ( Pavletich & Pabo 1991 ).  Due to the development of more complicated experiments more zinc finger proteins per experiment were needed. This results in a big prone for faults, because the specificities of individiual zinc finer proteins can overlap and can depend on the context of surrounding zinc fingers and DNA ( Ramirez et al. 2008 ). Off-target effects were observed instead of a high affinity to the intended target. The revision of the zinc fingers make them on the one hand way more effective but also on the other hand way more complicated to use ( Maeder et al. 2008 ; Sander et al. 2011 ).
Therefore, DNA binding domains, which are a lot easier to use for bacterial two-hybrid systems are necessary. Examples are, the repressor proteins cI of the phages lambda ( Dove & Hochschild 2004 ) and 434 ( Hays et al. 2000 ), respectively. The protein family cI are repressor proteins that compete with the phage Cro proteins for DNA binding.  The main function of them is the binding at the binding sites OR1 and OR2 on the DNA. If they bind at these sites they prevent that Cro can bind at the binding sites OR2 and OR3 and thereby inhibit the expression of the cro gene ( Brooks & Clark 1967 ).  Further researches revealed that next to the binding sequences
OR1 and OR2, also OL1 and OL2 downstream of the OR1 and OR2 sites are necessary for complete repression of the cro gene. Therefore, cI binds at the DNA as an octamere ( Dodd et al. 2001 ).
The sites OR1 and OR2 are important, because the binding domain is only used to anchor the fusion protein close to the promoter. Afterwards, gene expression is increased by attracting the activation domain which is fused to the binding protein ( Joung et al. 2000 ). All cI protein have specific binding sequences namely OR1 and OR2. These cI binding sequences are species specific and therefore different between diverse varying phages isolates.
However, the design of a hybrid transcriptional activation system with cI as binding domain is easier than the use of a zinc finger protein. This is the due to the binding sequences for a specific cI, which does not require optimization like zinc fingers do.
Comparison of cI proteins to zinc finger proteins revealed a much higher expression rate of a reporter in a designed bacterial two hybrid system, if cI proteins is used as the DNA binding domain ( Badran et al. 2016 ). Due to the"

Also, to determine whether the genetic design is danger, one should not depend entirely on the origins of biological parts; we should focus on not only the origins but also the functions of the parts.
Consulted experts on biosafety in the campus
Weilin Xu, Xiao Feng and Zhengyang Wen
In mid-September we visited and consulted Ms. Jie Zhang, specialist on biosafety in the school, about questions of how to be safe in a project.
Office of Laboratory Biosafety in our school.
Ms. Jie Zhang talked with us about safety in our school
We talked about biosafety in genetic engineering, a topic most relevant to us. Although she was not familiar with software engineering, nor did she know thoroughly what we did in the project, she gave us many constructive suggestions, say:
1. There must be rules for users to obey. Users should obey these rules in order not to make mistakes.
2. Rules are not enough; there should be warnings, tips, etc., for users to clearly remind themselves of their responsibilities in biosafety and biosecurity.
She was also interested in the poker we designed on the topic of biosafety. She advised us that more innovative methods are needed in order to improve the awareness of people in the lab and people outside the lab alike.

Inspiration on project
As a platform open to public in our project, CORE has the responsibility to properly deal with the problem of safety and biosecurity. We should classify the standard parts according to their origins (risk group) as well as their functions. Users of CORE should confirm that the benefits of this design for public outweigh its risks. Also, in the process of genetic design, we should remind the users of their conducts to the synthetic biology, to the human beings, and the world.
(2) Social Impact: Reflection and Practices
Our team has been working on the software aiding circuit design for years. We want our software could be not only competitive in Software Track but also be applied to actual scientific research and industrial product design. We think a lot about how our software influence the society if released and accordingly, how should we optimization our project.
1. Intellectual property
Motivation
We hope our software, CORE, can be open to the synthetic biology community. And one important thought is to protect the intellectual property, to respect the hard work done by others. Sharing should be based on the respect of others.
Considerations
There might roughly two methods to help protect intellectual property rights

HUMAN PRACTICES
Antibiotic discovery may continue to wane in the coming decades because antibiotics aimed for the easiest bacterial targets have already been developed. Considering that bacteria are unlikely to similarly slow in the development of resistance, decreased discovery could be disastrous, resulting in significantly more deaths caused by infectious disease.
NU iGEM 2016 took a significant stride toward an alternative solution to this crisis; however, our experiences this summer testify to the time-consuming nature of genetic research. In order to provide scientists enough time to develop novel antibiotics, physicians and patients must use existing antibiotics appropriately. With that in mind, our Human Practices work focused on educating the public on the proper use of antibiotics and encouraging young students to cultivate an interest in synthetic biology.
Educating the Public
Initially unsure of the best way to address the issue of antibiotic resistance via outreach, we performed extensive research on the subject. The publications we read mentioned many causes for the rapid pace of resistance development, including the overprescription of antibiotics in developed countries. We concluded that we needed the perspectives of clinicians if we were to understand why doctors overprescribe antibiotics, and how a group of undergraduates could hope to persuade doctors to prescribe antibiotics more appropriately.
As such, we interviewed Drs. Persell, Postelnick, and Scheetz, all of whom work on the research and clinical side of medicine through the Feinberg School of Medicine and Northwestern Medicine. These interviews revealed a major reason doctors prescribe unneeded antibiotics: patient demand. Instead of persuading doctors to change their behavior, we decided to educate the public on appropriate use and prescription of antibiotics.
In addition, the three physicians agreed that CRISPR would be more effective if targeted to knock out resistance genes for existing antibiotics rather than serving as a novel antibiotic by targeting other bacterial genes. Existing antibiotic resistance proteins, such as beta-lactamase and fluoroquinolones, are safer targets and result from well-characterized sequences. This advice incorporated well into the design of CRISPR Capsules—a realistic future aim would be to introduce Cas9 encapsulated in OMVs to a cell already containing a guide RNA for a selection marker such as ampicillin. If Cas9 enters the cell and cuts the resistance gene,"

Cell Resistance
Our experiments should start with parameters, right? So our first stop here is to determine at which point would the fatty acids concentration in the medium would start to inhibit the cell growth and be actually prejudicial to the E.coli.
As tocopherol in high concentrations is also prejudicial to the cells, we should also quantify at which concentration it would become toxic, instead of beneficial.
Procedure
The first step to our experiment is to prepare the stock solutions and mediums, so we did, as following:
-Tocopherol was diluted in ethanol, to a final concentration of 10mM.
-At low concentrations, oleic acid was applied directly to the medium. In higher concentrations, it was first diluted in the reason of 2:1, oleic acid:ethanol.
-Optimum medium was prepared.
-Samples were made in duplicate.
-All measures were made in a plate reader, in triplicates.
Source: Personal archive.
Experiment
E.coli cells were inoculated in optimum medium and left to grow overnight in a shaker in 37º Celsius and 190RPM.
Based on Okai, et.al, we defined our initial tocopherol and oleic acid concentrations. In his experiment, he used free nonylphenols, which are actively toxic to organisms, so we already expected the oil concentrations to be higher than these first goals set. The growth medium was prepared using the optimum medium in falcon tubes, in 5mL samples.
Source: Personal archive.
Tocopherol quantities were added from the 10mM solution and added to the medium as follows: 0uL, 5uL, 25uL, 50uL, 100uL and 250uL.
The overnight grown cells were than inoculated into the medium with the tocopherol and placed in the shaker to grow. Measures were made until we reached 12h from our starting point.

As it is quite clear from the graphic, the 0.11M sample has been really capped by the tocopherol. Not only it inhibited the cell growth but it started out with a negative growth, until the cells stabilized themselves"

Chloe is sophomore majoring in Biochemistry. She learned soooooooo much going through iGEM but it was also really really stressful and tough process!!
Random things:
She really doesn't understand why the Gibson Assmbly for ACEB contruct did not work out. It should at least have the same number of colonies as the negative control, how can it have no colony at all!!! The Gibson Assembly mix certainly have affected the DNA fragments in some way...Is it possible that a gene is toxic to its native strain? Also, for BBa_J176171!! She confirmed that the linear plasmid is stable at 50°C but why does it not assemble with complementary sequences engineered in GFP? Can we really trust sequence of this part? If this is heat sensitive, how can we confirm its sequence?
Astrid, ASTRID SEPHIRA ALIM
Astrid is a sophomore in HKUST, and studying Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Astrid works in sub-group 2 and mostly does the inoculation, which might be too many times so she got a new nickname, ""Inoculation girl""! For now, Astrid still has no clear plan at all after leaving UST, however she absolutely wants to go for further study or find something to do.

We received the 6 parts we had requested to IGEM 2008 Headquarters! (5 µl DNA + glycerol for every part) IGEM HQ also sent us a new punch tool:) Thank you very much!
9 ml cultures were grown correctly and BBa_J23100 culture was red. So we could perform miniprep for these 2 parts.
Red pellet for BBa_J23100 culture after a 15 min 4°C 6000 x g centrifuging
Unfortunately, plasmids extracted from BBa_B0030 culture were not pure: quantification at spectrophotometer showed an extra peak at 280 nm, which corresponds to protein contaminations.
We will repeat miniprep for BBa_B0030 next week, hoping to be luckier than this week...and hoping that QIAGEN miniprep kit will arrive soon!
We performed plasmid digestion for these 5 parts:
BBa_R0079 (X-P)
BBa_R0040 (X-P)
BBa_R0082 (X-P)
BBa_R0062 (X-P)

To provide more characterization data on these two promoters, we improved these promoters by obtaining different sequences.
Endogenous phosphate sensing system in E. coli
Figure 1. The Pho phophorous sensing system in E. coli.
E. coli has multiple native phosphorus sensing and regulation systems that we could use in the construct. Among them, we chose the PhoR/PhoB two-component system (TCS). It contains a sensory histidine kinase PhoR and a partner DNA-binding response regulator PhoB. PhoR is activated under low phosphate concentration, which will then phosphorylate PhoB. The phospho-PhoB is then capable of activating expression of the Pho regulon genes, two of the examples are phoA and phoBR. In high phosphate concentration, phoR is turned into an inhibitory state, which interferes with phosphorylation of PhoB. PhoB is, thus, not capable of activating expression of phoA and phoBR.
*The above text is our summarized understanding on phosphate-sensing system using information from Hsieh & Wanner (2010). Please refer to our references section below for the reference cited.

To construct a phosphate-sensing device, we cloned the promoters PphoA and PphoBR, and fused it with a GFP reporter BBa_I13504 in BioBrick RFC10 standard. The activity of promoter can then be reported by the fluorescence level under different phosphate concentrations.
The activities of PphoA (BBa_K1682013) and PphoBR (BBa_K1682015) in different phosphate concentrations were measured in Fluorescence per Biomass, following a modified protocol (see below) from Tokyo Tech 2013 iGEM team . They were found to be falling in a dynamic range of "

Abstract
Recent developments in the field of biomaterials have demonstrated the efficacy of silk in stabilizing temperature-sensitive compounds like antibiotics, enzymes, and vaccines. Moreover, silk has shown potential in wound healing applications due to its compatibility with human tissues and its ability to dissolve in a directed fashion. These unique characteristics make silk a promising platform for the deployment of bacteriophages to treat chronic wounds and combat the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Tufts Synthetic Biology envisions a biomedical product consisting of a silk film embedded with a lyophilized cocktail of bacteriophage-targeting pathogens responsible for chronic wound infection. This system could be utilized most readily as a bandage, with applications ranging from long-term burn management in the hospital setting to rapid treatment of penetrating wounds on the battlefield. The encapsulation of phage is also a viable antiseptic option for the silk scaffolds used in tissue regeneration. While this system has extensive possibilities for external and internal treatment options, this proposal specifically targets methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aereus (MRSA) skin infections.
Background and Significance
Bacteriophage Therapy
“The ability of phage to replicate exponentially and kill pathogenic strains of bacteria indicates that they should play a vital role in our armamentarium for the treatment of infectious diseases.”
Perhaps the most critical problem in modern medicine is the increased development of pathogenic bacteria resistant to most, if not all, available antimicrobial agents . The increasing occurrence of such antibiotic resistant strains has bred significant concern that a return to the “pre-antibiotics” era is a very real possibility. As such, expansion of alternative anti-infection therapy options has developed into one of the highest research priorities in biotechnology and modern medicine. When first-line and second-line antibiotic options become limited by resistance, healthcare providers are must resort to antibiotics"

Similarly as a result of our failure to express functional BioBricks in S. oneidensis MR-1 we decided to transfer our gene cluster to a modified pBAD vector for expression trials. With this information we designed our BioBricks to be assembled through a Golden Gate cloning strategy into any expression vector containing Bsal restriction sites. See the golden gate cloning page for more details. Our chosen pBAD vectors have been used in S. oneidensis before successfully (Edwards et al. 2015) making it a good choice for expression of our gene cluster.
In the future iGEM teams should investigate this to confirm the origin of replication is in fact the issue with BioBrick expression in S. oneidensis MR-1. If this is the case future iGEM teams can then move on to apply synthetic biology to optimise the origin of replication of some BioBricks for the highest possible copy number in S. oneidensis MR-1. These can then serve as a backbone for the cloning of further genes to be expressed in S. oneidensis MR-1 allowing more detailed investigations into the biotech applications of this organism.

School Project Interview with 6th Graders
Following the Danish Science Festival, we were contacted by two enthusiastic 6th graders, Bastian and Magnus. The two boys wanted to learn more about iGEM and GMO, which they intended to write about in a school project. They were curious to what range GMO could be used, and how we utilised it in our project, the PowerLeaf.
UNF Summer Camp
The UNF Summer Camp is an opportunity for high school students to show extra dedication towards science. We talked to some of the brightest young minds imaginable, all of whom aim to work in different fields of science in the future. At the summer camp, we held a presentation about our project, the iGEM competition, as well as how to handle and work with genes. We taught them how to assemble BioBricks and provided them with BioBricks for DNA assembly experiments, creating a ‘hands-on’ experience for these enthusiastic teenagers.
One of the high school students suggested that the Powerleaf should be able to rotate according to the sun, to ensure maximum exposure and outcome. We took this brilliant advice into consideration and contacted Robot Systems Engineer student, Oliver Klinggaard, who helped us with the potential implementation of a pan/tilt system. He provided us with his recent project report on the subject, as well as a description of the adjustments required for the implementation in our system, which you can find here .
Two students from the UNF Summer Camp thought the PowerLeaf was an interesting approach to sustainable energy, and they wanted to hear even more! So, they contacted us in late October, as they were interested to work on a project about green technology.
The Academy for Talented Youth
We hosted a workshop for the Academy for Talented Youth, an association for some of the most talented high school students in Denmark. During the workshop we invited the students into our laboratories, where they conducted a miniprep and a gel electrophoresis on bacteria containing our BioBricks. Additionally, we held a presentation and discussion about our project, with the dedicated students. We strongly believe in mutual communication and made sure to compile feedback, all of which was positive!
Presentations for the Local Schools

Ni affinity chromatography
1. Pick 3 colonies from plate and grow in 30mL LB + antibiotic (1‰ Kana or Amp according to vector) at 37℃ overnight. Transfer 10mL culture at 1:30 ratio into 300mL LB + antibiotic. After new culture could be grown at 37℃ into OD600 0.6~0.8 (which normally takes ~3hrs), add IPTG to induce protein expression at 16℃ for 18~20hrs.
2. Collect culture in a 50mL tube, centrifugate consecutively at 4℃ 5,000rpm for 5 min and discard of LB supernate. Resuspend sediment in 10mL lysis buffer (20mM HEPES, 500nM KCl) and centrifugate again. Then discard supernate and resuspend sediment in 20mL lysis buffer.
3. Add protease inhibitor at 1:1000 ratio and extract suspension through ultrasonication at 3sec/3sec for 10 min twice with 10 min interval. Centrifugate lysate at 4℃ 11,000rpm for 60 min. Take samples from supernate and sediment for future examination.
4. Blend supernate with Ni resin in a 50mL tube and incubate horizontally on ice at 160rpm shake for 1.5hr, then erect the tube and place on ice for 0.5 hr to settle mixture. Take sample from solution which would be marked as flow-through.     5. Segregate protein from affinity chromatography at 20nM-500nM imidazole gradient elution.
6. Equilibrate with storage buffer (20mM HEPES, 150mM NaCl).
7. Examine protein purification through SDS-PAGE.

Project Overview:
Since the isolation of GFP in 1962, fluorescent proteins have become a ubiquitous tool for studying cellular processes and have found applications in synthetic biology - for example serving as a reporter of the performance of the canonical repressilator.  To be better suited to the increasing precision of biological experimentation and the increasing sophistication of synthetic networks, however, these proteins will need to be more quantitatively characterized and used.  To this end, the 2011 VT iGEM team is interested in finding and optimizing good fluorescent reporters which mature and degrade quickly, and which fluoresce brightly.  This involves establishing a framework for modeling and characterizing fluorescent proteins, and then using this framework to find fast-maturing proteins and degradation tags that help destabilize and degrade them.  We hope that this work will lay a good foundation for a more quantitative use of fluorescent reporters in the future.
To tackle this problem, we have split our team into three specialized groups focusing on the Design, Fabrication, and Characterization of our fluorescent protein constructs.  This transdisciplinary approach allows us to work more quickly and achieve more ambitious goals
Design
Design Team Members:   Mark, Daniel
The Design Team designs biological constructs and makes predictions about their performance using the software tool GenoCAD.  As a Computer Assisted Design (CAD) tool, GenoCAD has a repository of biological parts, grammatical rules that help users put them together, and an attribute-grammar-based structure that helps users make predictions about how their assemblies will perform before they are made in a lab.  The Design Team works with all of these aspects of GenoCAD - searching for promising fluorescent reporters, promoters, and degradation tags to add to the repository, writing grammatical rules specific to this project that govern how parts can be put together, and using attributes to model how they expect our constructs to behave.  This software has been very useful to our project and has made it easy for the Design Team to quickly design many constructs and pass information about them to the Fabrication Team.
Fabrication
Fabrication Team Members:   Mandy, Loran, Hayley, Swetha

The kinetic equations are as follows:

where <math>F_{A}</math> and <math>F_{B}</math> represent the concentrations of basal enzymes that carry out the reverse reactions on nodes <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>, respectively (they oppose the active network links that activate <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>). In this circuit, node <math>A</math> simply functions as a passive relay of the input to node <math>C</math>; the circuit would work in the same way if the input were directly acting on node <math>C</math> (just replacing <math>A</math> with <math>I</math> in the third equation of Equation 1). Analyzing the parameter sets that enabled this topology to adapt indicates that the two constants <math>K_{CB}</math> and <math>K_{F_{B}B}^{^{\prime }}</math> (Michaelis-Menten constants for activation of <math>B</math> by <math>C</math> and inhibition of <math>B </math> by the basal enzyme) tend to be small, suggesting that the two enzymes acting on node <math>B</math> must approach saturation to achieve adaptation. Indeed, it can be shown that in the case of saturation this topology can achieve perfect adaptation.

The second strategy is shown below:
We make the T7promoter-CI part the same copy number as the bistable switch, to make the bistable switch easier triggered. However, this design may have larger disturbance on the bistable switch.

Finally, we have a 3 plasmid assembly. This design eliminates all the influences between either of the two parts.

fig17. Forth strategy---b
The first and second method of assembly can well support second stage assembly, because the bistable switch is on relatively higher copy plasmid, coupling the next module can only have minor interference to it. The third method, although not so promising in further assembly, but we didn’t give up trying it.
For the final method, which works out (see result section ), its further assembly is also promising. It is discussed in the Second Stage assembly section .
Result
We chose the best AND gate we had constructed (pBad-SupD, pSal-T7ptag, RBS B0033), bistable switch and 6 different T7promoter-C1 (the difference is on the RBS: B0030, B0031, B0032, B0033, B0034 and J44001) to achieve the first stage of assembling.
At last, we have successfully constructed some of clonings in the first and second strategy, and the most of clonings in the third strategy (AND gate and Bistable on pSB4K5) and the last strategy (three plasmids). After testing the function of some cloning in the third strategy and last strategy, we got some promising results, and based on these results, we can continue to finish our whole project.
Results of the third strategy:
After constructed the AND gate and Bistable on pSB4K5, we then transformed T7-C1 (12 kinds in total: two plasmid, pSB3T3 & pSB6A1; six"

Istanbul_Tech
This year, Istanbul Tech iGEM proposed a project with the purpose of creating a detection system for illegal methamphetamine-based drugs.  This system is constructed by an anti-METH single chain variable fragment (scFv) attached with fluorescent proteins. They expected to observe the FRET effect induced by the conformational changes in the scFv associated with binding of meth.  In order to do this, they proposed building a DIY spectrophotometer in which a light input shines through a whole-cell biosensor, is detected by a color sensor, is processed by a computer, and emits a different wavelength output induced by ligand binding (FRET).
Because our team had some drylab experience, we were able to help develop this idea. We showed that a cell phone camera could be used instead of a high-quality color sensor to detect color changes.  We also advised the team on arduino programming and the use of photoelectric multipliers.
More on Istanbul Tech’s project can be found on their wiki their wiki .

2. Evaluating an uncarried-on project by Artificial Intelligence.
In the future, we are going to adding a crowdsourcing feature in our software. To evaluate the project, a reliable auto-judging system will be created. The evaluation system will not only consist of simulation results but also variety of aspects that may affect the reliability of a project to function well (not only for Competition Awards but also for TRUE scientific & social effect it has). Machine learning and other method in big data mining area will definitely be used in the coming feature.
3. More validation experiments and feedbacks.
According to basic principles of engineering, iteration of the design-test-redesign circle for a product could never be enough. More efficient and user friendly features will be added during our further human practice in Synthetic Biology field. In our human practice section, we have demonstrate how we gain the idea of S-Din and how we enhanced it during the summer. We will do the same job for future improvement of S-Din, to make S-Din more popular and well-featured.
4. Dynamic data flow for synthetic biology.
During the brain storm, we want to add the feature that can provide dynamic data (news, latest paper) which can automatically upgraded everyday. Due to the limitation of time, we didn't merge this function into our software. In the future, these feature will be also added.
5. System optimization of the whole genome with the inserted circuits.
As a software team in synthetic biology, we felt responsible to build a software that can truly utilize the power of computer and algorithm to manage synthetic biologists  to accomplish important and complexed tasks. After circuits getting used seamlessly from search results, an consideration of the genome level are going into our sight. As the electronic system, performance and connection can be optimized to a most efficient or robustest way.
S-Din is the first step of our ambition to solve real synthetic biology problem based on which further project will have a ground foundation of data collection.

Our results from the side-by-side plate comparison of cholera with several strains of bacteria are encouraging!  We grew a patch of V. cholerae for one week on LB plates. Then, we streaked a line of a bacteria adjacent to the patch and another away from the patch.   We did this for six different strains on six different plates.  None of the bacterial strains plated adjacent to cholera grew.  All strains grew away from cholera.  However, TT9907, the strain with lambda lysogen, showed plaques! There were distinct plaques on the line of bacteria leading away from Cholera. Through what we believe is a quorum sensing pathway, the lambda lysogen recognizes that E.Coli has detected cholera.  It mobilizes excision from the genome, replicates, and lyses it's host.
We prepared top agar lawns of our 6 strains, with cholera plated in the middle, to show more clearly the result we saw today.
Clarice transformed the iGEM backbone into E.Coli and grew it up in an overnight.  From those cells we isolated the plasmid, pIG91, in two Eppendorfs, at concentrations of 52 ng/uL and 82 ng/uL.  Monday we will digest the plasmid and the SdiA gene to splice it in and submit to the registry.

The children's book is shaded!  We read it in class today and confirmed that everyone enjoyed it.  Redge needs only to make a few grammatical edits.  Hopefully tomorrow or Wednesday we'll get an appointment with Dr. Jaime Jensen, a member of the biology department here at BYU.  Dr. Jensen earned her doctorate in Biological Science Education, and we hope that she will give us some good ideas on how to maximize the educational value of our book and its appending parental guide.
And, we have wonderful news from the top agar lawns we plated on Wednesday.  Our results confirm that cholera does NOT kill bacteria that grow next to it, but DOES indeed stress bacteriophage lambda such that it lyses its host cell.  See our photos to the"

We use Gillespie algorithm to simulate the stochastic process of the reversal after Cre binds to Loxp sites. We can see from the result of this part that the inversion only happens when Cre protein binding to Loxp sites exists and about 50% of genes flip to the state we want. readmore
Sensitivity Analysis
We analyze three parameters and the third parameter –the degradation rate of Cre protein –have an obvious effect on the final percent of the genes in different state. readmore

By introducing a feed forward to the system, we increase the percent of the genes flipping to the state we want.And the system is more stable. readmore

Our talk was received very well by the audience, and numerous questions from the scientific fraction were asked and answered. Probably the most important non-scientific question of the evening was, if, as beer is also containing a lot of vitamins, beer would be a good source of vitamin B
12. Sadly, we had to clarify that a human would need to drink 100 L of beer per day – which we do not recommend at all for a healthy and balanced nutrition.
Back to School
We think that school students are a very important target audience. Therefore, we went to the Grotefend Gymnasium in Hann. Münden to introduce the students (age 16-18) into synthetic biology as well as the iGEM competition and our project.
We think that it is very important for the students to get an idea about the countless opportunities biology offers and the impact of all fields of biology on our daily life. When finishing school and thinking about academic studies, we know from our own experience that we weren’t too comfortable with synthetic biology and what it meant at this point of our lives. But this is what we are doing now and to give those young people an insight in this endless field of research we visited them and gave our best to show them the high potential.
After introducing them into the everyday life of a student, we went over to explaining what synthetic biology is and which impact it already has on our life. Especially at this point we realized that it was worth to come as most of the students were fascinated about the importance of research in this area. Finally, we could tell them about the iGEM competition and the way how students from all over the world work in their teams to make the world a bit better. We limited ourselves to state our project in a quite simple and understandable way, to not scare them but make them interested.
All in all we really enjoyed the day with the students and hope that all of them will go their own way no matter if they go into science or somewhere else.

Hayton serves a largely rural population, mainly receiving waste from farms and small villages, and is one of a small number of descriptive sites in the area, which cater to such populations.
We were shown how samples were collected from the primary tanks outside of the main tank. The sample collected on the day we visited was markedly redder than is typically expected from a sewage sample, and was collected by Yorkshire Water for further investigation.  It was speculated this might have been effluent sent to the treatment plant from a neighbouring abattoir, although this would not comply with waste regulations.
After we were shown the outer tanks in which sewage was aerated we were shown the main tank at Hayton. A fatberg had accumulated in the settling tank of the plant. The settling tank is where the solids sediment and separate from the liquid part of the sewage, but a thick, yellow layer of lipid mass had hardened on the top of the sewage. The hardened fatberg prevented the separation of solid mass from liquid, and the comparatively separated sewage could not flow through to the next compartment. This in turn inhibited waste material from entering the settling tank in the first place, and the system was on the verge of overflowing.
The lack of sewage exiting the settling tank had a knock-on effect on the aeration tank as well. The aeration tank is where aerobic bacteria are grown to reduce the organic content of the sewage before it is sent on to a purification plant. Since there was a reduction in effluent reaching the aeration tank the bacterial population was declining. Levels were also lower in the final clarification tank.
After touring the plant we discussed the problems and damages caused by fatbergs and the great cost this had on Yorkshire Water with Clarke. It was apparent that a solution to this problem would be greatly sought after by the water industry. It was noted that the recent spate of fatbergs had coincided with the recent opening of a new restaurant not 100 metres from the site itself, and problems in the area had not been commonplace before it’s opening.
This video we have created will take you through the steps and measures taken at the treatment plant and will allow you to see a real life fatberg!

Dalhousie_Halifax_NS,2016,Team:Dalhousie Halifax NS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," to determine what bacteria are found in the sample.
Illumina sequencing provides a massive amount of data that must then be sifted through with the aid of computer programs. For this task we use QIIME analysis tools with the help of the Integrated Microbiome Resource here at Dalhousie University and Dr. Morgan Langille’s Microbiome Helper tool.
QIIME Analysis:
To fully understand the data that the illumina sequencer gives us, we must use a data analysis pipeline. A pipeline is simply a set of tools used in the workflow of data analysis to provide us with a clear picture of the data we have collected. The microbiome helper tool, developed by Dr. Morgan Langille, contains the entire Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME, pronounced “chime”) set of tools which, collectively, are an open-source pipeline that wraps many other tools necessary for the analysis of illumina sequenced 16S rRNA gene data. This pipeline makes it possible to analyze 16S data efficiently and with accuracy to determine the taxonomy of the microbial community represented by the 16S sequences.
contain not only sequences that are important to us, but also chimeric sequences, bad quality sequences, very short sequences and lots of other “junk data” that could interfere with our taxonomic assessment down the pipeline. We must use the QIIME tools to clean up the raw data and retain what is useful.
The first step is to align forward and reverse DNA sequence reads, which come out of the sequencer as single-strand reads, and compile them into double-stranded reads. QIIME uses PEAR (Paired-End reAd mergeR) to do this.
The next step is to use a statistics tool called fastQC, which provides us with information of the read quality and length from the paired reads created in the PEAR step. This step allows the filtering of reads to remove short and bad quality reads from our samples. fastQC also has scripts for this process.
Following filtering of the reads, chimeric reads must be removed. A chimeric read is a piece of DNA amplified during the PCR step that is a combination of two separate molecules that became joined as a byproduct of PCR. Because the 16S region of the bacterial and archaeal genomes are conserved, they often contain some level of sequence similarity. This occasionally causes one single-stranded 16S DNA molecule to base-pair to, and prime, the PCR amplification of another leading to a new, chimeric 16S gene that is not indicative of any bacterial"

In this case, the current would consist solely of calcium ions moving into the cell.[12] Also, it is required that the term GV be scaled by the probability of the channel being open, and also by the number of channels per cell. Thus, current may be written as:[2],[13],[14]

The solution of the differential equations above takes the form:
Therefore, the current may be written as:
The solutions are plotted as such:
The reason that the current is negative is that by convention, the inward diffusion of calcium ions is called inward current, since it diffuses into the cell.[5] Therefore, one must remember to take the negative of the current to obtain its magnitude. The relatively small magnitudes of and render the channel relatively insensitive to inactivation, and as such, the action is mitigated by negative feedback from the calcium binding to calmodulin and calcineurin. This will be discussed further in the Calcium-Induced YFP Transcription/Translation.
Derivation of Calcium Intake and Post-Stimulation Calcium Concentration
The amount of calcium taken into the cell, and therefore the post-stimulation concentration, can be derived from the current taken at the ideal stimulation voltage (8 mV), during the ideal shock time (60 s). The idea behind the equation is simple: the total instantaneous charge will be taken, divided by 2x elementary charge, then divided by Avogadro’s number to obtain the number of moles taken in. This is then divided by the volume of the cell (1.25e-13 L) to obtain the post-stimulation concentration.[1],[10]
This concentration of calcium will be the input from which YFP transcription is derived.
Calcium-Induced YFP Transcription/Translation=
Assumptions
Entry into the nucleus occurs by diffusion, on the scale of several minutes.
YFP takes more than a day to significantly degrade.
Calcium first binds to Calmodulin; it is assumed that all of this bound calcium will bind to Calcineurin.

OUR TEAM
Tianjin University IGEM team is one of the first entries to attend the IGEM      competition in China. We started our IGEM journey from 2007 and we won a      gold medal on our first try. Last year, our project AlkSensor won the gold medal      and Best Poster award. With the increasing times of successful or failed attempts in the competition.      We have accumulated much meaningful experience in the field of synthetic      biology. With all of the experiences and joint efforts, a more united, efficient and      passionate team is built up.
This year we form a team of 16 students from the school of chemical engineering.      Not only seeking help from our instructor, we are planning to launch a series of      interchange activities with other teams and Chinese Academy of Sciences. We      also pay attention to the potential impact of our project to our society. With our      joint efforts, we hope, by exploring the relationship between science and life, we      can make the world more wonderful.
OUR PROJECT
An efficient method to transduce biological sense into electric signal.
To detect the concentration of certain micromolecules quantitively in almost real time.
Questions it raises : 1.If we set up this platform above, what aspects can it apply to?
2,What methods can be applied to real-time     detection and analysis to some molecules     that are difficult to detect in traditional     ways?
3.How to maintain the stable structure of curli fiber when it functioned?
Biosensors are becoming more and more indispensable tools in     life science, medicine, chemistry and biotechnology, which are     greatly enhanced by synthetic biology.
Yet in the bio-sensing procedure, the limitations of signal output     methods restrict the usage and practicality of biosensors. Wildly     used reporters such as chromophore and fluorescent protein     which requires laboratorial equipments to measure often result in     the loss of accuracy and Immediacy.

Freiburg,2012,Team:Freiburg#HumanPractices#Philo_-_-_TEXT.html," made by humans, they are also supposed to have a useful function: a machine needs to be constructed with the intention to be a helpful mean to some human end.  Although many of the scholars who worked on the products of synthetic biology accepted almost unproblematicly that the synthetic entities have technical functions (e.g. [10],[11],[17]), we wanted to examine in detail the idea of a synthetic biological product following a human-set goal. For this, we decided to study the relation between technical functions and biological functions, as the concept of a ‘living machine’ seems to have both of them.  Generally, referring to a function supposes to explain why its correspondent function bearer occurs and why it is there [18]. For example: if someone asks what a knife is, then we usually appeal to its function as cutting and stabbing tool and if someone asks what a heart is, then we answer referring to its function of pumping blood. Hence, functions are good for causal explanations. However, regarding the products of the synthetic biology we have an overdetermination problem, because we can explain what a trait is referring to both, technical functions and biological functions. Imagine following situation:
A synthetic biologist produces modified bacteria which are susceptible to glucose and that assist the treatment of diabetes in human beings. These bioengineered bacteria have a synthetic toggle switch which is activated when blood sugar levels reaches a tolerance threshold and allows the transcription of a substance to help the uptake of glucose from the blood. The decrease of glucose in blood allows the bacteria to live on.
If we want to explain why the bacteria have a toggle switch, we can say two things: this toggle switch enables the production of a substance, which decreases the amount of blood sugar and hence helps the treatment of diabetes or this toggle switch enables the production of a substance which decreases the amount of blood sugar and is therefore beneficial for the bacteria (and the occurrence of this toggle switch in the bacteria is the result of a feedback mechanisms involving the exercise of producing the substance). The bacteria also have a synthetic toggle switch, because it was constructed so or because it helps the whole system to live. If both functional explanations are correct in the same context, then we have a faulty overdetermination (two causes for one effect).

Kyoto,2016,Team:Kyoto#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," its cultivation condition was not known until recently, research on such methods has been significantly hindered [*1]. We therein resolved to devote our knowledge and skills of synthetic biology to join the global fight against the unconquered and highly contagious NoV.
Recent studies show that NoV seems to be multiplying in the human B cells, binding to the Histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) of enteric cells to get within the intestinal epithelial barrier [3][5][7]. Another study shows that human anti-NoV antibodies, such as antibody 12A2, bind to NoV's HBGA-binding site [8]. It suggests that the antibody sterically hinders NoV from binding to HBGA and blocks NoV's entry into human body, effectively neutralizing them (Fig3).
Fig3 Infection route of NoV and neutralization mechanisms of antibody 12A2.
NoV binds to the HBGA to pass through intestinal epithelial cells to multiply in the B cells. Human antibody 12A2 sterically hinders NoV's binding to HBGA[*2] [3][5][7][8][9].
2-2 Development of Noro-catcher
From these studies stated above, we thought of using a well known bacteria, E. coli to be a carrier of anti-NoV antibody to intestinal tracks. If we succeeded in delivering the anti-NoV antibody that binds to HBGA binding site of NoV, not only would it block the binding of NoV to HGBA, but might also physically remove E. coli-bound NoV from the intestinal tracks.
There are three steps in which we aim our Noro-catcher to carry out its intended purpose (Fig4). First, we deliver our Noro-catcher into the patient intestine. Second, after reaching the NoV-infested intestine, Noro-catcher will bind specifically to NoV using its surface expressed anti-NoV antibody. Third, the NoV-bound Noro-catcher will promptly be excreted from human digestive system. To achieve the first step, we could use exiting methods such as orally administering medicine, sterilized and capsule-enveloped, to patients. In our study, we created a biodevice with two handles in order to achieve the second and third steps. These two handles are both achieved through the same surface expression technology.

1) Noro-catcher is sterilized and enveloped within a capsule, then orally administered to patients.

Missouri_Miners,2012,Team:Missouri Miners#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," If the cells still fluoresce, the membranes will be isolated and tested alone for fluorescence. If the part works, the membrane will fluoresce indicating that the fluorescent protein is anchored to the cell membrane.
To determine whether or not the scaffoldin module works, the same experiment will be performed but with a different hybrid. In this case, the fluorescent protein would be combined with a type 1 dockerin module. It would also be ideal if more than one color of fluorescent protein was successfully anchored to the cell membrane. This would show that the construct is capable of anchoring more than one part.
It may also be possible to asses the effects of changing the ratios between the cohesin sites compatible with one fluorescence and those compatible with another. For instance if cohesins from two species were incorporated into the scaffoldin and if two different fluorescent proteins were each hybridized to a corresponding dockerin module, the fluorescent protein hybrids would only be able to bind to the cohesin that originated from the same organism as the dockerin module that protein has. In theory if one protein's dockerin had a single cohesin on the scaffolding and the other had two, the effective concentration of the later protein would be twice that of the former.
The team may also attempt to test the system using a naturally occurring multiple enzyme process (possibly fatty acid oxidation). The efficiency of such a system could be measured with and without the modified scaffoldin and anchoring protein.
Next Steps
In the future, a library of cohesin and dockerin modules could be built for simplified assembly of customized scaffodins. To do this, the team would isolate cohesin and dockerin modules of a variety of types from a variety of cellulosome-producing species. These modules would then be combined by iGEM non-standard restriction sites flanking the gene sequence, allowing for almost complete customization to the user's needs.
