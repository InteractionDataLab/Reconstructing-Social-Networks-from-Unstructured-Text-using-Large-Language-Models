Biology
The aim of our experiments is to demonstrate the coloration, for that we have done different experiments:
The goal is to introduce the constructions (pcst-RBS-CinR) and (pCin-lycopene) on the same bacterium, the constructions are supported on pSB3C5 and pSB1A2 respectively., by adding externel AHL molecule, this latter can enter in the bacterium and forms with CinR molecules complex that allows the activation of Lycopene production, after few times we can see the red color.
CLONING OF THE CONSTRUCTION pCst-RBS-CinR IN pSB3C5:
Restriction using  EcoRI and Pst1.
Ligation: standard protocol was performed; Pcst-RBS-CinR was inserted into pSB3C5 plasmids
Spreading over Petri dish.
Better cloning rate (New stock of biobrick Miniprep)
Do checking, PCR cheking.
To confirm the result gel checking was performed.
pCin-Lycopene CONSTRUCTION IN pSB1A2 PREPARATION
Culture overnight (the biobrick Miniprep was prepared).
Double transformation (introduction of the two plasmids contain pCst-RBS-CinR and  pCin-Lycopene respectively).
Spreading over Petri dish containing double resistances Ch and Amp.
Good results, we choose 15 clones.
PCR on clones was performed, 8 clones had the two plasmids.
To confirm the result gel checking was performed.
PREPARATION OF THE 96 WELLS PLATE.
We have tested our 8 clones with three different concentration of AHL (1mM, 0,5mM and 0,2mM).

Cardiff Wales
On August 9th, we spoke with the Cardiff team over video chat after corresponding with them through email regarding a new use of our parts. The team proposed using our ribitol induced promoter upstream of a fluorescent protein and transforming it into tobacco plants using agrobacterium. Since our ribitol promoter is a part of a larger operon, we decided to send them the sequence for the promoter. In addition the team decided to assist us on our device by 3D printing a model using STS files we provided them.
The team discussed the application of our device and project with a local agronomist, which contributed to our human practices work and project logistics. They assembled a plasmid with the ribitol promoter upstream of a fluorescent protein for transformation into Nicotiana benthamiana. They found some leaky expression of the protein during their testing.
Our team assisted the Cardiff team by helping them code parts of their wiki. We helped them interpret our code for the navigation bar to fit their pages and wiki design. In addition, some of their pages were adapted after ours.
Collaboration with ICT Mumbai
On July 21st we conducted our first video conference with the ICT Mumbai team after communicating with them through Instagram. The objective of the call was to learn more about each other’s projects and establish a connection to help facilitate easier collaboration in the future.

Potential replication competence
Each vector has its own benefits and drawbacks. Plasmid vectors, such as non-viral DNA vectors, have several advantages over viral vectors. Virus production is expensive ( Templeton et al. 2002 , Nagasaki and Shinkai, 2007 ) and safety of viral transfection remains a concern after several deaths ( McCormack et al. 2004 , Hacein-Bey-Abina et al. 2008 ). However, plasmid vectors have a very low transfection efficiency ( Murakami et al. 2011 ), especially compared to adenoviruses that have been shown to have a 95% transfection efficiency in hepatocytes ( Huard et al. 1995 , Sullivan et al 1997 ). Transfection efficiency of plasmids can be improved through methods such as in vivo electroporation ( Ataka et al. 2003 ). However, this method requires the insertion of electrode needles into the athlete to increase transfection efficiency. This is more invasive to the athlete than a single injection of vector particles.  Therefore, adenoviruses are seen as the most likely transfection method for gene doping at this stage and even more so in the near future. Hence, most of the numerical values were based on this type of vector.
2. Model Design
2.1 sgRNA Array Model
The four input variables of the model are the coding sequence of a gene, the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) of the CRISPR-Cas protein, the length of the sgRNA, and the CRISPR-Cas-dependent identity between sgRNA seed and target (off target effect). An overview of the generated algorithm is shown in figure 3.
Figure 3. Overview of the algorithm used to generate sgRNA array for detection of gene doping with targeted sequencing.
Detailed Steps of the sgRNA Algorithm
A step-by-step overview of the algorithm used for determination and creation of sgRNAs is given below:

今回、私たちが得た結果は極めて理想的で、過酸化水素による濃度的、時間的な蛍光タンパク質の発現調節が可能であることを示唆しています。従って、私たちはこの発現系により、極めて多くの色をつくり得ると考えられます。私たちの発現システムはE.coli Penの開発にとって、間違いなく強力なツールとなります"

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#experiment#exp1_-_-_TEXT.html," type cells and cells expressing inducible glyoxylate shunt.
To facilitate expression of inducible glyoxylate shunt in human hepatoma cell line (HepG2 cell), cell viability at different sodium palmitate concentration was measured. While a high fatty acid level is known to lead apoptosis, the cell viability test ensured maintenance of a stable cell line for transfection.
We used MTT assay to test cell viabilities in different fatty acid concentrations. The objective was to determine a range of optimal concentrations of fatty acids to be introduced into HepG2 cell and achieve more than 60% viability after 24 hours incubation and/or more than 50% in 48 hours.
MTT Assay Description
MTT assay measures the enzymatic activity of oxidoreductase enzymes that only show activity when the cells are alive. MTT, a tetrazolum dye, is reduced into an insoluble formazan, giving a purple color. Organic solvent such as DMSO can be used to dissolve the formazan. Absorbance at 570 is measured using a spectrophotometer to quantitatively determine the amount of formazan formation.
In our experiment, HepG2 cells were seeded into a 96-well plate. After one day incubation gradient concentration of sodium palmitate from 0 mM to 1.0mM, and 2.0mM were added into each row. After adding the sodium palmitate, we have incubated the cells for 24 hours and 48 hours respectively. MTT reagent was added and formazan formation was observed and measured using spectrophotometer.
Results
Figure 1: Average Cell Viability in Different Palmitic Acid Concentrations. A. HepG2 cells were incubated in gradient concentration of sodium palmitate from 0mM to 1.0mM and 2.0mM for 24hours. MTT reagents were added and formazan formation was measured using spectrophotometer. The relative ratio of absorbance at different fatty acid concentration was then calculated by comparing with A570 at 0mM fatty acid concentration. The percentage of relative absorbance ratio was regarded as values of cell viability. B. HepG2 cells were incubated in gradient concentration of sodium palmitate for 48hours.
From the MTT assay, we observed that after 24 hours of incubation with palmitic acid, around45% of cell viability can be maintained even at 2.0mM. For 48 hours"

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data"

Both ABI and PYL are found in plants. Thus, they can be implemented in mammalian cells, since the system is orthogonal. We tested our system using split integrase proteins in mammalian cells.
We characterized functionality of this domain in several split amino acid locations. One example shown below included splitting the TP901-1 protein and fusing halves to ABI and PYL respectively. We added ABA into our media to induce dimerization of the domains and protein halves, and measured the protein activity of TP901-1 afterwards. We were able to characterize some functional splits, since we regained TP901-1 activity after inducing dimerization. One functional split site (between amino acids 326-327) is shown below:
In the above experiment, we tested both domain fusion orientations. Proper TP901-1 activity led to expression of our mRuby fluorescent protein, which can be seen in both cases above. Read more about our fluorescent reporter experiment here .
Considerations with other parts: We intended to submit more parts to the iGEM registry, including other dimerization domains that we used (FKBP and FRB, CRY2 and CIBN), other integrases and RDFs (TP901-1, PhiC31, and gp3). Some of these were already in the Registry. However several of these protein domains were extremely large and did not conform with the BioBrick standard since they contained several internal restriction sites.

We were able to introduce a silent mutation into ABI such that it was BioBrick compatible (thanks to IDT for the synthesis offer). We were also easily able to submit orf7 and PYL because these were BioBrick compatible. We recognize that working with large parts pose such BioBrick issues, and we discuss possible ways to mitigate this on our mammalian synthetic biology challenges page .

Electroporation of pSB-pLAC-CD into electrocompetent AcsAB-containing DH10B cells
DH10B E.coli already containing the AcsAB construct were made electrocompetent using a standard protocol, which can be found in the Protocols section. A second round of transformation was carried out to insert pLAC-AcsCD. 5ul of miniprepped pSB-pLAC-CD (diluted in ddH2O) were added into 50ul electrocompetent DH10B cells already containing the pBAD-inducible AcsAB element. Electroporation was carried out in in 10mm electrocuvettes at 1.8 kV, 200 Ohm resistance and 25 mF capacitance. 500ul SOC medium was added to the electroporated samples and these were recovered at 37 °C for 1h before plating on Kanamycin25 + Chloramphenicol 50 LB Agar plates.
Congo Red Characterization
LB Agar Congo Red assay plates were prepared with a final Congo Red concentration of 20uM, and they were supplied with 0.1% Arabinose, 0.5mM IPTG, 50 ug/mL Chloramphenicol, 25 ug/mL Kanamycin and 1% Glucose. Transformed cells containing both AcsAB and AcsCD were plated on Congo Red assay plates and incubated at 37 °C. They were qualitatively assayed after 24h and 48h for cellulose production. Finally, 5 mL LB supplied with 0.1% Arabinose, 0.5mM IPTG, 50 ug/mL Chloramphenicol, 25 ug/mL Kanamycin and 1% Glucose were inoculated with freshly grown, cellulose-producing colonies and were grown for 16h at 30 °C, 180 rpm. An empty vector control was also grown overnight for comparative analysis. These liquid cultues were supplied with Congo Red, to yield a final concentration of 20uM. They were incubated under static conditions for 2h at room temperature, and were later pelleted down to allow for qualitative analysis of Congo Red binding.
AcsAB functionality was assayed by inducing AcsAB-containing cells with "

Frontend Part
About Frontend Framework
​ To make it easy to build applications with the web, we use advanced frontend framework Angular6 which is an open source framework maintained by Google. It is based on the Model View Controller (MVC) Architecture which ordinarily utilized for planning rich web applications. Angular6 combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end-to-end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. It helps developers to build cross-platform applications that live on the web, mobile, and desktop across Mac, Windows, and Linux.                         ​ Angular6 makes our web pages extremely high performance. It turns templates into code that's highly optimized for today's JavaScript virtual machines, giving us all the benefits of hand-written code with the productivity of a framework. And Angular apps load quickly with the new Component Router, which delivers automatic code-splitting so users only load code required to render the view they request.                         ​ Thanks to Angular popular, many well-known code editing products support Angular, like Visual Studio Code, Sublime text and WebStorm. We choose WebStorm as our IDE to makes code easily and spend less time.                         ​ When setting up our development environment, Angular CLI plays an important role. Angular CLI is a command line tool which makes build, add components and test faster. It has become one of the most essential tools for Angular.                         ​ We use Angular6 modularity system and component system to work together more easily and efficiently. The modularity system differentiates and combines the same and different functions and the component system can use less code to do a good job. Benefiting from Angular6’s performance and rendering mechanism which are better than most current mainstream frameworks,  including Vue and React, our web pages has faster response and more comfortable experience. With Karma for unit tests, our codes become stronger.                         ​ One of the important reasons we choose Angular6 is the issue of network security. Angular6 has built-in protections against common web-application vulnerabilities and attacks such as cross-site scripting attacks. To systematically block XSS bugs, Angular treats all values as untrusted by default. When a value is inserted into the DOM from a template"

Collaboration
Intro
Starting this summer, we have formed connections and maintained communications with other high school                     and                     collegiate teams, and we are glad that we could offer our help to some of the teams, and happy to                     receive theirs.
RDFZ-China
We provided lab resources to team RDFZ-China for two times. In the first time, we provided Kit Plate                     4 N4                     L12 and Kit Plate 3 G6 I6 F22 to their team. In the second time we provided bacteria solution of PSB                     1c3                     with designed restriction enzyme cutting site. Since high school teams do not usually have the                     financial                     support from school, most of the lab materials used by RDFZ are purchased by their team members. We                     are                     very happy to share our lab resources and help keep their experiments going and make their project                     come                     true.
Shipment Coordination
Because of the fact that the person responsible for receiving part in Genescript has recently                     resigned                     from his position, so there was a period of confusion where all the teams in China didn’t know who to                     send their parts too. One of our team leader Ruohong Wang actively communicated with the Genescript                     company and after rounds of negotiation finally got to know the new recipient of all the team’s                     parts.                     After knowing this piece of information, Ruohong spread the news the all the teams in China and                     helped                     all of them with this shipping problem.

Summary
As we know, some metal ions are toxic to bacterial cells at all concentrations, therefore detoxification and resistance systems that employ a variety of mechanisms to rid the cell of these potentially lethal toxins have evolved. In most cases, the expression of such resistance systems is controlled at the level of transcription by metal sensor proteins that sense specific metal ions via their direct coordination [1]. The most famous resistance system is smtB-OP-smtA device which defend metal ions including Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+ [1-3]. Briefly, the protein SmtB generally functions as a repressor in the absence of metal ions and become activators upon metal binding, by driving a metal-induced DNA conformational switch that converts a sub-optimal promoter (OP-promoter) into a potent one, then activate the expression of SmtA. In previous reports, the smtB-OP-smtA element which located in Synechococcus may also function as a metal ions (Zn2+, Co2+ and Cd2+) responsive repressor in E. coli [4-6]. In this case, we focused on detecting the content of Cd2+, while whether this well-known element could be employed in our project still remained uncertain. Therefore, we took steps of experiments and yielded several interesting data below.
Firstly, we obtained the smtB-OP-smtA device from Synechococcus genome and tested the growth of bacterium containing this element in Cd2+ present condition (Figure 1). The result displayed a significant growth advantage with smtB-OP-smtA positive E. coli, indicating the device worked in E. coli. Thus, we wanted to use pigments as reporters in our designed genetic construct which can be recognized by the naked eye. According to the previous work, we have chosen an identified pigment in the Registry: the biobrick of RFP ( BBa_E1010 ) was used as reporter gene in our"

E. Chrono
E. chrono attempts to merge synthetic biology and microfluidics into a novel hybrid system. The goal of E. chrono is to leverage quorum sensing in Escherichia coli to produce a microfluidic based fluorescent watch.
The E. chrono project focused on 3 major goals:
Learn the microfluidic device design process and select a software platform capable of rapid design.
Develop a cheap and efficient means for rapid prototyping of microfluidic devices.
Fabricate and test microfluidic designs.
Additionally, E. chrono sought to produce a cheap and efficient methodology for the rapid fabrication and prototyping of microfluidic devices. It is our hope that the designs and methods implemented in our project can be utilized in future competitions by other iGEM teams.

1.  Education
    With the intention to involve children in bioscience, our team organized a theme activity aiming to raise the young-generation's interest in science.
On June 22th The first station: Tian-E-Hu kindergarten
I. Science speech
    In this section, we introduced probiotics to children, and talked to them about the relationship between probiotics and our daily food, including yogurt, pickle and others. We also explained how probiotics work in our intestines. They showed great curiosity and asked us lots of questions about probiotics. We answered them patiently in an understanding way.
 
II. Drawing bacteria
     In this section, we asked the children to image how bacteria look like and draw them down. What they have drawn showed their rich imagination and understanding about our introduction.
     In summary, what we have done in Tian-E-Hu kindergarten enabled these children to understand the probiotics, and inspired their interest in science.
 
On July 8th The second station: the youth palace
     This section was meant for adults and teenagers. We made some display boards, which articulate and connect fundamental ideas in genetics, synthetic biology and iGEM without technical vocabulary and dense detail. Parents whose children was engaged with our other activities can come and listen. We got great feedback from them. They asked many questions and learned a lot in this section. This is also a mutual understanding between our project and its potential consumers.
 
iGEM propaganda
     In order to promote synthetic biology and iGEM, we held a preaching meeting about synthetic biology and iGEM for the students came from all faculties in Jiangnan University. At the meeting, we had a total of three parts. The first part was to introduce iGEM and synthetic biology to the students. The second part was brainstorm, which let students think about our project's innovative points and flash points based on our project's background. The third part was a free exchange session. Students can communicate with us about things related to our project and team. After this meeting, the innovation of our project is sublimated further.

AxyPrep Plasmid Miniprep Spin Protocol
Collect 1-4 ml of overnight LB culture. Centrifuge at 12,000g for 1 minute to pellet the bacteria. Decant or pipette off as much of the supernatant as practical.
Note: When using rich broths such as LBG or 2×YT, reduce the culture volume by half. Excessive bacteria will reduce lysis efficiency, resulting in low yield and reduced purity of the plasmid DNA. Do not exceed 2 ml of bacterial culture grown in rich broth.
Resuspend the bacterial pellet in 250 μl of Buffer S1 by vortexing. Please be sure that the bacteria are completely resuspended before proceeding.
Note: Be sure that RNase A has been added into Buffer S1.
Add 250 μl of Buffer S2, and mix by gently inverting the tube for 4-6×. Do not vortex.
Note: Vigorous shaking or vortexing will cause shearing of the bacterial   genomic DNA and result in the contamination of the plasmid DNA.
Note: After use, the buffer S2 bottle should be closed immediately in order to avoid neutralization of NaOH by ambient CO2.
Note: Buffer S3 (Step 4, below) must be added within 5 minutes.

Game overview
    There are many factors (Like initial number of each populations and spatial factors) can have influence on the results of population interactions in our system, and we found that it will be much easier to consider effects of these factors if we can visualize it. Therefore, we designed our game---E.coli War to satisfy our needs.
    Our games are made on structure of html5. The videos below are two short videos of our Fluid E.coli War and solid E.coli War.
See more details on Fluid E.coli War and Solid E.coli War
   After we designed our game preliminarily, we visited Beijing Perfect World Network Technology Co., Ltd (Perfect World), one of the largest game company in China, to learn more about the design of a game. The useful advice from the experts  help us a lot in improving our E.coli War, making it more fun and easier for kids to play.
See more details at Visiting Perfect World
    Afterwards, when children played this game during our exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum (CSTM), they found many interesting results which can even promote our understanding of this system. (See more details at Exhibition at National Museum and Game Discovery ) Furthermore, this can also be helpful for our further research design.

USTC_Software,2009,Team:USTC Software#Algorithm_-_-_TEXT.html," many high dimensional systems when the input variables are properly chosen. This is also the formula we use to achieve HDMR expansion. How to determine HDMR component functions? Practical formulations of the HDMR component functions determine whether we can carry out this algorithm. Theoretically, a component function
<math>f_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(x_{i1},x_{i2},...,x_{il})</math>
is obtained by minimizing the functional,
<math>\min_{f_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(u_{i1},u_{i2},...,u_{il}}\int_{\Omega}\omega_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(\hat{x},u) [f(u)-f_{0}-\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(u_{i})-\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} f_{ij}(u_{i}, u_{j})-...- \sum_{1\leq i_{1}<...<i_{l}\leq n}f_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(u_{i1},u_{i2},...,u_{il})]^{2}du</math>
under a suitable specified orhogonality condition which guarantees that all the component functions are determined step by step. Here,<math>\hat{x}=(x_{i_{1}},x_{i_{2}},...,x_{i_{n}}</math> , <math>\omega_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(\hat{x},u)</math> is a weight function. Different weight functions will produce distinct, but formally equivalent HDMR expansions. There are two commonly used HDMR expansions: Cut- and RS(Random Sampling)-HDMR. Cut-HDMR expresses <math>f(x)</math> in reference to a specified cut point, while RS-HDMR depends on the average value of <math>f(x)</math> over the whole domain <math>\Omega</math> . We adopt RS-HDMR to do global sensitivity analysis. For RS-HDMR, we first rescale variables <math>x_{i}</math> such that <math>0<x_{i}<1</math> for all i. The output function <math>f(x)</math> is then defined in the unit hypercube

Collaboration with team Aachen
While we were working on our project, we had connected with several other iGEM teams. We  worked really well with a student team from Aachen, Germany. They had a similar topic as us, so  collaboration was easier due to common ground. Firstly, we had a few conference calls with them  and after exchanging our experience with already conducted research and preparations for iGEM, we  worked on possible ways to solve the problems we all pointed out. Furthermore we discussed other  ways of collaboration.  We helped them with their Human Practises by filling out their questionnaire  on lab organisation and also conducted several tests for them.
They were investigating the degree of GMO pollution in the laboratories we worked in, which is  indeed a valuable problem to explore. When dealing with something with such power to transform  the world as synthetic biology has, safety is very important, both in the outside world when we try to  apply our ideas to everyday lives and in the lab as well. GMO pollution in the lab is an important  question because it concerns our safety and the safety of other people we interact with, so we were  glad to be able to participate in their study.
We conducted several swab tests on different surfaces with agar chips by placing 3 on each selected  surface for 5 seconds and then placed them in petri dishes.  They were incubated at 37°C and after  24 hours we received the following results:
tu pride slike Slovenia_HS_CollaborationAachen
The agar chips were maid according to the protocol they have sent us:
•prepare 250 ml of LB medium with 2% Agar (2.5 g NaCl, 2.5 g Peptone/Tryptone, 1.25 g Yeast  extract, 5 g Agar),
•sterilize the black chip-mould by wiping it with 70 % Ethanol,
•fill the mould with hot LB and let it cool down for 1-10 minutes,
•use a sterile (wiped with Ethanol) scalpel to cut along the markings,
•move agar chips into sterile petri dishes with a spatula"

This experiment indicate that E. coli may have positive chemotaxis for aspartic acid.
Fig.2 E. coli swarming to cadmium
L: cadmium(100 mM, 4 μl) R: ddH2O (40 μl)
Incubation: 110 hours
temperature: 30 ℃
E. coli cultured was spotted on the center of agar plate, and chemotaxis was spotted on 25 mm distant from the center.
The swarming circle of cadmium (L) was smaller than that of ddH2O (R), and the swarming area around cadmium (L) was more smaller than that of ddH2O (R), suggesting that E. coli hate cadmium.
This experiment indicate that E. coli may have negative chemotaxis for cadmium.
Capillary Assay
Result
Fig.1 Left : Aspartic acid, Right : control
There were 13 colonies on Asp plate. One other plate has 1326 colonies.
Discussion
At this method. We didn't assay aspartic acid cehmotaxis of E.coli. We did eleven assays.In this assay, E.coli formation will appear on aspartic acid plate more than conrol plate. But at result of Fig.1, E.coli colonies appeared control plate more than aspartic acid plate. And all result were not authenticity. There are some problems. One is heat of bacteria spreader. At plating moments. I may burn  'E.coli to death. Next is diameter of capillary. I made capillary by myself. There were various sizes of capillary. I used their capillary. So colonies formation were ununiformity. Last is the number of times of assays. In our source journal (Reference No.7), they assayed more then us.
Future work
We performed a project to collect cadmium using chemotaxis of Escherichia coli this year. But the second plasmid is still building it. We want to perform an experiment such as fig.1-B with two kinds of Escherichia coli as soon as construction is completed. In addition, the chemotactic instruction and control that we used have the applied nature to other projects very much. We want to create the new project using chemotaxis of Escherichia coli.

Newsletter
Newsletter is a publication which is released by Amoy. The contents of newsletter include introduction of team and project, and a question. The question we deal with is the current situation and the future of synthetic biology. We investigated statistics in IGEM to examine the current situation of synthetic biology. The following is what is written in newsletter.
Distribution of iGEM Teams
The United States, followed by China, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan, respectively, has the greatest scientific output in the field of biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology. With a few exceptions, countries with the most paper published in this field also has the highest number of iGEM teams. However, the country currently with the most iGEM teams is China, not the US. Although the US is the origin of iGEM and has increased steadily in participation, the growth rate of Asia’s participation is substantially faster than US’s.
By comparing the number of iGEM teams in different countries and regions in 2015, we are able to deduce two factors that influence the abundance of iGEM teams: economy and education. The hypothesis of population directly correlating to the number of iGEM teams is incorrect, as demonstrated in the iGEM population in Asia. With a total of 102 teams in Asia, China with 55 teams, Japan with 9, and Taiwan with 9, are the three Asia countries with the most iGEM teams. Although China has one of the largest populations in the world, however, Japan and Taiwan have considerably less. This shows that the number of iGEM teams is not directly correlated to population. On the other hand, economy is strongly correlated to the number of iGEM teams. GDP, or Gross domestic product, is commonly used as an indicator of the economic health of a country. According to trading economics, China had a GDP of 9240.27 (USD billion) in 2014, no doubt the largest GDP value in Asia. Japan in 2014 had a GDP of 4901.00, easily standing as the second strongest economy in Asia. Taiwan, although with GDP of 489.21, however, it is experiencing a steady GDP annual growth"

Introduction
Dynamic instability of microtubule during its lifetime is very interesting and worth researching. When a cancer patient is cured by taxol treatment fortunately, it should be owed to taxol's interaction with microtubule in dynamic growth process. So it's significant to explore principles of this process. We established a series of math works to clarify mechanisms of microtubule dilution system. Then we got data from wet parts of our project. Our model predicts observed data and phenomenon. In conclusion, we have presented a model that utilizes basic kinetics and it has been proved by experimental observations. We can use it to predict results in other conditions for guidance.
What we have done to analyze the dynamic process can be divided into three steps.
Fig.1 Our process
First we proved that taxol has a significant influence on microtubule growth by using the data which are provided from wet parts. Then we presented two differential equations model. One is an original differential equation model that can predict taxol’s influence on amount of microtubule. The other is a partial differential equation model expounding analytic solution. Since it’s hard to understand if someone lacks of necessary math skills, we build a program in MATLAB@ to visualize the kinetics in microtubule disaggregation.

This year, the final goal of iGEM_Bit team is to provide the potential versatility, precision, and affordability of JACOB—essentially a representation of modularized biomarker detections—to ordinary communities.  Our plan is to commercialize JACOB to provide warnings for potential disease and develop a self-sustaining facility for production and further research. From market analysis, we concluded the prominent advantages of JACOB and focused on those to provide more competitive products; from direct interaction with commercial industries, we optimized JACOB's operability and compatibility with the market.

Simultaneous model (2) If the enzyme is compared to a slide, the substrate is similar to the additive. The resulting enzymatic reaction rate - substrate concentration and                         gray value - has a good fit to the added concentration. So using this model is very suitable. In                         other literature [1], the results obtained are also consistent. The relationship between gray                         value and concentration in this model is shown in Figure 1(a), which applies to multiple stages                         of the project. The different substances added are shown in Figure 2(b).
(a) Addition of added substances
(b) Relationship between different additions and gray values (joined                                 separately)
(c) Fixed antigen grayscale model curve
Fig.1 Gray value and additive concentration relationship
In the step of immobilizing the antigen, other conditions are controlled and a large amount of                         experimental data is used to reduce the error. Experimental Results After data processing,                         Figure 1 (c), Equation \(\mathrm{Y_1}\), can be obtained. The resulting image was used to                         predict                         other data and found good consistency. The established gray value - concentration model is                         consistent with the experiment. Therefore, the antibody immobilization model was further                         established and the result of the equation \(\mathrm{Z_1}\) was obtained. It can be seen from                         the                         model and experimental data that the gray value is positively correlated with the additive                         concentration when the concentration is not large. It can be seen from the model and                         experimental data that the gray value is positively correlated with the additive concentration                         when the concentration is not large and is greater than 0.4 μg/ml.
$$ y = \frac{\alpha}{\beta} x \quad \mathrm{(Ψ_q)}$$
$$ y = 6.4904 x \quad \mathrm{(Y_1)} $$
$$ y = 9.3506 x \quad \mathrm{(Z_1)} $$

Figure 4. Growth curves of cultures in Synthetic Medium with varying carbon sources. A) Culture of transformed BL21-AI with a Dpe from C. cellulolyticum. B) Culture of transformed TOP10 with a Dpe from C. cellulolyticum.
As shown in figure 4, the BL21-AI strains had high growth rates regardless of the sugar, with a stationary phase reached in five hours. The carbon source has no impact on this strain. The growth of the Top10 strain is slower compared to BL21-AI. The sugar used in the medium has a great impact on the fitness of the strain, with a maximal optical density for the fructose condition. Therefore, we decided to do all further bioproduction assays in BL21-AI.
Impact of the Concentration of Fructose on the Psicose Production
Knowing that the sugar used had no impact we decided to use a standard concentration of 2 g/L of glucose for every culture and vary the fructose concentration. To test whether or not our strains were producing psicose we prepared a negative control, a BL21-AI strain transformed with pSB1C3 containing BBa_J04450 , an RFP under the control of a constitutive promoter (BL21-AI-RFP). Cultures have been made for 24 hours, with IPTG induction when the culture reached an OD600 of 0.6. Samples were taken throughout the bioprocess and centrifuged to purify the samples. Then the psicose contained in each fraction was measured with an HPLC previously calibrated to quantify sugars such as glucose, fructose, glycerol and psicose.
Figure 5. Growth curves and psicose production of BL21-AI transformed with a Dpe from C. cellulolyticum and BL21-AI transformed with an RFP, depending on the fructose concentration: 2 g/L, 20 g/L, 50 g/L or 80 g/L. A) Growth curves of cultures in Synthetic Medium with varying fructose concentrations. B) Psicose production. BL21-AI-RFP is used as a negative control with no Dpe.
As shown in figure 5, we had similar growths for every strain except for BL21AI-Dpe with 2g/L of fructose which has a delayed growth. The HPLC analysis showed us that BL21-AI-Dpe is able to produce up to 9 g"

Thermosensor Results The following table summarizes the results of the random mutagenesis on the Lysteria thermosensor. We found two thermosensors with narrower temperature ranges, and four thermosensors with increased or decreased expression after melting. We are especially pleased with the narrowed temperature ranges of BBa_K619890 and BBa_K619891, which demonstrate the most narrow temperature sensitivity of any known riboswitches from our literature research.

Day 1: European workshop in London
Can Simple Biological Systems be Built from Standard, Interchangeable Parts and Operated in Living Cells?
Or, is Biology so Complex that Each Case is Unique?
Jasper and Wilfred went to London to be at the ""Teach the teachers workshop"". After hearing the same intro song three times, it became clear that iGEM needs more musical tunes. Also they really seem to like the idea of team mascottes. And bright shirts! First things first, a 1000 parts of the 3500 available parts were sent to every team and sequenced. The sequences for all of them are available and should be checked before use.  Next the composition of the different websites were explained, with the partsregistry having a Wiki and a non-wiki part. And this non-wiki giving information to the wiki part of the registry and possibly to the 2009.igem.org wiki's. And it was made clear that Parts should be well documented and more than just test . Because parts, in contrary to some believes are not only the sequence of the"

The plasmid extraction is successful. We observe the plasmid in the agarose gel (including C0079, R0079, J23116).But the plasmid strips are very strange. So we do the electrophoresis of C0079, R0079, J23116, K081009, E0430 and I13453.We find that we have to redo the plasmid extraction of K081009,C0079. Therefore, we take out our medium and repick the other colonies and put the tubes into shaker.
21st, Aug
We complete the plasmid extraction of K081009,C0079.
27th, Aug
The plasmid extraction is successful. All the plasmid we need have already been extracted. Then Ms. Yang shows us the method of digestion. At first, we learn the use of Bio Photometer. And then we need calculate the mole of the target plasmid. At last, we put the solution to target plasmid, corresponding digestion enzyme, double distilled water and BSA into a tube (including B0034, C0079, B0015).
28th, Aug
What a tragedy! We find that our digestion fails after the agarose gel electrophoresis. So we have to redo the digestion. Luckily, we make it and get our first gene--------B0034,C0079,B0015.

Begin the digestion of K081009, E0430 and I13453.
6th, Sept
Today, Ms. Yang shows the protocol of connection. Like digestion, the procedure of connection is not hard. But it takes 16 hours. So we do the connection of K081009,E0430.

Where it is mentioned that samples were sent for sequencing - unless stated otherwise - the sequencing results corresponded to the expected sequence.
Plate reader measurements:
The machine used for plate reader experiments is BioTek’s SynergyMx. Gen5 2.01 software was used to acquire the data and export these to microsoft excel files which were further organized with Microsoft Excel 2011. All plate reader measurements were done in black 96-wells plates with a transparent bottom. During measurements the lid was on the plate in all cases to prevent mixing of sample due to shaking during incubation. All reported experiments were performed at 37℃ with fast continuous shaking. Measurements described were always at least 10 minutes apart to allow for proper shaking of the samples and allow for sufficient aeration. GFP activity was measured with fluorescence measurements with an excitation at 485nm and emission at 510nm. mRFP activity was measured for excitation at 584nm and emission at 607nm. Bandwidth for fluorescence was always 9nm. Wells contained 200µl cultures. Absorbance was measured at both 600nm and 660nm to assess bacterial growth. Absorbance data for bacterial cultures were corrected with the absorbance of medium only wells. This caused absorbance to start at 0 for all cultures, the first measurements notwithstanding. Fluorescence values were corrected for the fluorescence of medium only wells. This sometimes caused negative values for the fluorescence of cultures at low OD600 values. This of course it not realistic and was considered an artifact caused by fluctuations in the measurement of low level fluorescence.
Flow Cytometry
The machine used for flow cytometry in Wageningen is the Flow cytometry sorter - BD FACS AriaTM III. This machine is in principle also able to sort cells, but we did not make use of this function. Marcel H. Tempelaars, Specialist Flow cytometry sorter - BD FACS AriaTM III at Wageningen UR operated the controls while Thomas was responsible for sample handling and insertion. Marcel meanwhile explained the functioning of the technique.
During the flow cytometry analysis we found that the choice of mRFP as reporter was a good one: we observed a clear difference in fluorescence between the mRFP producing cells and cells that did not have a mRFP gene. Differentiation between GFP expressing cells and cells unable to produce GFP is known to be more troublesome. Therefore we advise future i"

That’s because the toxin addicted time was too short that only part of bacteria expressed cbtA. While expression of cbeA made most bacteria appeared in bacilliform in 6h observation. Because the experiment time was limited, we didn’t get the distinct result. We think that more solid result will appear if we extend the observation duration.

Future work
1. Western blot: Just as it referred in discussion part, we want to further confirm the expression of CbeA and CbtA.
2. More constructs are needed to verify the Geneguard system. So we need to design more structures to further valid Geneguard system.
3. We can also apply our Geneguard into other fields like petroleum industry and fermentation industry through well- designed circuits."

continued from yesterday :
""The protein encoded by paired-box homeotic gene 3 (PAX3) is a key regulator of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf) in the melanocyte lineage. Here, we show that PAX3 expression in skin is directly inhibited by TGF-beta/Smads. UV irradiation represses TGF-beta in keratinocytes, and the repression of TGF-beta/Smads upregulates PAX3 in melanocytes, which is associated with a UV-induced melanogenic response and consequent pigmentation.... ....PAX3 functions in synergy with SOX10 in a cAMP-response element (CRE)-dependent manner to regulate the transcription of Mitf."" [1] {Also: Figure 7. Schematic Diagram of the UV-Induced Melanogenic Response}
FOXD3
""...The transcriptional repressor FOXD3 is expressed exclusively in the neural/glial precursors and MITF is expressed only in melanoblasts. Moreover, FOXD3 represses melanogenesis....MITF expression begins very early during melanoblast migration and that loss of MITF in melanoblasts causes them to transdifferentiate to a glial phenotype. Ectopic expression of FOXD3 represses MITF in cultured neural crest cells....FOXD3 does not bind directly to the MITF promoter, but instead interacts with the transcriptional activator PAX3 to prevent the binding of PAX3 to the MITF promoter. Overexpression of PAX3 is sufficient to rescue MITF expression from FOXD3-mediated repression. We conclude that FOXD3 controls the lineage choice between neural/glial and pigment cells by repressing MITF during the early phase of neural crest migration."" [2]

Human Practices
As Peter Carr said,” Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work”, HP is the link between our experiments and real life and is an integral part of the project. Therefore, we need to carefully design our HP to promote our work to real life, and improve our project to benefit the world based on feedback from HP.

This is NEU_China's third trip to iGEM, and the members of team A are mostly major in biomedical. We are quite concerned about the advances in biotechnology and the cutting-edge research that can make a difference in the medical field. So we want to try a new track, Therapeutics.
Once in a group discussion, a team member shared that her sister's experience with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and we became interested in it. After reading some academic literature, we found that the incidence of IBD is related to the destruction of intestinal bacterial strings, and the incidence of this disease in China is increasing. Therefore, we chose the treatment of IBD as the topic of our project. In addition, we refer to past projects and hope to control the disease by a release of immunosuppressants by engineering bacteria.

Most farmers manage climate change and other pests using various improvised methods. Some develop their own irrigation systems by carrying jerry cans full of water to their plants from a well. To spray their crops, some farmers loan out backpack sprayers and others use brooms to spread pesticide on their crops."

1. Expand the scale of our database.
Projects in iGEM and literature field are grow at a remarkable speed, thus it's a responsible for us to update the data in our database regularly so that our users can catch the latest ideas and utilize into reproduction and testing. In next year, every team and publisher will be invited to redraw their genetic circuit on our design platform for seamless reutilization in future works, which is the most fastest and accurate way we can imagine for expanding the database. For display aspect, a wiki plug-in tool of S-Din will be developed so that all the teams next year can using the same editable tools in their wiki so that no more PS will be needed and also benefit us for gathering data from the first hand.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html,"), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph"

Each pellet was resuspended in 1ml PBS
Tubes were centrifugated for 1 minute at 8000rpm at room temperature and supernatant was discarded
Each pellet was resuspended in 1ml PBS again
Following these steps, the cells were washed and overnight media had been removed
1ml of washed cells was added to 19ml of fresh condition media for the expression stage
These steps were repeated five times for each media condition, ending up with five 20ml cultures of S. thermophilus growing in M17L/Casein; and five cultures of S. thermophilus growing in M17L. Essentially, five replicates were set up for each condition and the S. thermophilus cultures were exposed to each condition for a duration of 3 hours and 15 minutes, during which time optical density was checked at regular intervals (Table 1). Incubation temperature was kept at 37 degrees Celsius throughout. Upon completion of the incubation, each 1ml of sample was split into two tubes, yielding two replicates for each sample.
Table 1: Optical density analysis of S. thermophilus growth
We then followed the Qiagen RNAprotect protocol. This stalls cell growth, and inhibits the action of cellular RNAses to protect against RNA degradation. Consequently, we extracted RNA using the Qiagen RNeasy kit designed for use with bacteria. Specifically, we followed the enzymatic lysis protocol which, for S. thermophilus, involved using 30mg/ml of lysozyme lysis in an Eppendorf ThermoMixer desktop shaker. We shook the samples for 30 minutes at 1000rpm at 37 degrees Celsius. We removed residual genomic DNA by performing the optional stage of on-column DNAse digestion. For the final elution step of the protocol, the RNA was spun twice with 30μl Nuclease-free water to maximise yield. This resulted in 60μl for each of the samples. The two replicates of each sample were then combined into a single tube – so the final samples were 120μl x 10. In order to send adequate samples to Glasgow Polyomics, we assessed our RNA quality. Initially we checked RNA on a “Bleach gel” – an agarose gel that protects against RNA degradation [4] . To make a 70ml 1.2% agarose gel, we added 1.4ml of additive"

To combat this problem we have hosted an event with iGEM Stockholm and Lund which shed light on the growing problem of burnouts and how to prevent them. To further spread the knowledge we have published a booklet about it! The booklet is a summary of useful guidelines and techniques to prevent team members from burn outs. It also speaks about the current situation in iGEM which we have summarised after performing an international survey with answers from current team members and previous team members all over the world.

Step 1
The first step is to build a plate on which the box can be build. The format has to be 15x20 lego bricks.
Step 2
In the next step you need an even surface on which you can adhere 9 LEDs. We attached 3 strips à 3 LEDs with self-adhesive tape. Then thin rows of lego bricks have to be built at the ends of the plate.
Step 3
Be sure to spare 2 bricks where the LED wire comes out.
Step 4
All in all there have to be 5 rows of thin lego bricks.
Step 5
In the next step a row of thick lego bricks has to be built. This railing will be used for placing dispersion plates and foils.
Step 6
6 rows of thin lego bricks have to be built.
Step 7
This part of the box has to be shaded with black self-adhesive foil.
Step 8
In the next step you can place dispersion and intensity decrease units like (frosted) glass plates, clear foil or white paper. Depending on need of intensity you have to change the units.
Step 9
The next row consists of thick lego bricks with one half covered with even plates. This is the railing for the glass with the pattern you want to illuminate.
Step 10
Finishing the railing.
Step 11
Next 6 thin rows have to be built.
Step 12
Here you place the plate with the pattern you want to illuminate. The rest has to be shaded with self-adhesive black foil.
Step 13
The rows are finished.
Step 14
This part has to be darkened with black foil.
Step 15
The cells you want to illuminate can be placed here.
Step 16

In return, TU Delft iGEM tested an additional preservation method researched by iGEM Wageningen UR, consisting of drying cells in combination with kaolin clay. In the experiments, TU Delft dried BL21(DE3) along with different amounts of kaolin in a laminar flow cabinet overnight
Bacteria desiccation tolerance experiments with Kaolin. Kaolin tube forwarded by iGEM Wageningen UR and resulting plates dried and resuspended with Kaolin.
After plating the resuspended kaolin and colonies and incubating overnight, the results were unfortunately inconclusive:  the plates were either overgrown or had no colonies at all. Furthermore, after performing Wageningen's  protocol, TU Delft shared a list of suggestions for its improvement as certain steps (such as scraping the dried kaolin containing the bacteria or counting the colonies in plates with kaolin) were both laborious and difficult to reproduce accurately.
Munich
A few months before our European Symposium had taken place, TU Delft shared a project description on Facebook featuring a summary of all the science behind our project. Shortly after, the team of Munich contacted us indicating that, coincidentally enough, our two teams were to make use of the protein Cas13a in our projects. Because of this, TU Delft and Munich saw a great window of opportunity opening, as the possibility of collaborations that could substantially help both projects was there.
Wet lab Collaboration iGEM Munich 2017
Both TU Delft and Munich's project had a common goal: the realisation of a detection device featuring Cas13a. Consequently, the stability of their Cas13a in their device was also one of the challenges in their design, as it would determine the shelf life and storability of their final product. As a part of this year’s project, TU Delft was also researching and developing an alternative stabilization method by making use of the tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs). Therefore, TU Delft shipped a purified batch of TDPs to iGEM Munich, so that they could also assay and evaluate these; and, perhaps, eventually integrate them into their project.
TDPs in Munich!
However, the collaboration with Munich evolved after TU Delft had realised the first experiments with their purified Cas13a and TDPs and had observed that whenever our Cas13a was dried in combination with the TDP CAHS 94205, the resuspended Cas13a+TDP solution would start cleaving RNA  with and without target"

Monday 4th july - In the morning we ran a gel of our PCR products from Friday to test whether we had managed to amplify the specific gene we wanted. We also spent more time planning the UK iGEM get together, and decided on the protocol we would follow when transforming moss.
Tuesday 5th july - The gel from yesterday showed no DNA products from our PCR. We performed another PCR procedure using an adapted protocol and a different polymerase (phusion polymerase, as this has a proof reading ability and is therefore better suited for cloning). However, a gel from this was also unsuccessful. We returned to the drawing board and found a potential fault in the reverse primer we'd designed. Having corrected the error, we plan to order the adapted primer tomorrow. In light of specific numbers for the UK conference we began booking rooms and caterers. Having decided on a selection marker for algae transformations (arginine biosynthesis) we secured some arginine and autoclaved it ready for use tomorrow.

European and Eurasian Meetup
The iGEM Meetups that we attended were a great opportunity to meet the iGEM Teams and Community both in Europe and Asia and learning about overcoming cultural barriers and sharing the spirit of science.
The iGEM European Meetup was our first opportunity to interact with the iGEM Community and other iGEMers and we could not be more excited to be there. It did not take long for us to start meeting teams, almost minutes from when we arrived, we put up our poster and the poster sessions began even before the event was scheduled to start. We were so excited to be in a space where everyone was so thrilled about their project and it was a great energy to start the conference off.
We attended insightful workshops that were organised by the various iGEM teams and organisations. Many of them we found useful and it was a great chance to view unique perspectives of the teams presenting, e.g. the “Online Public Engagement in Written Format” given by the iGEM Copenhagen team introduced us to the use of ‘Medium’ as a social platform and we entered a very fruitful discussion about the variety of social platforms we"

It's the final week! The iGEM 'wiki-freeze' is also closely approaching - when we can no longer make ammendments to it (to aid its being judged). There's therefore a lot of hurried tapping-away at his keyboard from our wiki maestro Haydn.
The team are now down to four people; there are reports of tumbleweeds in the further corners of the lab.
Tuesday
Reflectin is a protein taken from a eukaryote , so it's no surprise that it doesn't work as it does in squid when we express it in E. coli (a prokaryote ). Out of curiosity the team are expressing it in (eukaryotic) onion cells, with the aid of a 'gene gun' - we'll literally fire little bits of DNA into the cells. Cool? Yup.
Wednesday
Despite the team's efforts to keep our wiki updated throughout the summer, with the week of the wiki freeze here there's some scrambling to document everything in time. With every other team in the same position around this time each year, the iGEM servers usually refuse to work with all the traffic; cue much grinding of teeth.

Our Team - The looks and the brains
Ilya Vainberg Slutskin
I am a fourth (and final) year student in the Faculty of Biotechnology & Food Engineering in the Technion university. I first heard about synthetic biology during my third year studies as part of a lecture in a molecular biotechnology course. Since then, I was hooked. I am thrilled to learn more about the subject and to gain valuable experience in the field. Although I don't have previous experience in research I hope to be a valuable member of the team. I hope to contribute as much as possible to both the wet and dry lab as well as to the administrative department of the project.
On my free time I enjoy spending time with my wife, creating digital art using both 2d and 3d tools and watching TV series.

Figure 1. (A) Glyphosate inhibits the 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase, which converts phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and 3-P-shikimate into EPSP and P in B. subtilis.  EPSP is a precursor for the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (Tyr) and tryptophane (Trp). (B) How does glyphosate affect growth of our B. subtilis wild type strains?
As shown in Figures 2A and 2B, at a glyphosate concentration of about 1 mM the growth rate of both strains was reduced by 50% and the bacteria were not able to grow at glyphosate concentrations higher than 3 mM. In contrast to a previous study (1), we have observed that 44% fewer glyphosate is required to reduce the growth rate of B. subtilis by 50%. This discrepancy might be due to differences in the genetic makeup of the B. subtilis strains, in the medium composition, in the purity of glyphosate or due to the different cultivation conditions. However, glyphosate negatively affects growth of B. subtilis in CS-Glc minimal medium.

1.2. Genomic adaptation of Bacillus subtilis to glyphosate
Previously, it has been reported that the growth rate of a B. subtilis culture containing 2.5 mM glyphosate strongly increases after 16 h of incubation (1). It has been suggested that this phenomenon might be either due to a physiological adaptation of the bacteria to glyphosate or due to the emergence of glyphosate-resistant mutants. To assess whether B. subtilis is able to adapt to toxic levels of glyphosate at the genome level, we propagated the wild type strain 168 on CS-Glc agar plates supplemented with increasing amounts of the herbicide (0, 10, 20 30 and 40"

Protocol videos
Our team decided to create protocol videos in order to help young scientists to manipulate.       When people are working on Genetics engineering, there are several basic experiments that have to be controlled.       During our experiments, we filmed 4 steps of cloning: PCR, digestion, ligation and transformation.
Watching it, people could see how to manipulate safely.       We asked other igem teams to translate protocols in their mother tongue.       We obtained protocol videos in English with Imperial College team,       in Spanish thanks to the TEC-Monterrey team,       in Dutch with Leiden team,       in Chinese with BIT team,       in Portuguese thanks to EEL team,       in German with Hamburg team and       in French with the collaboration of the Bordeaux team.       We wrote the entire script and we added some guidance in red (minutes for each paragraphs for instance). Teams had to translate and record the script.      Now, we possess a lot of protocols explained in six different languages, accessible to everybody on Youtube and on our wiki.

Move the mouse over the figure to see how it works!
The second XOR gate has the same design than the second AND gate: the ouput gene  has been put between the two pairs of recombination sites. (PhiC31 and FimE). The output protein can be translated only if the gene is in the right direction, meaning having been switched by either one of the recombinases but not the two simultaneously.
.
Move the mouse over the figure to see how it works!
These gates (XOR and AND) can be used in any regulation system, provided that the recombinases are assembled following the promoter of your choice with your specific regulations requirements.
Resetting these gates to their basal states requires a series of excisases capable of switching back the sequences to their native state. For instance, KAIST Korea iGEM team has described in 2012 a part which could flip back into the original DNA sequence: Bxb1 gp47 ( BBa_K907002 )
The OR gate
The OR gate is implicit in our adder. An OR gate functions (gives an output signal) with one input or both. The OR gate uses as input signals the product of the two AND gates. If for both gates the output gene is the same, we have an implicit OR gate: either on of the entries (or both) produce the same output signal.
Riboregulation System
Our design is based on a permanent switch of the logic gates. Contrarily of transcriptionally regulated logic gates, once the gate has switched, there is no possibility to switch back to the previous state, and this was a strict requirement when we though of a binary adder (if the calculator responses switched over time, we would have some trouble... :-)). The expression level of the recombinases is therefore highly critical and very small amounts of recombinases can switch the gates. A zero expression level is needed and the control of the expression of the recombinases was designed with a riboregulation system.
How does it work ?
This is the basic system: Two inductible promoters each followed by a RNA sequence
The blue and the red regions code for little RNA sequences.
When the promoter P2 is activated but not P1, the red sequence will be transcribed. This red sequence is partly similar to the rbs sequence (in red). When transcribed, the red sequence will block the rbs by promoting a secondary RNA structure and prevent the recombinase"

Extraction with Ethyl acetate
The spectrum that shows ethyl acetate extraction has well defined PHB peaks, but an unknown compound in the sample cause a peak at approximately 2.17 ppm. This indicates that the PHB purity is lowered with this extraction method, when compared to chloroform extraction.
Extraction with Hypochlorite
In the spectrum showing hypochlorite extraction the PHB peaks are clear, but a single impurity is registered in the spectrum at 2.3 ppm. The area under the two peaks near the impurity are almost doubled compared to the peak at 5.2 ppm. This inequality, however, is not significant as it is the impurity in the sample, that contribute to the additional area under the peaks.
Extraction with hypochlorite and Triton X-100
The peaks representing PHB peaks are present but the peak for water is absent. There is no indication of impurities, although these could have evaporated along with the water. This specific method is similar to the Hypochlorite extraction method. The Triton X-100 pre-treatment is performed to increase the digestion of cellular content, which could explain the absence of impurity.
For the hypochlorite PHB extraction with Triton X-100 and the ethyl acetate purification, the entire content of the purification, was not soluble in chloroform. This indicates that large impurities present in the sample were not visible in the H NMR spectra.

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Therefore we can conclude that our setup works as expected as it is indeed able to measure fluorescence without measuring other light sources.
For this experiment we used E. coli transformed with OmpA-silicatein that was induced and incubated in silicic acid, so it would contain the polysilicate layer. We deliberately used this strain to test whether the polysilicate or the cells had any autofluorescence that could interfere with our laser experiments. We did not observe any fluorescent signal for these cells, so we can conclude that the polysilicate layer does not have any autofluorescence at 405 nm. Therefore, these cells are suitable for the laser experiments.

Intensity measurements of laser cells
Introduction
One of the biggest differences between a laser and fluorescence is the amount of emitted photons. We can measure the amount of emitted photons by measuring the intensity of emitted light. The intensity of fluorescence increases linearly with the excitation energy. However, at a certain excitation energy it will reach the so-called ‘laser threshold’ and stimulated emission, and thus lasing will occur. From this point on, the output intensity of the fluorophores will still increase linearly, but with a much steeper slope, as shown in figure 1.
Figure 1: the relation of input energy vs. output intensity for fluorescence and lasing (Fan & Yun, 2014)
We investigated whether we could find the same relation between input and output intensity for our Biolaser cells, using our self-built setup, to investigate whether our cells were able to emit a kind of laser light.
Methods
The plasmids and conditions used for this experiment are summarized in table 1.

Parts that are able to induce cell death (apoptosis or autolysis) could be expressed under promoters that are activated in an uncontrolled environment as opposed to a laboratory. A huge amount of examples for these so-called kill-switches was designed by the iGEM community and is now available in the registry (see for example 2011's team of UCL London and the 2013’s BGU Israel's iGEM-team ""Programmable Autonomous Self Elimination"")."

“Having only 302 neurons, C. elegans is a good learner.”
Learning is the act of acquiring new or modifying and reinforcing existing knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences which may lead to a potential change in synthesizing information, depth of the knowledge, attitude or behavior relative to the type and range of experience [1] .
The learning behavior of C. elegans (Caenorhabditis elegans) has been studied for a long time. Worms are demonstrated to possess both non-associative and associative learnings induced by intermittent stimulation of chemicals or heavy metals [2] .
However, the main drawback of these studies is chemical stimuli cannot be withdrew cleanly. The the residual chemicals will make it impossible to avoid the stimuli cross-contamination. They will make the results difficult to interpret.  We use synthetic biology method to establish to overcome this obstacle.  The key components that help us solve this issue are hardware and model:
Optogenetics:
Expression of two types of channelrhodopsins in two pairs of receptor neurons enable us to use blue and red lights to train worms, for example, to be addicted to alcohol.
Microfluidics:
Two microfluidic chips are designed to study worms’ behavior change at the group level and measure the activation signal of individual neuron after stimulation.
So far, our project has been almost completed. With the expression of Chrimson and CoChR on AWA and AWB neurons [3] , C. elegans shows preference to the blue light and repulsion to red light.  After induced by the blue light for 2 hours, the engineered worms are strongly attracted by alcohol, while the wild worms have no preference to it.
Thus, our project demonstrates the establishment of light-inducing learning process in C. elegans. See details
Our further work is to decipher the change of neuron connectivity"

Today we started working on the Newcastle collaboration - we were determining the thermal conductivity of LB and M9 broth for them. The primary focus was setting up the equipment and calibrating it with water to ensure we got the expected value.
The installment of ‘Desert Island… Science?’ featuring Dr Jon Marles-Wright was released today. The delay between recording and releasing was for Alice to deal with sound issues caused by recording over Skype, which were all dealt with.
Lab work today predominantly focused on the overnighted Killer Red and Killer Orange in S171 E. coli. The lab team - Dan, Eloise, Jack, Pablo, Joel, Hannah - made glycerol stocks of, miniprepped and carried out qubits on the overnighted samples.
They also made new overnights of Killer Red, Killer Orange and the successfully transformed plasmid backbones in both DH5α and S171 E. coli strains.

We now have LB thermal conductivity data from the Newcastle collaboration experiments, and will be analysing them and sending them to the Newcastle iGEM team once we have completed the same for M9.
Joel began producing some fantastic logo ideas today, drawing from a moodboard produced by us a while back. we plan to stick with the colour scheme, but may alter the design depending on further feedback.
Today in the lab, we made glycerol stocks of, miniprepped and carried out qubits of the overnights of Killer Red, Killer Orange and the plasmid backbones in DH5α and S171 strains that were made yesterday, and sent samples off for sequencing.
We also tried using the QuickChange multi kit again for site-directed mutagenesis, and the controls made indicated that we had been successful this time as they turned blue when tested.

Linkoping_Sweden,2015,Team:Linkoping Sweden#Knowledge Survey_-_-_TEXT.html," critical symptoms actually are those that affect the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular                     systems. It is important to understand the severity and recognize the symptoms of anaphylaxis.                     Answering ratios are summarized in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Summarization of answering ratios of participants asked to identify the symptoms of                     anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening acute allergic reaction.
True or false?
Participants were presented with a number of statements about nut and peanut allergies and asked to                     determine whether they are true or false. Figures show answering quotas of all participants.
Peanuts are closely related to cashews and pistachios
False: Peanuts resemble other nuts in terms of nutrition and taste, but                     in botany terms the peanut                     is a leguminous plant (Arachis hypogaea). The actual peanut is the plant seed that grows in the                     ground, hence the Swedish name jordnöt, directly translated to earth nut. The English name peanut                     indicates the close relationship to other legume plants, including peas as well as soy beans, beans                     and lentils.11 Some of those that are allergic to peanuts experience an allergic reaction when                     eating fruits from other legume plants. This occurs due to cross allergic reactions caused by peanut                     resembling substances found in closely related species.12
Hazelnuts, walnuts, Brazil nuts, cashews and pecans contain the same allergy inducing                     substance.
False: Unlike peanuts almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, cashews, pecans,                     Brazil nuts, pistachios and macadamia nuts are defined as nuts according to the labeling rules of                     the European Union.13 Nut allergy is specific and most allergic individuals are usually allergic to                     only one type of nuts, i.e. hazelnut allergy or almond allergy, but since some nuts are more closely                     related than others cross allergic reactions do occur. E.g. Hazelnuts cross react with Brazil nut,                     walnut and pecans. It is very uncommon to be allergic to all types of nuts since all nuts do not                     contain the same allergy inducing substance and half of the participants did not know this.14
The more allergic reactions you have experienced, the greater risk for a severe allergic                     reaction.
False: The severity of an allergic reaction does not depend on the number                     of previous reactions. The most important factor of the severity is the dose. For those who                     previously have had severe symptoms after a small dose, a larger dose can in the future be                     devastating.15 However the very first time a body encounters a potentially allergy inducing                     substance no allergic reaction occurs and no symptoms"

From 2010.igem.org
Week 7: 7/25/10 through 7/31/10
Light sensor: Parts A & B were ligated successfully!  Almost no colonies were present on the control plates.
Samples of C0051 colony #2 were sent in for sequencing to ensure that it is C0051.
Initiator progress: now that RBS-C0051 is finally ligated together, it’s now time to ligate RBS-C0051 to a double terminator (B0015).  Though what we found odd was that after culturing 6 colonies of B0015, only 2 grew.  We find this odd because usually all cultures fail or all are successful.
We nanodropped our B0015 samples: concentrations were low
We then ran a diagnostic gel…which then showed that we had nothing!
We then miniprepped the 2 B0015 cultures that grew and then transformed them into new cells.  We believe the low concentration is because we tried culturing cells from an old plate.  Hence, the cells must have kicked out the B0015 plasmid (with the kanamycin antibiotic resistance) because they don’t need it anymore.  This way, we get a “fresh batch” of B0015 plasmids.  B0015 previously digested for other parts were obtained from an old miniprep.
Meanwhile, we have made an interesting discovery:
RBS-C0051 (which has no promoter) was successfully ligated to RBS-RFP-F1610 (no previous expression)...and it expresses!
We will send in parts for sequencing.
We have investigated this phenomena further by redigesting RBS-C0051 (SP) and C0051.   Strangely, RBS-C0051 was shorter than C0051.  Maybe the RBS-C0051 is actually RBS-I12006.
