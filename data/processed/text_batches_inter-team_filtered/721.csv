ETH_Zurich,2013,Team:ETH Zurich#Human_-_-_TEXT.html," at the department of biochemistry. In the game, players try to predict the structures of proteins according to three basic rules: “pack the protein”, “hide the hydrophobics” and “clear the clashes”. The better the folded protein satisfies these objectives, the higher becomes the score which is directly based on an energy function.  No biochemistry background is needed to play the game, the most important principles are taught on introductory levels. The Foldit project addresses three major goals in parallel. By combining the use of structure prediction algorithms and human pattern recognition abilities, the game can be used to solve puzzles of proteins with unknown structures. Because the highest possible score is not known for these proteins, the players compete with each other. The predictions with the highest scores are then tested in the laboratory by scientists. Using this method, the structure of the M-PMV retroviral protease was solved in 2011 by the Baker laboratory [9]. Another long-term goal of Foldit is to improve the design process for completely new proteins. The significant improvement of a computationally designed Diels-Alderase through the Foldit community in 2012 demonstrated the successful integration of human creativity into the computational design approach [10]. Finally, players are also encouraged to code and share their strategies to find new algorithms and approaches which can be used to improve present structure prediction programs [11].
Figure 2.Screenshot of the EteRNA RNA folding game [12]
Similar to the protein folding project of Foldit, an RNA folding game called EteRNA was released in 2010 by researchers of the Carnegie Mellon University and the Stanford University. Players are confronted with a given target shape for which they have to design matching RNA sequences. The most successful designs are then synthesized and tested in the laboratory. The evaluation of folding patterns and the definition of a set of rules to eventually predict any given structures in a fast and precise manner are the main goals of this research  [12].
Figure 3.Screenshot of the Phylo sequence alignment game [13]
Also released in 2010 was Phylo, a game where sequence data from the UCSC Genome Browser needs to be aligned successfully [13] [14]. With the project, researchers from the McGill Centre for Bioinformatics at McGill University in Montreal try to complement multiple sequence alignment algorithms with human pattern recognition abilities.
Probably all of these games still need to fully prove their benefit when compared to current methods. Still they represent an interesting strategy to extend present approaches used in the respective fields. Addressing different goals like education and research at the same point makes a concrete evaluation of these gamification processes difficult"

We also collaborated with the University of Virginia's iGEM Team by helping them distribute their survey! For more information, contact them at virginia.igem@gmail.com
We also helped to characterize a few parts from the registry:
BBa_M30109
BBa_M30109 does NOT work AT ALL. Digesting the plasmid with the iGEM restriction enzyme yields the right band lengths but other than that the sequence is junk. We tried on numerous occasions to assemble a plasmid to activate our light sensor system. This set us back half of the summer because of the faulty part. We found a new part on the registry with the same genes that showed slightly more promise. 
BBa_K1017726
BBa_K1017726 digests with the iGEM restriction enzymes well. We were able to assemble a plasmid by swapping out ori and resistance (we needed a different antibiotic) in order to co-transform with our system. There is differentiable results between our light and dark system, so the part likely has the genes as reported. However, digestion with known restriction enzyme sites based off the sequence provided gave gel smears rather than clear bands, so not 100% convinced that this part is as advertised.

Tsinghua,2013,Team:Tsinghua#Lablog_-_-_TEXT.html," microorganisms! First of all, AHL has specificity and differed in different microorganisms. Second thing is, actually qurum sensing system parts are easy to get, so many teams in the previous years work with QS system, as well as Tsinghua Team~ Amazing, it sounds like the best candidate was just standing behind us….( Okay this is actually sounds horrible…)

New meeting:
AHL should be purchased. Assigned to Meng, Finally our team logo and several candidate design have come out! All of them looks very beautiful, a big yeast in the back~ The wiki will be done by a classmate of Xiaojing, he is actually the member of colorwork, Good~ professional Several AHL has been discussed about to use as example. AIP, luxR system, LasR system…. It seemto be LuxR still are the one to be chosen.
Now there are two things we need to discuseed about. First is the specificity, the second is how can the AHL be passed into yeast cell membrane?
The yeast powder has been accomplished by Tianyi. And it has been tested that the powder can be reserved under room temperature and natural environment for as long as two weeks. Good~

A composite part is a functional unit of DNA consisting of two or more basic parts assembled together. BBa_I13507 is an example of a composite part, consisting of an RBS, a protein coding region for a red fluorescent protein, and a terminator.
New composite BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts (like Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators, Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on).
Note
This page should list all the composite parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

The Queen’s iGEM team consists of fifteen undergraduate students from a variety of different disciplines. Common among all our team members is a passion for synthetic biology and an eagerness to learn more about it while contributing to advance the work done in this field. Having the advantage of being from diverse backgrounds, each of the members has uniquely contributed to our 2017 research project.
Yifei Wang (Director)
Yifei is in his fourth year of Life Sciences. Yifei is the new QGEM Dictator after overthrowing Dragos in a peaceful coup and enjoys bossing the QGEM team around from his SynBio throne. His favourite class at Queen’s was molecular biology, and he hopes to pursue a career that combines SynBio and medicine. Yifei has a burning passion for Metro prepared meals, but hopes to have enough money one day after becoming the CEO of his own biotech startup that he can hire Chef Dee #anotherone. His favourite sports team is the Toronto Raptors, and he hopes that his amateur career as a Roots model will one day allow him to replace Drake as their new courtside celebrity.
Nolan Neville (Wet Lab Co-Lead)
Nolan is in his fourth year of Biochemistry. He is particularly interested in bacteria and the rise of antibiotic resistance, so this year’s biofilm project was right up his alley. When he isn’t running around in the lab or admiring crystal structures, he can be found listening to old Dire Straits records and learning classic rock riffs on his Les Paul. In the future, Nolan hopes to pursue a career in research working to create novel antibiotics.
Mady Thompson (Wet Lab Co-Lead)
Mady is in her fourth year of Biochemistry. She is particularly interested in biomaterials, and hopes to pursue a Master’s degree in engineering in this field. She hails from Sunnyvale Trailer Park; ask her how the mosquitos are tonight for a guaranteed laugh. When she isn’t in the lab characterizing kinesin proteins, she can be found scouting the halls of Botterell for cute firefighters. Mady also moonlights as a professional basketball player in the lab, so be sure to wear your goggles to protect your eyes from her stray 3-pointers"
Tacoma_RAINmakers,2018,Team:Tacoma RAINmakers#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," information). The notable difference between insert and backbone digestion are the enzymes. Each insert included a SalI enzyme site, which is not compatible with the BioBrick suffix/prefix of the vector. Instead, the SalI site is used to ligate the chromoprotein to PcArsR, rendering the ends of this complete insert as compatible for sticky-end ligation to pSB1C3. After combining reagents listed in Table 2.0, reaction was held in a water bath at 37°C overnight.
Once the SalI site in spisPink, amilCP, and PcArsR was successfully sticky-ended, Tacoma RAINmakers were prepared for ligation of each chromoprotein to the arsenic regulator. 60ng of each part were used in order to ensure that there would enough DNA material for the ligation. Having combined the substances from Table 2.1, the reaction was set to ligate overnight at 16°C. Afterwards, SalI was heat inactivated at 80°C, ensuring a complete denature, since the enzyme was no longer required.
Week 3
Digestion and Ligation of Insert (amilCP/spisPink + PcArsR) to pSB1C3 Backbone
Following the ligation of the chromoprotein and PcArsR, the complete insert was digested with enzymes compatible with our pSB1C3 backbone. This process allows sticky-ended ligation in the next step, which increases the chance of a proper insert-backbone ligation. 84 ng of insert DNA was pipetted into the reaction alongside the other reagents mentioned in Table 3.0. The digestion was set at 37°C in a water bath for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
Tacoma RAINmakers combined the reagents listed in Table 3.1 to ligate the completed insert to the vector. The reaction included a negative control that contained only vector DNA. A notable process involved in ligation reactions is calculating DNA volumes. Typically, a 1:3 ratio of vector to insert ensures that there is a balance of both parts. The RAINmakers employed the NEBioCalculator to determine how many moles were in 1ng of vector (2070bp) and 1ng of insert (1488bp). This calculation translated to 0.8µL of vector and 20µL of insert. The ligation occurred at 16ºC overnight and was heat inactivated at 80ºC for 20 minutes the following morning.

Our Design
We constructed an operon that would enable us to regulate the expression of the gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase with the fluoride riboswitch, called CHOP (Figure 5). We ordered the synthetic operon from IDT DNA with overhangs that have homology to the pSB1A3 vector so we could clone our operon in with Gibson. We used the pSB1A3 vector because we are regulating the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and we need to use the ΔcrcB E. coli strain, that is kanamycin resistant. We constructed the operon so that it is easy for future users to use Gibson cloning to add a new “promoter riboswitch segment” by cutting with HindIII or a new gene by cutting with XhoI. Check out our part BBa_KK2990000 for the correct overhangs for Gibson.
Figure 5: Schematic of the fluoride riboswitch regulated chloramphenicol acetyltransferase operon (CHOP)
How CHOP works:
Using the ΔcrcB E. coli strain, which can accumulate fluoride intracellularly
The Riboswitch detects fluoride
Fluoride activates the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme
Which allows for the growth of bacteria on agar plates with the antibiotic chloramphenicol"

After communication online, we then share experience about using of flow cytometer.Wediscussedthe applicationprojectsmadebyvariousteams over the years, then since we havea deeper understanding ofproject of each other, we also shared thoughts about the advantages and disadvantages of sterile and bacterial systems’ application, and whether bacteria can be truly applied to the market or not. What’s more, we raised questions about the construction of biological parts and project approval. We also had a talk about relevant knowledge of microfluidic chip,which gave us inspiration for our device design.It is really delightful to discuss with team XJTLU."

NUS_Singapore-A,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-A#Collaborative Report_-_-_TEXT.html," foreign species into different environments has, historically, not gone well, as the Australians can tell you regarding rabbits [5]. Introducing a species which is genetically engineered to be more resistant to harsh temperatures or produce more seeds could therefore lead to even greater problems.
The question to ask ourselves here is no longer “can we achieve this?”, but rather “should we achieve this?”. We have ventured into the  technology necessary to modify living beings to our design, creating new subspecies in our free time. We must now study with intense scrutiny the impact of our actions and the moral justifications behind them.
The prospect of developing more efficient antibiotic formulations might seem attractive, yet the reckless and unregulated use of antibiotics will soon spawn new strains of resistant bacteria, harbinging a storm of more drug-resistant infectious diseases. Unfortunately. the current state of matters leads to the very distasteful and unpalatable consequence of breeding drug-resistant pathogens. Effects of these drug-resistant pathogens places undue pressure on the pharmaceutical industry, for the Sisyphean task of developing newer antibiotics to keep up with the development of stronger drug-resistance.
As the saying goes, prevention is better than cure - we strongly believe that judicious usage of the available classes of antibiotics, coupled with vigilant antibiotic stewardship programmes in healthcare settings, should become more commonplace. The fearsome tragedy of having no available antibiotics for treatment, such as in the case of carbapenemase-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, harkens back to the Dark Ages before the discovery of antibiotics, and must not be allowed to catch us off guard.
Once we have our priorities settled, even more important questions need to be asked. Is modifying the human genetic code different to modifying that of the plants and animals around us? Again, the risks and benefits require heavy evaluation. Fixing a deleterious mutation causing diabetes or multiple sclerosis could change someone’s life, but deciding what your child’s eye colour will be is probably going too far.
To conclude, it is safe to say that these new developments are not much more different than others before it. Humanity has caused a great deal of damage to the environment through greenhouse gases and deforestation, all for the sake of ease of life and financial profit, to cite only one example. While synthetic biology affects a more profound basis of life, the leaders of any scientific revolution must always reflect on the impact that it will leave on the world before declaring that we are living in a brave new world.
Economic Aspects towards Synthetic Biology (NUS)
For some, genetic engineering is akin to playing God. However, to many synthetic biologists"

More than One Jewel on the Crown
——Booster and Gearbox
The Crown will help us achieve the goal of selective enzyme polymerization. For polymerization, we introduce the Booster, which is an accelerator with enzymes collecting on it. For selectivity, we introduce the Gearbox, which offers users the right to make use of different sets of enzymes.

What’s more ?
Reference
Booster
Booster is the model of polymerization and maximization. Polymerized enzymes, different from normal scattered ones, have much more opportunities to contact with the substrates. Therefore, our project aims to increase as well as to control the efficiency of complex reactions. We have built a framework that makes multi-enzyme complex easy to form, which we call a Crown.
And based on the success of the individual fusion protein(The first jewel) expression, we tried to add more jewels on the Crown.
In order to build a polymerization system, we made more fusion proteins bind to the same Connector. Then with more enzymes added, it has the practical effect of accelerating the reactions and enhancing the production efficiency. So far, the Crown is built with more than one jewel shining on it.
Gearbox
Gearbox is the model of selectivity. Our fusion protein can not only be used to polymerize enzymes but also be used to control selective combinations. We can control the direction of pathway by simply transforming different Connector plasmids.
Figure 1.3.1 Principle of selectivity
All the three enzymes involved are expressed in the bacteria. Each fusion protein contains ssDsbA, Lgt, FL3, enzyme, HL and TAL; different TAL parts can recognize different sites. Connector is originally designed with three recognition sequences(RS), which are combined to form two different connectors, one with RSⅠ and RSⅡ while the other one with RSⅠ and RSⅢ (shown in the figure below). Connector with RSⅠand RSⅡ can bind to Connectee-enzyme�"

R60 is almost fully conserved, whereas the remaining residues are conserved to between 30–80% (Estela Pineda-Molina, et al.)
Table 1. Properties of the model
Fig.7 (A) The structure of malate and succinate, and the thermodynamic parameters for the 2 compounds that were found to bind. (B and C) View of the interaction of malate (B) and succinate (C) with the McpS-LBR. Malate binds to a cavity formed by α1 and the C-terminal segment of α6, and its coordination is achieved through interactions with R60, R63, R254, and T258 from one monomer and Q65 from the other monomer. Residues R60, R63, and Q65 form part of helix α1, whereas R254 and T258 are part of α6. Succinate binds to McpS-LBR in an almost identical manner as malate. Unlike malate, succinate has no hydroxyl group at C2. Therefore, the two hydrogen bonds that are established between the malate hydroxyl group, and the protein cannot be formed in the succinate structure. The remaining interactions of succinate with R60, R63, R254, and Q65 are analogous to the malate structure where they establish six hydrogen bonds.

WT (blue) and a kanamycin resistant strain (KanR, red) were co-transformed with a plasmid carrying the Cas9 construct, and a second plasmid carrying the anti-Kanamycin gRNA. WT was successfully transformed with one or both plasmids.  KanR E. coli couldn’t be tranformed with both plasmids because of Cas9-induced cleavage of the chromosome specifically at the KanR cassette, with about 99% efficiency.

Background
SirA is an essential gene in latent tuberculosis infections
Aims
To perform an drug screen targeted at the sirA gene from mycobacteria
Results
Produced an E. coli strain which relies upon mycobacterial sirA, fprA and fdxA genes to survive in M9 minimal media
Demonstrated that E. coli can survive with mycobacterial sulfite reduction pathway with Flux Balance Analysis
Located drug target sites on sirA as well as identified high structural similarity between cysI and sirA through structural anaylsis

XMU_Software,2013,Team:XMU Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,", the minimum requirement for RNA polymerase binding is recognition of the promoter by the sigma factor. In general, prokaryotic RNA polymerases can interchange a number of sigma factors which bind and initiate different groups of genes.3
Transcription Factors
Figure 4 Transcription factor binding site
Sigma factors are essential for the transcription initiation in E. coli.10
In addition, promoter strengths are not determined purely by the binding of the sigma factor. Other transcription factors can bind specific sequences surrounding or overlapping the promoter to either activate or repress transcription.4 The mechanism is transcriptional activators and repressors contribute to and detract from the accessibility of DNA by the RNA polymerase. 12
These transcription-regulating nuclear proteins bind to specific binding sites in the regulatory regions (e.g. promoters, enhancers) of the genes thus providing their activation or repression.
Figure 5 Transcription factor binding site
Computational methods of predicting TF binding sites in DNA are very important for understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation.
The binding sites of the same transcription factor show a significant sequences conservation, which is often summarized as a short (5–20 bases long) common pattern called a transcription factor binding site (TFBS) or binding consensus. Our software aims to figure out the possible TFBS in promoters and precisely locate the TFBS so that the user may know the exact sites that play a role in regulating the transcription.
In prokaryotes (lower organisms without nuclei), there are fewer TFs, their motifs tend to be relatively long and the strength of regulation for a particular gene often depends on how closely a particular site matches the consensus for the motif. The more mismatches to the consensus in a binding site, the less often the TF will bind and therefore the less control it will exert on the target gene. So our software will calculate the similarity between the possible TFBS in the promoter and the standard motifs so the user will know to which extent the transcription factor will control the promoter transcription
Primer Design
To facilitate the design of PCR primers of various promoters, we've developed an additional function, namely, primer design in this part of our program. After inputting the promoter sequences, the software will figure out the most suitable primers based on the theory of Thomas Kämpke1, Markus Kieninger, and Michael Mecklenburg.13

7. The flow through was discarded and then the column was dry spun at 14,000 rpm for 2 minutes.          Note: Dry spinning is important to remove all of the ethanol from the wash buffer because this can interfere with transformation.
8. The column was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube and 4 µL of dd H20 was added to the column.
9. The column was allowed to sit for 1 minute.
10. The tube was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 minutes and then the concentration of the DNA was measured via nanodrop.
Ligation Reaction
Purpose: This procedure is done to add a segment of DNA into a vector backbone that has compatible digested restriction enzyme sites. When digestion occurs, a “sticky end” of DNA is left over. This section of DNA is complementary to the other digested restriction site of the backbone or insert. This makes it possible for these nucleotides to connect and form a new plasmid that incorporates the desired insert. The plasmid then can undergo PCR clean-up and it is then ready to be transformed in to a cell.
Procedure:
1. The following solutions were added to a PCR tube
1000 fmole insert - varies
10 fmole cut plasmid - varies
T4 Ligase Buffer - 2µL
T4 Ligase- 1 µL
ddH2O - to 20 µL
** In order to calculate fmoles, DNA(fmoles) = DNA (ng/µL) * 1515/ ( # bp in DNA)
2. The reaction was allowed to run for 5-10 minutes at room temperature.
3. The ligated product immediately was used for PCR clean-up.
Note: This is so that the ligation does not start to generate non-specific ligation products.
Resuspending PCR Primers Protocol
Purpose: In order to proceed to PCR, primers shipped as lyophilized DNA must be resuspended and diluted to a known concentration. This allows consistent and correct amounts of primers to be added to PCR reactions. It also ensures that stock solutions are protected for future use.Modified from: http://fg.cns.utexas.edu/fg/protocol__resuspending_PCR_primers.html
Procedure:
1. Spin down tubes of dried primers (ensures the pellet is in the bottom of the tube)
2. Create a 100 uM solution of primers by resuspending with 10 ul water for each ng DNA in the tube. For example, if there"

Tufts,2014,Team:Tufts#app scenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," been offering grants for bandages which can easily applied to combat wounds and will aid infection prevention. While the phage cocktail would need to be altered for the region to which the bandage is being supplied – to ensure prevention of the most common bacterial diseases – the basic premise of the research remains the same.
A phage encapsulated silk bandage would provide thermostability and moisture resistance for utilization across nearly all combat locations. The encapsulated phage aid infection prevention. Silk is also being utilized as a biocompatible material for skin grafts and so, while more uncertain, it may be possible to design the silk bandage to aid in wound healing.
The chief advantage of working under a DOD grant is the rapid nature of approval as an emergency product for in-combat utilization. While the exact timeframe is uncertain, such approval could be received upon the completion of the 2 to 3 year grant as compared to the minimum 5 year span one would expect through standard clinical trials, particularly since a regulatory framework has yet to be developed for bacteriophage therapy applications. Approval for combat use, however, would demonstrate efficacy of the product and so encourage more rapid approval for civilian use. This same end could be achieved by receiving military approval for combat utilization without having received a DOD grant.
Clinical Trials
All new treatments must be thoroughly tested before they can be licensed and approved for patients. Clinical Trials are employed to ensure the new treatment meets Food and Drug Administration guidelines of safety, stability, and efficacy. There are four phases of clinical trials
1. Phase 1  – Trials recruit a small number of patients (up to 30) to test for adverse side effects and determine the best dose
2. Phase 2  – Trials recruit additional patients (up to 50) and determine the effects for the larger group
3. Phase 3  – Trials are much larger (including 100’s or even 1000’s of patients) and compare the new treatment to standard treatments
4. Phase 4  – Trials are carried out once the drug has been licensed. These trials aim to discover longer term risks and benefits and the success of the drug when employed more widely.
There is no typical length of time the clinical process trials take. It might take 10 or 15 years to complete the first 3 phases before the licensing stage, but this time span varies depending on several factors, such as:
1. The type of disease being treated
2. The type of treatment
3. The number of patients required
4. Follow-up testing period
5. Unexpected results or problems with the treatment

Dr. Dai shared with us his several interesting ideas on the project:
1. As yeast is a eukaryotic system, it might be modified to have partial functions of lymphocytes. One possibility is that it might synthesize phages which could kill bacteria or synthesize antibodies to collaborate with pre-existing immune system, or it might be modified to recognize and phagocytose bacteria as a macrophage. Cool idea as it is, however, in my known case, no paper directly related is found. The overall mission seems to be tough, but making small achievements are promising. At least we may focus on recognition of pathogen by yeast.
2. Cell-communication between tumor cells in drosophila might be investigated and transplanted by yeast system. This is a grand new aspect that few papers are published but valuable materials are available.

Li Xiaoyi got an idea: using RNA to simulate GFP
We all know that it is GFP protein’s fluorophore that give GFP the ability to produce fluorescence. The paper I sent to everyone is about screening an RNA named Spinach. This RNA has a special secondary structure. Its blue part, named aptamer, can bind to different substrate as we modified its DNA sequence. When add chromosphere, fluorescence can be observed.
Pros:
1. The method commonly used can only use fluorescent protein to reflect the change of protein level in cell. This new method can reflect the level of substrate.
2. The substrates of aptamer are usually ADP or SAM. We can design different substrates but needs searching other reference.
3. Easy to design. We can alter the stem-loop structure of the RNA in ways we want.
4. Classical synthetic biology methods can be used to control transcription.
5. The intensity and stability of the fluorescence are good.
6. There are lots of HBI analog. Adding different chromosphere can produce different color.

Our goal
Posted by Roberto Martín 25/06/2011
We are going to build circuits based on collections of different bacteria strains, where each strain works as a logic gate. A logic gate is the basic component of an electronic circuit, such as AND, OR or XOR,  and it exchanges information with the others. Combining the correct strains and using certain chemical substances as system inputs we can manipulate a bacterial community into performing complex functions.
To achieve our goal we are going to define a standard of programming modularized biological circuits, where a community of bacteria -from different but interconnected strains- form a physically independent module. Combining different modules in this way makes it possible to recycle strains and substances. To implement this system, the key is to standardise the inter-modular communication substances. This is exactly what we are going to do: we are going to define a substance, which we have named the Ubbit Standard (from Universal BioBit), that will be the element of communication between modules. Just like that, any research group could use the modules created by any other group and combine them with their own without the necessity of knowing how it internally works, just by using the Ubbit standard.

Objectives
This year we presented Softer Shock to several audiences, from students to seniors,               to get their point of view and develop the project according to society’s needs.
Presentation of softer shock at the Sèvres mayor’s office and the Department of Val de Marne.
On Thursday, April 27 we had a meeting to present our project to the mayor’s office of Sèvres’.                   A part of our team went to this meeting to present the iGEM and our project (what is our goal to improve agriculture).                   We presented the scientific and ethical aspects of synthetic biology in youth education and our qualifications                   for the grant. They were very interested in our project and the potential results. We were awarded a grant of 1 000€                   for participating in the student science education, and congratulated for our enthusiastic participation in such a                   competition. For our first professional presentation it was a very good experience!
With the same goal to present our project for fundraising but also to have different perspectives and                   advice on softer shock we met some representatives of the Val de Marne Department. Our project consits of                   different parts. First, we present the context and the history of the iGEM competition. Then we explained what                   made us different from other teams -  our pluridisciplinarity and complementarity. We then explained the technical,                   scientific and ethical aspects of our Softer Shock project. We concluded the presentation with the project budget and                   the our requirements for accomplishing Softer Shock. We were awarded a 1 500€ grant, they were confident in our project                   and wanted to help us to start our proof of concept.
Our participation in the French Science Festival
The Science Festival in France, held annually since 1992, is a day of science presentations and                 demonstrations in public spaces. The goal is to provide an appealing introduction to science for the youth,                 as well as provide a opportunity for informed dialogue between the general public and working scientists on                 science in current events.
In order to present synthetic biology and some of its applications (of which our project is only one example)                 we presented Softer Shock to other students.

CrtEBI Characterization
Biobrick BBa_K274100 is the lycopene-producing device submitted by team Cambridge 2009. It is used to produce lycopene which is red pigment can be detected by the naked eye.
However, we find that BBa_K274100 represented a significant leakage expression when exploited as a reporter gene and even bacteria bearing BBa_K274100 only could also represent significant color change, compared with the blank. We speculate that it’s because of a putative promoter upstream, resulting in the leaky expression of CrtEBI. In order to verify the speculation, we further characterize this biobrick. This biobrick was suffixed to the constitutive promoter BBa_J23103. On the other hand, we did something fantastic: The biobrick was suffixed to the terminator BBa_B0015. Terminator upstream was expected to reduce the basal level of lycopene production, thus to verify our speculation. Resulted two new biobricks are shown in Figure 1.

Interest Group of Synthetic Biology of Nanjing University
In order to unite the students who embrace huge passion in the field of synthetic biology and propagandize iGEM, we established this group in March, 2013. We aim to combine amusement and science together to live a wonderful lab life. Meanwhile, we also communicated with other iGEM teams as a group. This summer, most students of our group devoted themselves into working on the idea we came up with independently half a year ago. Moreover, we hope that through iGEM, we can not only increase our quality of research, but also strengthen own team cooperation. After iGEM 2013, this group will still exist and we are going to make it more influential.
Visit iGEM Teams of Tsinghua University
Being fresh in iGEM, it's important for us to communicate with a sophisticated team who can help us grow more quickly. In this way, we can also establish friendship with people who have the same dream with us. Under this circumstance, we went to Beijing and visited Tsinghua University in November, 2012.
During this trip, we visited 3 teams, Tsinghua-A, Tsinghua-C and Tsinghua-D, and communicated with them well. As experienced iGEM competitors, they successfully showed a more clear scenery of iGEM and synthetic biology to us, who haven't stepped into this field before. Besides, Tsinghua-A have introduced the model part in iGEM to us and promised to help us for the lack of modeler in our team. Of course, all of them sincerely remind us of the hardship in this process and we have also talked over the questions like how to come up with a good idea, how to assess and realize them. When we left THU, we had learned so much and both Tsinghua and our team members thought that we should keep contact with each other in the future and step forward together.

ShanghaiTech,2018,Team:ShanghaiTech#Project Oribosome_-_-_TEXT.html," E.coli in absence of the corresponding orthogonal 16S rRNA. The C9 RBS shows the best orthogonality.
The experiment results showed the great orthogonality of the orthogonal ribosome A2 and C9 we introduce and verified the function of the orthogonal ribosome introduced by Tianjin_2012 iGEM team. The fluorescence signal of GFP is much weaker without orthogonal 16S rRNA, but when the orthogonal 16S rRNA existing, the fluorescence signal increases over time.
Characterization experiment B
Fig.10 Characterisation of orthogonal ribosome system interaction in DH5α E.coli. Flourescence is monitered over 6 hours by plate reader when different orthogonal ribosomes are under different RBS.
The experiment results did not fully meet the data shown on the previous paper.  While achieving  perfect proof of the orthogonality of the orthogonal ribosome to host ribosome, the crosstalk between each of the orthogonal ribosome was much more serious that expected. Especially for the TJU O-16S, it can nearly translate all the orthogonal RBS from Jason Chin's Lab. However, we are still luckily to find that the A2 orthogonal ribosome. It is relatively orthogonal to other orthogonal ribosome while have good affainty to its own RBS. Meanwhile, the A2 RBS is perfectly isolated from the host genome.
We infer that the test of the orthogonality in previous paper is based on whether the bacteria can survive when the resistant gene is under the orthogonal RBS. This creates a far more strict screening than our experiment since expressing GFP is not a great burden to the host bacteria.
For now, we just need one pair of orthogonal ribosome and RBS, so the interaction do not actually bother us.  But we will still other orthogonal ribosome for further construction.
Characterization experiment C
Experimental results showed that Jason's orthogonal pool sufficiently controlled the expression of GFP. The fluorescence signal of GFP was nearly close to zero without o-16S rRNA, but when the o-16S rRNA existed, the fluorescent protein showed the tendency to increase over time. Besides, the fluorescence signal of RFP increased with time as well, no matter whether the o-16S rRNA presented. Due to some unknown reasons, we received some very small, even negative values of red fluorescence signals in measurements at the very beginning of culturing cells. For better understanding, we moved upward our data to make the lowest value be zero, and the whole values of red fluorescence signals were elevated synchronously. Fluorescence values"

CALCA Promoter
gRNA
dCas9
dCas9 - sspA fusion
This year we planned to create 5 distinct BioBricks, due to multiple problems occurring in and out of the lab that will be discussed later, we were not able to successfully ligate any synthesised DNA into a plasmid for transformation.
SSPA
*Stringent starvation protein A* (sspA) is a protein native to Escherichia coli, it is normally expressed in the change from growth phase to stationary phase on the normal growth curve. It forms a homodimer to bind to genomic DNA, and acts as a transcriptional activator.
It’s sequence can be found on this Benchling link
CALCA promoter
This part was to show that our system could target and amplify human genes. Natively it initiates transcription of calcitonin protein A.
It’s sequence can be found on this Benchling link
gRNAs
The guide RNA (gRNA) is used to target the Cas9 protein to the calcitonin promoter. It was designed with 20 base pairs of complementary sequence, along with the scaffold sequence. In order to design the gRNA, we ran the CRISPR analysis tool from Benchling, and by following their tutorials we managed to design two gRNAs.
gRNA1 Benchling link
gRNA2 Benchling link
dCas9
dCas9 stands for dead Cas9, as this version of Cas9 has a mutation that causes it to not have any catalytic action. This means that the Cas9 binds to the DNA through the help of gRNAs, and then just sits on the DNA, instead of cleaving it. We used the sequence from the Streptococcus pyogenes bacterium. We then had to break the sequence up into chunks as IDT only provided 1kb chunks of sequencing, so we decided to perform a gibson assembly upon the chunks to stitch the part together.
It’s sequence can be found on this Benchling link
dCas9 - sspA fusion
This is the same as the dCas9, however we have added a 10 amino acid linker and the sspA sequence to the end, meaning that when they are expressed, the two proteins should"

Working with GMOs outside the lab is a delicate task because the spread and gene transfer to organisms in the environment must be prevented. This is the reason why the Israel iGEM-Team decided to engineer a system that, after the organism leaves the controlled environment, leads to cell death.  We are convinced that safety is always an important issue so we were glad when the BGU Israel asked us for help.  For the detailed characterization of a main component, the phage λ cI repressor, of their system special equipment is required and we could provide it. Before making the HPLC they asked for we will perform some Western blots to find out if an HPLC is really necessary. Therefore we will use the provided plasmid with the His-tagged cI and anti-His antibodies.  In return the BGU Israel iGEM team will characterize our nitrate reductase promoter used for the antibody production in PHAECTORY.

Furthermore, due to the interest in search on the whole exome sequence for the neoantigen variants,                   the whole Gnomad biallelic variants were selected as the interval of the analys. The output consists in a table containing 6 different columns: contig, position, ref_count, alt_count, other_alt_count, allele_frequency. The alt_count                   field contains the reads that are supported by the germline resource.
The pileup summaries table was then used to calculate the fraction of cross-sample contamination in the tumor reads and output the contamination table that can be used to filter the mutations. The resulting table contains the estimates                   for contamination and error in the sample. Furthermore, CalculateContamination also supports an alternate mode which uses the matched normal sample to improve on the accuracy of the analysis.The results show that the contamination levels                   for the samples are relatively low.

The mutations outputted by Mutect2 were filtered using FilterMutectCalls. This applies a preset of thresholds and filters to remove false positives from the data. It uses the contamination table as an additional input. FilterMutectCalls                   outputs a VCF and index file, containing the true positives with the PASS label and the false positives with the FILTER field.
Gene-Based Annotation - Annovar
The gene-based annotation was performed using Annovar (v. 2018Apr16) annotate_variation.pl script. Gene-based annotation was used to annotate the mutations of the discover in the samples and the coding_change.pl was change to translate                   the annotated sequences into the corresponding coding proteins. Additionally, filter-based mutation was used to filter mutations from the Cosmic Database and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) database.
Annovar uses the predetermined file format VCF4 for the inputs. The annotated mutations from Mutect2 or other GATK packages commonly found in VCF format can be converted using the perl code convert2annovar.pl. This tool adds three additional                   rows to the VCF format, zygosity status, genotype quality and read depth. The genotype calling files from the samples extracted after filtering the contamination with FilterMutectCalls were converted to VCF4 format.
Before annotating the samples with annovar, the FASTA sequences for all annotated transcripts in RefSeq Gene hg19, were downloaded using the built-in --downdb argument in the annotated_variation.pl package."
Potsdam_Bioware,2011,Team:Potsdam Bioware#Safety Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," Children are open minded and want to discover everything. It’s easy to inspire them with our work.  The earlier we start to introduce people to science, the better are the chances to create endorsement and interest instead of fear and refusal of synthetic biology.
Therefore, we took the initiative and invited kids to our lab. We gave them a short and easy description of our work and aims at an adequate level. They assisted us at the lab and enjoyed tasks like pipetting. It was such a pleasure to see the fascination in their bright eyes. We think that such positive memories will last a lifetime.

Biosafety and Biosecurity (English)
It is important to discriminate between biosafety and biosecurity in the context of working with genetically modified organisms. Biosecurity comprises the safety of the lab. The WHO defines biosecurity as a task of organisation and administration. The term biosafety deals with the biological risks of the samples for the user, the enviroment and the lab. In this article, we are mostly summarizing the German law on biosecurity and biosafety regarding to the ZKBS (zentrale Kommission für Biologische Sicherheit) and their list of unhazardous organisms plus the comment on safety of the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) . Furthermore we crosslinked the laws of the United States of America and the European law of biosecurity and biosafety in this article. We marked this statement in the text, so the reader can discrimante between the law systems. This kind of differentiation makes sense, because our experimental work was done in Germany, shipped in Europe (to SDU Denmark) and used as a BioBrick in the United States of America.

ABOUT PORTFOLIO CONTACT SEARCH
The objective of our project is to eliminate ammonia from public places. To determine concentration of ammonia in public places around us, we decided to sample air from sources that are potentially rich in ammonia. We sampled air in washrooms and chemical laboratories in our Institute, and analyzed them for ammonia using the indophenol blue assay (the protocol we used can be found
here
). We wished to understand whether other countries and regions face similar issues when it comes to the state of their public washrooms, and therefore, decided to collaborate with other teams to measure concentrations of ammonia present in their washrooms.
We are fortunate to have formed friendships that transcend geographical distances.
Team UCAS China
Team UCAS China is trying to address the issue of excessive ammonia present in aquaculture. Given that both our teams are trying to eliminate ammonia, determination of ammonia levels from environment samples is of relevance to both teams. We have shared our protocol for quantification of ammonia with Team UCAS. Team UCAS has carried out measurements of ammonia in air samples for us and will be sharing their results with us.
On our part, we have collected water samples from a nearby lake, Bandra talao, and measured ammonia in it using our protocol. We have shared our results with them.

Team Heidelberg
Team Heidelberg 2013 had worked on indigoidine synthesis, which forms an integral part of our project. Ever since our Skype session with the current team, Team Heidelberg has been extensively involved in helping us out with indigoidine synthesis. They shipped us two plasmids, pRB1 and pRB5, which contain genes for production of indigoidine. They also sent out relevant plasmid maps which helped us carry out successful transformation of E. coli cells with these plasmids.
All-India iGEM teams meet-up at IISER Pune
We participated in the All-India iGEM teams meet-up hosted by Team IISER Pune. It was indeed an enriching experience, presenting our project to an intelligent audience as well as listening to innovative projects of other teams. Our presentation was followed by an interactive question and answer session wherein many interesting points about our project came up, which helped us in chalking out our future plan."

Exeter,2014,Team:Exeter#iLOVCharacterisation_-_-_TEXT.html,"aching events. By t = 5:02 the fluorescence of iLOV and GFP had reached the lower limit of the bleaching effect seen in figure 7, beyond this point the additional exposure would have certainly disrupted measurements.
Figure 8: The recovery could not be measured without further photo-bleaching of the sample.
Whilst this result reveals very little about the recovery rate of iLOV, an estimate of its upper limit can be made from the fluorescence topography scans. Wells where used alternately, spending 6 minutes inactive between uses. The fluorescence appeared to have returned to normal levels at the start of each triplet of scans (See figure 4). This suggests that the maximum recovery time from three 4.5 ms scans is 6 minutes.
Summary
This experiment characterised the fluorescence topography of iLOV. Photo-bleaching of the iLOV protein by a low power light source was also explored. These results should help future iGEM teams analyze data they collect whilst using the iLOV part.
The iLOV protein gave the greatest fluorescence response when excited with photons of wavelength 449$\pm$1nm whilst detecting photon emission at a wavelength of 494$\pm$2nm.
After a 400 $\mu$s exposure the fluorescence of iLOV was found to drop around 5%. This was approximately the same for GFP. To bleach the proteins any more than this a higher power light source would be required.
The upper limit of iLOV's recovery time from a triplet of 4.5ms exposures was 6 minutes. When mapping the topography of iLOV it was seen that accurate measurements of iLOV's fluorescence could be made with exposure times as little as 100 $\mu$s. Therefore photo-bleaching can be avoided when using iLOV as a reporter with the condition that the protein is allowed to rest for at least 6 minutes between measurements.
To better characterise the photo-bleaching effect on iLOV, a laser source could be used. If the power of the source is high enough irreversible bleaching in GFP could be shown along with proof of the photo-reversibility of the iLOV protein.

We innovatively plot a new way of spreading the spirits of IGEM by starting our own community and we will never stop sharing and communicating.

Human Practice,""the C project""
Although we do software, we also keep eyes on promotion of synthetic biology and sharing our own program. Therefore, we started a long term human practice, “the C project”, since this summer.“the C project”, as we call, consists of three parts: Curriculum, Communication and Community.
Curriculum
As a IGEM team, we try to let people as many as possible to know what synthetic biology is. Therefore, advisors of our team, Haiyan Liu and Jiong Hong, have established a set of synthesis biology curriculum this summer. We have done many works related to human practice on the curriculum.
Jiong Hong (in the right picture), advisor of our team, gave lectures introducing safety and ethnics issues of synthetic biology.
Luojun Wang (in the head picture), members of our team, gave lectures promoting iGAME.
A survey* on how students know about synthetic biology and their interests for tutor game was made.(*the survey statistics comes from a sample of 240 students. Numbers of undergraduates, masters and PhDs are 160, 60 and 20)
Analysis of the results of the survey The first chart shows students' favorite game types for iGAME, and the second chart shows their knowledge of IGEM project.
The Circos Map
We tried many methods to plot our survey more straightforwardly and clearly before we finally chose Circos mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos . Circos is biological software used to plot genome elements and relationship. Here, we innovatively used Circos to demonstrate our survey.(as in the right picture) Circos is somehow like pie chart yet it can present multi information as all the statistics are proportional and clear on the graph.
In the graph, there are three circles. The inner circle stands for their knowledge of synthetic biology, and middle circle stands for their interests of iGame. Deeper the color is, the more they know of synthetic biology or the more they are interested in iGame. For example, light pink means they know little about synthetic biology and deep green means they are very interested of the coming tutor games. The outer circle, however, stands for their major;light green for biology major and light orange for other majors. As"

Newcastle,2018,Team:Newcastle#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," control parameters are most important. Paul Brown (Director) gave us lots of useful contacts within the industry and seemed very passionate about our project, however he did mention some areas of the market may be sceptical when it comes to eating produce that has been grown using genetically engineered microbes.
Week commencing: 06/08/2018
This week we started to work on a video for the opening of the presentation in Boston. We wanted to continue with the theme portrayed in a previous 'teaser' we produced. The hydroponics switching circuit was finalised by the engineers, this controlled the day and night cycle to simulate specific environments for the seeds. The Hydroponics system aesthetics were also worked on, we applied spray paint and stencils to make it more visually appealing. At the end of the week Matt Burridge (One of our team members) conducted a workshop to teach people how to write and run protocols on the Opentrons OT-2 robot.
In the lab we: amplified the backbone of pSBS1C3 through thermocycling using primers for the 2kb sequence required for assembly and this allowed the plasmid to be linearised and prepare for later insertion of the gblocks for the naringenin operon, ran this PCR product using agarose gel electrophoresis to check for separation of the backbone required from the rest of the plasmid, purified the PCR product and quantified the DNA concentration thus making the backbone ready for Gibson Assembly. Towards the end of the week amplified the positive control for Gibson assembly practice using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit.
Week commencing: 13/08/2018
We were in the final stages of building the hydroponics system this week, we have determined optimal wavelengths to run the system at. Chris 3D printed a series of trays for seeds to fit in. We were also lucky enough to have a meeting with Chris Tapsell From KWS (the 4th largest seed company in the world). We outlined our project and discussed the issues surrounding GM crops and how the industry and wider public respond to GM use.

b) High-efficiency production of natamycin.
Key points:
1) Is it viable for mass-producing?
2) Negative feedback and positive feedback.
3) Association of quorum sensing and pimM expression.
Conclusion:
     Group 5 mainly searched information about increasing the production of natamycin. But they didn't study about the intracellular expression of E coli. Besides, they didn't mention of the advantages of utilizing quorum sensing (QS) system to produce metabolite. Therefore, in the following days, the members of Group 5 should find answers to the two questions through studying literatures.

4. Secretive expression and Kil-Km secretive box
Conclusion:
     Barnase is a kind of RNase. It's toxic and will cause cells death. Barstar is the depressor of barnase. These two proteins interact and then neutralize the toxicity of barnase. The members of Group 6 introduced barnase and barstar from various aspects, such as their applied prospect. Whereas they didn't learn about any problem in the process of producing barnase, so we don't know whether synthetic biology can help to improve it. What's more, just to construct a Biobrick to produce barnase seems of not much value.
     After discussion, we suggested the members of group 6 to study about some difficulties in the productive process of barnase and try to communicate with Group 5, in order to find our advantages of utilizing quorum sensing. Besides, Huang introduced some information of Kil-Km secretive box, which can accelerate secreting proteins out of cells. So we hoped them to exchange information with Group 3 and help them to find secretive pathways.

Introduction
Bioaccumulation – “General term describing a process by which chemicals are taken up by an organism either directly from exposure to a contaminated medium or by consumption of food containing the chemical.” – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010
In nature, exposure to toxic elements enabled microorganisms to develop a complex and efficient system, overcoming harsh environments. In response to heavy metal stress, organisms could use different defense systems. Such as binding proteins, like metallothioneins, with cysteines as binding sites, that could inactive it, a synthesis of some enzymes to reduce the metal and turn them less toxic.  One of the microbial processes to be used as a bioremediation tool to remove heavy metals, is bioaccumulation. Which is an active process that depends on microorganism’s metabolic energy. Organisms with unique abilities of metal absorption, accumulation or resistance can occur naturally. Alternatively, these systems can be used in genetic engineered bacteria and plants for remediation of polluted waters and soils.
In order to solve the environmental problem regarding to mercury, we built a bioaccumulator using Escherichia coli DH5α through the metal binding peptide (MBP).
Why Metal Binding Peptide?
Metal ions act as relevant proteins cofactors, having an important role on protein activity regulation, where the amino acids sequence is fundamental for binding to metal ions. The appropriate protein configuration is ensures the binding with metals, and is pretty selective according to its nature. Metal Binding Peptides are low weight molecular proteins, similarly to metallothioneins, with high cysteine content which confers to bacteria the ability to adhere to mercury.
Our construction (How it works?)
To develop our bioaccumulator in Escherichia coli DH5-alpha, we designed a biobrick device to bind and inactivate Hg. It is composed by two parts: Essential biobrick (BBa_K1355001) attached to the MBP biobrick (BBa_K346004) that was synthesized by iGEM Peking 2010. As described by the team, this MBP design"

Simulating A Bioreactor
Nonlinear least squares estimation of wild type saturation curve
Problem:
In a typical reactor, cells at the surface absorb more than enough light to saturate their  photosynthetic apparatus, transmitting less energy to deeper layers. Cells operating past the saturation point  waste incident photons by non-photochemical quenching and possibly undergo photodamage.  For wild type cells, the  “saturation curve” is assumed to be approximately the same for all cells in all layers, regardless of their  incident light intensity.  This means that layers of cells on the exterior of the reactor nearest a light source  receive an overabundance of photons and in turn block the interior layers from receiving enough light.  In an  optimal reactor, all layers would operate near their respective saturation points to maximize the photosynthetic  channeling of incident light energy.
The total saturation curve for wild type R. Sphaeroides was fit with a nonlinear least squares regression of the  form in the corresponding equation.  Data points were generated from calculating absorbance as the negative logarithm of the ratio of the absolute irradiance detected on the next layer to incident absolute irradiance on a layer of cells.  A logistic form was chosen to account for the diminishing returns to absorption of further photons past a threshold operating capacity of the photosynthetic apparatus. (1)
Exponential response curve for mutant LH2 saturation coefficients
Simulating our Mutant's advantage in a Bioreactor
For our mutant cells, the LH2 saturation curve for each layer scales as a function of light intensity.  This  predicted behavior in the mutant is due to negative regulation of LH2 complex production as incident light  intensity increases.  The scalar of the magnitude of the saturation curve was altered according to a predicted  exponential curve of LH2 production in repsone to changes in incident light. It was assumed that the system could  vary expression levels such that at high light intensities, the saturation curve is scaled to 25% of that of the  wild type.  At low light intensities, LH2 production was assumed to have the potential to be up-regulated to 150%  of wild type expression levels.
The advantage this mutant would confer stems from the adaptive nature of the saturation curve heights.  Cells  receiving the most light on the outside of the bioreactor saturate at low absorption levels.  This allows"

7/21/14:  We PCRed more HSP+pACYC184 and UV+pACYC184 with the input backbone primers to try to successfully amplify the backbone. We used 5uL 1000x dilution of plasmid, 2.5uL water, 2.5uL forward primer, 2.5uL reverse primer, and 12.5uL Q5 McMaster Mix.

We also used DpnI on the five output backbones that we had previously PCRed successfully to chop up the template before we purify it. We used the 25uL of PCR, 19uL of water, 5uL Cut Smart buffer, and 1uL DpnI. This went in 37degree waterbath for 1 hour.   We also ran the HSP experiment. We had inoculated in 5mL LB+antibiotic four samples: DH5alpha, HSP+pACYC184, GFP+pBR322, and HSP/GFP+pACYC184/pBR322. We made 1/10 and 1/20 dilutions of all four. For the 1/10 we used 4.5mL LB, the correct antibiotic, and 500uL of sample. For the 1/20 dilutions, we used 4.75mL LB, the correct antibiotic, and 250uL of sample. We took OD600 readings and found that the 1/20 dilutions were closer to one. So we split these into 2 tubes, 2.5mL in each. These were put in the shaker for forty minutes and OD600s were taken again. This was repeated, checking OD600s, until the concentration had doubled for all 8 samples. (The combo ones took the longest to rise). Then, we put the four heat shock ones into a 45degree water bath for 15minutes. The other four (controls) sat in 37 (withOUT shaking) while they were in the water bath.

Some of the concerns they expressed are very much in line with the obstacles we have witnessed in the past, so we specifically focused on those issues in our report. The report includes a section explaining the iGEM competition, the basics on how to start a team, an attributions section, and an appendix. The appendix has detailed explanations on each part of starting and managing a team, including recruiting, training, timeline and more. Both the Baltimore BioCrew and iTesla team state what they have attempted in relation to each topic, what has worked and what has not worked. To conclude the topic, a section on advice/improvements is usually provided to give potential iGEM teams direction on where to start.
We plan on continuing to add more feedback as our experience with the iGEM competition progresses and hope to encourage more community laboratories to invite local high schoolers to compete in the iGEM competition using their lab space with our iGEM Guide.

3) Identify the essential genes in the HMF pathway
After we complete the RFP knockdown, we will begin our combinatorial knockdown of the 19 HMF pathway target genes previously identified by graduate student Iman Farasat. Using double and triple gene knockdowns, we will be able to analyze which gene or combination of genes is responsible for the functioning of the pathway. We will do this using a 2-furoic acid assay, where we will incubate all constructs in 2-furoic acid (approximately 3 g/L) and monitor their growth and consumption of 2-furoic acid over a 24 hour period. Colonies that display reduced 2-furoic acid concentration demonstrate that the pathway is still functioning – we will look for colonies that do not deplete the 2-furoic acid concentration.  The latter colonies reflect that the pathway has failed to function, and we will use these to determine which gene combinations result in this phenotype.
4) Develop a program for automated genome comparisons
5) Engineer the pathway to function in P. fluorescens and E. coli
This is a late-stage goal that will most likely not be completed before the Jamboree. Once we identify the gene(s) that are essential for the functioning of the HMF pathway, we will insert them into the E. coli genome and evaluate the action of the pathway using the 2-furoic acid assay. If this objective is completed, industry and academic researchers will be able to use our E. coli strain to produce biofuels without the toxic effects from furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural killing cell cultures. They will be able to subject biomass to more intense pretreatment procedures, increasing sugar yields and the amount of biofuels that can be fermented from these sugars.

Illinois-Tools,2009,Team:Illinois-Tools#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," to consider when creating a novel organism and even more when you are talking about integrating a cell into an environment. It is almost impossible to be certain how a new cell will react in the environment; it is fairly likely that a long term effect would be detrimental.  By having an ATP balancing system you can adjust the ATP so that the cell can fulfill its purpose and then die off shortly after. This is a critical safety precaution and should always be considered when talking about introducing anything new to a new environment. By implementing this guideline in synthetic biology, you would be one step closer in integrating it with the environment.
Questions:
Q1: Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety,
public safety, or
environmental safety?
A: Environmental safety is the issue that comes about with our project.
Q2: Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
A: There is no biosafety group that we are aware of.
Q3: What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
A: Had there been a biosafety group, they would probably be able to see the benefits of our project to have in many   aspects of science, health and environment as long as necessary environmental safety measures are taken when implementing the information our program provides.
Q4: Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry?
A: We did not create any new BioBricks.

Nina is on it!
The growth of the Registry depends on having a broad base of reliable parts. This is why the improvement of an existing part is just as important as the creation and documentation of a new part. An ""improvement"" is anything that improves the functionality and ease-of-use of a part, so that it is more likely to be used by the community. For instance: strengthening the expression of a part by mutating the DNA sequence; modifying one or a few parts in construct (Device) so that it performs its intended job better; improving a cloning or expression vector that can be easily used by the entire community; and of course, troubleshooting and fixing a part reported to be non-functional. Data from an experimental comparison between the original and improved part/ device is strongly recommended.
Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.

Summary
The insights of the methods ( formularies and guidelines ) veterinarians use, gave us insights in how our detection method could add value to the current regulations concerning antibiotic treatment. We found out that the treatment per animal disease is very specific, and that we had narrow our scope to one animal disease to add value. In the future, the detections methods could be slightly adapted with regards to a specific animal disease.

Not only students have attended to organisation but also there were academicians to listen in presentations. In the end of the event, we have presented our poster to academicians and talked about antibiotics, their usage and the anticipated outcomes. Main aim was to create an awareness among people and inform about what we are trying to accomplish and what beneficial outcomes might occur.
High School Presentation: We went to Bilkent High School to introduce iGEM, answer the questions of high school students about science and synthetic biology and present our project to them. We have talked with the principle of the school and he has given us the opportunity to present our project to them and explain what is iGEM, what is the hype about the iGEM competition and how hard and amazing it is to be an iGEMer. They were very interested and some of them really wanted to become scientists and engineers after the presentation. We believe that we have created an awareness about the problem of antibiotics and increasing resistance that we are dealing with along with inspiring future iGEMers.
Synthetic Biology Day: Synthetic Biology Day is the day that we have all worked so hard for and the day we all have been waiting for since this would be the organization that is solely organized by iGEM team. This is the third Synthetic Biology Day that Bilkent-UNAMBG iGEM team is organizing at UNAM facility and this year we have brought many speakers* from reputable universities and from different fields of science and technology. We have also designed posters, notebooks and stickers for the event.
The aim of the Synthetic Biology Day is to introduce synthetic biology - what is it, what are the applications of it etc. - to people from various fields starting from engineering to medicine and even from social sciences that are curious about science and innovation. We have also aimed to introduce people to iGEM, thus we have presented our project at the event. We have invited METU-HS iGEM Team to present their project as well and they were very glad to accept this opportunity. The audience were engaged in the conference, the speakers were knowledgeable, the UNAM staff has also congratulated us and we got many positive feedbacks about the organization and pastry! Overall, it was a fruitful conference."

Line 3 is a close match, and the accession number matches one of the ADH genes found in K. xylinus. Credit: Stratton Georgoulis.
Identifying genes of interest
In order to design a construct increasing expression of PQQ-ADH and ALDH in Ga. hansenii, it was necessary to find the genome of the ATCC strain and identify the coding sequences for these genes. The whole genome shotgun sequence for our organism, ATCC 53582, is published on NCBI (Abbot, 2015) with annotations regarding the functions of specific sequences. Coding sequences are annotated with proposed gene products. Though there are several aldehyde dehydrogenase genes annotated in the genome, there is only one which is described as membrane-bound, matching the description from Mamlouk and Gullo (Mamlouk and Gullo, 2013). There are additionally multiple alcohol dehydrogenases. A known amino acid sequence for a homologous PQQ-ADH in Comamonas testosteroni was compared against sequences in the Ga. hansenii genome using BLAST (Table 1). One ADH enzyme found in the Ga. hansenii genome sequence matches the C. testosteroni sequence with a query cover value of 94% and an E value of 0 (third line of Table 1).

Modeling Overview
In order to develop a rapid diagnostic lateral flow assay (LFA) using griffithsin (GRFT), the thermostability of GRFT must be improved while preserving its biological activity and structural integrity. Proteins with greater thermostability are more resistant to conformational changes at higher temperatures and thus, have longer shelf lives. Thermostability can be improved by altering a protein’s noncovalent and disulfide bonds through random and site specific mutagenesis. Instead of blindly altering the protein structure and measuring the melting temperatures of each GRFT variant, we chose to use the YASARA modeling package to selectively alter amino acids with the goals of minimizing the ΔG of folding and preserving structural similarity of both the monomeric (3ll2) and oligomeric homodimer (2HYQ) forms of GRFT. After engineering the two thermostable variants of GRFT through computational directed evolution, the biological activity of these proteins were evaluated through the docking package ZDOCK.
Modeling Packages
Yasara is a modeling package which has many useful functions for protein engineering. In addition to imaging the protein of interest, Yasara is useful for repairing the unfolded structures, mutating multiple protein residues, and predicting the stability of formed variants. For the purposes of this project, Yasara was used to calculate the B values of protein residues and predict the structures of proteins based on certain residue changes. After using the B values to determine which residues are unstable, the position scan function in Yasara's FOLDX suite was used to mutate each amino acid to the other 20 and predicting the change in stability between each variant and the original. The mutations that increased the stability were stacked upon each other to create more thermostable Griffithsin protein.
ZDOCK is a docking package from the University of Massachusetts that predicts the interactions between different proteins and"

OVERVIEW
Abstract
        SCUT-China_A team tries to build a group of heavy metal detecting devices: We standardized the lysis gene SRRz to build a visible and low-cost reporter which can detect chemical substances qualitatively. And it can also detect chemical substances quantitatively in a certain concentration range. Subsequently, we will link some specific inducible promoters of heavy metal ions to the reporter and transform these devices into Escherichia coli BL21 to verify the feasibility of the reporter and construct engineering bacteria that can rapidly detect heavy metal ions in water.
Background
1. The current situation of the heavy metal pollution
        With the expansion of the city and the development of large-scale industries, heavy metal pollution in the                     environment has become a serious social problem. More heavy metal ions are discharged into the water                     through mining, metal smelting, the wastewater of chemical industry, and other anthropogenic sources.                     Most heavy metals ions are toxic to humans at even micro-concentration. As they are toxic, and can be                     biologically enriched, they severely threaten the safety and health of humans.
        However, the current methods of heavy metal ions detection are complex and expensive.
2. Current detection methods of the heavy metal
2.1 Chemical methods
         Nowadays, the major detection methods of heavy metal ions are ICP-AES, ICP-MS, AAFS, GHAAS. The advantages                     of these methods are low detection limit and high specificity, but they require expensive instruments                     and complex operation, which is relatively unavailable for the non - professional, and it cannot detect                     the bioavailability of heavy metals.
2.2 Biosensor based on traditional reporter
        In the past few years, some projects developed biosensors to detect heavy metal ions, most of which                     selected GFP as the reporter. The advantages of biosensors based on GFP is low-cost, and the expression                     of GFP can be directly measured by a certain method. However, the response of GFP usually spends 2-3                     hours. And the measurement of fluorescent proteins requires spectrophotometers which is expensive and                     requires professional operations.

In addition to this A600 (subscript 600) was measured, showing growth, which would allow determination of the cytotoxicity of hydrogen peroxide at levels required for induction of SoxR. Sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, despite literature, was too low for sfGFP detection over the noise. Cell growth was highly inhibited and higher values we believe would be too detrimental to cell growth to give valid data. We thus believe hydrogen peroxide is not an appropriate substitute for paraquat and due to legal restrictions, our characterisation could not be improved.
Imperial College London iGEM - Outreach
We teamed up with Imperial iGEM to hold a joint stall during New Scientist Live at the ExCel Centre, London. Throughout the 4-day exhibition, which featured our respective project posters, we engaged with visitors to discuss various aspects of iGEM, genetic engineering, and our projects. In preparation for the event, we held weekly Skype meetings with the Imperial team in order to jointly design an educational leaflet designed to improve understanding about synthetic biology, including common laboratory techniques, to distribute to the general public. The leaflet is shown below:
Imperial College London iGEM - Software Testing
We tested a web app (‘let’s talk about this’) created by the Imperial iGEM team designed to help resolve team issues that may arise in extended projects. We provided feedback on various aspects of the software in order to improve its suitability as a tool to promote discussion.
METU HS iGEM - Mentoring
We have been in contact with the METU high school team since the beginning of the Summer. We have given advice on designing parts, restriction sites, protocols, interlab and helped out for judging criteria and deadlines.

Safety perception of RIOT System
The survey results from Australia illustrated in the above table shows that 32.8% of participants were very receptive to the RIOT System (rating it a ‘5’), despite many of them believing that it is not completely safe - only 6% rated safety with a ‘5’. For more details on the analysis of these results, please refer to the Human Practices (International Outreach).
Hong_Kong_HKUST
We assisted Hong_Kong_HKUST with their model, and they helped us to validate our RIOT Sensor in return.
Modelling
The Hong_Kong_HKUST team worked on the tri-stable switch, which required the full treatment of the RIOT Model system. Their intra-bacterial tri-stable switch responds to inducer concentrations in the bacterial environment. As such, the diffusion of the inducers in the environment were modelled in the outer model, and the inducers enter the bacteria at each outer point via free diffusion through the bacterial membrane. Upon implementation, the RIOT Model was sent to the Hong_Kong_HKUST team to experiment with.
Validation of RIOT Sensor
The Hong_Kong_HKUST team kindly helped us to measure the sfGFP expression under the control of different lactate sensors over a range of lactate concentrations. However, the bacteria were unable to grow and the blank media had very high readings. Therefore, we could not use these results to compare with ours.

Hong_Kong_HKU helped us to distribute our survey in Hong Kong.
Human Practices: Survey
With the help of our collaborators from the Hong_Kong_HKU iGEM team, our survey was distributed in Hong Kong. They distributed our survey in their university, the University of Hong Kong, and to the general public.
