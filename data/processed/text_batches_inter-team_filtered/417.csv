SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Concept2_-_-_TEXT.html," integrins gathering can be achieved and induces the internalization and the endosomal escape.
Because of the fact that the lambda phage is naturally infectious for the prokaryotic organisms, the cellular internalization and the endosomal escape are serious limiting factors for its use to transfect eukaryotic cells. But, some studies have shown that the penton base improves in a significant way the cellular internalization and the endosomal escape.
Without any penton base, a phage looses almost the totality of its transfection efficiency. It is an important element for the maintain of a good transfection efficienty of the cell vector.
The adding of the internalization protein, the polypeptide III, allows to the cell vector, the internalization and the endosomal escape of the eukaryotic cells. Once outside of the endosome, the therapeutic plasmid is released in the cytoplasm of the targeted cell and can act.

To summarize…
The DVS has a cell vector , with the following characteristics:
- Non pathogenic so not toxic,
- Cell targeting, so the 2nd specificity,
- Passage of the eukaryotic cells membrane,
- Encapsidation and delivery of a specific plasmid .
This characteristics, specific to the DVS , bring a solution to the redundant problems, of specificity , membrane passage , and therapeutic agent delivery, encounter by the vectors .

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Model#flagellin_-_-_TEXT.html," barely changes when $C_s$ changes, which is reasonable since $C_s << C_{m0}$. $\theta$ increases almost linearly with $C_{m0}$ and does not seem to hit its limit in our parameter range. However, notice that the highest $C_{m0}$ here is about $50 \ \text{mg / ml}$, which is very high indeed. A higher concentration is not only extremely hard to obtain, but might also make the buffer so dense that the normal properties of the reaction is compromised. Therefore, we suggest that in practice, it is sufficient for us to get the concentrations of monomers and yeasts as high as experimentally convenient.
To see how different variables in our equations change over time, we plotted one simulation with $C_s = 4.430 \times 10^{-8} \ \text{mol / L}$ and $C_{m0} = 9.667 \times 10^{-5}$ in the graphs below. To see the full process, we set the simulation time to 20 hours.
Figure 2 The change of the concentration of seeds in the solution over time. $C_s = 4.430 \times 10^{-8} \ \text{mol / L}$, $C_{m0} = 9.667 \times 10^{-5}$

$C_s = 4.430 \times 10^{-8} \ \text{mol / L}$, $C_{m0} = 9.667 \times 10^{-5}$
We can see that the concentration of monomers $C_m$ gradually decays to zero as the concentration of seeds in the solution ($C_n$) and on the yeast surface ($C_{ns}$) gradually increase until around 10 hours. Notice that at hour 10 there are still some monomers left in"

Through expert opinions and mentorship, we were able to learn about the problem of salt damage and extend the project's purpose and contribution to society.
2 Integrated Human Practice regarding biosafety
We were only thinking about biological and technical aspects with respect to creating a device using yeast that sucks salt. Initially, we only considered the condition inside the test tube as a place to use our device and considered that biosafety adhering to laboratory safety guidelines was sufficient. However, as we wrote in the above item, the policy has changed to expand the purpose of our device and aim for future use in the field of salt damage. In this case, unlike laboratory work, it is necessary to give special consideration so as not to let genetically modified yeast escape into the environment.
Among the Human Practice activities, high school students and Kinki Regional Agricultural Administration Office frequently pointed out that whether we are taking genetically modified organisms go outside the system and harm human beings or have a negative impact on the ecosystem. From these experiences, we noticed that when applying to out-laboratory environments (salt damage problems) not only technical issues but also biosafety must be considered carefully.
2-1 column fixing yeasts
So we started thinking the importance to set up biosafety. As we talked to Professor Inoue about yeast, he introduced us a method to fix yeast to the column. If yeast is immobilized on a column and a solution to be desalted is passed through the column, the solution can be desalted without mixing with the yeast cells. With this method, the solution after desalting should be safely desalted without including yeast cells.
In addition to that, we decided to fix yeasts in the column that are aggregated beforehand, in order to further enhance the biosafety. this reduces the number of yeast cells that exist alone and prevents small yeast cells from coming out of the column.
Aggregation of yeasts can be performed by expressing two proteins that bind together specifically; SdrG and Fgb, which are said to be the most potent in the living world.

We tried to solve the environmental problems of salt damage by fixing salt-absorbing yeast on a column and applying it to a practical field. As a result, we"

As our circuit is complicated and involved many transcription factors and reporting proteins (see above), results are separated into the modular parts of our circuit.
Results
LovTAP to LovTAP*
Our entire circuit depends on the conversion of LovTAP to LovTAP* by light. In this simulation, the cell is irradiated at t=300 and this irradiation is ceased at t=700. We observe function as desired, with the concentration of LovTAP as it converts to LovTAP*, and decreasing when the light is turned off.
LovTAP* to CI
Because LovTAP* is a repressor and we desired light induced induction, we make use of an altered version of the double-repression system designed by EPF-Lausanne. Thus, when LovTAP* represses the TrpR promoter, tetR is no longer produced, allowing production of CI+AraC+Mnt. The graph below shows LovTAP* in green, tetR in red, and CI in cyan. As we can see, the increase in LovTAP* decreases tetR and CI then increases, as desired.
State 1
Our first state is on by default; it is the ‘reset’ state of the bi-stable switch. In the graph below, LovTAP* is in green, S1 is in yellow, and CI is in cyan. As we can see, the S1 protein gradually increases at first. When LovTAP* begins to increase in concentration,"

Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is the process where light from the sun is converted into chemical energy that can be used by photosynthetic organisms to fuel their growth and metabolism. The process is divided into two differed photosystems; photosystem I and photosystem II. Photosystem II is the first step in capturing energy from the sun in the form of photons, this energy is captured by chlorophyll molecules and then used to energize electrons that split water atoms into hydrogen atoms and oxygen [1]. Photosystem I then further excites electrons from photosystem II and uses them to produce NADPH for carbon fixation where inorganic carbon in the form of carbon dioxide is converted to organic compounds [2].
Photosynthetic organisms such as the single celled algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are reliant on this system in order to survive and function.
Mutagenesis
Mutagenesis techniques have been an important tool for scientists to determine the individual functions of the genes. For example, Meinecke et al conducted a study on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that were chlorophyll deficient. These mutants were found to have a build up of Mg-protoporphyrin IX as a result of mutations in the ChlM gene. The ChlM gene encodes the enzyme Mg-protoporhyrin IX methyltransferase and this buildup of substrate resulted in no production of chlorophyll, suggesting that the ChlM gene was an essential step in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway [3].
Whilst it is known how the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway operates, currently there has been little success in replicating this system synthetically. Hence, this serves as the basis for this research project. If the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway is successfully created, it will be a world first advancement in this area.

When our finished product is inspected, we want to obtain the minimum detection time and                         determine the credibility of the test results. Therefore, the relationship between the test                         result and time is made. The reaction \(\gamma\) and the pattern diagram ω3 are as                         follows:
$$R_TA\overset{K_{d1}}{\underset{K_{a1}}{\rightleftharpoons}}A+R_T$$
$$P+R_T\overset{K_{a2}}{\underset{K_{d2}}{\rightleftharpoons}}R_TP \tag{ γ }$$
Figure. ω3 Detection mode diagram
For the detection, we assume that the immobilized antigen is not easily detached outside of the                         reaction, and the amount of free antibody during the reaction is very small and remains                         substantially unchanged. Using this free antibody steady-state and kinetic knowledge, we derive                         the relationship (9):
\begin{equation}\begin{split}                         [R_TA]=&Cexp[-(K_{d2}+K_{a2}[R_T])t]\\&+\frac{K_{d2}(K_{d2}[R_TA_0]+[R_T])-K_{a2}([P_0]-[R_TA_0]+[R_T])[R_T]}{K_{d2}+K_{a2}[R_T]}                         \end{split}\tag{9}\end{equation}
equal meaning between \([R_TA_0]\) and \([R_TA]_0\).
By simplification of relation (9) and combining relation (2) inside the grayscale model content,                         relations (10) and (11) can be obtained:
$$[R_TA]=Cexp[xt]+y\tag{10}$$
$$Grayscale value=\frac{\sigma exp[xt]+Psi}{\beta+Cexp[xt]}\tag{11}$$
According to the relationship, We can obtain a detection curve expressed by the fixed                         antigen-antibody concentration. The relationship between high and low sensitivity detection                         curves can also be obtained (slide detection sensitivity and antigen-antibody positive                         correlation).And we can list Fig. 5 (a)(b)(c):

These two figures show the worm have obvious response to the blue light which could activate channelrhodopsin CoChR. the first video shows the worm which expressed Odr-10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry circuit could run in circle to follow the blue light. The other figure shows the same type worm which looks “asleep” ( because of no food supply) be “waked up” also by blue light(preference).
Fig 8B. Observe individual worms in microfluidic chip. This PDMS channel is designed to fix worms and observe them under stereoscope. 4 channels with decreasing diameter is used to fix worm. Other 4 narrow channels allow worms to move in a line constraint.
Alcohol addiction
We trained the worms engineered  with Odr-10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry to be “addicted to” alcohol successfully.
In this experiment, we added the alcohol on the NGM plate containing engineered worms. At the same time, blue light is turned on to stimulate worms continually.
After training for 2 hours, we washed the plate and recovered the worms in M9 buffer.
Then, we put the mixture contained worms and M9 buffer on one side of a new plate. After recovery of the worms, we added the alcohol on the other side of the same plate to see if the worms have the tropism to the alcohol.
The result shows that most of the worms transfected with Odr-10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry moved to the alcohol while the wild types could not (Fig.9).
What’s more, without the previous training by light, the worms transfected with Odr-10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry show no preference to alcohol, neither. (Fig.10).

We agreed, that the most active fraction contains 90 % laccase, which is commonly used in the literature. Since we applied the same protein amount of each fraction for the activity measurements, we made sure that the results really correspond to the amount of laccase. These are the most active fractions we have chosen with their contained laccase amount:
ECOL: Fraction 50% 2 with a laccase concentration of 63,9 µg mL-1.
BPUL: Fraction 50% 2 with a laccase concentration of 25,1 µg mL-1.
BHAL: Fraction  5% 3 with a laccase concentration of 10,9 µg mL-1.
TTHL: The best fraction of our TTHL laccase was fraction 50% 1 with a laccase concentration of 4,03 µg mL-1. In regard to Team Immobilization and Team Substrate Analysis we had to reach a higher amount of TTHL laccase. So we thought of combining two fractions. We chose the second best fraction of TTHL, which is 5% 3. To calculate the amount of contained laccase we had to compare the activity and reconsidered the slope. Since we stated the fraction with its highest activity as 90 % contained laccase, we calculated the amount of laccase regarding to that one. The following figure shows the slopes we got out of the activity from fraction 50% 1 and fraction 5% 3 (which is the second best). Accordingly to this, fraction 5% 3 contains 68,9% of laccase, which is 4,8 µg mL-1. In total, the composed fraction contains 4,4 µg mL-1.
Slope of the two most active fractions of purified TTHL laccase. By comparing them, the amount of contained laccase in the fractions had been calculated.

The simplest example with only E.coli cell
introduction
As the simplest example, a model of a flask with only E.coli cells inside will be shown. Only one reaction will be considered: the replication of E.coli. However, it is not trivial. MoDeL enables users to add such an auto-catalytic replication reaction easily and conveniently. The minimal database used for this model could be download here.
database construction
We only provide key points regarded with construction of this minimal database. To add the auto-catalytic reaction in the Reaction container, a species with only part E.coli is required. It has the simplest Chain-Node model format: only one chain with one part and no trees. The auto-catalytic reaction has one modifier and one product and they are both referred to E.coli defined in Species container. Since they are compartment-type species (species representing a compartment), attribute itself of compartmentLabel node in modifiers and products definitions should be set the same with label of the compartment they represent in the compartments definition. It ensures that the product and the modifier are the same, avoiding wrong mismatch of the product which is different with the modifier. Since number of E.coli cells will reach a stable level in a long time course, we use <math>k_{g}(1-C_{E.coli}/C_{max})C_{E.coli}V_{Flask}</math> as the reaction rate, where <math>k_{g}</math> is the growth rate of E.coli, <math>V_{Flask}</math> represents the size of E.coli, and <math>C_{E.coli}</math> and <math> C_{max}</math> are concentration of E.coli and its max concentration in the flask, respectively.

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

VIII Fluid and Solid model
    Because of our limited time, we have not constructed all characters and used it to investigate some interesting questions, but our model can help us study the behaviors of this system.
     Concretely, we designed a fluid model and a solid model, where the solid model has taken spatial effects on relationships between populations and individuals into consideration. In the fluid model, we use Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to describe the behavior of the amount of different characters and molecules. In the solid model, however, we use Cellular Automaton (CA) to mimic effects of spatial factors. (See more at Fluid Model and Solid Model )
     As is shown above, fluid model helped us a lot on experimental design. Besides, they can also be used to help us design our game---E.coli War! The game can be used to help us consider effects of some factors on population interactions. Besides, it can even help us realize the educational purpose of our project and make the public know more about synthetic biology!
IX E.coli War
     Our games are made on structure of html5.The videos below are two short videos of our Fluid E.coli War and Solid E.coli War.
     See more details on Fluid E.coli War and Solid E.coli War
     After we designed our game preliminarily, we visited Beijing Perfect World Network Technology Co., Ltd (Perfect World), one of the largest game company in China, to learn more about the design of a game. The useful advice from the experts help us a lot in improving our E.coli War, making it more fun and easier for kids to play.
    See more details at Visiting Perfect World
    Afterwards, when children played this game during our exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum (CSTM), they found many interesting results which can even promote our understanding of this system. (Fig.10) (See more details at Exhibition at National Museum and Game Discovery ) Furthermore, this can also be helpful for our further research design.
Fig.10 Children are playing E.coli War in CSTM!
X Summary
     In conclusion, we designed a very general system to study many complex relationships and also a useful model to describe this system. In the future, it will be convenient to investigate some interesting questions with regard to relationships between populations and individuals by using this system.
     What’s more, we designed two interesting games--- Fluid E.coli War and Solid E.coli War to make the public more interested in synthetic biology. Conversely, their finding of many interesting results and disciplines in the games"

Birgit Degner
Judge
Ordinary Jurisdiction North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany
We contacted the experienced judges Birgit Degner and Dr. Jens Degner to get their legal opinion on our research project. They were not able to give us a legal assessment, because our project is far too complex and based on too many different fields of law to find a quick answer. Instead, they explained to us their personal opinion.
From their point of view, scientific research should be as unrestricted as possible. This also implies that a crucial role is assigned to the scientist: Every scientist has to prove if his or her research is compatible with their own moral values and has to make sure that all necessary safety measures and precautions are taken. Scientists are connected to and responsible for their research, but in the end the consumers can and should use their market power to give a feedback if the findings are compatible with general ethical values. In addition, ethical review committees can lead discussions, clarify research topics, and help to determine moral values.
They concluded that science should not be limited unnecessarily, because the ultimate goal of research is the improvement of the general quality of life for every human.

Directed evolution experiments lead to altered DNA sequences and proteins could evolve towards toxic and hazardous sequences. Before evolving sequences in our PACE and PREDCEL experiments, we wanted to confirm that no hazardous products can evolve. We had the idea to establish a SafetyNet, which screens the input sequence for potential hazardous outcomes. Therefore, each sequence that was used in our experiments was first compared to a predefined list with dangerous sequences using our SafetyNet. We discussed with Dr. Janausch, which protein classes should be included in the list of hazardous sequences and he recommended us to test the relation to oncogenes too. Therefore, we edited our SafetyNet to integrate oncogenes as potentially harmful sequences. We discussed the different safety aspects and Dr. Janausch concluded, that PACE and PREDCEL experiments should be save when tested in our SafetyNet first and discussed with our supervisors before starting the experiment. Indeed, he recommended that we integrate our SafetyNet to our toolbox guide , since every researcher that wants to evolve proteins using PACE or PREDCEL should reflect on the outcome of their research.

Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," with the selection of a decent route and to find the correct mean of transportation. After a couple of hours, we thought that we were ready to go, but man what did we know? So, our chosen route was to fly to Brussels from Hamburg and take a bus from there to elft, it should be cheap and fast and nice.
Well the flight was; however, we could not take the bus we wanted had chosen and had to go by train to Delft. Next, we found out that the travelling system in Belgium and the Netherlands differs majorly from German standards and that we had to pay waaaay more than expected. Well at least for me hence I am old, at least that is what I was told. But the weather was nice and we arrived in Delft ahead of schedule.
Shortly after our arrival we decided to explore the beautiful city in an attempt to find our hostel. First, we wandered around somewhat clueless, showing of our map reading skills, but then changed to more modern methods of navigation. Which was a good idea because we were actually lost beforehand. We could find our hostel quite easily utilizing google maps, but it was still closed so we decided to have lunch and contact our host team in Delft to meet them in advance of the planned dinner in the evening. After getting lost again, or let’s say some more exploring, we could find the TU Delft and meet the iGEM team of Delft. They briefly introduced us into their campus and we had an interesting talk about each other projects. As it turned out, we were trying to tackle the same problem from different angles, Delft wanted to invent a crispr-casper utilizing detection method for multiresistant bacteria that then could be utilized in stockbreeding. And we tried to invent the cure. As we split up again, our hostel had finally open and we met more iGEMers as it turned out the whole hostel was almost exclusively booked by other iGEM teams.
In the evening we went to the royal palace a nice Asian restaurant to meet with all our fellow iGEMers that arrived a day earlier. On a side note, I misread the email informing us about the restaurant and genuinely thought that we were invited into THE royal palace in Delft, well we did not meet any royals, but we had a royal feast!
On the next morning the Meetup started, after grabbing our welcome bags and introducing ourselves to a couple of more teams, Fiona, Delfts team leader introduced the schedule and the scientific talks started. I really enjoyed the first talk"

Our project also required auxotrophic markers for selective screening of our transformants, so we looked for a ura3 and leu2 auxotroph. A paper by Verbeke et. al described the JMY2394 strain, which satisfied our parameters, but was unavailable to us. We searched for a similar strain and settled on FKP393 by recommendation of Erin Bredeweg of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. FKP393 is a NHEJ mutant derived by transformation of Po1g with the specifications matA; leu2-270; ura3; xpr2-332; axp-2; ku70::hph+.
This strain includes all of our specifications but lacks sufficient annotation. We were informed by Cory Schwartz of UC Riverside that this was not an issue, because the parent strain is the well-studied W29, which we can use for genome analysis. We received the FKP393 strain as a gift from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center at the Kansas State University.
PROGESTERONE METABOLIC PATHWAY
Figure 1: Simplified version of the reference pathway for progesterone biosynthesis in mammals, from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).
Due to our extensive research on world issues, we chose to create a contraceptive in yeast: progesterone. Progesterone is a hormone produced by all mammals (men and women) naturally, and aids in many functions regulating fertility, menstruation/ovulation, pregnancy, and normal body function. ""Progesterone prepares the endometrium for the potential of pregnancy after ovulation. It triggers the lining to thicken to accept a fertilized egg. It also prohibits the muscle contractions in the uterus that would cause the body to reject an egg. While the body is producing high levels of progesterone, the body will not ovulate"" (hormone.org). Progestins are routinely used in contraceptive pills, vaginal rings, and IUDs. Progestins are a chemically formulated version of progesterone (CITATION!!!), that acts on progesterone receptors to increase cervical mucus and suppress ovulation to prevent pregnancy. They are not naturally made by the human body, and therefore have many ill effect on the women who take them (CITATION!!!!!). Progesterone is the molecule naturally made by the body, which when taken in excess, can perform the same function as progestins: preventing pregnancy. Progesterone can do so without the harmful effects that progestins cause (C"

Improvement Part: (BBa_K2599016)
     The improvement part that NCTU_Formosa 2018 modified contains the IPTG induced pT7 (BBa_I712074) , strong ribosome binding site (BBa_B0034) , Sf1a, GS linker (BBa_K1974030) , snowdrop lectin (BBa_K1974020) and the 6X His-Tag (BBa_K1223006) .
Introduction of μ-segestritoxin-Sf1a and Lectin
     μ-segestritoxin-Sf1a is kind of insecticidal toxin, contains three disulfide bonds. It will inhibits insect voltage-gated sodium channels by blocking the channel pore. Lectin is carbohydrate-binding proteins, and it is able to bind soluble ectracellular and intercellular glycoproteins.

     We utilized Rosetta-gami DE3 strain to express both the previous part and improvement part. The proteins that was produced was then coated on leaves respectively and each leaf was placed inside containers with same number of larvae. The leaf remaining area was observed as shown as below.
Comparison of Plant Protecting Effect between Different Linker Design
Table 1: Comparison of plant protecting effects by changing the linker between protein Sf1a and lectin. (I): link proteins with GS linker (improvement part BBa_K2599016 ); (II): link proteins with AAA linker (previous part BBa_K1974022); (III): negative control group of Rosetta gami DE3 solution. After feeding for 7 hours, percentage of remained leaf area : improvement part > previous part > negative control.
Figure 1: Percentage of remained leaf area of improvement part, previous part and negative control.
     In conclusion, through comparison, improvement group (I) is more effective in protecting leaf from larvae consuming than previous part (II) and inferred that elongation of linker can enhance the function of fusion proteins and provide a proper folding of proteins.

Population modelling
A simple view of our bacteria's possible states. Note how when the sequestering spore state is reached, the cell cannot germinate back to being a vegetative cell.
One of the models which we have produced is one concerning the population numbers of our bacteria. It looks at how our additions to the DNA may affect the growth of the bacterial population.
This model has been implemented in the Java programming language, and connects to other models which we have written in CellML, using the JSim application. Due to the design of the program, the team has enlisted the help of some very powerful computers, and final iteration of the program has been to use distributed computing and the ""Amazon Cloud"" to extend the size of the bacterial population.
Distributed Computing
Distributed Computing (also known as Cloud or Grid computing) is the use of multiple computing processors, which can be distributed around the world, to accomplish a single given task. The processes on the machines may also communicate with each other, instead of simply acting independently.
Due to early versions of our bacterial population simulation program using a lot of CPU time and RAM, we attempted to think of ways to be able to speed up the processing times and expand the simulation. Although these early simulations were fairly small scale, each bacterial cell runs as an independent thread, so every system that we ran it on began to slow down dramatically.

ROSETTA protocol
ROSETTA combines information about the ligand and constrains to find possible hydrogen bonding partners and propose the shape        of the scaffold within the set constraints.
5. Enzyme design
ROSETTA protocol
An algorithm uses the information from the previous step and information on the ligand to simulate the mutation process and        generate sequences for optimized scaffolds with corresponding scores as measures of fit.

Introduction
Overview
Figure 2: Tyrosyl-tRNA-synthetase
3D-structure based on ""1J1U"" from PDB edited with pymol
As part of our iGEM project, we faced the challenge of adapting the tRNA synthetase      to non-canonical amino acids. For this purpose, we modeled possible candidates for synthetases as an      alternative to carrying out a positive-negative selection according to (Liu et al., 2007) in the laboratory.      Due to the rapid development in the field of protein and molecular structure analysis, there has been an      increase in the availability of molecular 3D structure data. These data are organized in publicly available      databases which provide a foundation for the modeling and simulation of chemical-biological processes in bioinformatics.      As our ncAA has been synthetized in our lab, no such comprehensive information is available, yet.      However, information of similarly structured amino acids can potentially serve as a basis for our modeling.      Specifically, we focused on simulation to      design an aaRS for the new ncAA CBT-Asparagine .
Method
We used the open-source software ""ROSETTA"" for the main part of our modeling project, which was introduced at the University of Washington by David Baker in 1997        (Simon et al.,1997), initially in the context of protein structure prediction. ROSETTA has grown through the addition of numerous modules and is currently widely used in research. In our application, we focus on the Rosetta module called the ""Rosetta Enzyme Design Protocol""

Hotel search and Sponsors Continuation
Today:
All morning (pretty much) was spent helping with moving the computers in the Bio Inf. Lab. Here’s the real deal:
I followed up with the Company 1 and they replied back saying that they’re unable to help. Also Company 3 and Company 3 have declined our offer.
On a more positive note, I found GSK (GlaxoSmithKline) which is a  research-based pharmaceutical company devoted to developing innovative medicines and vaccines. I only found their phone number so I’ll give them a shout tomorrow and follow up with 4 other companies.
I also finished writing and editing my email to Dr. Jay Ingram (Discovery Channel Co-host). Fahd, Jamie and Jeremy double checked it so I’ve attached it in this email. Dr. Jacob sent me Dr. Ingram’s wife’s email. They both know Dr. Jacob so I’ve mentioned him in the letter.
I also searched up a few hotels which are not too far from MIT and have decent prices. I spoke to Thane about it and we were thinking of getting <centre>
- And since the hotels are close, we could walk to MIT to avoid transportation costs. So far, we’ve managed to raise $3000 cash (excluding the lab reagents and equipment from sponsors)…so this will probably fly 6 students to Boston and back. This money came from first and second bake sales, and cash donations from sponsors. Accommodations will cost the 15 students  ± $1100 for the 4 nights. I haven't looked at rooms for facilitators so I can’t tell you much about it now.  In our next bake sale, our goal is to make around $500. :D The marketing team is trying their best to arrange meetings and getting sponsors. </centre>
Tomorrow, I’ll call the other companies and send an email to Shawn Abbott (one of the Dragons) to set up a meeting with him to discuss iGEM sponsorship and if he can help us/give us advice. Once I set up a meeting, Jeremy and I plan to go visit him. Right now, the marketing team is reviewing the rough draft of the July newsletter which we hope to finalize by Friday and send out to companies early next week.

Unlike NhaA, the activity of NhaB shows no dependence on pH in the range 6.4~8.3. The affinity of NhaB to Na+ (Km = 40-70μM) is higher than that of NhaA[9].
○ Design
The gene circuits of the alkali-resistance device is shown in Fig.3. This device consists of two genes and two promoters. The strong constitutive promoter J23119 is used in our gene circuits. In order to resist alkaline stress, we chose two of Nha sodium ion-proton antiporter proteins referred before to construct device one. NhaA could make sure E.coli’s survival under alkaline pH. NhaB regulates intracellular pH when NhaA is limited. But NhaB is weakly pH-dependent, so a alkali-induced promoter J23119 is necessary. The construction has been finished .
Fig.3 The gene circuits of alkali resistence device.
○ Results
Firstly, we cloned the genes NhaA and NhaB from the genome of Escherichia coli str. K-12. Then, the standard part NhaA (BBa_K1675000) and NhaB (BBa_K1675001) were assembled together. The agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of NhaA and NhaB is shown in Fig.4. The construction results of JBA(J23119+B0034+NhaA) and JBB(J23119+B0034+NhaB) are shown in Fig.5 and Fig.6.
Finally, the standard part JBA+JBB was successfully constructed through 3A assembly. The agarose gel electrophoresis analysis is shown in Fig.7.
After finishing the construction of the standard parts, we measured the OD600 and the intensity of proteins expressed to test the efficacy of our functional genes. The genes NhaA and NhaB encode membrane proteins, we inserted these two genes into plasmid pET28a separately and transformed them into BL21(DE3). The results weren’t satisfying. To solve this, we transformed the recombinant plasmid into E.coli C41 and C43 [10]. Luckily, the overexpression was successful this time. The result of SDS-PAGE is shown in Fig.8.

GlmS is the B12-binding subunit of glutamate mutase (Glm) from Clostridium cochlearium. The mechanism by which the enzyme uses adenosylcobalamin is highly similar to methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase. Glm catalyzes the reversible rearrangement of (2S)-glutamate to (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartate (Leutbecher et al.., 1992). This reaction is the first step in the fermentation of glutamate to acetate and butyrate (Buckel et al.., 1974). The assembly of the active enzyme, an α2β2 tetramer, is mediated by coenzyme B12. While GlmS as the smaller subunit (14.8 kDa) binds B12, the larger subunit GlmE harbors the substrate binding site (Zelder et al.., 1994). Crystal structures of the whole enzyme in complex with its substrate and adenosylcobalamin (PDB 1I9C; Gruber et al.., 2001) as well as an NMR structure of only GlmS (PDB 1B1A; Hoffmann et al.., 1999) are available.
BtuF is the periplasmic binding protein for the Vitamin B12 transporter BtuCD from E. coli (Cadieux et al.., 2002). While some bacteria and archaea are capable of its synthesis, E. coli belongs to the majority of prokaryotes that contain transport systems to import B12 (Warren et al.., 2002). Its transmembrane transport is achieved by the Btu (B twelve uptake) system composed of BtuB, an outer membrane TonB-dependent transporter (Cadieux et al.., 1999), and the ABC transporter BtuCDF, which is located in the inner membrane. While BtuC and BtuD compose respectively the trans-membrane domain and the ABC (Bassford et al.., 1977), BtuF is the periplasmic binding protein. It has a size of 30.19 kDa and is composed of two globular domains, between which Vitamin B12 is bound, linked by a rigid interdomain α-helix (Karpowich et al.."

Figure 3 displays the computed mismatch tolerance for single mismatches, two consecutive mismatches and three consecutive mismatches and shows that single mismatches are not tolerated in the central seed region, two consecutive mismatches are tolerated at the ends of the spacer and three consecutive mismatches are only tolerated at the 3’ end of the spacer.
Figure 3: Cas13a tolerance for mismatches. Cas13a tolerance for mismatches ($\Delta C=0.25$,$\Delta I=2.5$). The cleavage probability relative to the on-target is plotted for different types of mismatches. Single mismatches (blue line) are not tolerated well in the central seed region. Two consecutive mismatches (orange line) can be tolerated in the beginning and end of the target. Three consecutive mismatches (green line) are only allowed at the target’s 5’ end.
As can be seen from Figure 3, a maximum of approximately 3 mismatches is tolerated by Cas13a. We can use a binomial distribution to compute the probability that a random target and spacer have at most 3 mismatches (thus having 25 or more matches) is low:
$$ P_{\textrm{at least 25 matches}} = \sum ^{28}_{m=25} \frac{28!}{(28-m)!m!} \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^m \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{28-m} = 1.276 \cdot 10^{-12} \tag{7}$$
Having found suitable model parameters for $\Delta C$ and $\Delta I$, we can now employ the model to compute the cleavage probability for different guides and plasmids (or even entire genomes). We started by investigating the relative cleavage probability of our crRNA 1-5 on the tetracycline-resistance conferring (TcR) plasmid that the crRNAs were designed target (Figure 4). We were able to confirm that crRNAs 1-4 target the plasmid at the desired position. However, we also found that crRNA 5 did not meet the design requirements of the PFS: the position 3’ to the target sequence was a G. This finding prevented us from wasting time on testing crRNA 5 in the lab. This is also the reason why we will not consider crRNA 5 in the"

Mentoring Program
As an over graduate team, it's our pleasure that we experienced more and received more knowledge which provide us the abilities to help high school teams. So in order to make it into place and meaningful, we checked the registry information in 2015 iGEM official website and found Shenzhen_SFLS team(Shenzhen Foreign Lauguages School, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China) in which team the members are also studying in Guangdong province. And then we contacted them and organized this program between us in order to help them.
This program included six parts which can also be called six mentoring courses, including iGEM program introduction, synthetic biology knowledge sharing and experiment skill mentoring, bio-brick standardization, modeling, human practice design guidance, and web building.
The first course was about program introduction. During the first course we gave a systematic introduction about iGEM competition to Shenzhen_SFLS, including its history, development, characteristics, standard, and et. al., which helped them find some new sights to understand iGEM and form a systematic ideal about iGEM competition.
The second course was about knowledge sharing. Since we are all working hard on finishing the assignments of iGEM competition, during this period, there is nothing more important than improving our related abilities. Then we gave a lesson about synthetic biology and experiment skill mentoring which was aimed at enriching their knowledge on synthetic biology and helping them improving their experiment skill.
The third and fourth courses were about bio-brick standardization and modeling. During those courses, we gave them advice on all the important points that we thought they need to pay more attention to, the necessary skills they'd better know, and the problems they might meet during the competition. In the modeling course, one of our team members majors in bioinformatics. During the class, she introduced several software related to molecular simulation, and teach them how to use these software. In the process of preparing iGEM, we have been in touch with each other in the molecular simulation"

Construction of a Glucose Insensitive Inducible Promoter in E. coli
Although the constitutively expressed Escherichia coli sigma 70 promoter (J23101) has proven to be adequate for expression of our fatty acid and alcohol genes, the hope was to construct a new promoter for the iGEM registry that was inducible, but not sensitive to glucose or other sugars. The inducible promoter, trc, was a promising option.  This promoter originated as a fusion between the trp (tryptophan inducible/glucose repressible) promoter and the lac (lactose inducible/glucose repressible) promoter (De Boer et. al. 1983). The trc fusion promoter was engineered in such a way that gene expression can be up-regulated in the presence of IPTG, but expression is unaffected by fluctuations in glucose concentration.
In spite of the encouraging research, trc has proven to be a complicated promoter to work with in the lab. With only 62 base pairs it is hard obtain definitive visual results and manipulate such small fragments between plasmids, cells, etc.  There has been little success with this small fragment. Many techniques have aimed at transforming trc into pSB1C3 iGEM plasmid for submission to the registry for use by future teams and placing the promoter in front of both genes in various plasmids including pUC vectors, TOPO vectors, as well as iGEM vectors. Different techniques, enzymes, and protocols were used without success. One of the biggest challenges when using trc is that agarose gel electrophoresis is of little use for quick verification. The 100bp (promoter plus iGEM prefix and suffix) shift is nearly impossible to visualize on the gel and sequencing is often needed to confirm results which takes a few days to obtain results.  Despite the frustration that we have had using the trc promoter, we think it would be a valuable part for the registry.

The aim of this project is to engineer a genetic bistable switch that produces two different, mutually exclusive outputs when given two different inputs. The switch is based on the repressor-anti-repressor system of the Salmonella phages Gifsy1 and Gifsy2 and the λ-phage anti-termination system. The latest induced output will remain stable through generations, even once the input ceases, due to the phage regulatory systems.
We present the framework for this development and we characterize the regulatory mechanisms by using fluorescent proteins as outputs. The dynamics of the system will be modeled and we will also attempt to characterize and submit the promoters, repressors and anti-repressors from the Salmonella phages, as well as the two anti-terminator proteins from the lambda phage, as BioBricks.
There are multiple potential applications for a biological ""switch"" like ours in the world of biotechnology i.e. within the medical and environmental field.

Recep Erdem Ahan: Hi all, I am Recep erdem Ahan team captain of ITU MOBGAM Team. I was born and continue to live in Istanbul. It is a lovely city to live if you can ignore some negative parts. After I watched X-man, Heroes, Fantastic Four , glowing rabbits and stuff like that, I am impressed by science of genetics and molecular biology. Now, I am last year student in Molecular Biology and Genetics Deparment in ITU. Moreover, I do double major in Chemistry. I met iGEM and synthetic biology two years ago. After doing couple researches and reading articles , I had thought that it has a potential to human life better. My searches interests are Omics Sciences, Bio- and Nano- technology, System Biology, Cancer and of course Synthetic biology. I want to pursue my carrer in academic way (at least I want to take PhD.) Besides all, in my free time I would like to watch movies, hang out with"

The video seen above display a considerably slowed droplet generation procedure. The reaction mixture comes from the side and stable droplets are made by cutting the water phase with inert carrier oil. The collected emulsion is incubated off chip at 30oC for 6 hours. 10 µL of the emulsion is stained with SyBr green to and imaged at 488 nM to validate the amplification of DNA inside droplets in a digital PCR manner. ADisplays the emulsion off the chip and the fluorescence of droplets stained with Sybr Green. The occupancy of droplet is kept at 1 template per 10 droplets (Poisson distribution lambda = 0.1) in order to remove the chance of partitioning two templates in a single droplet.
Figure 11. Droplet MDA reaction product comparison to analogous in bulk reaction product. Circulized DNA templates were encapsulated into 50 pL droplets together with MDA reaction reagents (Droplet). The same reaction reagent concentrations were used for 20 µL in bulk MDA reaction (In bulk). Both of the reaction were incubated 30oC for 6 hours. The amplified DNA was analyzed using agarose gel.
Additionally, amplified DNA product is analysed in agarose gel. As seen from the figure 11, the set reaction conditions work perfectly with droplet MDA reaction. The droplet reaction produces a much sharper and cleaner DNA band as opposed to in bulk reaction smeared DNA. These results arise from the fact that each single DNA template is compartmentalized in separate water in oil droplets (Rhee et al., 2016). therefore there is no template switching between different templates and each droplet has a fixed population of reagents for the amplification. Based on these results it could be concluded that single DNA template is amplified in picoliter droplets and produces cleaner DNA fragments compared to analogous in bulk reaction.

Droplet MDA reaction with standard cytidines or 5-methylcytdines amplified product agarose gel analysis.MDA reaction were performed with standard (dCTP) and 5-methylated (5mC) cytidines in 50 pL droplets.

(This is important because the beads begin to settle to the bottom of the wells within about 10                           minutes,                           which will affect the measurements.) Take care to mix gently and avoid creating bubbles on the surface of the liquid.
Measure Abs600 of all samples in instrument
Fluorescence standard curve - Fluorescein protocol
Plate readers report fluorescence values in arbitrary units that vary widely from instrument to instrument. Therefore absolute fluorescence values cannot be directly compared from one instrument to another. In order to compare                       fluorescence output of test devices between teams, it is necessary for each team to create a standard fluorescence curve. Although distribution of a known concentration of GFP protein would be an ideal way to standardize the                       amount                       of GFP fluorescence in our E. coli cells, the stability of the protein and the high cost of its purification are problematic. We therefore use the small molecule fluorescein, which has similar excitation and emission properties                       to                       GFP, but is cost-effective and easy to prepare.

Tsinghua,2011,Team:Tsinghua-A#Safety#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," it’s not as easy when the amount of signals increases, for that molecules should maintain orthogonality.
In our further research, we try to utilize microfluidical chips, which aim at separating signals and transmitting information through physical isolation, to achieve the independence of biological reactions.
Application
Oscillation can be always seen in biology, so we want to build genetic machines with an oscillation, and hope these machines are able to deal with the biorhythms. In the follow paragraph we talk about the ideas of their applications on medical treatment.
Nowadays a lot of people are suffering from insomnia, a sleeping difficulty sometimes caused by hormonal disorders. Here, we hope to use an oscillator, which can generate a signal follow the cycle of day and night. With an oscillator like this, we can build a system implanted which can cooperate with our body to regulate the hormone secretion to a proper way.
Another interesting example is about medicine taking. When catch a cold, we find it a trouble to take medicines follow the doctor’s prescription such as “taking it every 8 hours and three times a day”, sometimes we even forget it. Suppose the drug is carried in a bio-oscillator. Once we take it in, the drug inside the oscillator will be released every 8 hours automatically in our body. It will be amazing!

Nowadays, the environment is becoming increasingly deeply affected by high levels of pollution, chemical processes being one of the main sources of pollution. Since synthetic biology only uses renewable resources, it seems to be a promising way to produce all kinds of molecules. However, for an interesting application of synthetic biology, a large amount of sugar would be necessary to feed all the microorganisms used to produce a large range of chemicals such as biofuels and drugs. In fact, more than 145 million tons of sugar are produced every year in about 120 countries [1] to fulfill the various needs in food or biofuel industries for example. Around 60% to 70% of the sugar currently produced comes from sugar canes with the remainder coming from sugar beets[1]. Like all massive monocultures, massive production of sugar has dramatic impacts on the environment (deforestation, loss of biodiversity, soil and water pollution)[1][2][3]. How much would this need of sugar increase if all the cars used biofuels? Would there be enough lands for culture? What will be the impact on the environment?
To meet the considerably growing needs of sugar for synthetic biology while being respectful for the environment, we needed to find sustainable alternatives to the use of arable lands for sugar production. Given the important marine surface on Earth, producing sugar in a marine environment seemed to be a relevant solution. This could bring back synthetic biology to its contribution to sustainable development. To produce sugar in a marine environment we chose a green microalgae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, aka, Claude.

USTC,2009,Team:USTC Software#When_-_-_TEXT.html,"2:
The imprecision is largely caused by Local minimum and initial value dependence. Similar as above, these are also open problems. For we adopt Monte Carlo sampling in our algorithm, the results may vary time to time due to the randomness nature. It also remains a problem for us to solve in the future. We will make effort to modify existing algorithms or even create new one.
Output
Q1:
Is it better to export a graph following SBGN standard?
A1:
Currently, we are working on it. The basic drag-drop function has been accomplished in our software of current version. In the near future, we will complete this function.
It is much convenient for users to locate and combine substances/biobricks with this easy-drag interface.
Output of time course plot.
Q2:
Can you export the robustness analysis along with the SBML model in one sheet?
A2:
It is not easy to implement such information in a single SBML file. In current version, we can realize a robustness analysis by importing a SBML file which two sheets will be generated. In next version, we will try to incorporate such information to a general form. With such change, there is also a need to modify libSBML as a result.
Database
Q1:
Does the database contain too little biobricks?
A1:
Since the concept of standard components that contain enough information is relatively new in synthetic biology. The acquisition to the information is rather difficult for us because we have to learn each bricks in detail. In the current version, we construct one that is suitable for our illustrative examples as well as our USTC wet team’s new submitted biobricks. A relatively “full” database needs collaborations of different teams who should submit information of the same format. Otherwise, we propose a developing standard for such a design.
Q2:
Is the search algorithm fast enough for the database?
A2:
For lager database, searching algorithm is quite important. It is also an open problem in computer science. To our extent, we seek collaborations inside or outside our campus.
Q3:
How do you manage these data efficiently?
A3:
To manage a large database, manage software is needed. Luckily, Berkeley tools team are focusing on this problem. We are expecting cooperation with them.
Q4:
Is it too difficult to obtain the kinetic parameters and reaction type?
A4:
Firstly, in the next version, we will make a web server that makes our database open access. Then users can freely update the database by submitting the data in a general form.
Secondly, we can also apply a"

4. General Guidelines:
Template: Use of high quality, purified DNA templates greatly enhances the success of PCR. Recommended amounts of DNA template for a 50 µl reaction are as follows:
DNA AMOUNT
DNA Genomic 1 ng–1 µg Plasmid or Viral 1 pg–1 ng
5. Primers:
Oligonucleotide primers are generally 20–40 nucleotides in length and ideally have a GC content of 40–60%. Computer programs such as Primer3 can be used to design or analyze primers. The best results are typically seen when using each primer at a final concentration of 0.5 µM in the reaction.

Figure 1: Draft of the BaKillus Nasal Spray
The human nasal mucosa is the main ecological niche of Staphylococcus aureus residing in human beings. S. aureus adheres to the mucosa and the epithelia of the anterior nares [1] . The goal of BaKillus is to decolonize and kill S. aureus within the interior nasal areas. Other methods of decolonizing S. aureus have already shown to reduce the risk of infections with S. aureus subsequently to open surgery [2] [3] . Nonetheless those current preventive measures include efforts towards screening patients that will receive surgery in order to avoid overusage of antibiotics. BaKillus resembles an alternative possibility as it will only produce antibiotics in response to the actual presence of Staphylococcus aureus. It is therefore possible to apply BaKillus as an preventive application without need for screening and unneccessary usage of antibiotics at the same time.
To maintain a cheap and easy-to-use application we decided to create a specialized nasal spray. The general functionality is the same as for any common nasal spray for medical applications, so no pre-ex"

  About Kompala's cybernetic model
Model 2: Wong, Keasling et al model
Models such as Zhao Lu et al [3] or Keasling et al [4] cover in more detail lactose transport into the cell and the dynamics of the lac operon.
Zhao Lu et al takes into account several factors that are not included in Kompala's model, such as:
The effects of catabolite repression and inducer exclusion [3-4]( see chemical induction for further explanation).
The ""lag effect"" seen when we switch from glucose to a secondary source. In the case of lactose, this delay is caused by the production of permeases and b-galactosidase.
  About Zhao Lu's model
The Zhao Lu et al model does not take into account receptor binding interactions such as:
Interaction of the lac repressor protein and the sigma factor with RNA polymerase involved in transcription initiation.
Binding of CRP-cAMP
Operator interactions of the lac repressor and allolactose.
These are included in the Keasling model, and hence the reason why we have implemented it [4].
For more details of the metabolic network of the lac operon:
Figure 2 from Zhao Lu et al [3]
In the autoinduction medium, we have developed experiments where we have used secondary carbon sources such as: xylose, galactose, mannose... (See autoinduction experiments ). We restrained from using lactose because it also induces the protein production module before time, although the other secondary carbon sources are related to lactose in structure.Hence, we believe that the dynamics of the lac operon have an important part to play in the bacterial metabolism in the presence of two secondary carbon sources.

Followed by ideas discussion with Tom, to get some feedback on                      our original ideas and what expertise/equipment may be available to us. Then Nick Aldred, a marine biologist/engineer, talked to us about boat anti-fouling coatings. Finally we had a                      talk from Vas Andriotis who focused on plant biology (corn yield). Finishing with another ideas session to refine our ideas.
Day 5 - 13/06/18
The day began with a talk from Martyn Dade-Robertson who discussed the use of biotechnology in architecture and his research                      into pressure sensing E.coli. In the afternoon Harold Freemann led a discussion around the use of mathematical modelling and its                       uses in synthetic biology. Finally Alice Banks and Colette Whitfield covered current topics in synthetic biology and the                        equipment available to us in the laboratory.
Day 6 - 14/06/18
This was our first day in which we were given freedom to explore our ideas and gain a necessary background surrounding                      the topics in order to refine into 6 ideas that will be pitched to research supervisors and the guest speakers who have                      given presentations since the project began.
Day 7 - 15/06/18
We continued to explore our ideas for the majority of the day, narrowing our proposals down from ten ideas to six.                      We worked more as individuals, researching specific aspects of the proposals.
Day 8 - 18/06/18
Today was more orientated around the ethical implications of Synthetic Biology. We started with a discussion with                      Ilke Turkendag, a lecturer in Law Innovation & Society. We discussed our six proposals and outlined possible ethical/legal                      issues which could arise. This was followed by an interesting talk from Simon Woods and Ken Taylor, they spoke about potential                      stakeholders and how we could go about talking/communicating with them. They also took each of our ideas and looked at the                      potential impacts our projects could have on the wider public. We then finished the day preparing for our six pitches for Tuesday.      The Opentrons OT-2 robot, which the Newcastle iGEM team won, was also delivered today1.
Day 9 - 19/06/18
We pitched the 6 ideas that we selected to the instructors and masters students. After receiving feedback and suggestions                      from the advisory team we narrowed it down to 2 ideas to be taken forward. Further, we constructed a template for both idea                       presentations and allocated team members to each idea.

This summer vacation, our five teammates of our team went to National Chiao Tung University in Taipei to take part in 215 iGEM Asian Conference.
In Taipei, we shared our idea and experience of experiments and mathematic modeling with other igmers. There were so many enthusiastic students from famous university. In the conference, we talked about projects, some problem we ever faced. Not only did we talk projects and science, but also we made precious friends.

The three university Consortium of Central China is consist of, HUST-China、WHU-China and HZAU-China. In the meeting we discussed project，teams and other problems we met. Beside We plan to build a shared platform, which contains the information of synthetic biology, the laboratory equipment of wetlab and so on.
We are also considering to expanding the breadth of communication. We choose iGEM, we love biology, why don’t we talking about more biology problems not just for a competition? it must be cool, and we are trying to do that !
3.2015 CCIC PEKING
We are invited to participate in the second CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer's Committee) hosted by Peking on August 14th-15th. In the presentation time, many teams show their project and ideas about H&P、wiki and so on. In tea break time, we communicated actively with other teams about our project, and received many good advice and suggestions.
By the way, the CCiC means “Central China iGEMers Consortium”. It’s origin from the 1st Central China iGEMers' meet up hosted by our team in 2014. This year, There is a novel idea occur in our mind: How about make the CCiC to be a iGEMer’s Olympics in China? That’s means the host team will change in each Olympic game. Isn’t it interesting？
CCiC aims to deepen the connections between iGEM teams and to provide a collaboration platform for iGEMers to explore the frontiers of synthetic biology. We leant a lot from that and met many new friends while enjoying the meetup time. In this way we think iGEM teams will communicate with each other closely and the influence of iGEM will spread in a wider range in China.

This week, we began to think about our thesis again. Whew. A few of us began reorganizing the information we needed to write about to make the paper more clear. We also had a meeting at the end of the week about expectations for writing during the coming week.
After finding out about the IRB, we applied for exemption. We then found out that we would have to revise our questionnaires. Appropriate changes were made and the application was submitted again (this happens several more times in the next week or so).
Some of us considered different design and selectable marker options to test integration of genes into the yeast genome. We learned that one of our steps lacks a reliable selectable marker test, but that replica plating may provide sufficient levels of certainty.
Our several lab groups worked tirelessly to make more media, to check for deletions in plasmids, and to design primers that actually work.
Now that we have lox-URA3-lox, linearized pUC19, and amplified homologous arms, we are able to begin Gibson Assembly. We did two gibsons this week. The first Gibson includes the parts mentioned above and the second is our linearized pXRL2 along with several gene fragments: ADR, FDX, Delta7H, p450SCC, and 3BH. After combining the neccessary components with the Gibson Master Mix, we put it in the PCR machine for an hour and then stored it on ice. The following day we inoculated the gibson products on high copy LB-AMP plates. The pUC19 plate grew normally but the pXRL2 plate lawned.
We then picked colonies from the pUC19 plate and transformed it in liquid cultures. We then performed colony PCR to check if our Gibson assembly was successful. It likely did not work. The gel showed very bright bands in the wrong areas but a faint band where our desired product would be. With this information, we made streak plates of the potential successful colonies in hopes to isolate what we believe to be our desired gibson product and threw the rest of the cultures out.
Once we created a gel with clear, distinct bands for DNA extraction, we tried using the Bioline Isolate II PCR and Gel kit to retrieve the DNA from our agarose gel. At first we used a different binding buffer than the one provided in the kit, but the final extraction had a high salt concentration that made the DNA unusable as a PCR template. We tried using the Zymogen clean and concentrator kit to further purify the DNA, but"

We also finally received IRB exemption for our questionnaires! This means we can now officially use our questionnaires to gather information about the women who may not have adequate access to modern contraceptives.
Once the full length genes came, we tried amplifying the genes using the forward and the reverse primers from the OE PCR reactions. We used thermocycler settings that had worked for past reactions but still saw multiple bands for some of the genes, suggesting that the primers had non-specific annealing at those annealing temperatures. We started making touch-down thermocycler settings for each gene to determine what annealing temperature would yield the least amount of non-specific bands.
After outgrowth in liquid selective media, our cultures repeatedly failed to show colonies when plated on selective media. In order to address this, we redid our protocol for making chemicompetent Y. lipolytica cells after performing a final plating with the last of our transformant cell stock. We also performed transformations to reamplify our D17 plasmid in anticipation of beginning Gibson Assembly trials.
For our second yeast transformation attempt, we accidentally used less plasmid DNA; we obtained no growth. For our third attempt, we made sure to use the sufficient amount of plasmid DNA and to eliminate the outgrowth step, which was not necessary for leucine-marker selection. This yielded a successful transformation.

Over the weekend our final Y. lipolytica plating showed a large amount of growth, indicating that our old stock was indeed competent. Our E. coli amplification, however, showed no growth. It was found that this was because of an error in the media used. To save time, we thawed our previous glycerol stock of transformed cells and used it to inoculate a culture for outgrowth and plasmid isolation. DNA yields of this culture were lower than previous amplifications. We reasoned that this was due to the glycerol stock not having been plated on selective media before freezing. This would have resulted in some population of non-transformants existing in the stock and lowering plasmid yields. To remedy this, we plated our glycerol stock on selective media to isolate colonies and inoculated cultures with these colonies. We left these cultures to incubate over the weekend.
We began PCR experiments to amplify our riboswitch inserts in anticipation of our Gibson Assembly trials. Trials initially showed mixed results, which was perplex"

Summary
For antibiotic detection, most research is currently focused on real time PCR with specific probes that anneal to the antibiotic resistance genes. This method is comparable to our method, as specific primers are required per resistance. We decided to try out the Milk DNA Isolation Kit to be able to compare our boiling method with a commercially available isolation method.

Summary
Dik and Fimme do research on the development of diagnostic tools for pathogen resistance detection in the bioveterinary field. In S. aureus, blaZ is relevant when looking into the β-lactamases. Other β-lactamases are not relevant enough. BlaZ produces small-spectrum penicillinases. This means that benzylpenicillin, ampicillin and amoxicillin antibiotics, common first and second choice antibiotics that are empirically used by the farmer to treat mastitis, can not be used is blaZ is detected. Rapid detection of this gene could prevent the misuse of penicillins by the farmer and gives reason to directly prescribe other treatments. From the policy perspective, the presence of blaZ has a lot of impact.
The mecA gene is also relevant to detect as this gene makes the pathogen resistant against all β-lactam antibiotics, leading to the well-known disease MRSA. The experts revealed insights for the key of success. Furthermore, they told us that farmers are able to work with tubes and pipettes. Farmers are willing to invest and follow a more challenging protocol if time for a good results.
Reflection with workshop

Valencia_UPV,2016,Team:Valencia UPV#Loop_-_-_TEXT.html,"ptions made to consider this situation are:
The complex can be considered as a macromolecule with                         three-dimensional random diffusion around the                         nucleus.
The net molar flow is presumably equal to zero, as the                         compartment composition is well-mixed.
As DNA is dispersed among the nucleus, the complex will                         be almost in permanent contact with it.
Simulations
Varying the time of measurement and the number of Cas9                         and gRNA copies introduced, we can expect different                         results for this ratio:
Figure 10.                             Comparison between values obtained for the                             diffusion ratio of the Cas9:gRNA complex al time t                             = 4320 minutes (3 days). All curves are relative to                             the results obtained with 1 copy for Cas9.
Simulations represented in the graphic above let us check that the gain in the rate of contact between the                         Cas9:gRNA complex, increases approximately in the same                         way when so does the concentration of the complex. A minimum of 10-15 gene copy number for the gRNA                         construction is necessary to achieve the plateau of the                         kr ratio, independently of the gene copy                         number for the Cas9 construction. Furthermore, the gain                         in the number of gene copies encoding Cas9, is the same                         produced in the random contact ratio.
As it can be inferred from this analysis, achieving                         enough Cas9:gRNA concentration is critical to stablish                         contact between the complex and the target. One                         possibility to increase repeatability of the test, minimizing the randomness of the complex diffusion, is                         to infiltrate the Testing System construction with the                         gRNA sequence.
The expected result was that if the gRNA                         is transcribed near the target, the aleatory of the                         three-dimensional diffusion would be minimized. Joining                         both pieces near to each other, it will be “easier” for                         the complex to find the target. This suggestion was                         implemented in wet-lab experiments, showing an increase                         of the light signal.
Probability of R-loop formation
In order to knock out our genetic target, it must be                         hybridized by the gRNA forming the R-loop. This                         structure provides Cas9 with the necessary stability to                         cut the DNA strand (2, 15). In order to get the                         structure, it is necessary that potential targets are                         complementary enough to the gRNA.

We wanted to carry out a screening for peptide aptamers, but due to delayed deliverance of our nucleotide library and problems inserting it into our scaffold, we did not manage to accomplish this in the given time frame.
Figure 2: Fluorescence microscopy images: (A) pSB1C3-T25-GFP, (B) pSB1C3-T18-GFP and (C) pSB1C3-T18 transformed into Top10 (E. coli K12-strain).
Green Fluorescent Protein was fused to the two components of the two-hybrid system, T18 and T25. This allowed us to detect expression of the two components that are both controlled by the lac promoter. Additionally, the presence of green fluorescence will verify that proteins can be fused to T18 and T25, and still fold into the correct structure. The two constructs pSB1C3-T18-GFP and pSB1C3-T25-GFP were transformed into the E. coli K12-strain Top10. The following fluorescence microscopy images confirm the presence of green fluorescence. This means that both T18 and T25 are expressed from the lac promoter, and that proteins fused to these two constructs can fold into their native structure.
The two constructs, pSB1C3-T18-GFP and pSB1C3-T25-GFP, were transformed into the competent E. coli K12-strain, Top10. Fluorescence microscopy imaging (fig. 2) confirms the presence of green fluorescence, thus both T18 and T25 are expressed by the lac promoter, and that GFP fused to the two constructs can fold into its correct structure. This indicates that proteins can be fused to T18 and T25, without affecting their 3D-structure.

Cost Analysis
While MycoDiesel resolves the ethical issue of food         crop usage as inputs for biodiesel production, Team Alberta         wanted to further emphasize the benefits of our project's         approach. As the inputs to our production process are largely         industrial wastes, MycoDiesel also promises to provide         substantial cost advantages, savings that can potentially         be passed on to consumers. Given the current economic         hardships throughout the majority of the developed world,         MycoDiesel's approach is an attractive potential solution         to attenuate ever-increasing consumer fuel prices.
Team Alberta received the help of Alex Siu, an accounting         student at the University of Alberta School of Business, who conducted a preliminary cost analysis study to explore         the potential savings that can be realized from synthesizing         biodiesel using MycoDiesel's approach.
Preliminary Cost Analysis
Given that our laboratory production process remains         in its infancy and is not ready for commercial analysis,         to achieve the most reliable cost information, the         large-scale production of soybean biodiesel was used as         a model for our estimates. Within our analysis, the net         cost of relevant direct materials was estimated to be zero,         given that they are industrial byproducts that are readily         disposed of throughout industries. According to You et         al. (2008), the direct material input of soybean biodiesel         production represented 64.8% - 75.9% of the total cost of         production1. Keeping with the most conservative estimate,         i.e. one that posses the highest non-direct material         cost, our analysis will estimate that 64.8% of total         cost of production is attributable to current B100 pump         prices. However, it should be noted that with the relatively         recent trend in rising food prices, raw material input prices         may actually present a large share of production costs. The         following tables estimate the cost breakdown of 2011 B100         fuel prices within the United States, the estimated retail         and production costs of our fuel, and the estimated retail         cost of our fuel relative to other similar fuels.

Figure 1 European Experience. We participated in the European Experience, a big gathering for European iGEM teams organized by iGEM Evry and iGEM IONIS. Every team started in the morning by presenting its project, we all had posters and were exchanging with other iGEMers. It was a good opportunity to explain our project Frank&Stain for the first time : we presented our main idea, our workflow, our goals, etc. By exchanging with other iGEMers on our project they gave us feedback and ideas. European Experience was also a great way to meet European teams and learn what kind of projects and ideas they have in mind. Potential collaborations arose,  we asked for red wine from teams near vineyards. Last but not least we had to very interesting conferences on Synthetic Biology in the afternoon.
Figure 2 NightScience. Biodesign Nightscience is an event organized by the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research-Paris. This event gathers each year researchers, hackers and education innovators to share their approaches and experience on building new ways to achieve better knowledge construction and transmission. Our team was invited to present our project in front of diverse audience. We had 15 minutes to present our idea and work, followed by 10 minutes of questions. We were very glad to hear the views of audience coming from different backgrounds on our synthetic biology approach to tackle wine stains and supplant PERC in dry cleaning. We met iGEM-University of Cambridge and exchanged our views on each other's project and presentation. We met some of the fantastic people and learnt more on DIY, open, frugal, hands-on, collaborative and citizen science! We thank the organizers of the Biodesign Nightscience for giving us the opportunity to present the project and convey synthetic biology approach to more diverse audience.

Biosafety+ involves developing biosafety regulations on remediation by genetically engineered bacteria (RGEB) based on opinions from iGEMers in China and improving iGEM projects accordingly (such as perfecting the suicide switch, visual identification, hardware design, etc.). Society+ mainly requires us to collect opinions from different groups, such as government organizations, enterprises, and individuals. By implementing the main principles of “3+ net”, teams will be able to view their projects from a more comprehensive angle. The concept was raised by ECUST during the trouble-shooting meet-up of CCiC and many teams under the track of environment would like to be a part of the activity and make the meaning of “3+ net” much richer. After discussing together and working independently, all teams finished their own part excellently and the complete 3+ Net Guidelines can be found below. Thanks to FJNU-China, SHPH, WHU-China and SCUT-China for your participation and unremitting efforts!

IIT-Madras
As one of the most important information carriers, languages are always beautiful and full of magic, which is sometimes troublesome if we want to communicate with non-native people freely. To spread the main ideas of synthetic biology to as many people as possible, we collaborated with IIT-Madras to make a short video on DNA&RNA by re-translating and recording the script in Mandarin, the most widely-spoken language in China. Click here to watch the video.
SHPH-SHANGHAI & SUIS-Shanghai
This year, ECUST collaborated with two high school teams on the interlab experiments by providing instructions and experimental equipment. We further collaborated with SUIS-Shanghai by instructing them on how to prepare CAS reagent and discussing their experimental results. In return, they offered their engineered bacteria for our exploring experiments.
NWU-China
With a focus of dealing with problems caused by saline soil, NWU-China collaborated with ECUST on data collection and measurement. Since ECUST has one campus located near the sea, plants on the campus always grow slowly due to the high salinity. By collecting data inside and around the campus, we were glad to be of help for their background information and project. NWU-China also kindly gave us suggestions on our modeling of biofilm degradation.

Truncated is better
There is a truncated PhyA
PhyB is main mediator of low fluence red light, conversion to Far form. W PhyA, main mediator of responses to far red light, in shaded environments. 2 modes—responses to prolonged exposure to far red light, and low fluence exposure if PhyA totally held in the dark. Still converts w red. Low fluence response does not matter on quality of light—any small exposure to visible light.
PhyA will bind PIF3, but in plantae, never. Getting phyA into nucleus FI1 needed for translocation to nucleus. Nuclear localization signal.
Lagarias—has been trying to get both phytochromobilin and the phytochrome to express concurrently in yeast, most people use the bacterial for heterologous expression. Clarke would be the person to ask to see hwat he has gotten to work. –email him he will respond.
They have primers for all Phy B and could design primers for just truncated section. Try just amplifying from genomic DNA in a single exon. Def try from genomic DNA.
Probbablyjust want to work with PhyB. In some ways could be advantageous s to work with Phy A—differs in how sensitive it is to light—once it sees light it degrades rapidly. Goes into proteosome degradation, and maybe a proteosome box is exposed? Maybe that’s just specific in Arabidopsis. It’s an E3 ligase. We need to look at specific structure of the protein. In plants PhyA builds to high levels in the dark and disappears in light—degradation and turning down. In yeast dunno how it would behave. –maybe working with a couple or three just to make sure one is robust would be good.
Def worth trying both PhyA and PhyB—espworking with full length. Don’t know if truncated has same sensitivity characteristics. PhyA is most sensitive.
You need to express the protein in the dark. The trick is the conditions under which you express the protein—use minimum minimum green light. Just put in green filters, 25 w bulb. If you can do that….The person collecting the data has a spectroradiometer and he had built a red and far-red filter to push them between the red and far red films in the cuvettes. She will see if they still have that instrument. The trick will be the conditions.

Fudan_China,2017,Team:Fudan China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," steady flow of repressor produced, the concentration distribution will get constant in the end. The results are shown in figure3.2.
The average distance (relative) between the promoter and the repressor source is about 0.17 and the corresponding concentration (relative) is 0.6577 which means when the repressor gets to the promoter, its concentration decreases more than 33 percent. It gives us an reasonable explanation to the problem why all the promoters are leaked seriously. According to the enlightenment of the model, we take two kinds of measures to ease the problem.
First, we can increase the plasmid copy number so as to increase the dense of the point sources and reduce the average distance.
Second, we can use only one kind of plasmid for both repressor production and the integrase production, so the source of the repressor will get extremely close to the promoter.
Figure 3.2 | The concentration distribution describes the steady relative concentration of the integrase varies with the relative position to the plasmid which we consider as the point source of repressor production in E.coli. The arrow marks out the average distance between the promoter and the point source as well as the corresponding concentration. We suppose both the average radius of the cell and the concentration of the point source as the unit 1.
In general, the model not only helped us to demonstrate and analyze our project, but also gives us a vigorous tool to solve the unexpected problem. You can see more detailed mathematical demonstration at the back of each part.

Explanation of constraints based modeling
Constraint based modeling [3] is a computational method to mechanistically simulate complex metabolic networks [4], that operates based one one key assumption: The system is assumed to be in steady-state, which means that the concentration of all of the cell’s inner metabolites remains constant throughout the process. Based on these assumptions, constraint based modeling, allows to make quantitative predictions about the cellular behavior, by utilizing a minimal set of information. The essential prerequisite of any type of constraint based modeling is the existence of a reconstructed metabolic network, where all reactions of the network have been characterized stoichiometrically. Once this is done, one constructs the stoichiometric matrix S of the network, which includes the stoichiometric coefficients of all metabolites in each of the reactions. In particular, each column of the matrix corresponds to a reaction and each row to a metabolite (Fig. 2). This represents a mass balance of the network. Beyond the stoichiometric coefficients, another essential part of the model are the boundary constraints: These place upper and lower bounds on the flux (turnover rate) of some of these reactions, based on physicochemical considerations and experimental data. For example, lower or upper bounds are set to 0 if a given reaction is considered as irreversible.
Figure 2: Visualization of the concept of a stoichiometric matrix: In (a) a biochemical network is shown, whose reactions can be represented mathematically by the coefficients of the reacting substrates and products (b). Finally, in the flux space representation, each reaction is constrained by a lower and an upper bound. (from [3])
Figure 3: The constraints imposed by the steady state condition and the bounds to the reaction fluxes restricts n-dimensional space to a polytope, the so called flux space. Maximization of a linear objective function using linear programming returns a vertex of this polytope. (from [3])
