Nile Red is also used as a lipid stain and this is indicated by its staining of the membranes of EV cells. In contrast, in phaCAB containing cells, staining is restricted to points within the cells.
Each fluorescent image was created by exciting the stain at 530nm for 100ms. Despite this standard treatment of samples the intensity of fluorescence produced by the cells containing the hybrid promoter is greater than from the constitutive ones. This could indicate a difference in the strength of the promoters which lead to phaCAB expression and therefore the amount of P3HB produced. The images also suggest that not every single E.coli is stained. This may be due to the conditions in which the cells were grown or may be dependent upon the stage in the lifecycle of the E.coli.

We extracted the P3HB using a simple technique which maintains the chain length of the P3HB while releasing it from the cells. The amount of plastic extracted from the hybrid promoter-phaCAB(BBa_K1149051 [84] ) was much larger compared to the native promoter-phaCAB. All other conditions were kept the same.
A comparison between the amount of plastic produced by bacteria containing an empty plasmid(EV), native promoter-phaCAB and hybrid promoter-phaCAB after plastic extraction. The EV does not produce P3HB while the hybrid produces much more than the native promoter.
Increasing Bioplastic Production ▼
We converted the data into the format with which industry compares P3HB production. These are mass of plastic per dry biomass and mass of plastic per litre of culture media. The strain containing the hybrid promoter had a ten fold higher ratio of plastic to biomass than that produced by the original part BBa_K934001
A summary of the improved production of P3HB by our hybrid promoter-phaCAB construct(BBa_K1149051) over the native promoter-phaCAB.
Comparing the amount of plastic produced by the two constructs is visually striking.

Meet-up with Team NEU-China
It’s important to find new friends in iGEM. On 20th, August, the team leader of NEU-China happened to come to Guangzhou, China for a summer camp. We met him and bring him to sight-seeing around. Referring to collaboration, he mentioned that their team might need modelling help at later phase of the project. We discussed about assistance and drew a conclusion that if time and energy permit, we will help them with modelling.
Figure 7.6
In September, we had cooperation with them. Since our experiments had a lot of things in common, we cooperated in various aspects of the whole project. Especially, we had a deep discussion of the concept of modelling and exchanged views about the details, such as the way to predict the density of factors in the mice. At first, they were interested in our parts’confirmation in animal models, like fitting of fluorescence intensity. Later, they wanted to introduce that in their own models. We also gave them a little instruction about how to predict the factors in mice and analysis the data.
Communication with Team TMMU_China
At the very beginning, we talked about the Neutral Network with regards to its usage as classification, and regression model. We were excited to find out that both of our teams took similar ways to predict values. When realizing that there was a problem about how to define parameters, we both found a method to solve it. It was so happy to get the chance to communicate with someone who owned passion towards data analysis and we even promised to meet in Boston and attended some biostatistics classes in Harward.

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," easy to use that researchers in synthetic biology will be excited to make microfluidic chips. We want a workflow that interfaces with fabrication protocols that are low cost, such that even DIY hobbyists could make new chips. We wanted a workflow whose hardware could be fabricated with a 3D printer, and whose software is open source so that the entire synthetic biology community can contribute to new features in Neptune. Further, we wanted to ensure our workflow completely and cleanly integrates with current fabrication methods, so that we are still following current standards.
Open Source Software
While this is already an iGEM requirement, we are proud to say our source code for Neptune is licensed as open under a BSD-II license. Further, we are very proud to say that Neptune is public on GitHub, and we encourage developers to fork the repo.
Neptune is free to download from GitHub too, and very soon NONA will provide a distribution method.
GITHUB REPOSITORY
NONA
Simple Design Process
Accessibility means ease of use. Ease of use means simplicity; it means a no-brainer user interface and powerful code to help you design microfluidics with ease. Indeed, the biggest setback to designing microfluidics before Neptune was the tedious, long, and difficult process of hand-specifying all features in the microfluidic device. In Neptune, simple english-language descriptions allow you to specify complex microfluidic designs.
Tutorials, Wiki's, Documentation
Not knowing how to use a new tool can dissuade researchers from ever bothering to learn; poor documentation, lack of support for new users, confusing or nonexistent tutorials- all of these add up to a big headache to a researcher who wants to get into microfluidics.
We targeted this issue by creating a tutorial video for our software and hardware workflow. This tutorial is a complete “Hello World” walkthrough that will guide new researchers step-by-step through the microfluidic creation process. We hope that this will encourage anyone who had been intimidated by microfluidic design to come forward and give it a shot.
A  tutorial video is good, but not complete. We followed up by starting a extensive written tutorial to writing LFR and MINT files (to design microfluidics,) and written tutorials on how to setup the hardware components. We also added wiki into to the GitHub repositories for Neptune and our hardware, providing yet another resource for new users to try.
Integrated, Low Cost Fabrication Protocols
This is truly where the Gold Medal HP contributions become apparent. We had a clear choice here: We could have made Neptune interface with industry grade, powerful and very expensive fabrication methods using photolithography"

Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"on and the ThiE KO/GLF operon have been isolated and confirmed by gel electrophoresis. The primary goal now is to successfully construct each operon by Gibson assembly or SLIC. Once the operons have been confirmed transformation of Synechocystis will be carried out in two successive steps: first with the AGP KO/inv operon and, secondly, with the ThiE KO/GLF operon.
Assay Development
Throughout the duration of this project, enzymatic assays were used to confirm the function of the genes used to transform E. coli and quantify the secretion of biofuel products. A hexokinase assay was used to measure glucose/fructose secretions from cyanobacteria, and oxidase/peroxidase assays were used to quantify free fatty acid and ethanol production from E. coli.
Most techniques for directly determining the concentrations of sugars, alcohols and fatty acids in culture media involve multiple steps, and may not distinguish between, for example, different types of sugars. We overcame these problems by using enzyme assays which, upon the addition of the sugars, alcohols, or fatty acids, result in the formation of other compounds which can be measured directly.
For each assay, samples of Synechocystis or E.coli medium were taken, and centrifuged to remove particulates. These samples were then added directly to assay mixtures containing enzymes and additional substrates necessary for the formation of compounds whose concentrations we could measure directly.
Coupled enzyme assays for Glucose, Fructose and Sucrose uses enzymes to catalyze a series of reactions, resulting in the formation of NADH, which we can measure directly in the spectrophotometer.
Assay Description: Invertase enzyme will be directly added to sample media to split sucrose into D-glucose and D-fructose, which are then added to a Hexokinase/Glucose-6-phosphate DeH assay mix, which will produce one NADH molecule for every one glucose molecule added.  NADH can be measure on the spectrophotometer at 340 nm and can be quantitated using Beer’s law and the NADH extinction coefficient (shown above).  Because the assay is glucose specific, the first reading will quantitate glucose present, then a Phosphoglucose isomerase enzyme will be added to the assay mix to convert fructose-6-phosphate into glucose-6-phosphate and a second reading will be taken, the increase in absorbance will be used to quantitate fructose present.
It should be noted that fructose is produced naturally by"
Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#The i in iGEM_-_-_TEXT.html," students and the University of Edinburgh includes 35% non-UK students in its body (UKISA 2013). Moving to Germany, a similar story unfolds: 11.3%, or 282,201 of the students come from outside the country (DAAD 2014). In the two universities with the longest history in the competition, University of Heidelberg and University of Freiburg, 17.1% and 15% of the students respectively come from outside of Germany (NUS International Relations Office 2014) (University of Heidelberg 2014).
Finally, the United States of America. In 2013, it was reported that about 820,000 non US nationals were enrolled in US universities. That makes up only 3.3% percent of the population. If we look specifically though into universities that have been participating in iGEM for a while, those percentages shift dramatically. MIT, birthplace of the competition, 28.63% of the students are international (MIT ISO 2014). In Purdue University, another early iGEM participant, the percentage is 15% for undergraduates and 38% for graduate students (Purdue 2012).
Currently, there is no way of knowing this however since iGEM does not record the nationality of participants. As a result, the i in iGEM refers only to the origin of the participant universities, rather than the participating individuals. Countries with no representation through teams in the competition are still represented by individuals. Just within the history of Imperial College iGEM there are students from 5 different countries with no official participation in the competition: Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Pakistan and Slovakia (Imperial iGEM wiki 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2014).
On the graph below we can see that the percentage of international students in the Imperial iGEM teams over the years by far exceeds the 44% of international students in the university. It should be noted that in the 2007 and 2011 teams. only one of the students was British
Many internationally educated scholars end up returning to their home country or wishing to have an impact on its scientific output.

Lambert_GA,2018,Team:Lambert GA#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," demonstrated to have significant consistency, with the average peak output at 1997.8378 V (S.D. 278.2399 V). The time constant has been shown to have slight variation, with the average time constant at 5.1362 ms (S.D. 0.8927 ms), with trials conducted by 3 individuals across the ages of 18-25, with most values within the necessary range for successful electroporation. Through this, we’ve experimentally determined that the ElectroPen is capable of successfully producing high-voltage pulses within the optimal ranges for electroporation of E. coli, however, to understand how this occurs, the underlying mechanisms for voltage generation must be described. Therefore, we developed a theoretical model to characterize the functionality of the ElectroPen.
Figure 3: Voltage/time constant model for the ElectroPen. a Time constant is defined as the time taken to achieve 1/3rd of the peak voltage. b Comparison of voltage/time constant outputs of the ElectroPen to those optimized for electroporation of E. coli. The majority of those produced by the ElectroPen fall within the expected range, demonstrating its functionality.
THEORETICAL MODEL AND EVALUATION
Voltage outputs from any piezoelectric-based system are dependent on the force exerted on the crystal, allowing for the reorganization of the ions, creating the corresponding output [32]. In order to characterize the capability of a small lighter to generate high voltages (on the order of kilovolts), the underlying mechanism within the lighter must first be described. The mechanism (which will henceforth be referred to as the “hammer action”) comprises of two springs, a hammer (metal piece striking the crystal), and the PZT crystal itself connected to a metal conductor. The hammer action functions in three phases: a loading phase, a release phase, and a relaxation phase, each directed by various components. During the loading phase, the hammer is held in a locked position as the lower spring and upper springs are being compressed using the user exerted force. The entire upper portion of the casing moves upwards, while the hammer is still locked in a loading position. The time interval of the loading phase is dependent on the force exerted by the user, and has no effect on the output voltage as the hammer's movement is dependent on the spring release. At the release phase, once the action begins to approach is critical point, the lower casing with a connected wedge pushes the hammer out of the latch while the spring is compressed at maximum, beginning to release the hammer. Then, the hammer switches from the lock"

XMU_Software,2013,Team:XMU Software#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," we have been entangled with the problem that how to get the position frequency matrix of Sigma promoter motifs (we have only obtained the data of sigma 70 and sigma E promoters from literatures). This week, after deliberate discussion, we come up with an idea that we can use the consensus sequences provided in literatures and promoter sequencess in RDB to calculate the matrix by ourselves. Han Tao and Zhang are in charge with this little program and now we have worked out the frame of the program and have tested it using the data of sigma 32. There is more work to be done to refine the program and make our position frequency matrix more reliable.
Members of our software team are doing experiments in the lab this week.
Group of Protein experienced a tough time these weeks. In 21th, July, we decided to apply the algorithm of patent 200780024670.5 in further work. However, concern on sort of using the patent delayed our pace forward.
After communication with Prof. Fang this week, we stick to the direction and all neglected tasks are being undertaken. Unfortunately, things don’t go smoothly as expected.
Jianxing Huang employed data from NCBI (database) and paid enormous efforts on changing sequences files to FASTE files. He exerted himself in making the algorithm programmable by understanding the patient in detail.
Tao Han went home, but he was still making attempts to program the available parts.
Zach Lin went home as well, in which the documents cannot be downloaded, only doing his endeavor to read limited documentary sources online.
Next week:
Jianxing Huang will find out and download all those parameters mentioned in the algorithm from the database.
Examples will be made by Jiang Huang to explain the algorithm and make the main idea of the program possible.
Tao Han tends to begin compiling the computer program.
Zach Lin wants to blend an innovative point into the algorithm by scanning lots of papers.
The week we had finished the elementary function so that user can use our software by registering. We named the software for “E’Note”. User can add and delete an experiment, add step, add text, table, photo and so on.
Qiu had put the software on the line. Chen had finished one of the experiment formwork that the user can utilize directly. However, the tool hadn’t finished which we will work hard next week.
Frist, we had uploaded the wiki of team project descriptions to the iGEM server. It is beautiful but half-baked, so we decide to make the wiki after the platform is done, maybe in mid-August. Second, we designed a series"

In order to prepare for the project, the UIUC Software team made sure everyone was on the same page during our first week of summer.
Task List
Learn Django - Web Development
Learn how to utilize COBRA for cell modeling
Connect to the team SVN
Understand the IMPtools code (written in Python)
Assign responsibilities for each member
Results
Bootcamp turned out to be a big success. All of the tasks were in some way or another, completed. It turned out that after responsibilities were assigned, some tasks were unnecessary for some, and more important for others. By the end of the week of bootcamp, we had a very effective team with everyone working hard to accomplish the team's goals.

Sequence Verification of Integration Products
In order to confirm that the integration products of the functionality test were the ones we expected, we attempted to sequence verify them. We load the whole PCR product visualized on lane 2 and 3 from functionality assay on 28/09/2018 on 2% agarose gel and isolated the bands from the gel and purify them. Since a very low concentration was achieved, another round of PCR was done using the isolated fragment as template. We cleaned up the PCR product and achieved concentration of 250ng/µl for"

Audiences participating in this public speech
The final part was the most important section, the announcement for our own projects. We public two project, which came out after long time discussion and brainstorm. One is a novel proteins expression system with circular mRNA and RNA thermometer. Another is Synthesis of crispr-cas system in gliomas cell to specifically knock out CD44 gene for inhibiting cell migration and activation. Professor Lv asked many question about circular mRNA. He thought it could be used as drug to regulate gene expression; however he doubted that whether it could be used to translation of proteins. Hence, James explain the mechanism of group I intron self-splicing RNA and results from literatures. Pro. Lv agreed and would like to help us with the project. Dr. Liu thought RNA thermometer was quite interesting and could be widely used. She hoped we could use RNA thermometer to create a fantastic project. Although the projects were replaced by another better idea, we were benefit from group discussion and research training.

Synthetic Biology Day
The Synthetic Biology Day is an initiative by all German iGEM teams. It is a public event with the intention to explain and communicate the field of Synthetic Bilogy to the general public. It was held on August 25, 2012 in the following cities: Bielefeld, Darmstadt, Frankfurt, Göttingen, Marburg, München and Tübingen.
Event
townhall in background
Propagating synthetic biology in a town like Tübingen is a delicate business. Tübingen's inhabitants are known for their very ecological and organic lifestyle. So when we set up our pavillon at 8 am, we were prepared for the worst. Thanks to the sunny weather the cafés around us opened early and the first deserted marketplace got filled continuosely.
A group of bikers stopped by to have a glass of our free iced tea. They were the first to try their knowledge on our synthethic biology quiz, most questions only needed a little help to be answerd correctly. Throughout the day we had kids enjoying iced tea and sweets, watching their parents discussing topics such as the impact of genetic engineering on agriculture and medicine.
""What happens when I eat a gene?""
""How can microorganisms be controlled?""
""Do we need genetic engineering to feed the world?""
We provided answers to all these questions and were happy to see that most of our visitors were thankful for the information we provided.

Introduction
In this section we focus on the lambda phage nut-site and N protein termination system. In lambda bacteriophage, gene expression is regulated by the suppression of transcription termination which is mediated by the lambda N protein that interacts with the nut site. We have constructed several test plasmids with different terminator strength and references. These plasmids are presented in the Construction of Parts section. The aim of the characterization experiments has been to test:
If it was possible to trigger the feedback mechanisms of the N protein by varying promoter strengths, it would be possible to observe increased read through of the terminator.
If the N-mechanisms can be triggered by induction of N from a seperate inducible plasmid.
Characterization
The characterization strategy and results are presented in this section, for more information on our constructs, see Construction of Parts . For more information about our BioBricks, see Construction of BioBricks .
Strategy
In order to test the funcionality of the antiterminator system the following 6 plasmids were constructed. The test plasmids pAT12-16 and the induction plasmid pAT01 are presented in the figures below.
Figure 1: pAT12: Insert´s organisation in plasmid pAT12 with pSB2K3 as a backbone. As the figure illustrates, there is an RBS followed by the FACS optimised GFP (from pAT03) and the natural lambda nutR (from pAT05). Next, there is the N gene followed by RBS and RFP (from pAT02) downstream of the nutR site.

Collaborations
On 13rd, August, 2015.We attended CCiC which was hosted by Peking University. By taking this opportunity, we made communications with other teams.
NJU-China which is from M3 lab Nanjing University offered valuable advice about CRISPR and expression vector. Before we made a study of safety, we thought that E.Coli vector would bring potential safety problems. Therefore we planned to express dsRNA in saccharomyces cerevisiae. Meanwhile, we planned to integrate the target gene to genome to avoid the lose of plasmids. But Doctor.ChenXi pointed that efficiency of prokaryotic expression system was better than eukaryotic expressing system. And there would be several problems which we couldn’t predict, and because of it. We would not be able to complete the project in time.
After conversation, we had to face the question that what we should do in the future. Therefore we restudied the safety problems. Luckily, we found information that honey could restrain the growth of bacteria. Therefore we decided to choose HT115 as an expression vector.
Meanwhile, we visited Beijing Normal University after CCiC. BNU-China Team is a year-old team, they also met several problems about the establishment of the team. How to attract new team members has been becoming one of the most important things. In their views, we could hold academic lecture to attract students to join us. And holding science communication event would be a good choice for us to attract popularity. What’s more, we agreed that standard training and criterion would be essential for the construction of teams."

- Balanced Regulation
There is great concern that the development of fast-growing fields such as synthetic biology is 'overtaking' the regulation which is in place to regulate its application and to balance the risks and potential benefits. Such concerns could be addressed
We used the feedback from these focus groups to shape the direction of our survey questions.

Sheffield iGEM Meet Up
In July Oliver, Corinna, Fran, and Emily attended the Sheffield iGEM meet up and presented our project to other teams there. Corinna had this to say:
""For the presentation of our project at the University of Sheffield meet-up, we were expected to remain under a time limit of 5 minutes. This was the main factor in determining the extent of detail we included in the presentation. We were also encouraged to have a PPT slide to accompany our presentation, which we kept very simple: a slide with the animated DCMation logo, and another slide with a team picture.  We had four team members attend the meeting, and all of us spoke for about a minute in the presentation. The first minute of the presentation was spent on outlining the uses of DCM, current disposal techniques, and how it is harmful to the environment. The second minute was devoted to describing our user-friendly disposal kit in a very simple manner.  We then spent the last three minutes on the three parts of the project we had at that point (A, B, and C), as well as the engineering aspects of our system. These were only one- or two-sentence summaries due to the time limit. We used general scientific jargon in the presentation, since our audience was almost exclusively other iGEMers doing wet-lab work in the project. We could therefore use terms such as E. coli, enzymes, biosensor, regulatory network, etc. without having to explain their meaning.""

Social Engagement
We are willing to introduce the advanced science to the public. Therefore, we went to a community near our campus, Shangdeyuan Housing Estate, and organized a workshop. People aged ranging 4 to 65 engaged our events and workshops to know more about synthetic biology.
The residents showed their curiosity about what synthetic biology is. Therefore, we introduced the biosynthetic products around us and the significance of genetically engineered organisms. Though they expressed concerns about genetically modified foods, we used vivid examples to dispel their wariness to some degree.
To evoke enthusiasm for science in children, we prepared several interesting experiments that were easy to carry out. To our surprise, children were quite into them. We also played games while educated them about knowledge of biology like making the cell model with the eraser, teaching them the structure of the cell, drawing DNA on a blackboard etc. Even though our activities had finished for a long time, people were reluctant to leave.

Education
TUST-China also went to Tianjin Haihe Middle School this summer and our instructor went with us. We interacted with the students and let them answer some questions. For example: ""Are you interested in biology?"" ""Has anyone ever heard of synthetic biology? Do you know it?"" ""Can you guess what is the main research in synthetic biology?"" The students are very positive to answer our questions, we gave the students the badges of our team as souvenirs. The interaction lead us to the introduction of synthetic biology. We've also introduced iGEM to them and showed them how to take part in iGEM as a high school student.
After listening to our introduction, they had a better understanding of biology . For us, it's quite a good experience to communicate with middle school students and to teach them what we've obtained in taking iGEM competition.

Different activities such as playing the Canvas Town game designed by Fatih Medical 2011 iGEM team, watching videos and holding a question-answer platform took place which enabled us to exchange ideas and maybe spark a light of interest.
The Dean and Doctors
Our faculty’s dean was only familiar to the word iGEM and nothing else. Therefore a meeting was organised with the university hospital doctors and the dean. Upon listening to our presentation of iGEM and Oncoli, some doctors offered the opportunity of working with tissues they will specially design for oncoli in which we will be able to continue our experiments. Their enthusiasm and support was essential and motivating. National Union We attended the national union organised by the METU-Turkey team and presented our project. This enabled us to practice for the jamboree as well as answering the questions asked by them. Following this a discussion panel was held on how to spread Synthetic Biology in Turkey.

We can write cell vectors number at the injection instant (Np(Tdox)) is equal to :
The cell vectors number does not increase such as the tissue vectors . Indeed, it decreases with time, because of the phage vector stability and of its cell penetration (to release the therapeutic plasmide ).
Its stability in the blood is equal to the phage vector deterioration constant (kdeg) according to time. If we add this constant to the cell vectors number equation according to time (Np(t)) we obtain the following formula :
The phage vector dispersion steps  in the tumor and for cell penetration are the steps below Fourth and Fifth) because of their complexity.

DVS Efficiency
So, we determined:
The size of the tumor versus time (initial volume + growth)
The amount of tissue vector versus time
The amount of released cell vectors for a tissue vector
Now, we're going to determine the efficiency of our vectors for penetring cancer cells.
For that we are studying:
The area of dispersal cell vector
The importance of the cellular internalization of the vector in cancer cells.
Back to top
Fourth step : The cell vector dispersion
Here, we are looking for determine the maximum area that a phage can cover. This requires knowing:
The spread of phages in the bloodstream
Their diffusion through the walls of blood vessels
The surface of a cancer cell
For our modeling, we consider the blood as a Newtonian fluid with a constant velocity Vmax. Here, We neglect the heart-related jolts and turbulent flows caused by the cavities of the blood epithelium.
The cell vector moves along two axes. An X axis in the direction of blood flow and a Y axis orthogonal to the axis X.
The phage propagation in the bloodstream
The movement in X depends solely on the propagation of phages the vessel due to blood flow. Indeed, we neglect the diffusion which takes place also along the X axis because it is 1000 times less than the propagation of particles in the blood (due to the importance of blood flow). The cellular carriers are moving at speeds spread on a dish from, Vmax in the center of the vessel at V0 against the vessel wall.
The speed of phages decrease in approaching the vessel walls due to the friction forces which are opposing to the movement.
We can determine how long the particle (with a Vmax velocity), ie the particles in the center of the ship, reached the end. This gives the time necessary to internalize all the phages of the bacteria.

(J)
The volume of oil between two droplets can be expressed as \(V_{sp} = (Q_1 + Q_2) \varDelta t = l_{init} H W_1 = l H W_{ch}\). Solving the eq.(J) for Δt and inserting it into the volume relation, we get the expression for l, which represents the initial thickness of oil in the coalescence chamber (with dimensions HWch):

Replacing T0 in eq. (F) with eq. (K), the full expression for drainage-film thickness is found:

The approximate solution of equation (2) is the following:
(3)
The drainage rate of the oil is expressed according to Barman et al. (See ESI of [1]):
(4)
When the expressions (1) and (3) are inserted, the equation (4) gives a function of drainage flow rate .
2. Interfacial tension and electrowetting-effect
The pressure difference in equation (1) and the expression for Qdrain accounts for the effects of surfactant adsorption and capillary pressure. However in our experiments we have the two populations of droplets with different interfacial tension γ. The difference of interfacial tension arises from different degrees of interface saturation of surfactant between re-injected and produced droplets. The re-injected droplets are incubated beforehand and already have saturated amount of surfactants on their surface. In comparison, the produced droplets only reach the saturation at a later point. All the droplets in our experiments are being produced by using nonionic surfactants.
The first population of droplets is being re-injected into the electrocoalescence chip after some incubation period. Liquid interface of these droplets gets saturated with surfactant monomers from oil solution. It is well known the interfacial tension of droplets reach the lowest (equilibrium) value γeq[3] after incubation. We use the value γ1=γeq for interfacial tension of re-injected droplets. This population of droplets is produced in a microfluidic chip of lower channel height, therefore the volume of droplets is smaller compared to that of the second population droplets. When the first population is re-injected into the coalescence chip with higher channel height compared to the channel height they were"

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#MFC Result_-_-_TEXT.html," decided to repeat the measurement, but allowing aeration to the cell culture after shifting from LB to M9 for better cell adaptation to the new medium.
Figure 3 Growth curve of Shewanella MR-1 shift from M9 aerobic to M9 anaerobic condition.
Stationary Shewanella MR-1 in LB was washed and transferred to M9 aerobic medium at time zero. At time t = 30h, M9 medium was renewed. The drop of OD600 is likely due to the loss of cell during medium replacement. Similar to figure 2, the OD600 stayed at 1.79-1.84 with slight fluctuation. While no significant cell growth was observed again, the OD600 sustained for 24 hours after shifting to anaerobic condition when 20mM lactate was added.
MFC Measurements
The MFC was constructed as described in Notebook. As a fast and convenient method, we scaled down the microbial fuel cell in the experimental set-up as shown in figure 4. We constructed it with eppendorfs, which are easily obtained from the laboratory while less reagents and materials are required. It was sealed with epoxy and paraffin to prevent liquid leakage and provide anaerobic condition.
Inspired by Bielefeld 2013 iGEM Team, we also attempted to use 3D-printing to make our MFC prototype as our product. For convenient, our prototypes as shown in figure 5 and 6 are designed to print as a whole such that no assembly of individual component is required.

The control has the same construction as the sample except no cells were added. 20mM lactate was added as carbon source. Despite the fluctuation shown from time 20 to 35 minutes of three individual trials, the MFC potential increases over time and reach the similar plateau. Besides, the curves of three trials are significantly higher than the control curve, while the control is staying at the low voltage over the whole experimental period. We could conclude that the difference between the control and MFC curves is most likely due to the exogenic properties of the Shewanella and the increase of voltage could be attributed to the growth of the Shewanella in the MFC.

Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose risks to lab members, security, the general public, or the environment?
None of the biological materials used in our lab pose pose any sort of risk. The main biological part that we are using in this project, the mtd, does not affect any organism other than Bordetella bacteria. Furthermore, all of our work is done in vitro, and our product is not packaged within a vector. As such, there is no chance of our materials impacting the public or the environment outside of the controlled laboratory environment.
If your project was scaled up from a lab study to a widely used industrial product, or if the knowledge and methods produced from your project became widely available, what new risks might arise?
No new risks would arise. Our project has no inherently malicious utilities.
What are your institution's biosafety guidelines?
All biological research at UCLA is overseen by the Environment, Health, & Safety department's Biological Safety Division . Per EH&S's requirements, Members of our team took the Lab Safety Fundamentals Concepts course taught by UCLA's Environment, Health, & Safety department. The course covers fire safety, chemical safety, and mitigation of hazards in the lab. We also consulted with EH&S regarding the safety implications of our project. Initially, we had planned to conduct our experiment in vivo using the BPP-1 phage and its host, the Bordetella bacteria. However, Bordetella causes infections in humans and smaller mammals, and our lab facility was not equipped to handle such a hazard. As such, we decided to switch to a completely in vitro approach.  In the USA, the Center for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health provide biosafety guidelines for the nation.
What is the BioSafety Level rating of your lab?
Our lab has a BSL rating of 2.
Does your project involve any high risk organisms?
Our project does not involve the use of any chassis organism. We only use standard strains of E. coli for the transformation/replication of our plasmid (XL-1 blue), as well as for screening purposes.

TUST_China,2017,Team:TUST China#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," BC Company
We inquired about LEE'S PHARM and collected data related on Hemicelluose Dressing-- Veloderm. Owing to its unique nano-scale three-dimensional network structure, BC has a high-water retention, high mechanical strength, and outstanding biocompatibility, which enable it to serve as a natural scaffold material for the regeneration of a wide variety of tissues. For most wound-repairing materials, important characteristics are their ability to lock exudate during the dressing process, as well as their removal from wound surface after recovery. BC’s potential lies in the unique properties (such as the high mechanical strength) of the never-dried BC membrane; on the other hand, its high liquid absorbency, biocompatibility and hygienic nature perfectly cater to the specific demands for skin tissue repairing. Thus, considering the properties of BC as well as its clinical performance, the commercialization of BC for wound caring is very promising.
Outreach
Shandong Nameide Biotechnology Co., Ltd.
As we near the end of the project, we would like to know the BC factory's view of our work and the production of some BC products. So we visited Shandong Nameide Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Their product is named Nanuomei - a bacterial cellulite wound dressing.
The company's R & D manager received us and took us to visit the production workshop. She introduced us their mode of producing, which is quit different from the mode of producing BC in our laboratory. For example, in the lab we used the conical flask to produce BC. however, BC was produced in a huge metal tray in the factory.
Besides, We introduced our iGEM project to her and asked her what she thought about it. She thought our work was very meaningful and has been achieved increasing BC production, but she had doubts about whether it is suitable for the factory because the production methods and the production environment is totally different.
We plan to test the results of our iGEM project in the factory in the future. And we hope that our project can increase the production of BC not only in the lab but also in the factory.                                 This trip we have gained a lot and we are more confident that our project is useful and meaningful.

Back again, you should consider the virulence factor and immunology analysis. I think people in Indonesia are easy to accept something new, as long as the cost isn’t very high. And I think there would be no high cost because nowadays people uses bioreactor so it would be done easily and the cost won’t be too high. For another instance, use lyophilization of bacteria so you could store in in a matter of long time. Professor Akira in Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science UI has collected bacteria around Indonesia using this method.
Do you think that Indonesia is a bit left behind other countries?
Well, in biosimilar technology, I think Indonesia is quite advanced. The only problem is to find the investor who would commercialize it.  And there is no regulation from the government.
How about Intellectual Property Rights?
iGEM has an open source basis in ung.igem.org so if it has become a public domain, everyone could use it. We have to insert notes of: “for research only, for commercial purpose, please contact the author.” If we want to protect our online right in, Indonesia there is also HAKI or Intellectual Property Rights. However, we should pay some money monthly to maintain it.

Synthetic biology really has big prospects in the world. We need ideas––yet we need breakthroughs if we want to achieve more from it. Asia is being forward in many aspects over the past several years. However, Major findings from the Wilson Center on “Tracking the Growth of Synthetic Biology” in 2013 shows that the number of entities conducting research and commercial applications in Synthetic Biology in Europe and US is very high, but Asia has been left behind.

Cyano Q&A
A lot of current iGEM teams work with cyanobacteria. These tiny green microorganisms require special cultivation methods which aren’t always known to everyone. We started noting down important facts after iGEM Hamburg 2018 gave us the impetus to do so. We created this Cyano Q&A in order to solve the most prominent questions of them and other teams that contacted us. But it is also written for everyone else who is entering the world of cyanobacteria.
What are the cultivation conditions of cyanobacteria?
That depends on the strain. Typically Synechococcus elongatus sp 7942 and Synechocystis PCC 6803 - two model organisms - are incubated at 30°C (86°F). Moreover, as an autotrophic organism they need light in order to survive. We use light bulbs with a light intensity of 75 μE/m2·s . With those settings they have a growth rate of 0.052 h‐1. Optionally, you can use the light intensity of 60 μE/m2·s. With those adjustment the growth rate would be 0.026 h‐1.
Can I store cyanobacteria on agar plates and if so, how?
Yes, you can store them on plates made of equal amounts of 1,5% agar and 2x BG11. You can also add an antibiotic treatment if needed. You can find the protocol for this here: https://www.protocols.io/view/recipe-for-standard-bg-11-media-gtmbwk"

Our Market Research: Understanding the future context of use of Medusa
The first thing on our task list was to scope out the industry and size up the competition, so we focused on market research. To ensure that our axes of development were in line with the expectation of our future users, we attempted to determine what would attract or deter them from using our 3D-bioprinting device.
To understand what the target users would print with our device, we analyzed what the 3D printing community is currently printing. To do so we extracted the downloading, liking and printing activity on Pinshape.com, one of the most popular and open source 3D-templates database.
Popular Categories on Pinshape.com
As primary research, we found surveys to be the best way to get the information we needed in a short amount of time. We therefore designed surveys for 3D printer users. Our goal with our surveys was to understand:
the place the 3D printer has inside of the technological arsenal of today as well as where it will stand in the future.
how 3D printer users view the device and why they use it.
We posted on facebook hobby groups to question the 3D-printing community on its vision of bacterial printing. We noted that 3D printing was mostly used by DIY hobbyists who would like to reduce the time and cost of 3D printing. In addition, low performances for safety efficiency and speed were flagged as the key hold-backs to using a 3D-bioprinter.
What Would Deter You Most From Using a Bio-3D-printer?
What Are You Most Likely to Print?
Would you like to try bioprinting stuff ?
The initial result of our online research showed that the idea of printing biomaterials with a 3D-bioprinter is well received"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," degradation. Molecular cell, 22(5), 701-707.
Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified"

This year, a major aspect of our human practices were the interviews that were conducted by members of our team. We had the chance to interview Dr. Ed Pryzdial, who is a scientist from the Canadian Blood Services, Dr. Bruce Ritchie from the hematology department from the University of Alberta, as well as an expert from St. John’s Ambulance. All three of these interviews provided vital feedback that directly affected our course of thinking for the design of our product.
Canadian Blood Services
We were able to get in touch with Dr. Ed Pryzdial, a scientist with Canadian Blood Services and the Associate Director for the Centre for Blood Research at the University of British Columbia. Aside from his work with Canadian Blood Services, some of his specializations are in coagulation and blood proteins. His knowledge would provide us with insight into any potential problems we might run into.  We received comments about the design of our construct from him. He told us that using the whole fibrinogen molecule would result in issues when it is used in combination with the snake venom component due to the size differences between the two. This input lead us to find a small, four amino acid fibrin peptide chain to combat this problem. He also gave us comments about the safety of our system. He thought it might be interesting if we tried to engineer our protein, Cerastocytin, to turn it off. He thought that a solid matrix might be useful to prevent diffusion of the venom outside of the wound. Like Dr. Ritchie, he commented that creating a fusion protein with human and snake components might result in an immune response and the formation of antibodies. If antibodies did form, this would cause issues for repeat use of our product. This information made our team realize how our product could only be used on a one time basis. However in serious situations, our product would still be useful if it meant saving a life. Overall, Dr. Pryzdial’s comments gave us many things to consider"

Mycobacterium avium est donc ""safe"" pour l'environnement et également pour les personnes saines. En effet, l'infection, si elle existe, est localisée dans l'organisme. A l'inverse, l'infection est plus globale pour des patients immunodéprimés (à cause du VIH par exemple). Les effets de l'infection seront, bien entendu à analyser sur différentes phénotypes (sains, tumoraux, immunodéprimés) afin d'étudier la balance bénéfices/risques pour le patient.
D’autre part, notre Mycobacterium ne subsiste pas dans l’organisme. Celle-ci est en effet lysée lors de la libération du phage dans l’organisme, après l'ajout de doxycycline.
En ce qui concerne la doxycycline, celle-ci possède des effets secondaires comme une coloration des os, le syndrome de Lyell, le syndrome de Stevens Johnson, une anémie mégaloblastique, une ulcération œsophagienne, un bloc neuromusculaire, une porphyrie cutanée, ou une dyschromatopsie. Cependant, cet antibiotique est déjà largement utilisé par l'industrie pharmaceutique et ne présente pas de danger dans la limite où les doses et contre-indications sont respectées.

Phage Lambda
Notre vecteur cellulaire encapside seulement le plasmide d'intérêt – non son génome tout entier. S'il infecte une bactérie de la flore commensale de l'organisme (ce qui peut être limité par la modification des protéines d'internalisation), celle-ci ne recevra donc que le plasmide d'intérêt.
De plus, notre phage est un organisme procaryote, or les cellules du corps humains sont eucaryotes. Il ne peut donc pas y avoir de risque de recombinaison homologue ou d'intégration hasardeuse entre son génome est celui de nos cellules puisqu'ils n'appartiennent pas au même ""monde"".

Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," we need to simulate and validate our model? Estimating all the parameters based on our experimental results is not realistic, due to the large number of parameters, the nonlinearity of the system and the potential inaccuracy of our experiments. A straightforward way to obtain the values of parameters is to refer to literatures, results of previous iGEM teams and common sense. We trust that the simulations run based on these values of parameters should provide us with generally satisfying results, which can at least predict the general behavior of the system correctly.
The values of parameters we utilize are listed below.

NYMU-Taipei,2010,Team:NYMU-Taipei#Project#Speedy reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," the BiFC technique use split fluorescent protein instead of split enzyme in the PCA. The split form of fluorescent protein alone has no fluorescence. Fluorescence appears when two split parts reassembly together immediately in few minutes. For mRNA detection, we design a system differ from BiFC’s protein-protein interaction to RNA-protein interaction. Where a GFP is split into two inactive parts and fused with two parts of the split-eIF4A protein, a kind of RNA binding protein. On the other hand, we designed an mRNA aptamer that the eIF4A protein can bind to. EGFP will fluoresce through the interaction of split eIF4A and its corresponding aptamer. Using this method, we can immediately detect mRNA quantity and location in vivo. For protein detection, we design another system of BiFC which RFP is splits into two inactive parts and fused with two parts of antibody light chain and heavy chain. And then we fused the antigen to target protein. When target protein fusion antigen appears, the light chain and heavy chain combine with antigen. And then split RFPs reconstruct and fluoresce.
Design
The speedy reporter contains two parts:.
Split fluorescent protein
Protein-aptamer binding pair
In the design,each fusion protein contains a split fluorescent protein fused with peptide linker and combines with aptamer binding protein.
Using split protein method to make a speedy reporter:
The formation of chromophore is the rate limitation step to get the fluorescence.In order to save the time for the chromophore folding and to get a immediate fluorescent signal report,we split the fluorescent proteins at particular residues to make it contain a preformed chromophore.When they are in a split form,they are not fluorescent.
We fused the split fluorescent protein with the split aptamer binding protein,the fusion proteins are constitutively expressed.
When the aptamer is expressed,the aptamer binding proteins bind on the aptamer due to strong affinity,the split fluorescent proteins will recombine and restore the fluorescence then become a functional fluorescent protein.So we can get a fluorescent signal immediately.
RNA reporter Design
Our circuit design:
EGFP-eIF4A system / RNA aptamer on plasmid pSB1C3.
EGFP/ERFP + split eIF4A
split GFP/RFP
We split the EGFP/ERFP into two parts, the larger N-terminal part and the smaller C-terminal part. The N-terminal part contains performed chromophore and has a very weak fluorescence that is hard to detect. Only when it combines with the small C-terminal fragment, does the fluorescence become very bright. When both parts combine, we"

    However, from our Orthogonality test and Killing test , we find that we can just find warrior II that can be killed by warriors from the other group but not itself. Warrior I cannot satisfy this. Therefore, we improved our gene circuit by choosing specific combinations of AHL, receptor and promoter.
II Design 2.0
Fig. 2 Improved gene circuit of two warriors. The one on the top is warrior I while the one below is warrior II. The gene circuits of beggar and farmer are modified in a similar way.
    In this circuit, warrior II can only be killed by C4HSL secreted by warrior I, but not 3OC6HSL secreted by itself.
    Without TetR, we can see that C4HSL can activate expression of LacI by binding to RhlR and LuxR from the results of Orthogonality test . However, we have TetR here! C4HSL forms a complex with the protein RhlR inside warrior I. This complex activates the expression of TetR. TetR can then inhibit the promoter Plux/tetR, thus counteracting the self-activating effect. In this way, the expression of LacI is not activated so warrior I does not kill itself. We modify the gene circuits of beggar I and farmer I in a similar way so that warrior I no longer kill them. Its feasibility can be seen in Improved gene cicuit .

They could also search information in some databases and websites directly though this engine.  For most synthetic biology workers, it is difficult for them to conduct effective communication on experimental content, so we established a synthetic biology community based on search engine and report editor. In this community, bio workers can use this to record their experimental process and comment on other scholar's reports, thereby reducing the blindness of the research.
In The Future
As the advanced architecture and plugin system designed in our Biohub 3.0. It's pretty easy to improve our existed functions and provide new function by activating new plugins. Here are what we want to do in the future.
Improvements
It is super easy to accomplish your report rapidly by useing our editor. But we can make it better.
We believe it is possible to share your protocols and steps with anyone freely.
It is great significant to make it more efficient to build a new step or protocol.
Our editor takes too much memories and will be slow down when the report goes long.
The Search Engine at the moment supports searching by nature language thanks to the new nature language processing technology. The intelligence can be improved in understanding what users want and reacting more smartly. On the other hand, we can integrate more databases which are most used by biologists.  The society is still growing. That is why chatting and communication could be considered as an important facility in our society.
New Features
Several Interface has been implemented to make it easy to improve Biohub in the future without refactoring core codes. New codes can be considered as a module or plugin.  In the next generation of Biohub, We want to strengthen our society and build a society like Quora where biologists can post their ideas, ask questions, sale their e-books, have a free chat or find partners who share interest in a certain area.  If there is a matching hardware port, it could complete the experiment automatically according to the given steps and protocols. We could match the steps or protocols to the manipulator's operating instructions accurately. For this, we hope BioHub can help achieve experiment automation."

In the pre-panel survey, 42.9% of people had complete concern for the quality of their household water. This number increased to 60.9% which suggested that our panel demonstrated there should be a concern for the quality of our water. It is important to note that in the pre-panel survey, we had a total of 28 responses and in the post-panel survey we had a result of 23 responses, due to early dismissal and error of survey submission. However, survey results were based on a percentage and therefore still significant for analyzing the significance of our panel.
PRE PANEL
POST PANEL
Another way we measured information delivery was asking participants to rate on a scale of 1 to 5 on their knowledge of iGEM, genetic engineering, CRISPR, and E.Coli.
PRE PANEL
POST PANEL
These results suggest our panel was successful in providing information on these topics. Ethical considerations were an essential topic during our panel and surveys. We asked participants how they would feel about using genetically modified organisms to clean wastewater/water? (On a scale of 1-5, 1 = strongly against, 5 = strongly support). Ethical deliberation involves considering the impact our actions have on individuals, society, and the environment. Furthermore, we also asked participants to respond to the statement: “I believe the benefits of using genetically modified organisms to clean water outweigh the potential risks.” (On a scale of 1-5, 1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree).
PRE PANEL
POST PANEL
At the end of the panel, participants left feeling more confident about the use of genetically modified organisms for bioremediation. We can make this assumption based on the increased number of people who selected “strongly support”.  Furthermore, we can conclude that participants seemed more comfortable with the potential risks posed by the use of genetically modified organisms for bioremediation. More participants selected responses of 4 and 5 in the post-panel survey than in the pre-panel survey, indicating that they agree or strongly agree with the statement.
PRE PANEL
POST PANEL
Inquiring about participants’ prior knowledge of what pollutants in water are most dangerous provided an understanding of what society believes is important for public health. Within this question, we included all relevant pollutants such as microplastics, pharmaceuticals, phosphorous, and heavy metals. In the pre-panel survey, 39.3% of participants argued that microplastics and heavy metals presented the"

In addition to this, people of the Earth consume more than the total biocapacity, that can be regenerated from renewable resources in the same time span.  The Ecological Footprint of humanity is defined as the sum of the areas needed for biologically productive land and/or fishing grounds to supply resources  for the human population’s consumption, and to assimilate associated waste. This has exceeded  the biocapacity available since the 1970’s, as shown in figure 1.  In 2008, the total biocapacity of the Earth was 12.0 billion gha, and thus 1.8 gha per person.  In contrast to this, the total Ecological Footprint was 18.2 billion gha, and thus 2.7 gha per person. This ecological overshoot means that it takes the Earth around 1.5 years to generate the renewable resources. In other words we are consuming the biocapacity of 1.5 planet Earths every year, shown in figure 2, and this means that the bioc"

To introduce the lower school to synthetic biology and the ethics involved in this exciting field of science we created a weekly club within our school. We chose to make the club specifically for year 7s because by teaching them the basic principles of genetic engineering they can research further throughout their time in high school and form their own opinions about genetic engineering and potentially become the future iGEM team. The club provided the iGEM team with the opportunity to engage with the younger members of the school community and explore their opinions about the complex ideas we were introducing them to.
Each weekly 1-hour session in the BioBlast club built upon their knowledge about DNA and genetic engineering starting from the basics and gradually working up. We started by looking at cells and using microscopes to identify the nucleus, then in following sessions, we studied DNA and its structure. All our sessions had a practical element to keep students engaged since they were 11-12 years old. For example, when we were looking at the structure of DNA we used sweets to create 3D models - this was very successful as by the end of the session they could identify elements of the DNA structure. In following sessions, we transitioned onto Darwin and Mendel and the effect of genes on phenotypes (demonstrated by a practical involving Gelli-baff which mimicked natural selection) and then moved onto genetic engineering. It was in these sessions that big ethical debates were raised naturally by the students and lead onto organic discussions such as “Should we genetically engineer a ‘perfect’ human?” and “Is it ethical to genetically modify farm animals for agriculture?”.
It was very encouraging to see these debates developing without prompting from us and to see these issues discussed with a solid scientific background. In the final session, we played a board game created by the Exeter IGEM team in 2016 which taught the students about plasmid construction and illuminated the vast potential of genetic engineering- this was very successful as at this point the students had a solid scientific foundation and could follow along very well to a game created for slightly older students.

With FBA being the most basic form of analysis, there may be more than one optimal solution; these are often accounted for through more sophisticated techniques that employ mixed-integer linear programming (e.g. flux variability analysis, FVA) or even quadratic programming (e.g. minimization of metabolic adjustment, MOMA).
Aims 
Using the constraint-based model, we can delve into questions concerning the holistic behavior of the microbial cell factory, especially facets such as growth and overall productivity. We may look into how the addition of new and more sustainable substrate sources, may impact the cell growth and PHA yield. We maybe able to identify a maximal yield without compromising growth. Additionally, using the COBRA Toolbox, we can also simulate the metabolic network in cases of overexpression or knockout of certain pathway enzymes such succinyl-CoA synthase (sucCD) and investigate it would have predicted effects on product yield in our strain of E. coli.
The Model 
For the constraint-based modeling of growth and PHA biosynthesis in our recombinant strain of E. coli ,  we derived our GEM from iJO1366 , the most comprehensive GEM of E. coli   K-12 to date (Orth et al., 2011), and added onto it the heterologous pathway for PHA biosynthesis encoded by the pha operon.
To carry out these operations computationally, we used the COBRA Toolbox (Schellenberger et al., 2011) created by the lab of Bernhard Ørn Palsson at University of San Diego. Built for the MATLAB suite, the toolbox can be used to implement FBA as well as a plethora of other powerful (and awesome) functions. Using the toolbox, we added in the biochemical pathway for PHBV biosynthesis to develop the basis for projections into how we may optimize PHBV production in the E. coli  chassis.
Using the COBRA Toolbox to reconstruct and analyze a genome-scale model

Results and Discussion 
To first investigate how to best optimize the growth of E. coli as a biological host for PHA production, uptake of different carbon sources into the iJO1366 GEM were compared in silico using the COBRA toolbox. In order to best characterize the growth phenotype (denoted by setting the biomass function as the objective in F"

The Bio Reaction
Scaling up Oxygen Generation
We repeated the above experiment at larger scale with the following modifications. 50 mL cultures were grown overnight in 200mL Erlenmeyer flasks using the same conditions described above. In place of Cld(SP+) we used a culture of E. coli that contained no plasmid as a negative control. The next day stir bars were added to each flask and the cultures were stirred at moderate speed. Solid chlorite was added to each flask to a final concentration of 0.5M. A condom was placed over each flask to collect the generated O2 . Condoms were selected because of their thin, flexible nature that when filled with O2 would produce  an approximate cylinder whose volume could be calculated from it diameter and length. The results are presented in the video in the video above.
Conceptual Bioreactor Sketch
Martian soil and water are mixed together to create a sludge in this first module.
The Martian soil solution is filtered through to the next stage where the perchlorate ions are absorbed by rods filled with activated charcoal.
The activated charcoal rods are shunted into a module with boiling water. Boiling the water releases the perchlorate ions creating a solution of perchlorate ions. The solution is also diluted if necessary at this stage if the perchlorate concentration is too high, to ensure the survival of the E. Coli in the next stage.
The perchlorate solution is precipitated into a chamber layered with the genetically modified E. Coli where the perchlorate is converted into oxygen and chloride ions. Biomass from the mission is used to feed the E. Coli, and the waste can be reused as fertilizer for possible agriculture operations. The oxygen gas and chloride is separated by a membrane after exiting the chamber.

One enthusiast, Hans Loncke ,  aims to make exact copies of the existing authentic AvL microscopes. He makes his own microscopes by methods that would have been available to van Leeuwenhoek.  Using of one of Loncke’s facsimiles, Lesley Robertson has spent many hours trying to repeat Van Leeuwenhoek’s experiments, and  photographing and filming the results.
Many film fragments, photos, different light sources, an set-up spanning over 300 years and lots of patience has led to fascinating results. We are very grateful that we are allowed to show the following three movies, illustrating what Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek saw 300 years ago.
The movie below shows a clump of Vorticella feeding on bacteria. The animals are attached to sediment particles by their spring-like stalks which extend when the animal is ready to feed. When the mouth opens, the cilia around it can be seen beating to generate a vortex that traps the prey (usually bacteria) and carries it into the mouth for digestion.
The second movie, see below, shows an unknown worm that appeared during filming intended to prove that van Leeuwenhoek could work with a single candle for illumination. Protozoa can be seen swimming around the algae in the background.

Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," need about 0.025u CIAP for 40 uL of J63002.
After some consideration (see above), decided to follow a modification of this protocol.  To the reaction mixture I will add 5 uL 10x buffer, 44.5 uL gel extract and 0.5 uL CIAP.  Note that final concentration of CIAP was 0.01u/uL.
Incubated this reaction for 31 mins at 37 degrees C.  Added another 0.5uL of CIAP and then put into incubator again for ~32 mins.  Put on heating block at 70 degrees C for 10 minutes to denature the enzyme activity.
After this was completed, went straight into the ethanol precipitation.  It was quite evident that this was necessary due to the low concentration of DNA in both tubes (J63001 and J63002).
Need to make 3 M sodium acetate for the ethanol precipitation.
MW of sodium acetate trihydrate = 136.08 g/mol
For 10mL, this translates into 3 M * 0.010 L = 0.030 mol
0.030 mol * 136.08 g/ mol =  4.0824 g sodium acetate trihydrate dissolved in 10 mL water
Weighed out 4.0826g sodium acetate trihydrate and dissolved in 10 mL of solution.
To each tube, which contained roughly 50 uL, added 3 volumes of 100% ethanol (150uL) as well as 20uL of 3M sodium acetate (which was 1/10 the volume of the DNA and the ethanol combined).  Also added 1 uL of Glyco Blue.  Incubated in -80 degree C freezer for 1 hour, then spun in centrifuge that had been placed in the fridge (since a cold centrifuge was specified).  Spun first tube at 13000 rpm, which was possibly too much.  Spun second tube at 8000 rpm.  After centrifuging, removed the supernatant, allowed the tubes to air dry, and then resuspended in 20 uL of distilled water.
After the ethanol precipitation, it was discovered that the new concentrations were as follows:
J63001: 17.6 ng/uL
J63002: 15.5 ng/uL
Clearly, there was not much improvement for either.  Also note that now there is only 18 uL left, since 2 u"

Our cholera overnights don't show any growth yet, but as we are starting these overnights from plated cholera, it will take almost a week before we have good biofilm growth.
The SSW-LB that we prepared on 10/9 doesn't look right. It is darker than it should be and is really cloudy. We discarded this stock and made a new 500 mL stock following the recipe listed in the protocols section. The new stock looks right and is free of contamination.
Our DspB colony plate grew well, so we took eight individual colonies and ran Colony PCR on them following the protocol listed on the protocols page. The plate with the streaked individual colonies was placed in the 37° incubator overnight and the PCR was left running overnight.
10/12/13
We ran the plasmid prep kit on the pelleted PIG92 overnight. The purified plasmid was stored in the freezer in our parts registry.
We also ran our colony PCR products out on gel to check for the presence of our plasmid. We ran 3 uL of product with 2 uL of loading dye for each sample. It appeared that there were really faint bands on three of our eight samples, but the bands were so faint we couldn't tell if the plasmid was there or not. We also pulled the 8-colony DspB plate from the 37° incubator and stored it in the fridge until we can verify if any of the eight colonies contain our plasmid.
10/14/13
We re-ran our colony PCR products out on gel, but ran 5 uL of product rather than the 3 uL that we ran before. We were hoping that running more product would cause any bands to be more visible and allow us to detect them, but we got similar results. We decided to pick eight more colonies from the plate, ran colony PCR on them, and streaked them onto a LB-Amp plate and incubated it at 37°.

Beehives
Though no risk from microorganisms, modified or otherwise, was involved, our work at the Wageningen beehives also required some safety precautions. Working on a project like BeeT becomes much harder when you are covered in bee stings. Team members working on the beehives always wore at least the top half of a beekeeper’s suit, complete with gloves. Team members were never allowed to go to the beehives alone. Additionally, smoke from a bee smoker was used in order to keep the colony calm when disturbing the hive. (Bees are calmed by exposure to smoke, becoming less easily aggravated.) Even so, getting stung - through the fabric of snug-fitting pants, for instance - still occurred. We were provided with easy access to an epinephrine pen in case of severe allergic reactions, along with clear instructions for its use. For future work, we recommend the use of a full beekeeper’s suit, so as to reduce the amount of bee stings received.

Click here to see the Questionnaire
We have conducted surveys by designing questionnaires, distributing them to the visitors to our booth, then gathering their responses.  The questionnaire is designed to solicit information on the level of public awareness of the topics and issues related to the synthetic biology. The survey results, which are summarized below, will give us better understanding of the public awareness of the synthetic biology and tools to better plan our promotional, human practice activities in the future.
Most of the respondents belong to the age group of 10-18 years old.  In fact, more than 80% of respondents belong to that age group. The result is expected, considering that the survey was conducted at the Youth Expo. Male respondents are tree times larger than female. The largest age group is high school students, followed by under and over graduates. Since program providers are mostly high school and college club members, the result is expected.
B. Public Awareness of Synthetic Biology
In general, the younger the respondent is, less likely that they knew what the synthetic biology meant, or ever heard about it. Respondents aged between 10 and 15, 174 out of 222 (about 78.83%) answered that they have never heard of the synthetic biology. Respondents belonging to the age group 16-18 showed similar results: 75% (147 out of 196) have never been exposed to the definition of the synthetic biology.  As ages increase, more people answered that they have at least heard about it, or know what it is.  About 66.67% of people aged between 19 and 25 (52 out of 78) responded that they have heard about the synthetic biology. For older age groups, more than 55% of age group between 26 and 40 and 83% of age group between 41 and 50 respectively understood what synthetic biology means.  The result, however, is not reliable because the total number of sample belonging to these age groups are very few (only 15 out of 511).  Furthermore, that they are aware of the subject is rather expected, considering that they visited the Youth Expo at all, visited our booth and volunteered to participate in the survey. The results seem to suggest that the synthetic biology is not well understood or accepted among school age teenagers.
Comparing the result we got with the results obtained by the Team Oxford in 2014 iGEM and and UCL London 2010 (see the charts above), general public in Korean including high school and college students show higher percentage of people who have been informed of"
ZJU-China,2015,Team:ZJU-China#Practices#Application#Application Scenarios#first_-_-_TEXT.html," This habit also makes termites one the city pests, which are the most difficult and expensive to control.
Transmissibility
First, termites have the strong adaptability and viability. As long as there are proper temperature, humidity and nutrient, termites can survive.
Second, their reproductive capacity is severe high. In the breeding heyday, a mature termite queen's daily oviposition is over ten thousand. The spawning of one year reaches up to five hundred millions.
Third, termites could achieve different-distance spread and distribution by virtue of flight spread, pervasive invasion and factitious carry, owning to their strong transmission capacity.
The propagation of termites sometimes results in wide spread of termites' harm. Taking the Coptotermes formosanus as an example, which is the most harmful termite around the world; however this species once only distributed in several regions, such as Chinese mainland and Taiwan province. With the transportation of massive supplies in World War II, these termites' distribution range has gradually enlarged. At present this kind of termites has caused serious damages in numerous countries and regions, turning into cosmopolitan pest. According to incomplete statistics, all over the world, the annual expenditure of termites control exceeds a billion dollars.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
IGEM ZJU-CHINA 2015 has created TERMITE TERMINATOR, a genetically modified toxins expression system with a delivery carrier cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) , capable of trapping termites based on their trophallaxis, and then kill the whole nest.
We choose two kinds of toxins which are safe and environmentally friendly to eliminate termites. Separately over expressed in E.coli and another host, toxins were then delivered to the termites by the cell carrier. We have cloned genes coding insecticidal toxic proteins from Photorhabdus luminescens TT01, a bacteria poisonous to numerous insects, and express them in E.coli. Streptomyces avermitilis belongs to actinomyces, one of gram negative bacteria capable of producing multiple antibiotics. The insecticidal avermectin is one of secondary production of S.avermitilis. Judging that S.avermitilis is in Risk group 1, both the S.avermitilis itself and avermectin is safe to human.
Then, we prepared cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) , and generated the nanofibrous microspheres (NCM) self-assembled from CNC as bacteria carriers. We decided to have the carrier for: reducing the loss; improving transport efficiency;"

NYMU-Taipei,2017,Team:NYMU-Taipei#Nitrogen starvation_-_-_TEXT.html,"ysin-B0010-B0012. The endolysin in this part is from iGEM released part, BBa_K112806, which is the endolysin from the enterobacteria phage T4. Besides the endolysin, in this composite part, we choose BBa_J23106 as the constitutive promoter, BBa_B0034 as the ribosome binding site, BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012 as the double terminator, all of which are widely used parts in iGEM.
This figure is the gel electrophoresis result of endolysin PCR product.      The marker is 100 bp. The expected length is 514 bp.
This figure is the gel electrophoresis result of endolysin backbone PCR product.      The marker is 100 bp. The expected length is 2268 bp.
Holin Construct
We successfully constructed R0010-B0034-Holin-B0010-B0012. To control the precise suicide timing, we choose a lactose-inducible promoter, BBa_R0010, to regulate this suicide mechanism. Besides holin coding sequence and the inducible promoter, in this composite part, we also choose BBa_B0034 as ribosome binding site, and BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012 as double terminator.
This figure is the gel electrophoresis result of holin PCR product.      The marker is 100 bp. The expected length is 657 bp.
This figure is the gel electrophoresis result of holin backbone (from BBa_J04450) PCR product. The marker is 1 Kb. The expected length is 2458 bp.
Endolysin-Holin Construct
We successfully constructed R0010-B0034-Holin-B0010-B0012-J23106-B0034-Endolysin-B0010-B0012. We combined holin and endolysin for suicide mechanism. In this composite part, holin functions as an important regulator.
This is the restriction enzyme check gel electrophoresis result of holin-endolysin construct.      The marker is 1 Kb. We used XmaI to digest the sample. The expected total length is 3843 bp.
Endolysin-Holin-NrtA Construct

IISER-Mohali-INDIA,2017,Team:IISER-Mohali-INDIA#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"2015, small laboratory animals are bred for research and education. The animals bred therein are used for experiments strictly as per the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC).
• Laser labs
Labs working with lasers take special precautions like using IR blockers, safety glasses as mandatory while doing experiments. Also, the rooms with lasers are kept dust free to avoid contamination with dust, etc. Lasers need high voltage, hence are properly grounded and the personnel working with lasers always wear shoes while operating the lasers.
• Waste disposal at IISER Mohali
To mitigate the environmental burden caused by ongoing work in the labs, the waste is segregated depending upon the nature of waste before disposal. Waste from Biology laboratories are collected in special yellow bags, autoclaved and only then, discarded. Any harmful compound containing waste is collected separately in black bags and processed as per the requirements. The plastic or glass wares of the waste are collected by the appropriate companies and then treated for further usage. Various chemicals and media from all labs are neutralized (for example, via bleach treatment) before disposal.The disposal of animal waste from the Small Animal Facility for Experimentation (SAFE) is done as per guidelines provided by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB).
• Pertaining to the project
The principle organism (DH5 alpha strain of E.coli) and all parts being used come under a risk level 1 classification, which are white-listed by default. DH5 alpha being a dependent micro-organism (for synthesis), will fail to thrive in an external environment, part of the containment strategy. Further containment is ensured through the use of a 0.2 micron filter paper which is permeable to atmospheric gases, but not the bacteria. The co-cultures to be used will fall either under a risk level 1 or 2 classification. Any remaining causes of concern can be incinerated, along with device (the method of disposal)!
We realize that the implications of our work go beyond safety, namely ethical, legal, and social issues. For the same, the institute’s Bio-ethics Committee, Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC), and Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee (IACUC) have been constituted. They include not only members from IISER Mohali, but also those from other institutes like IMTECH, PGI, NABI, etc., that are well versed in human practices.
No animals (or their parts) have been used/harmed during the construction of our device. Every step of the project has satisfied requirements from within the institute as well as legal requirements from the"

Collaboration with TMMU-China
This year, TMMU-CHINA aimed to build a quorum sensing tool kit based on the Agr system from the Gram-positive bacteria-- Staphylococcus aureus. However, they were not able to synthesize the genes agrC and agrA in plasmids,                 and therefore, the experiments were not able to conduct. Fortunately, we had the similar construction and                 provided them with our group I Staphylococcus aureus’ s agrC and agrA genes. The plasmid we sent them is shown below.
And, thanks to TMMU-CHINA for willing to help us to test the efficiency of antimicrobial peptides LL-37, GF-17, Grammistin-Pp1,                 and DRGN-1 on Staphylococcus aureus with our own protocols.
Collaboration with ZJU-China
When conducting the Interlab measurements, we accidentally kept LUDOX-S40 at -20 °C and made the silica irreversibly precipitated.                 Thanks to ZJU-CHINA for sending us a tube of LUDOX-S40, and thereafter, we carried on and successfully finished                 the experiments.
Collaboration with Lanzhou (The iGEM team)
In September, we received an invitation from Lanzhou iGEM team for a video interview on the dilemmas and issues our team                 had encountered and how we dealt with them. We conducted a video communication on 30th and exchanged ideas                 about the current situations of project development in our respective universities. Furthermore, the management                 of the iGEM team was also discussed in this conversation.
On balance, this conversation benefited both of our teams a lot. Through helping Lanzhou with their human practice investigation,                 we gained much experience on team operation and learned how to resolve the unforeseen issues.
Collaboration with Greece（The iGEM team）
In October, we helped Greece with a survey questionnaire about evaluating their project’s benefits and potential side effects.
