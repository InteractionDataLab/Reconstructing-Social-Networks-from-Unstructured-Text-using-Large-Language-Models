BNU-China,2014,Team:BNU-China#investigation.html_-_-_TEXT.html,", et al. reported high-resolution structures of the ligand- binding region of the cluster II McpS chemotaxis receptor (McpS-LBR) of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 in complex with malate and succinate (Fig.7 B& C) . The root mean square deviation (rmsd) between the malate and succinate cocrystal structure is only 0.2 Å indicating that differences in the nature of the ligand do not significantly alter the protein structure (Table 1). In a sequence alignment of McpS-LBR homologs containing McpS-LBR of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the amino acids involved in malate and succinate binding are conserved. R60 is almost fully conserved, whereas the remaining residues are conserved to between 30–80% (Estela Pineda-Molina, et al.)
Table 1. Properties of the model
Fig.7 (A) The structure of malate and succinate, and the thermodynamic parameters for the 2 compounds that were found to bind. (B and C) View of the interaction of malate (B) and succinate (C) with the McpS-LBR. Malate binds to a cavity formed by α1 and the C-terminal segment of α6, and its coordination is achieved through interactions with R60, R63, R254, and T258 from one monomer and Q65 from the other monomer. Residues R60, R63, and Q65 form part of helix α1, whereas R254 and T258 are part of α6. Succinate binds to McpS-LBR in an almost identical manner as malate. Unlike malate, succinate has no hydroxyl group at C2. Therefore, the two hydrogen bonds that are established between the malate hydroxyl group, and the protein cannot be formed in the succinate structure. The remaining interactions of succinate with R60, R63, R254, and Q65 are analogous to the malate structure where they establish six hydrogen bonds.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

However, bacteria cannot naturally produce resveratrol. That is why in this part of our project, we wanted to introduce resveratrol pathway in Lactobacillus. In this purpose, we focused on the enzymes of this pathway. There are two indispensable enzymes to make bacteria produce resveratrol.
Biosynthetic pathway of resveratrol. The biosynthesis of resveratrol by the coupling of p-coumaric acid to CoA by the 4CL enzyme. Subsequently, coumaroyl-Co1 is converted into resveratrol by sequential addition of three malonyl-CoA units with the release of carbon dioxide.

4-coumarate, coenzyme A ligase (4 CL) and Stilbene Synthase (STS) enzymes have to be expressed in bacteria.
We based on Rice Igem Project of 2008 to start our project. We needed to know if 4CL and SLC enzymes were already available to make the genetic construction. Part: BBa_K122012 of Rice University consists on the fusion of 4CL and STS enzymes. First of all, we needed to get the enzymes biobricks before express them in bacteria. In this purpose, we wanted to design new biobricks. Grape is well known to produce an important rate of resveratrol. That is why wanted to extract these enzymes from grapes.
To get these enzymes from grape, we obtained cDNA from a reverse transcription on grapes pericarps extracts. We performed a PCR on the two genes: 4CL and STS in order to assemble them within a single biobrick under the control of a promoter (R0011 http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_R0011 ) induced by the presence of lactose in the growth medium.

COMMUNICATION
 
If Newsletter builds cooperation as the bridge to connect with other teams, our communications via net-video and face-to-face meeting establish a deep friendship with counterparts.
 
We initiated net-video meetings with the iGEM teams in Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), Tientsin University (TJU) and National Chiao Tung University (NCTU). We were so excited to see their faces on the screen that some of us talk over one another. Huang Jianxing had to keep order from time to time. We delightedly shared our progress and experience, and introduced our ideas with each other. During the meetings, we learned a lot from our counterparts: SJTU put forward a design of a video in which the development of iGEM in China would be shown, and their imagination astonished us. The campus cultural festival of Tokyo Tech showed a creative Human Practice idea, and we found we two were quite different in selection methods of team members, the manner of working, and the way of thinking, from which we were illuminated a great deal. And it was the innovation of TJU’s idea that convinced us. It is particularly worth mentioning here that NCTU’s enthusiasm really inspired us a lot.
 
 
In addition, we were glad to call on iGEMers in other universities. On July 25th, Chen Jielin paid a visit to the iGEM team in Zhejiang University (ZJU) who generously provided some strains for us. And we were so happy to see 3 members from ZJU again during their reciprocal visit to us. Liu Yang visited TJU’s lab on July 28th, and she brought back their latest progress and experience. Fan Wu and Yue Jiang reported our idea in University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

The enzyme model can then be called a theozyme. Rosetta then Score. Rosetta Scores correlate with Gibbs Free Energy, but do not measure entropy directly, only indirectly. The design process utilizing Rosetta3 can be broken down into four parts: choice of catalytic mechanism and corresponding theozyme, matching identifying sites in the scaffold library where the theozyme can be placed, designing the found sites, and evaluating and ranking the resulting designed sequences. This process allows one to alter the substrate specificity of an enzyme4.
Foldit is a program that provides a visualization of all of the interactions a protein makes. It is particularly helpful in viewing hydrophobic, aromatic stacking, and hydrogen bonding interactions. Foldit also contains a scoring function that useful for understanding the effects the potential side chain mutations can make. We made the following mutations, listed below, to enhance binding.

If the designed protein is successful, it will hydrolyze the autoinducer at the thioester linkage and produce free cysteine with exposed thiol groups. To determine the protein’s activity, we utilized Ellman’s Reagent. This reagent enables us to measure the concentration of sulfur in solution with UV absorbance. The reaction that Ellman’s Reagent undergoes in the presence of sulfur can be seen below.
Initial results are promising. As the figure shows, when the thiol absorbance of AIP and the protein are measured individually, the combined absorbance is 0.326. However when the two are measured simultaneously (interacting with each other), the absorbance rises to 0.367. This appears to indicate that the protein hydrolyzed the peptide and increased the sulfur concentration.
FUTURE
The designed protein contains a total of seven cysteine residues. While these should be accounted for with the background absorbance measurements, it would be ideal to remove this absorbance by mutating the residues to another amino acid with similar properties, such as serine.

About Calgary
Calgary is the largest city in Alberta, and has a population of over 1 million.  It was founded in 1875, when the RCMP erected Fort Calgary (then Fort Brisebois) to protect the western plains from whiskey traders. When the Canadian Pacific Railway reached the area in 1883, Calgary grew into an important commercial and agricultural center. Currently, Calgary's economy is dominated by the oil and gas industry, and major attractions include Canada Olympic Park (the site of the 1988 Winter Olympics), Calaway Park, the Lilac Festival, and the Calgary Stampede (an annual agricultural fair founded in 1905).  Calgary is also situated near the Rocky Mountains, and plays host to a unique weather phenomenom called the chinook. Famous Calgarians include the young, incumbent mayor, Naheed Nenshi, who is the first Muslim to become mayor of a major Canadian city, as well as the current Prime Minister of Canada, Conservative leader Stephen Harper.
The University of Calgary
The University of Calgary is ranked as one of Canada’s top comprehensive research institutions. Currently, more than 30,500 students are enrolled in 14 faculties in undergraduate, graduate and professional degree programs. The University contains more than 30 research institutions and centres, including the O’Brien Centre within which iGEM Calgary operates. The university is also the birthplace of many inventions including the neurochip, and has had 140,000 alumni since its founding in 1966.

The COSMIC project from Sanger institute allowed us to determine which genes to bring to the therapeutic plasmid in the non-small cell lung cancer case. This project sums up all detected mutations for each type of cancer in function of their appearance frequency. So, from their data, the loss of apoptotic capacity of tumor cells for lung cancer can be due to the functional loss of proteins from the following genes :
These different genes play a predominant role in the application of the apoptotic process and are the most susceptible to be mutated in the lung cancer case. They compose the therapeutic plasmid .

The objective
The objective of this study is to check if a wild type version of a tumor suppressor gene inside the tumor cell, for which the own version is mutated, induce or not the apoptotic phenomenon.
Experimental approach
Cancer cell line and reported gene
Cancer cell lines, which have a mutation of tumor suppressor gene has been selected from our database. We also possess a wild type version of the TP53 gene. Then we choose the prostatic cancer p53 mutated DU-145 in the goals to test if bringing the wild type version of the p53 protein (p53wt) in the DU-145 cell line allows to induce the apoptotic process.

Applications of VitaYeast
Human Practices
By using the IRB system to validate and approve our survey of attitudes toward genetically-modified foods, we are bringing the typical iGEM survey up to a new standard. Surveys conducted under the auspices of the IRB produce results fit for publication.
Despite the promise of VitaYeast, its reception might still be hindered by the public's concerns with genetically modified food. These concerns typically include, but are not limited to, safety and environmental impact. However, as technology advances and more natural resources are depleted, the impact of genetic modification will become more significant to society. Therefore, in addition to our wet-lab experiments, we hope to gather data to help us understand the concerns of both the developing world and local communities regarding genetic modification and the global food supply. While we stand firm in our faith of synthetic biology as a powerful tool for addressing global health needs, it is critical that we place our solution on a firm path towards global adoption.
Golden Rice
Featured on the cover of Time Magazine. Source
One of the first things we investigated in the Human Practice Division was golden rice . Like VitaYeast, it synthesizes beta carotene.  Crucially, it also has been studied. Because of golden rice, we know what obstacles we may run into once VitaYeast is developed.
Although hailed by TIME magazine as ""grains of hope"" that could ""save million kids a year,"" many people had problems with the fact it was genetically modified.  Also, in certain African countries, humans tend to eat white grains, while animals ate the colored grains.  Urging the people in those countries to eat golden rice was the equivalent of telling one to eat something"

We believe that if our method is approved by the Brazilian government for distribution, we could not only reduce the rate of dangerous at-home abortions, but potentially lower the rate of associated health complications and death in fertile women.
China
Zhi, Former Chinese Citizen
We spoke with a former Chinese Citizen named Zhi. When Zhi lived in China, they witnessed first-hand the one-child-per-couple policy where women were often felt forced to have abortions or be sterilized; babies were often abandoned or given up for adoption, especially if the child was female (Munjello, D.E., ""The Great Encounter of China and the West""). Read More >> Thankfully, the regime change in 2016 allowed women to have up to two children; however, the number of children a woman can have is still determined by the government rather than by the parents, and with the government’s desire to increase the Chinese population, birth control is becoming more difficult to access. According to Zhi, many people in China are unfamiliar with contraceptives and Chinese officials are working to spread such information using social media. We hope that our brochure can help the Chinese officials’ efforts to provide better knowledge and understanding of modern contraception methods.
Colombia
Yeraldin, Colombian Citizen
Yeraldin, a Colombian-born citizen, believes that our birth control method research is a meaningful pursuit. According to Yeraldin, “there are many unwanted pregnancies in Colombia, but it is a problem because there is no money to buy [contraceptives]”. Yeraldin believes that an easy, affordable birth control option could minimize the large amount of unplanned pregnancies currently in Colombia. She does not know of any specific rumors on birth control in Colombia because birth control is rarely discussed. We hope to prompt the discussion of birth control by contacting Colombian officials in charge of regulating contraception and ask them if/how they plan to combat the ignorance around birth control.
Maria, Universidad de los Andes
A few members of our iGEM team attended the 2018 BMES Coulter Conference. At the conference, our team members met a student named Maria from Universidad de los Andes. She helped us gain insight on birth control in Colombia. Read More >> According to Maria, there are three primary healthcare plans in Colombia"

Data Analysis of Co-culture of CB008 Const+rtTA+GFP+mfa+pAGA+mCherry Run
After running the data on FlowJo and Matlab, we compared the data to the original pAga1+mCherry pTEF1, M7, and M10 data.
The comparison showed slight variation and unexpected results.
Maybe due to the larger cells being too stressed from producing so many proteins, and the overall population producing less as a result of this.
After comparing the data, it was decided that the best option would be to rerun this experiment but with pTEF1, M7, and M10 separately put on the plate as a comparison.
Started growing cultures of pTEF1, M7, and M10 in the incubator.

Our human practice work involves several questions relating to biosafety, social justice and public acceptance. Our aSTARice is actually a genetically-modified organism, so our work focuses on people's concern about GMO (genetically modified organisms).
1. Self-improvement
First of all, we should make sure that we ourselves have correct understanding on this question. Because of this, we took part in some lectures about transgenic.
The first lecture was given by Jianping Kou, who is from the Department of Science, Technology and Education"" in MOA(Minstry of Agriculture) of China, and Min Lin, who is the director of Institute of Biotechnology of CAAS(Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences). In this lecture, we got to know that transgenic food sold in market are absolutely safe because they were tested by many relavent departments and labs in valid as well as scientific ways for many years. And up to now, only a few kinds of transgenic products have been given permission into Chinese market. After lecture, we communicated with these scientists about new technologies uesd in transgenic researchs.
Apart from that, we also took part in a talk given by Yongning Wu, who is the director of ""Key Laboratory of Food Safety Risk Assessment, Ministry of Health"" belonging to China National Center forFood Safety Risk Assessment (CFSA). In this talk, we obtained a lot of information in analysing GMO.
As we would like to create a new kind of crop, we thought we should also know more about agriculture, so we joined in The Sixth Asian Conference on Precision  Agriculture as voulnteers.
2. Innovative and venture talk
As most undergraduate students have no idea about how to carry out a biological project correctly, we held a talk on innovative and venture in our college. We gave a speech about our two projects and our ways to do biological research, such as how to get papers from some databases and how to communicate with professors. Our talk attracted more than 300 students and most of them were impressed by our fantastic ideas.

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Membrane_-_-_TEXT.html," membrane current due to ionic flux creates an electric field in the nerve that produces a potential difference outside the nerve called extracellular voltage. It is this extracellular voltage that a measuring electrode will perceive. For a myelinated axon, these ionic currents appear only at the nodes of Ranvier.
III. Modelisation of the currents of a axon’s membrane
Although our objective is the measurement of the extracellular action potential, it is necessary to know the currents produced at the level of an axon.
From an electrical point of view, the myelin sheath of the axon acts as an insulator, preventing the appearance of transmembrane currents elsewhere than at Ranvier's nodes. In fact, seen from the outside of the axon, the action potential seems to jump from one node of Ranvier to the other. Let us now consider how to model this propagation, in order to extract the transmembrane currents at the nodes of Ranvier.
1.  Electric model of an axon
We used the model of Hodgkin-Huxley to describe the flow of electric current through the surface membrane of a giant nerve fiber. The electrical behavior of the membrane may be represented by the network shown in Figure 2. Current can be carried through the membrane either by charging the membrane capacity or by movement of ions through the resistance in parallel with the capacity. The influence of membrane potential on permeability can be summarized by stating: first, that depolarization causes a transient increase in sodium conductance and a slower, but maintained, increase in potassium conductance; secondly, that these changes are graded and that they can be reversed by repolarizing the membrane.
Figure 2: Electrical circuit representing membrane. RNa = 1/gNa; Rk = 1/gk; Rl = 1/ḡl. RNa and Rk vary with time and membrane potential; the other components are constant.[3]
Thanks to this model, we are able to determine the evolution of the membrane’s potential (V), ionic current (Ji) and capacitive (JCM) densities as a function of time (Cf. Figure 3).
Figure 3 : Components of membrane current during propagated action potential. A, membrane potential. B, ionic current density (Ii), capacity current density and total membrane current density I. C, ionic current density (Ii), sodium current density (INa) and potassium current density (IK).[3]

Here's a little bit about us
Queen's University is located in Kingston, Ontario, a beautiful limestone city which was Canada's first capital. Their iGEM team is composed of dedicated students who have devoted their summer to working with synthetic biology, toiling away in labs, promoting the field to others through outreach, and having a blast along the way. Our project this year initially began as an idea to remove foot odour. It eventually evolved to a much broader idea involving mosquitoes, malaria, and smelly feet!

One of the events took place at the 'Cité des Sciences' (a known Science Museum in Paris) called “Parfums Microbiens”. During three days, we held up a stand that included posters explaining the relationship between the microbiome and body odor, a place to analyze sweat samples using our 'Smell Game' software, and an area to exercise playing a 'Wii' game and donate sweat samples. During this event, we collected around a hundred samples and had about 200 people play the smell game.

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," some joining. It was also prime vacation time so we were a bit short handed but we survived…. barely. Unfortunately, this week brought many difficulties. We were having the same issues with our Cas9 project as before, our gel imaging system was not working, and there were problems with sequencing, so we were not able to make much progress this week. We decided to add a secretion part to our Banana project design and found a part in the kit that we transformed into E. coli to attach at the end of our TLP. We also made agar plates with varying concentrations of fusaric acid to test what concentrations of this toxin would cause our cells to die. We also started working on our complete Metal project plasmid and did a 3A of our lead and zinc plasmids.
August 7- August 13
This week, our Experiment.com page to fund our iGEM team got approved. We did some work with the banana project by ligating some different parts together and miniprepping. We also ran a fluorescence test to check for the RFP to make sure it was functional. Since fusaric acid killed some of the E. coli, we are testing its toxicity to normal competent cells as well. We are almost finished with the metal plasmids and should be able to start testing soon.
August 14 - August 20
This week, we were really trying to focus on the banana project since it has encountered a number of unexpected roadblocks and has been lagging behind some of our other projects. We attempted to do some ligations to attach a secretory component and checked it by running it on a gel. We attempted to use this new plasmid with an even stronger promoter in fusaric acid. Unfortunately, all concentrations of fusaric acid killed the E. coli and only the control group grew. We may have to look at a different way to test our project since fusaric acid is not allowing us to check for phenotypic changes.
August 21 - August 27
For the banana project, we worked on adding a secretory system in for the TLP. Our metal plasmids are all ready to be tested, but we need approval to test the lead plasmid since lead is a hazardous material. We started reaching out to local high schools that might be interestested in having us pay them a visit. We were running experiments with our hardware project to determine how fast our centrifuge will need to be to be feasible for most protocols.

Detection of Ha-tagged pcol E9-ssp1 and ssp2: Single colonies of pcol E9-ssp1 and pcol E9-ssp2 were grown overnight in 5ml LB with 0.5% glucose at 37°C. 250μl of cells were then grown in 25ml of LB at 37°C until they reached an OD of 0.5A. They were then represssed with 0.2% glucose and induced with 0.2% arabinose and 0.5% arabinose and incubated at 37°C for 5 hours. 2ml sample of each was taken, pelleted, then 100μl of laemmli sample buffer and B-mercaptoethanol was added to each and they were boiled for 10 mins. 20μl of samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) transferred to membrane and probed with HA-antibody. pcol E9-ssp1 and pcol E9-ssp2 were expressed when induced with arabinose at both concentrations.
Once we had confirmed that our fusion proteins were being expressed, we needed to see if they were toxic.

And finally our primers arrived!! (after 3 weeks). We did PCR of the different parts that we need to build our first construct (the Working Plasmid). For that we:
a) Obtained the parts necessary to make the Working Plasmid and transformed e. coli with them.
b) Did minipreps of all the constructs to purify the DNA from the transformed bacteria.
c) Amplified the constructs in the thermocycler.
d) Did electrophoresis of the PCR amplicons.
We had several problems with the electrophoresis, but after some attempts it worked. 5 of the 7 PCR were successfully amplified. The two parts that didn´t work are HIV cleavage site (2kb) and vector backbone pSB1K3 (42kb).
April 16-22, 2012
We did electrophoresis with HIV cleavage site and pSB1K3. This time, we added more of them (4 μL template in PCR) to ensure that they were present in our tubes.  We had now all the parts that we need to proceed! We made our first Gibson Assembly to build the working plasmid (see constructs). We need this plasmid to build the GFP Reporter Plasmid and the Protease Producer Plasmid. But unluckily our colonies resulted to be red. This is not what we expected… later we did an analytical digestion to the DNA of those colonies, but we obtained strange results. Something went wrong.
This week we had the great opportunity to assist to a lecture of Dr. Aldo Leal. He is a Chilean biochemist that currently works in Germany studying the interactions between cells and biomaterials made of spider silk proteins. We learnt a lot of information about the production of recombinant spider silk proteins and the possibility to easily create films. Then, it’s not necessary to utilize other sophisticated spun methods like electrospinning. Later we met with Dr. Leal, and he recommended us the following very important paper:"

High River Wastewater Treatment
Our team has collaborated extensively with the High River Wastewater Treatment Plant; speaking with Jason Craigie (Treatment facilities supervisor) and Eugene Lund (Manager of Operational Services). We wanted to know where the best place in the Wastewater Treatment Plant to integrate our bacteria would be.  From meeting with the High River Wastewater Treatment Plant representatives we learned that the largest fat build up problem happened where sewage and drainage pipes met - called lift stations. We looked into integrating our bacteria there, but soon discovered that lift stations are anaerobic, with the average temperature below optimal temperature for our bacteria. This would hinder the production of our enzyme in bacteria, causing our solution to not be as effective. With the help of our local representatives, we found that our bacteria would work best separate from the current wastewater process. Currently, fat in our sewer system is manually removed through a vacuum, then physically broken down by high air pressure.  The problem with this method it that fat often clumps back together once reintroduced into the system. Our plan would be to introduce out bacteria to the phase in the current fat removal method where that fat is separated from the system. Our town’s local wastewater treatment system has separate concrete pillars, which the town has offered to let us use to introduce our bacteria to the removed fat. Our method would chemically break the triglycerides down, reducing the probability that they would join back up again.
Cargill
We have also met with representatives of our local Cargill facility. Cargill is a local industrial plant located outside of our town (High River).  As the factory produces lots of wastewater, they have set up their own wastewater treatment facility. We met with Sean Murray, (environmental superintendent) who is responsible for the wastewater treatment facility. Sean told us that the Cargill facility uses bacteria to produce a biofuel, which is then converted into power for the factory. Sean told us he would be interested in collaboration for the use of our e. coli in Cargill’s wastewater system.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2014,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#asoMain#Project#Background-Problem_-_-_TEXT.html," injury that can be more damaging than the initial ischemia. (5) Reintroduction of blood flow brings oxygen back to the tissues, causing a greater production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species that damage cells. Hypoxic cells could use excessive oxygen because of their boosted oxygen consuming systems which results with high production of these ROS particles. Further inflammation would attract white blood cells to the perfused site inducing them to secrete more ROS to the field because of recognizing the inflammation as a threat to the body. These ROS can damage all of cell components including DNA, cell membrane and organelles.
TIn prolonged ischemia (60 minutes or more), hypoxanthine is formed as breakdown product of ATP metabolism. The enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase acts in reverse that is as a xanthine oxidase as a result of the higher availability of oxygen. This oxidation results in molecular oxygen being converted into highly reactive superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. Xanthine oxidase also produces uric acid, which may act as both a pro-oxidant and as a scavenger of reactive species such as peroxynitrite. Such radicals and reactive oxygen species attack cell membrane lipids, proteins and cell components causing further damage.
Because of these, an effective and safe treatment of ischemia must allow us to both remove hypoxia and prevent reperfusion injury caused by ROS production and its related pathways such as xanthine degradation.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," whether they were expressed correctly and decided to use a simple SDS-PAGE for that purpose. Subsequently, we tested the combat proteins' activity, purified them and attached them to spider silk.
Figure 3: Expression, purification and testing of combat proteins
To test the functionality of the combat proteins, we decided to work primarily with biofilm assays using S. aureus and P. aeruginosa since they provide a quantifiable, clinically relevant readout. Simply put, the bacteria are incubated in conditions allowing them to form a biofilm and then the biofilm-degrading proteins are added either straight away (providing data regarding the inhibition of biofilm formation) or after biofilm had been established (measuring the ability to disperse biofilm). At different timepoints, the biofilm was stained, liquified and the absorption measured in a spectrophotometer.
Apart from the biofilm assay, we also used modified Kirby-Bauer tests where filter papers soaked in cell lysates were placed onto agar plates with bacterial cultures streaked on them. If the enzymes within the cell lysates were bacteriolytic or bacteriostatic, they inhibited the colony formation in their environment, leading to halo formation around the filter papers.
Conjugating Combat Proteins to Spider Silk
Once the combat proteins were assembled with an appropriate LT sequence and purified, the conjugation was going to be fairly straightforward. Sortase A is able to catalyze the formation of a peptide bond in between two glycines - one found on the LPETGG sequence of the combat proteins' tag and the other one naturally present on the spider silk.
Once the wound dressing components are fully assembled, more biofilm tests could be performed, alongside different stainings to visualize how the components of the biofilm are broken down in response to treatment.
Sortase A
Sortase A is our matchmaker enzyme and is used to conjugate combat proteins to the spider silk. Its sequence was easily isolated from S. aureus genome and subsequently, two modifications from the wild type Sortase A were planned to improve solubility:
Truncation of the enzymes so that the transmembrane domain (amino acids 1-59) would not be included in our BioBrick
N-terminal addition of GB1, a Protein G domain well known to increase solubility of recombinant proteins
Additionally, an endogenous XbaI site was aimed to be removed via site-directed mutagenesis in order to comply with BioBrick standards.

Fig.16 After nematodes ate the bacteria with rMpL.
Discussion
During our experiment, we found an interesting phenomenon. When we changed our pBAD promoter to constitutive promoter, and growth of the E.coli became much slower(Fig.17). pSB1C3-BW25113 is the bacteria with the pBAD promoter and the pSB1C3-BL21(DE3) is the bacteria with constitutive promoter(BBa_J23100). We can easily find the difference.
Fig.18 Cultivating for 5 hours.
Fig.19 Cultivating for 10 hours.
We think it may because rMpL could do harm to the E.coli themselves. Hence, it verifies that the pBAD promoter is more suitable than constitutive promoter.
Circuit Design and Test
pcyA+ho1
We connected gene pcyA（ BBa_I15009 ）and ho1（ BBa_I15008 ）together along with the constitutive promoter( BBa_J23100 ) through overlap PCR. After we transformed the restriction-ligation product into E.coli TOP10, we did colony PCR to test if we had successfully synthesized this biobrick. The agarose gel electrophoresis showes that this biobrick was successfully constructed(Fig.20). And this work was helped by BIT-CHINA, for more information, please see the collaboration section .
Fig.20 The agarose gel electrophoresis of pcyA+ho1, the bands pointed by arrows represent the expected result. Lane M, DNA marker DL2000; Lane 1 to 12, colony PCR of pcyA+ho1 biobrick; Lane 11, presents an approximately 1500bp of pcyA+ho1 band which is as expected.
PompC+RFP
We constructed the PompC-RBS-RFP circuit first(Fig.26), when we just transformed this circuit into the E.coli Top 10, we wondrously found some of the colonies became red. It indicated that these colonies had expressed RFP. It indicated that these colonies had expressed RFP. It means without the regulation of OmpR, promoter PompC can start the transcription of the downstream target gene. And then we sequenced these colonies which expressed RFP. The result indicated that the PompC-RBS-RFP circuit did lead the expression of RFP.

University of Texas Fall Undergraduate Research Symposium
This was the Rice iGEM team’s second year to present at the University of Texas Fall Undergraduate Research Symposium (FURS). Not only was it an opportunity to share our research, but we were also able to meet with the UT and Texas Tech iGEM teams. This meeting led to an exciting modeling collaboration with the UT team. We were honored to be the Computational and Synthetic Biology session award winner.
Gulf Coast Undergraduate Research Symposium
The Gulf Coast Undergraduate Research Symposium (GCURS) on November 4, 2017 will be the final formally organized event at which we will present our research and spread awareness about CrVI before the Jamboree. We will be presenting in the Systems, Synthetic, and Physical Biology division to Rice students and professors and to visitors from other institutions alike. Through this event, we hope to spread information about CrVI to people from the regions surrounding Houston who might also find elevated CrVI levels in their water and to reflect on all the work we have done for iGEM this year.
Humans of SynBio
Humans of SynBio is an initiative modeled on the format of Humans of New York that is now in its second year. We interview synthetic biologists from all over the world and post a brief excerpt from the interview along with a picture of the scientist on our social media platforms. These posts show a more human side of a field that can seem austere and intimidating to outsiders."

Safety
There is risk associated with almost any laboratory experiment, especially when working with live biological agents.  However, our team has gone to great lengths to minimize the risk posed to the researcher, the public, and the environment.  Overall, our project can be considered low risk since the finished product is not intended to come in contact with humans in any form.  Our E. coli and Rhodobacter sphaeroides cultures should only be grown and tested in a bioreactor with proper laboratory safety technique.  Even in the event that either strain was ingested, its is very likely that no harm would occur since the bacteria are not able to survive the environment of the human digestive system.  The two major safety concerns associated with our project arise during DNA purification using gel electrophoresis and extraction of PCB from spirulina powder.
Gel electrophoresis is necessary to purify DNA for almost all steps of our project.  To make DNA visible as it moves through the agarose gel, Ethidium Bromide (EtBr) is added to the gel to act as a fluorescent tag.  Ethidium Bromide itself is a potent mutagen and a known carcinogen that may be absorbed through the skin.  For this reason, a separate lab bench has been set aside for all items coming into contact with the toxin including pipets, tips, gel rigs, glassware, and DC power sources (for electrophoresis).  In addition there is a vessel designated as contaminated where all disposables (i.e. pipet tips) maybe deposited and properly disposed of at a later date.  It is important that all items coming in contact with EtBr remain on the EtBr lab bench and all noncontaminated lab materials are not brought to this bench.  Nitrile gloves must be worn when handling EtBr and replaced frequently, especially when going back and forth from this bench to another one.
Phycocyanobilin (PCB) is necessary for the final testing"

**The bacteria had created precipations which made the measurings unreliable.
Figure 5: Specificity inhibition test. Top row is control plates, bottom row is with colicin. From left to right Lactobacillus Plantarum, Klebsiella, E. coli, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter.
Since the experiment did not give any clear results we did the experiment again with new lysates, one with colicin Fy and one negative control. At first it seemed as if the colicin Fy killed most of them but at a closer look we saw two types of colonies on some of the plates, probably contamination. When plating out the lysates that should be sterile, some bacteria still grew, but they grew much more in the controls. If the contaminated plates are ignored the colicin Fy seems specific, but more experiments need to be done to be sure. Due to lack of time this was not possible.
Figure 6: The E on the plates stands for Enterobacter, the C stands for control lysate added while B for bacteriocin (colicin Fy) added. the numbers 10, 100 and 300 stands for the amount of µl of lysate added.
Figure 7: Controls of the lysate to see if they were contaminated or not, to the left is the control lysate while the bacteriocin is to the right.
As seen in fig. 7 the control lysate is much more contaminated than the bacteriocin, this explains why the control plates in all cases have more bacteria on the plates plated with 300 µl of lysate added compared with all the others. Different types of colonies can also be seen on most of them.
In conclusion there are some indications that colicin Fy is specific but more tests need to be done.

Functionalized biotinylated and biotin-binding membrane proteins
Our membrane proteins (also referred to as 'receptors') enable the polymerization of cells into three-dimensional cellular matrices during bioprinting. Therefore, our receptors present biotin or biotin-binding proteins on their surfaces, and - being co-injected with a biotinylated linker peptide into streptavidin solution - immediately 'glue' to each other by the means of synthetic biology, allowing printing of defined three-dimensional cellular structures.
Figure 1: A) Schematic depiction of the modular structure of the created genetic receptor constructs.  B) Schematic depiction of the modular structure of the membrane receptors for cross-linking of cells via biotin-streptavidin interactions.
The following extracellular domains were constructed and tested:
1) A biotinylated receptor containing an extracellular biotin acceptor peptide that is endogenously biotinylated by a coexpressed biotin ligase (BirA) and thus presents biotin groups at the cell surface.
The biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) is a 15 amino acid peptide sequence originating from E. coli. [1] Being biotinylated by the biotin ligase BirA at a lysine residue within the recognition sequence, it mediates the functionality of the receptor by presenting biotin, allowing the interaction of the cell surface with streptavidin in the reservoir solution.  The biotin ligase BirA is therefore encoded by the same vector as the receptor, with an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) allowing translation of two open reading frames (ORFs) from a single bicistronic mRNA. BirA is targeted to the ER via an Igκ signal peptide and trapped via an ER retention signal (C-terminal KDEL-sequence), allowing it to efficiently biotin"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Software_-_-_TEXT.html,"Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them.

Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," tRNA suppressor for the colour switching.
Remove the bad smell of E. coli
Our lemon should smell like a lemon. Our chassis is Escherichia coli , a bacterium known to have a foul odor. We thus have to remove the genes involved in this particular phenotype. The tnaA gene is required for the degradation of tryptophan into indole, the main molecule at the origin of E. coli smell. We use a phage transduction method to reach our goal.
Lemon Scent
The particular odor of lemon is mainly due to 3 monoterpenes: limonene, beta-pinene and geranial. We will clone the 3 monoterpene synthases responsible for the production of these 3 molecules into our bacteria to allow them to produce this fragrance. We will also  improve the production of the GPP precursor using a synthetic mevalonate pathway using the construction of the team of T. S. Lee.
Lemon appearance and Ripening
Since vision is one of the most important senses in humans, we want the lemon to look as real as possible. To achieve this, we plan to make our lemon look green or yellow, like a real one. Furthermore, we also want to simulate the ripening process of the lemon by changing its color gradually from green to yellow.
Artistic Part
Lemon Shaping
1st  idea
We basically wanted to build up a lemon tree in which one we would have put lemons we had made. As lemons pass from green to yellow, we would have simulated the season’s cycle.
Boston Installation
2nd  idea
The idea was to project the shadow of a little sculpture in a screen or a wall: the positioning of the light with respect to the sculpture would have enabled the creation of shadow ten times bigger than the sculpture itself. The aim of this structure would have been to show the gap between a object and its image, between real things and decoys.
3rd  idea (chosen for Boston)
Finally we decided to modify the second idea (for logistic reasons). The element which could this time reveal the gap between an object and its image, between real things and decoys, would be a mirror …

Every working person in the lab is trained on safety issues.
We have a safety and a disinfection officer at our lab.
No unqualified personal has access to the lab.
No public access to the lab.
We reduced the risk of contamination of the environment or staff members by desinfection, autoclavation and using of protection clothes.
In case of emergency there are telephones, fire extinguishers, defibrillators and alarm buttons around the lab.
We only used organisms of the risk stage 1, which do not harm neither mankind nor the environment.
We modifed an unhazardous organism with specific, identified and characterized BioBricks. So we can appraise the risk causing by the modified organisms.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

Using protocol E. coli KRX single step competent cells by Promega
Remove Single Step (KRX) Competent Cells from –70 °C, and place on ice for 5 minutes or until just thawed
Add 1–50 ng of DNA (in a volume not greater than 5 μL) to the Single Step (KRX) Competent Cells. Move the pipette tip through the cells while dispensing. Quickly flick the tube several times. Do not vortex!
Immediately return the tubes to ice for 5–30 minutes
Heat-shock cells for 15–20 seconds in a water bath at exactly 42 °C. Do not shake.
Immediately place the tubes on ice for 2 minutes.
Add 450 μL of room-temperature SOC-Medium to each transformation reaction, and incubate for 60 minutes at 37 °C with shaking (approximately 225 rpm). For best transformation efficiency, lay the tubes on their sides and tape them to the platform.
For each transformation reaction, we recommend plating 100 μL of undiluted cells and 1:10 and 1:100 cell dilutions on antibiotic plates. Incubate the plates at 37 °C over night.
Standard BioBrick Assembly
modified from Silver lab :
This assembly method can be used for BioBricks which are bigger than 150 bp. The BioBrick should be at least 500 bp bigger or smaller than the backbone. The BioBrick, which complies with these conditions, is used as the insert and is assembled into the prefix or suffix of the other used BioBrick, called vector. So you have to differentiate between a prefix and a suffix insertion.

A 3xFLAG-tag is added to the C-terminal of the scaffold. This affinity tag can be used for detection and/or purification purpo ses. Reference: Sigmar-Aldrich: 3xFLAG system. Visited: 16.09.15 -
We also made another version of the device containing intein. Intein Intein Intein is a thiol-induced self-cleavable protein that enables the release of a C-terminal fused protein. It also contains a chitin-binding domain, which is an affinity-tag that enables affinity purification on a chitin column. First the target protein fused to intein is loaded and washed on the chitin column. Using a thiol reagent, like dithiothreitol (DTT), an on-column cleavage is induced and the target protein is released. enables affinity purification of the hTrx-based peptide aptamer and self-cleavaging ability, thus releasing the peptide aptamer from the purification column.
To validate that the T18 and T25 domain constructs can be used to study protein-protein interactions, we fused leucine zippers Leucin Zippers Interaction between the leucine zippers will induce formation of cAMP.

The sequence that includes the antibiotic resistance marker and the replication origin is held within the backbone of the plasmid. The image below depicts an example of a sender gene for LuxI, one of the senders we will be testing.
Previous research used just one AHL at a time with the Lux receiver to catalogue the functionality of potential circuits. The Lux F2620 is a composite gene constructed by standard assembly from five BioBrick standard biological parts (Canton et al., 2008). In this research, we will be combining and testing two different HSLs in the form of freshly grown cultured sender cell (filtered) supernatants. Different concentrations of the two senders will be tested with one receiver at a time to catalogue our ten senders for crosstalk, orthogonality, signal disruption and possible circuit enhancing combinations. Results will be measured using Green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in the receiver bacteria. The GFP expression levels will depend on how well the AHLs bind to regulatory proteins inducing transcription of the GFP. This can change based on the AHL concentration and how much crosstalk there may be between the different senders. The differences in GFP expression levels will be used to evaluate how well the HSLs signals are being received compared to the other combination samples. Results can then be analyzed based on the varying percentages of one supernatant to the other combinations of senders that were used. Signal strength (induction) over time provides information about the strength of the overall induction (GFP/OD). The rate of induction will be analyzed using the hill equation to better understand how the concentration of AHLs affects induction. The addition of these details to the known catalogue of QS pathways will make for easier development of specific synthetic circuits in the future designed to operate either faster or slower depending on the specific need.
Some of the specific questions this research aims to answer are: how do combinations of senders affect gene output? Can we find any combinations of senders that increase the overall GFP expression? Can we find any combinations that do not affect the GFP expression?
The specific senders chosen for the induction tests were selected because previous research showed that they have either a very low or very high rate of GFP induction when used in a single sender/ receiver circuit. In other words, the chosen senders tend to either work very well or not very well at all and we need more data on how well these senders express the gene when used in combination with another. By combining two senders at a time, sometimes with senders that have shown to induce a high GFP expression and sometimes with send"

ColumbiaU_NYC,2016,Team:ColumbiaU NYC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," across different CTAB      plates. There were no visible halos for low concentrations      of rhamnolipids indicating that we might need to calibrate      CTAB to detect lower concentrations of rhamnolipids. We      also conducted the CTAB test using live E. coli cells with      the RhlAB recombinant plasmid, but there were no visible      Halos possibly due to low Rhamnolipid concentrations. The      overall conclusion is that the CTAB test may be used as a      qualitative analysis, but is not reliable as a      quantitative method due to condition-dependent halo      diameters. We found a different assay called an orcinol      assay that may be used in place of the CTAB test.

We focused on counting the exact levels of survival using cell count methods.
Mosquito Experiments
Because the lab at Rockefeller University did not respond      to emails, we contacted the Fidock lab at Columbia      University. The Fidock lab has extensive experience with      Malaria experiments and has incubators that they would be      willing to allow us to use. We made a meeting for the      following week and began to draft experimental plans to      discuss with Professor Fidock in person.

Molecular Cloning
We received S. Epidermidis strain RP62A, shuttle strain      S. Aureus RN4220, a plasmid pC194 from S.A. RN4220, a      plasmid pC221 and pGO1 from S.A. OS2 from Dr. Jiang at      Rockefeller. We will start cloning next week once we      design the primers.
Freeze Dry
Experiments were conducted using M9 minimal media or LB as      the rehydration media. The lyoprotectants used was either      10% Sucrose or 10% Sucrose with LB. Based upon the      analysis conducted in the freeze dry research paper,      survival rate was calculated. The highest survival rate      calculated was 2.25% using LB as the rehydration and the      10% Sucrose lyoprotectants.
Rhamnolipid Quantification
As a way of detecting rhamnolipids, we decided to try      thin-layer chromatography (TLC). For different staining      methods, we tried orcinol with 50% sulfuric acid, orcinol      with 10% sulfuric acid, CAM, and KMnO4. We discovered that      orcinol with 10"

I am Mounia, and I am very interested by the interface between biology and chemistry. It is an important aspect in the Master’s degree in pharmacology I want to pursue.
On the other side of my personality coin, I really enjoy going out and do sport. I love to go to the cinema, I have been practicing Crossfit for more than 2 years.
I have been given the chance to participate in the iGEM competition. I worked mainly in “wetlab”, I was involved in communication and sponsoring and I was helping in the design part (the wiki, the Tshirt,etc). For undergraduates (like me), it is an opportunity to get more experience in the setting up of a scientific project and in labwork.
I really enjoyed the team spirit and the funny moments spent with the other members of the team! Humanly it was a good experience of sharing and collaboration.

I am a research engineer in Dr. Faulon's Lab and the advisor of the Evry iGEM team 2016. The iGEM competition is for me a good opportunity to share my knowledge and my experience about this competition, as I did iGEM in 2014.
My main task is to take care about the administration part of the project and to be present when my team needs me for an advise or the wetlab.
I hope that in my future, after the PhD, I will become a great researcher and to be accepted in the Wyss Institute. It's my dream
Otherwise, I like to cook cupcakes!!! My funny fact is that when I have a lot of things to do at the same time and my brain freezes, like I don't remember me what I should do, I tap myself on the head to restart my system ^^.

INTRODUCTION
Science divulgation can potentially achieve a powerful fusion of public and scientific values. Understanding current research and its developments is mandatory in our society, and science communication can make people aware of this. Researchers need to be able to explain their work making science constantly open and accessible to the public, demonstrating that their work is safe for the rest of the society. In this context, Valencia UPV iGEM Team decided that time for changes has come and we proposed to give people the opportunity to discover a new revolutionary discipline in scientific field: Synthetic Biology.
Since increasing the social outreach of our project is decisive, we decided to organize different social levels in our Silver Human Practices work. Innovative approaches have been done at each one in order to spread how SynBio can help to face the main challenges of our society.
UNIVERSITY LEVEL
University appreciates plurality of opinions and interdisciplinarity of their students in order to go forward in knowledge progress. Thus, we decided to transmit to university students with different profiles what SynBio is about and how iGEM contributes in our society progress.
FINE ARTS
Fine Arts students were our first target since we consider that a cooperation between science and arts is mandatory in order to enrich both fields with the benefits of each other. After exposing an initial proposal of our project, we organized an activity in which fine arts students should present a graphic design proposal about our project, fusing SynBio and fine arts. Amazing posters were designed, and several students focused their attention on this project joining as full-time students to participate in the amazing iGEM experience.
This experience gave us the opportunity to realize that SynBio-related developments are barely known for undergraduates, so we decided to extend our outreach to other university fields.

Ionis_Paris,2016,Team:Ionis Paris#Events_-_-_TEXT.html," exchanges between students and teams, partnerships being forged, friendships getting created … As said by Madeleine Premm, member of the LMU-Munich TUM team: ""The event is top and multicultural: we really meet people from different places! Everyone is very outgoing and noone is afraid to ask questions or present his own project, his career, his studies, etc… Each discussion is interesting. The event also allows team building and is also a good workout for the final Jamboree in October: you can practice your English and get used to describe your project ».
Conferences
After 3 hours of exchanges and a good meal, everyone ends up in the auditorium for the two round tables.
Throughout the whole day, the iGEM teams of the world could live The European Experience 2016 on Facebook and Twitter with hashtags #EE16 and #iGEM2016.
Furthermore, we organized a retransmission of the two conferences on the iGEM IONIS Facebook page, live and free!
The opening ceremony was led by Paul Indelicato, deputy director of Thierry MANDON’s cabinet, Secretary of State for Higher Education and Research.
The first thing to know about this symposium is that we wanted to organize an event as much entertaining and sharing as possible. That’s why we planned a main scientific symposium through two roundtables to maximize the exchange between the speakers and the audience.
Then, we decided to focus our both roundtables about synthetic biology of course. However, we didn’t want to only deal with sciences in a global way.
That’s why we planned to divide our scientific symposium into two related but different roundtables.
Round table #1
Synthetic biology : challenges & risks
From left to right : Andrew TOLONEN (Research Scientist & Research Professor at Genoscope) Héloïse MULLER (Research Scientist at Institut Pasteur), Christophe GENISSET (Biology project leader at General Secretary of the Defense and the National Security), Alexei GRINBAUM (Research scientist at CEA) and François KEPES (Research director at CNRS & Director of iSSB).
This conference is here to explain the purpose of Synthetic Biology. Nowadays, it is really important to better understand the challenge of Synthetic Biology. Indeed, it is going to be the future of many fields of expertise. Our 5 different speakers shared with us their own expertise and help us discern the key points of synthetic biology development.
The first one, named “Synthetic Biology: Challenges & Risks” was dedicated to the academic world."

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Collaborations#Blog3_-_-_TEXT.html," note is the scope of these protections. In this original copyright act, applicants’ work was guaranteed protection for 14 years. Fast forward to today: copyright protections will protect an individual’s work for the life of the individual, plus an extra fifty years [5]. Furthermore, the Copyright Act of 1790 only protected an author’s work from explicit verbatim copying and no more than that. This led to an interesting situation where Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, attempted to sue the German translator of her work when they secured a copyright for the German translation.  In 1853, the Pennsylvania Circuit Courts decided that the translation was not an infringement upon Stowe’s copyright, as it did not constitute verbatim copying. The Pennsylvania Circuit Court argued that “A translation may, in loose phraseology, be called a transcript or copy of her thoughts or conceptions, but in no correct sense can it be called a copy of her book” [6]. To give this example some context: imagine if Harry Potter (originally written in English) was translated to Spanish by another person, under the original copyright laws.  If that was the case, J.K. Rowling would not be able to protect the translated copy as her own work. Fast forward to today: copyright obviously protects the translation of an author’s works, but the scope of copyright has grown to protect not just texts, but photos, songs, software, and even architecture. (A big extension to the copyright laws was made in the Copyright Act of 1831, which allowed “musical compositions in the list of protected materials, along with books, maps, charts, prints, cuts and engravings.”[7]) Indeed, the U.S. courts eventually concluded that the essence of work protected by copyright is “in the substance, and not in the form alone.” [8]
Much as the scope of copyright laws increased – in both duration of protection and content protected – patent law in the United States also grew to encompass greater varieties of functional inventions for lengthier periods of time. In 1842, Congress extended patent laws to cover industrial designs in an effort to stimulate the industrial revolution at home. Congress also passed the Plant Patent Act of 1930, which allowed patents on unique cultivations of plant species. Interestingly, patent laws also grew to encompass surgical procedures after World War 2, unfortunately leading to a host of ethical dilemmas concerning the monopolization of life-saving treatments. This issue was addressed in 1996 when Congress granted physicians freedom from liability for infringement of patented medical practices. [9]

Do you think it is viable to put GMO in the soil?
""Obviously, it won't sound good to most people, although I think from a legal standpoint it could be entirely possible, specially in most banana producing countries . It has to be guaranteed, however, that the use of this technology is not going to affect other processes and microorganisms in the soil.""
Do you see immediate problems with our project?
""In the first place, GMOs in general don't have good press to start with, and as we were saying now, it could be affecting the soil ecology. We would need field experiments and extensive documentation on how the GMO bacteria works to support that there is no risk of horizontal gene transfer, that it's not interfering with trophic networks, etc.""
How would the public react to using a modified bacteria in the soil?
""Not well, definitely! People with technical know-how could embrace it and admit it as one technology more that is available. I, personally, see more danger in using other solutions like organophosphoric compounds, which are environmentally dangerous. than in using this sort of biocontrol solution. But this is my personal opinion: some colleagues would simply say “no GMOs!”.""
Let's say that Tropical Race 4 shows up in the Canary Islands and we finally completed our GMO bacteria. What would you think of using it?
""First I would need to verify that the law allows it, and that you have done studies showing that it's not going to cause trouble in the soil. Although I personally don't support the use of GMO plants in certain conditions, I think we don't have to stop progress, just bad applications of technology, but we need the greatest guarantees.""
What if a GM banana that was resistant to Fusarium was developed?
""Resistance based on GMOs, I think, end up not working. With bananas there is no risk of spreading the transgenic plant, but probably you would just get, in time, a new variety of Fusarium that attacks the new banana plant.""
Which is preferable, a self-destructing bacteria or one that stays in the roots?
A priori the former makes more sense, that's what we do with our biocontrol. That way you prevent it from getting established in the ecosystem and driving out other species from their ecological niche.

Aalto-Helsinki,2015,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," was synthesized prior to the coding sequences of the cellulases which would then move into cell’s periplasmic space.
Cellulase producing capacity would have been first investigated with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) plates which are labeled with Congo Red assay. Congo red dye is the sodium salt of 3,3'-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4,4'-diyl)bis(4-aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid) which has a strong affinity to cellulose fibers. If the cellulose polymers are digested by enzymes on the plate, the spot will be changed into colorless and a halo will appear around the bacterial colony. However, the method will not tell whether glucose is produced or not.
For glucose analysis, 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid would have been utilized. It is a compound which reacts with reductive sugars like glucose forming 3-amino-5-nitrosalicylic acid. The product absorbs light with the wavelength of 540 nm. Three different controls are needed when analyzing the produced glucose concentration because the cultivation liquid with CMC already contains sugar: one without any strain, one with E.coli without cellulase producing capacity and one with cellulose hydrolyzing. Furthermore, liquid chromatography could also be utilized if we find proper equipment.
Micelle Fusions Enhancing the Production
Based on the previous studies about this pathway , we knew the propane yields weren’t very high. We thought about trying to enhance the system by searching for homologs for the enzymes, but thought this would be too time-consuming and also not very innovative. We then ran into a research article by Huber et al. . The group had designed a synthetic amphiphilic protein that spontaneously formed membrane-like structures inside the cell. These proteins were designed quite like membrane lipids: there is a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic end. According to the energy minimum principle, the proteins’ hydrophilic ends will face the liquid phase of the cell and the hydrophobic ends will pack together. This way the proteins will be able to form either a double layered vesicle (similar to the double lipid layer) or a micelle.
To both enhance the knowledge of these amphiphilic proteins and to gain better yield of propane, we thought of fusing enzymes to these proteins. This would bring the enzymes close together and possibly enhance their productivity. Because our system is so big, we needed to make some compromises - we didn’t think it was possible to attach all 10 of our pathway’s enzymes into"

(TR,CB) When looking at our Common Procedures, we realized that we were not supposed to run our SOEing PCR product and vector on a low melt gel without first doing a restriction digest.  We are going to try and save our product by doing the restriction digest by melting the insert at 65 degrees C and using that.

Hereditary Fructose intolerance is a rare genetic disorder, caused by a deficiency in Aldolase B, leading to liver or kidney failure after fructose uptake. We will genetically modify the probiotic Lactobacillus johnsonii to metabolize fructose and sucrose instead of glucose in order to effectively remove these metabolites. Therefore, we will knock out enzymes involved in glucose metabolism and increase the uptake and metabolism of fructose and sucrose. In order to avoid a significant impact on growth rates we will select suitable knockout targets based on an analysis of in silico models of closely related species. Since cloning is the main work in both our and most other iGEM projects, we want to make cloning faster, easier, and cheaper. We will achieve this by creating backbone inserts for a new plasmid series, that will allow the use of negative selection and a novel plasmid purification technique with the iGEM 3A assembly."

The nickel chromatography was not completely successful, but there is some purification of Tn5. The Tn5 did not completely bind to the nickel resin and was observed in the flowthrough (lane 6). It is recommended to further optimize the nickel chromatography to further reduce losses, and reduce contaminating proteins due to non-specific binding to the nickel resin (lane 8). However for our purposes, the losses were tolerated.

3.4 Determining Buoyant Force: Temporal Tracking Algorithm
Now that we have an expression for vertical displacement as a function of time which depends on the buoyant force as a parameter, we want to determine the magnitude of this buoyant force. In principle, this is not a difficult task as it can be solved using the built-in least-squares optimization curve-fit functions, in say, MATLAB. The difficulty lies in acquiring experimental data to fit to. Our proposed solution to this is to acquire images from a stationary point of view at evenly spaced, small time intervals and perform image segmentation and analysis techniques to track the vertical position of floating biomass frame-to-frame. In reality, the biomass will be clumped into many clusters, so clustering and labeling algorithms are employed. The advantage of using a visual tracking algorithm to observe vertical displacement is that researchers can exactly characterize flotation, benchmark their results, and calculate how different variables affect flotation.

Safty Form
1 . Would any of your parts or project ideas raise safety issues?
No,The biological material used in our project are E.coli K12 and B strain, which rank group 1 in safety risk according to the ABSA. The main idea of our project is to regulate the expression of enzymes in the pathway of propionate synthesis by gene clone. Maybe it will burden E.coli thallus itself, but less threaten to researchers, the public or the environment.
As we want to make the microbe in human’s intestine function the same way as E.coli do outside the body in the future work, a lot of condition difference need to be considered. Firstly, we should make sure that E.coli K12 will not cause any pathema when they work in the guts. Otherwise, we will transform the genes to another microbe that belongs to intestinal probiotics. We have also thought about the crowd psychology about the medicine with live microbe. After a small surgery on the campus internet, we found that most of them were reluctant to use microbe as medicine. But if we give them the example of yoghourt, vinger and distiller's grains (a kind of chinese sweet food, like congee,by glutinous rice fermentation).
2 . Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
No, we do not believe that the BioBrick parts made this year raise any safety issues. Our biobrick parts consist of an operon encoding four enzymes in propionic acid synthesis pathways and synthetic gene oscillator. The four genes are all endogenous in the E.coli K12 and the function of biological oscillator has been demonstrated in the reference paper.
3 . Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, there is a non-official group constituted by safety officer in every laboratory. They supervise everything related to safety like sanitation, reagent consumption, instrument application and even personal dressing.They will record the improper behavior and point out to warn the staffs in the regular meeting every week.
4 . Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Better documentation and standardization of parts is required. And some safety analysis tools should be extensively incorporated into synthetic biology models. Through"

Ops Normal: a novel protein sequestration sequence to prevent a phenotypic switch in Candida albicans
Candida albicans is a fungus that, despite being considered part of normal human flora, has the potential to cause life-threatening systemic infections. Candida infections are the fourth leading cause of hospital acquired systemic infections and result in mortality rates of up to 7.1%.1,2 Candida albicans becomes pathogenic after a phenotype switch from white-to-opaque or opaque-to-white, depending on the infection site.  The USAFA iGEM team cloned the 5’ UTR of the master white-opaque phenotypic regulator (WOR1) into a vector to act as a protein sequestration sequence.  To confirm successful cloning of the 5’ UTR and expression of our vector, the team used E. coli as our model organism.  Once integrated into the Candida albicans genome, our genetically engineered part should sequester transcriptional regulating proteins away from the WOR1 transcript and alter the phenotypic switching tied to the pathogenicity of Candida albicans.

Collaboration with Georgia Tech iGEM Team
Our team is mentored by Styczynski Lab at Georgia Institute of Technology.  Over the summer, our Lambert iGEM team visited Georgia Tech and with the current Georgia Tech iGEM team. During our visit, we presented and explained our project and they, along with Dr.Styczynski and Dr. Liangjun Zhao, were able to give us advice.  We used these pointers to design our project.   In particular, they helped eliminate some projects that would have not worked at all in the scope of our timeframe, including a CRISPR cas reporter for Wheat Stripe rust.  They played a major role in assisting us with our initial construct ideas. We used the IDT offer of gBlocks to order several different constructs.  In turn, we had the privilege of listening to their project as well. We asked questions about their designs and discussed our experiences at the Collegiate Jamboree in 2013 and 2014.  This was valuable to them as members of their team had not been to a Jamboree before. Lastly, the team led us on a tour of the new Engineered Biosystems building and labs.  Without this type of collaboration, it would be impossible for our team to have as successful of a project.

Rheda_Bielefeld,2018,Team:Rheda Bielefeld#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"-387). So the capability of the student's performance suffers from the medicine and another side effect is fatigue.
Jeroen Buters, a professor at the technical university of Munich, showed real interest in our general  project. Even after the Giant Jamboree, we want to stay in contact with him because he wants to continue research of our project in the future.
Another thing we had to think about was the negative side of developing a biosensor. If the biosensor debuts, the center for pollen in the technical university of Munich which counted the pollen before would lose their purpose and it could cause a loss of jobs because the pollen were counted by hand with a microscope.
Asking the fruit juice industry
We communicated with the  fruit juice industry.
We found out that the fruit juice industry uses pectinase for clearing the juice, which is an important step for clear apple juice. If our E.coli could produce the pectinase, it could be used in the fruit juice industry because the amount of pectinase the industry needs is „quantum satis“ (limitless).
If there is a chance for the fruit juice industry to use the E. coli, it needs to be approved for the food production by the European Union that tests the E.coli if it is detrimental to ones health and if it can be used by the industry.
So this could be another way to use our E. coli and to research in the future.
Results of Human Practice
To conclude, our Human Practice we found out that there is a general interest in our idea and that not only the medicine but also the fruit juice industry could make profit out of our project."
Lethbridge,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," is ethical(1). Though this is in direct conflict with the oath to “Do No Harm” it is an accepted practice in the medical community. There are misinterpretations though, I believe that this situation can be a misinterpretation of that practice. The Doctrine of Double Effect stands in cases such as: a military sniper killing a terror bomber or a catholic doctor performing an abortion in a case where pregnancy would kill the mother. What these have in common is that they are last ditch efforts to save lives. The purpose of this project is for the topical application not to be a last ditch effort, but for it to be a go-to in the case of an emergency. In this case, because the possible chance of harm may outweigh the possible good, it may not be considered ethical.  Development of procedures to minimize risk will be essential to make the solution ethical in this sense.
4. ""First do no Harm"" as it relates to a potentially harmful biological product (Talia) The saying “first do no harm” is one which is heavily related to bioethics and medicine. It refers to the way that both in the medical and scientific community we are meant to make choices. This was developed as a basic way to evaluate all choices as sometimes they can be fairly tricky and need to be made quickly. The basis of this viewpoint is to do what you think is right first in high stress situations, but also to maintain respect. This means that though you know your treatment or project could be helpful if the people most directly affected does not agree with what you are doing you are not free to do so, and to do so would be wrong. (1) The do no harm viewpoint also emphasizes that one should not place people in a historical order meaning that when considering the effects of one's project you should not place on viewpoint or person in preference but rather all as equal. (2)This applies to the project because when considering the effects of the project one must consider the true effects it could have on those directly affected or the patient's. First of all let's look at application. With the current implementation method there is still a possibility, though limited that a patient could experience sepsis or another effect from the biological system or that the snake venom could cause the blood in the patient to clot somewhere other than the  womb sight. Applying the first do no harm principle in a high stress situation if this could save the patient's life then they should do so. However if the patient is able to consent they must provide this consent. The second issue is surrounding that of the use of a GMO on a person. Many people"

The FreiGEM 2012 Team
Our interdisciplinary team mainly consists of undergraduate students from every corner of the scientific landscape and beyond: Medicine, Biology, Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science and even Philosophy.
Our team leader Nicolas started the team in autumn 2011, when he first discussed participation in the competition with a small group of colleagues of his and some molecular medicine students, which were instantly enthusiastic about the prospect of taking part in a famous synthetic biology competition. The remaining team members joined in following up on announcements, through contact with former iGEM members or oral propaganda. The first meeting of our team was held in a Pub in Freiburg in November 2011 as an opportunity to get to know each other.  Since 2011, weekly iGEM meetings were set on to get things moving: finding a promising idea, investigating former projects and interesting methods, founding a non-profit association, scouting sponsoring options.  In spite of meeting every single week, it almost took us until April, that we finally pinned down an idea for our project: the development of a method to assemble a TAL protein with 14 DNA binding sites in one single reaction and the aim to use these proteins to direct effector enzymes to specific target sequences within the genome.  To realize our project, we were  able to go back to the unique knowledge of every single team member. Be it in research issues, financial questions or website-related problems, everyone in our team did his or her best to make the most out of the project.  During the period of lab work, we tried to spend at least some time together away from the lab to strengthen  team cohesion. We had a barbecue in Nico´s garden, bike tours around Freiburg and the"

Introduction
Short for logical genetic designer, LGD is an online computer aided genetic circuit designer. LGD has two major features: 1, it is online! Unlike other computer aided graphical designing program such as TinkerCell，Our LGD is an online software. 2, it is integrated into the Registry of Standard Genetic Circuit. Every project in the Registry of Standard Genetic Circuit comes with a LGD design, users can make their own modification and improvement in the original design.
Tutorial
LGD can be access from the Registry of Standard Genetic Circuit. When you go to the “circuit” page of a project, click the ""View and edit in LGD"".
LGD is constitute with the control panel and the coding frame panel on the left.
Let take the project “A Synthetic Genetic EdgeDetection Program (Eco900_00)” for example, if we want to add a newcodingframe in the existing gene circuit just click “Add new codingframe” button. Then you will get a new coding framing:
Adding a part by clicking

YES! Finally a construct that seems to have the correct length! Both the analytical digestion and PCRs seems to confirm our construct.                                   The construct was also sent for sequencing.                                   We spent some time trying to figure out how to test the plasmid. We ended up retrieving the BBa_K592009, BBa_K592010, BBa_E1010 and BBa_J23110 parts from the distribution kit, and pair them. The idea is that if we are able to make a construct in our backbone, we should see a visual output.                                   Unfortunately we were not able to retrieve the BBa_K592010 from the distribution kit, and it was decided to leave this for now.
Substrates
Contamination of experiments was determined with microscopy. Might come from the minimal media being contaminated.                               First test on complex glycerol based media. Y. lipolytica seems to grow better than Saccharomyces cerevisiae.                               The growth form on different C-sources is analysed with microscopi. There seem to be different amounts of planktonic and filamentous growth depending on energy source.

Microscopy results
Without IPTG
At time point 1, the cells did not express gfp and there was little evidence of sporulation (see figure below). Examination of the sample taken at time point 5 (see figure below) revealed the presence of a few spores inside the mother cells and only minimal gfp expression. Some spores would be expected since natural sporulation was not disabled and the cultures were approaching stationary phase.
With 1mM IPTG
Again, at time point 1, the cells did not express gfp and there was little evidence of sporulation (see figure below).
As can be seen, at time point 5 (shown below) with the addition of 1mM IPTG there are many spores due to the increased expression levels of KinA. In addition, many of the cells are showing high levels of gfp expression and many of the gfp expressing cells can be seen to contain spores.
Hence we can conclude that the sporulation was mainly triggered by our device.
We therefore believe that the sporulation rate tuning device works as expected.
If we had time we would like to characterise this brick even further by carrying our sporulation assays (using the heat resistance of spores as a selective measure) and by flow cytometry to accurately measure the sporulation rate.

Bioremediation
Bioremediation is the concept in which biological organisms are used to repair the environment; essentially, when biology meets ecology. This is an advantageous way of eliminating radioactive/toxic waste at radioactive storage sites and facilities. Physicochemical clean-up costs of such sites can amount to as much as 265 billion dollars, making bioremediation a cost effective and environmentally intelligent way of eradicating hazardous toxic waste2.
The process of nuclear waste bioremediation utilizes microorganisms such as bacteria to break down or precipitate harmful, radioactive substances. In order for this to occur, the organism being utilized must be able to withstand the potential cellular damage caused by the radioactive waste at the eradication site. Deinococcus radiodurans (D. rad) is the most radiation resistant bacteria known; D. rad is resistant to ionizing radiation, desiccation, ultraviolet radiation, oxidizing agents and electrophilic mutagens2. Considering these extremophilic anomalies, D. rad is the perfect candidate for use in bacterial bioremediation efforts. It is already being tested in bioremediation efforts at sites of U.S nuclear weapon production during cold war, where a vast amount of toxic waste still remains3. There are multiple ways of accomplishing bioremediation, the substance being remediated determines the strategy used.
One of the major nuclear waste bioremediation strategies, toxic organic compound degradation, is for the detoxification of contaminated solvents produced during nuclear weapons production.  These include radioactive organic solvents such as toluene and other aromatic compounds. In recent years, D .rad strains have been produced with solvent-degrading capabilities to accomplish these goals. D. rad expressing the enzyme todC1C2BA, derived from Pseudomonas putida, have been successfully created3. These D. rad strains have been used to oxidize toluene, which is then metabolized and eventually forms insoluble"
