Sıkı takip ve önlemler ile bilim tarihinde hızla gelişmeye devam etmiştir..  2010 yılında Craig Venter milyonlarca baz çifti uzunluğunda bir genomu Blue Heron Bio şirketine sentezlettirdi.Bu genomu tüm genetiksel materyalleri alınmış bir hücreye aktarırlar ve hücre ilk bölünmesini gerçekleştikten sonra Craig Venter:’Bu ilk sentetik hücre’ diyerek hücreyi yarattığını iddia etti; fakat bilim dünyasından itirazlar geldi. Çünkü, varolan bir canlıdan taklit edilerek ve parça alınarak kopyasını yapmanın yaratmak olmadığını tüm bilim dünyası açıkça belirtmiştir. Bu olay ile beraber olayın etik kısmı ile ilgili tartışmalar başlamıştır.

We changed the ratio of Peasant to Civilian and the concertration of arabinose, which can active PBAD to control the invertase’s secretion. RFP was measured to represent the abundance of Civilian, i.e. the ability how this part (Peasant) can feed bacteria without any invertase genes.
III Methods
    1.Transform invertase and its transport system (Peasant) and constitutively expressed mRFP (Civilian) separately into E. coli MG1655 ΔsidA ΔlacI. Let them grow in M9-sucrose culture medium, a special M9 culture medium in which glucose is replaced by sucrose.
    2. Cultivate a pipe of Peasants and a pipe of Civilians for 12h.
    3. Adjust their OD600 to be the same value.
    4. Take 2ml each, and centrifuged them at 12000rpm for 1min. The supernatant was removed and each sediment was resuspended with 2ml M9-sucrose culture medium.
    5. Add 5ml M9-sucrose medium and 100μl bacterial liquid, in which Peasants and Civilians are mixed, so the total number of them is fixed, nevertheless of their ratio. The concentration of Arabinose was set by adding concentrated Arabinose solution.
The experimental groups and control groups are listed as follows. The number “1” and “3” in the boxes are the numbers of repeats.
    6. All of the groups were cultured for 20h. The growth was measured by flow cytometry. The number of cells is averaged.
IV Results

BIOFILMS - AN INTRODUCTION
Unlike how they are usually conceived by those involved with laboratory experiments, bacteria such as E. coli do not always exist as free-floating, independent cells. In natural environments, they often live in adhesive, structured communities known as biofilms. These semi-rigid structures offer cells protection from harsh environmental conditions which include changes in osmolality and temperature, as well as medical incursions like antibiotics. In nature, biofilms are often heterogeneous with different species of bacteria forming large, layered complexes; however, individual species can form biofilms by themselves. In biofilms, individual cells change their morphology and protein expression and secrete adhesive matrix polysaccharides (such as cellulose, PGA, etc) in response to environmental stress. (Beloin et al., 2008) Some of the cellular and extracellular components upregulated during an E. coli biofilm response are discussed below.
Curli
Curli are amyloid fibrils composed of two separate subunits, CsgA and CsgB, the latter of which is associated with the outer membrane. The transcription regulator CsgD controls subunit production by upregulating transcription of the csgBA operon. Curli fibrils assist in the processes of surface attachment, as well as playing a key role in intercellular interactions. Thus, curli are involved in both the initial adhesion of a biofilm onto a surface and further fortification of its structure (Beloin et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2013).
A model for the production and export of curli subunits.

Fimbriae
Type I fimbriae are long, surface-exposed polymeric filaments. They are composed of fimA, which forms the major component of the stalk, and fimH, which is found at the end of the filament and binds ligands in a mannose-dependent manner (Beloin et al., 2008).

In theory, since we added the same initial amount of melanin to each sheet, the concentration of melanin in the runoff should inversely indicate the linker's binding activity. We quickly analyzed these results with a UV-Vis Nanospectophotometer. Interestingly, the sheets without any linker had the highest absorption readings on a range of 200-300nm, while the runoff from the sheet with the linker had the lowest. This confirmed our expectations that the linker was latching on to the cellulose sheet and retaining the melanin.
Figure 9: UV-Vis spectra of runoff generated by washing melanin coated membrane. Higher UV absorbances corresponds to lower binding efficiency of construct used to retain melanin.

We measured channel capacity of the part BBa K1061013. We quantify the properties of TRE promotor.
The link is:
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1061013
Our Improvement
Purpose
Channel capacity evaluates correlation between input and output signals. For instance, if channel capacity is larger than 1 bit, the part can decern between high and low inputs, and vice versa. By assessing this novel quantity, we through light on how much information can a inducible promotor pass on. The measuring and calcualtion methods can be applied to more promotors in the future.
Results
Using EBFP2 as reporter, we measure channel capacity of a simple circuit driven by TRE to be 0.5259, with standard deviation of 0.0058.
Methods
We transfect HEK-293 human cells with our plasmid constructions as described in the form [ref: table]. Different concentrations of Dox are applied to cell culture at the same time.
Transfected cells are cultured for 48 hours before performing flow cytometry, long enough for protein expression level to achieve steady state. FACS examination measures florescent intensity emitted by each cell, from which we obtain a large sample of florescent protein expression level, tens of thousands of cells for each experiment group.
Data collected from flow cytometry are later analyzed on computers. We estimated probability density function (p.d.f.) from data using kernel density estimation, a nonparametric statistics method. Given high and low Dox concentration input, cells exhibit different probability distributions, as illustrated in the example below [ref: fig].
What we have in hand is the conditional distribution $p\left( {Y\left| {X = x} \right.} \right)$ , given a known level of input $x$ . In order to calculate mutual information $I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \iint {p\left( {x,y} \right"

Background
    Over the past two decades, Lactococcus lactis has vastly extended its application from food to being a successful microbial cell factory .Not only can it produce lactic acid, vitamins, bacteriocins and antimicrobial peptide (nisin) in traditional fermentation, it can also express heterologous antigens, thus allowing the bacteria to act as live vaccines. Using L. lactis as vaccine carriers is appealing as it is able to induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses, has adjuvant properties, and is free from risks associated with the use of conventional attenuated live pathogens. With lyophilization, L. lactis does not require storage at low temperature, and administration of the preparation does not require specialized personnel.
    However, L. lactis suffers from various stress conditions including acid, osmotic and oxygen during fermentation processing, among which acid stress and cold stress are great survival challenges. During fermentation, the decrease of environmental pH will inhibit the activity of intracellular enzymes, which will also affect the normal growth and metabolism of microbial cells. Furthermore, as live vaccines, L.lactis has an advantage in the low pH condition of gastric juice compared with other chassis microorganism. During the process of lyophilization, it suffers from severe cold stress, which rapidly reduce their survival rate. Therefore, the strain resistant to acid and cold needs to be constructed as soon as possible.
What are we doing
    Therefore, we aim to create an ideal chassis microorganism with good resistance and food-safe characteristics by synthetic biology methods. We added genes msmk, cspD2, promoter ppepN, gfp and a kill-switch (→ Basic parts ) respectively to model strain Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 to give it the anti-acid, anti-cold characteristics.

In our simulation, the shift in equilibrium is made by introducing additional expression of RelE.
Two different models were used with two different approaches:
How a given configuration of RelB and RelE production increases the RelE concentration and whether it could induce dormancy within 2 hours.
The time required for the bacteria to exit dormancy for each of the configurations, that is, how long it takes the levels of free RelE to decrease again.
Rates and Reactions
The skeleton of toxin-antitoxin system inherent to E. coli in the model was based on the study by Cataudella et al. 2012 Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N. Conditional cooperativity in toxin-antitoxin regulation prevents random toxin activation and promotes fast translational recovery. Nucleic Acids Res. 2012;40:6424–6434. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks297 . In an E. coli cell with a size of 1-2 μm, each nM of concentration can be approximated to 1 molecule. Thus all units are converted to molecules-1, as this fits the premises of the Gillespie algorithm. To simplify the model, the high affinity of RelE and RelB was used to ignore single RelB and only consider the dimer, RelB2 Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N.

The control of E. coli Bl21 (ancestor of evolution) cannot produce tryptophan, but the other two controls with bitter defender part rbs30 and rbs32 showed very low tryptophan production of about 0.4mg/L. Obviously, the two evolved strains had much higher productivity of tryptophan. The productivity of the evolved strain of rbs30-16 was 2.4 times higher than that of control, while that of the evolved strain rbs32-3 was 2.7 times higher than the control. These results clearly proved our evolution strategy successfully evolved a strain with higher tryptophan from their ancestors which cannot produce tryptophan at all.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"How we propose to approach these problems:
To make it especially hard for unauthorized parties to access our key, the key-spores will be sent in a mixture of decoy spores. The decoy is present in a much higher ratio than the key-spores. The key-spores have to be recovered using a specific selection mechanism. We have developed a ciprofloxacin resistance cassette that can be integrated into the B. subtilis genome. Only the knowledge of this specific selection antibiotic will allow the recovery.  To access the key not only general knowledge about molecular biology is required. The recipient has to know specific information about the exact biological procedure that has to be applied in order to access the key.
We believe that getting in contact with the National Institutions    in charge of the protection of digital information, gave us a better    understanding of what professionals and experts might expect from our    project.

Groningen Archives
CryptoGErM is a project focused on the storing of    potentially large encrypted data to ensure its protection and durability, and    subsequent shipping by conventional means... In order to understand what    the currents systems for the storing of data are and how CryptoGErM    could be used by Private and Public Institutions for the storing and    preserving of their information, we got in contact with the Groningen    Archives!

Eike, our chairwoman, visiting the Groninger Archieven together with CryptoGErM
The Regionaal Historisch Centrum Groningen Archieven is the    information centre for the History of the city and the province of    Groningen. Files, books, newspapers, maps, photos, films, videos, and    voice recordings are stored and tell the story from the province of    Groningen from the Middle Ages until now.
We learned that the Groninger Archives store the old administrations    of the State Institutions of the province of Groningen, besides that, they    also manage the archives of families, churches, societies and private    companies.
Currently in the Groningen Archives, most of the information      is stored on special, high quality paper, although other      storing means are used such as tapes, CD’s, DVD’s for      multimedia (films and audio recordings). However, for that type      of storing, specific conditions are required to ensure the      correct and long preservation of the paper, i.e. a specific      temperature (18°C) in dry air carton boxes. Within the      Groningen Archives the air composition and quality paper is      controlled by a system in"

In the vaccination part, we mainly talked about the mechanism and types of vaccines, as well as the importance of vaccination. Through this introduction, both the teachers and the students have deepened their understandings on the significance of vaccination. The second part of the lecture is about our project,which is also a topic on how a new vaccine can be developed using synthetic biology approaches. We found that this part is too specialized as some students who did not know anything about laboratory could not understand the topic well. To help them gain the basic idea of synthetic biology, we played an short video on this topic that was downloaded from Ted. This video attracted lots of attention and gave them a vivid explanation on synthetic biology. We talked about Biobricks to the audience, and most of them showed great curiosities. Finally, we introduced iGEM to them, with the hope that they may take an active part in this interesting competition some day in the future.
After the lecture, several students asked us some related questions, we were very happy to see that these young students were desired to learn more about synthetic biology. We believed that such communications should not stop at the classroom level, but should be brought steps further to the lab. We thus decided to organize an Openlab Day when we could take the students out to the lab and show them some cool stuff used in practical experiments.
Open lab(July 14th)
In order to let high school students really feel the charm of biology, we held the activities called Plate Colony Painting. We invited some high school students to the public lab of our university to participate in this event. We prepared some plates and E. coli, and asked them to innovate in the plates.
These students were given safety training by Yini Luo, one of our team members, before they were allowed to create imaginations with the plates and bacteria. These students indeed had full of fun, and we believed that they must had felt the charm of synthetic biology through participating in this event.

In August, We were informed that the Nanjing-China team needed our help to build their model. Considering that the communication and collaboration is a truly important part of doing research of synthetic biology, we promised that we would help them. So, then, they sent us their documents about their circuit and the function they wanted to realize. Our team had a discussion and found something we didn’t understand, so we had a video conference with them to know more about their circuits and confirm those details that we need to build this model. When we had finished a half of the formulation work, they came to our school to had a discussion with us. We showed them our work and asked for their suggestion and after that we confirmed more details and adjust a few equation. After we listed all the equations, we tried to simplify them. And then we begin to bury ourselves in coding, using the Matlab tool. We set a map with some parameters and some cells, with the map and cells’ state we can get new data of each cell and with the new state and the old map we got a new map"

UCL,2013,Team:UCLA#Project#NaturalSystem_-_-_TEXT.html,"s generate variability in the viral receptor protein that specifies tropism for ligand molecules, and encode polypeptides that are designed to tolerate sequence variation. A C-type lectin fold displays amino acid sequence variability. The lectin fold provides a static scaffold that helps balance diversity with protein stability. A reverse transcriptase mediates the exchange between two repeats, a variable repeat (VR) and a template repeat (TR).
The BPP-1 genome contains a variable repeat (VR) of 134 base pairs on the gene coding for the Mtd. This variable repeat is variable across every specimen of BPP-1, with variations isolated to 23 discrete nucleotides. Downstream from the variable repeat is the template repeat (TR), which serves as a master copy and is never permanently altered in wild-type phage (Medhekar).
Occasionally, during the viral assembly process, the TR is transcribed, and then reverse transcribed by a reverse transcriptase coded for by the brt gene further downstream from the mtd gene. This process introduces site mutations at the 23 extremely specific nucleotide locations. These nucleotides are all adenines, and are changed to any of the four possible nucleotides. The resulting cDNA strand is then directed to the location of the VR and integrated into the genome, replacing the VR itself (Guo). All of this results in the assembled viral particle having a different sequence in the mtd gene, and thus a different Mtd protein that is capable of binding to another target on the surface of Bordetella.
Comparable Systems in Nature
The human immune system can generate upwards of 1012 antibodies with unique antigen-binding sites. It is remarkable that such enormous diversity can be generated from far fewer numbers of genes, and does not disrupt the overall structure of the antibody. This strategy of shuffling and combining parts has been tried-and-true throughout the tree of life, and has conferred an adaptive advantage to many species – including ourselves! Evolution trends towards making the most out of a handful of tools, and it’s no wonder that we are interested in upholding this principle for our own projects (Alberts).

Conjugation
We have attempted to conjugate GFP into both G. oxydans and G. hansenii with a Diaminopimelic Acid (DAP) auxotrophic strain of E. coli (The Barrick Lab). The plasmid contains the vector pMMB67EH, the promoter PA-1, GFP and a spectinomycin resistance gene.
The first conjugation was done with two of our isolated G. oxydans strains, in case the strains might behave differently. First, a mixture between our recipient strain and the DAP auxotroph strain were plated on an LB+DAP agar plate to allow for conjugation to occur. After 24 hours of incubation, we scraped up the growth and plated each conjugation mixture onto a LB+Spec plate (Figure 1). 24-48 hours later, we viewed the potential transconjugants using a fluorescence microscope. We then picked these glowing colonies and streaked them out onto another LB+Spec plate.  We then followed our protocol for genome DNA isolation and 16S sequencing, as described above, to confirm successful"

is het mogelijk om op de homepage wat tekst over de foto van het ladeuzeplein te zetten? dat is beter dan dat iedereen moet doorscrollen naar beneden - Ingethijs 09:22, 29 July 2008 (UTC)
persoonlijk vind ik dit een beetje moeilijk, omdat tekst op een blauwe achtergrond niet zo goed wordt getoond (tenzij je overgaat op nogal schreeuwerige kleuren) , wat ik echter wel zie zitten is een homepage gelijkaardig qua structuur aan die van Imperial College , het is niet saai, mooi opgedeeld en zeer vlot leesbaar en alle aspecten van het team, Leuven, ... kunnen in een apart vakje. Indien er tekst over de foto heen moet is dit zeker doenbaar. -- Avdmeers

voorstel: een tools pagina voor templates misschien? -> Team:Kuleuven/Tools/... waaronder dan de templates/ css styles/... staan (dus bv: Team:Kuleuven/Tools/Navigation_Bar), de Tools pagina kan je dan ook wat modificeren om een lijst bij te houden van de subpagina's (krijg je een overzichtje).

Within the week, we gave the same class a tour of two labs belonging to our advisors. Kelly Schwarz, our team’s graduate student advisor, exhibited projects investigating exosomes in Josh Leonard’s lab. She then led a “painting” activity employing fluorescent bacteria of various colors. Ben Des Soye, a grad student in Michael Jewett’s lab, talked to the students about research in cell-free protein synthesis. The students asked insightful questions on both tours, such as “How do you avoid contaminating mammalian cells?” and “Why would you want to make proteins outside of cells rather than inside?” In addition to answering these questions, we explained the concept of CRISPR Capsules.

Perspectives Charter School
At the summer’s end, we were given the opportunity to teach a high school biotechnology class for a day at the Perspectives Charter School campus in Auburn Gresham, a high-risk neighborhood in the south side of Chicago. Teach for America member Emma Nechamkin helped us prepare our presentation material, which took almost a full month to plan. Emma emphasized that her students were a “challenging group.” Aiming to provide an engaging lecture, we filled the slides of our presentation with images and GIFs.
We brought with us two bags of GMO-free fruit juice pouches and conventional honeycrisp apples from Whole Foods. The class had 25 students ranging between the ages of thirteen and nineteen. None of them had any prior exposure to research science. We handed out juice pouches. Initially, we discussed GMO foods, using the “non-GMO” juice pouches as a segway for our discussion on “What is genetic engineering?”
We explained the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, CRISPR-Cas9, our iGEM project, and grant proposals. Students asked questions such as “If I cut off a lion’s tail, can I use CRISPR to give myself a tail?” and “If I were to modify the DNA of an animal, would that animal change completely?” At the conclusion of our presentation, we asked the students to write grant proposal outlines explaining how they would use CRISPR to solve a problem. We encouraged crazy ideas and walked around the classroom to interact with the students. One group of students said they’d use CRISPR to “give a person a twin if they wanted one.” Another group said they would “change other people’s mindset” and “end racism.” After the students completed their grants, we gave everyone apples, explaining"

When pooling the answers to these two questions, we find that those who consider our adrenaline natural are mostly those who think that natural means “assembly of natural products” and vice-versa. In other words, their rating of naturalness in the previous question directly corresponds to their perception of the naturalness of our product.
In conclusion, our survey helped us realize the need for popularized science as many people fear what they do not understand. Scientific progresses affect everyone but those who fear the progresses may oppose it. Therefore, opportunities for the public to participate in discussion and deliberation about emerging technologies such as synthetic biology are critical. In order to communicate properly with them, scientists need to popularize their work and engage debate over sensitive topics. A further analysis of this topic is presented in the next section.

Introduction
From crops to cattle to dogs, humans have always sought to improve their living conditions by adapting plants and animals of their surroundings to their needs[1]. However, these occur over a lengthy selection processes over hundreds, possibly thousands of years. New developments in the field of biology has enabled us to progress much faster, by interfering with an organism’s DNA directly.
Synthetic biology is an emerging scientific and biotechnological field that uses these developments at its core. It combines biology and engineering principles, with the aim of designing and building new biological systems and functions.
Synthetic biology has been gaining interest among ambitious science students who are seeking to bring their research outside the lab and be involved in more application-based solutions. The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition brings together thousands of students across the globe to develop synthetic biology solutions and  collaborate with one another based on the common passions.
Among hundreds of teams that participated in this year’s event, Team Toulouse-INSA-UPS, Team NUSGEM (Singapore Team-A), and Team ULaval came together to exchange ideas about relevant issues regarding synthetic biology. Before writing this report, we discussed different topics ranging from ethics, environmental impact, public engagement, repercussions on public life, and more. We chose three main subjects to discuss: bioethics in synthetic biology; economic aspects; and society’s perspective of synthetic biology.
Bioethics in Synthetic Biology (Toulouse)
A lot of factors have to be considered when evaluating the benefits and risks of using synthetic biology. To develop a new production method for example, one must first closely study the available techniques that do not employ synthetic biology. If something can be produced chemically, then"

Figure 2: The top row shows centrifuge tubes containing the 4-nitrohenol ester reaction mixture for the palmitate (a) and octanoate (b) esters with no cells added. The middle row shows the response for a negative control where DH5⍺ cells without any plasmid were added to reaction mixtures containing 4-nitrophenyl-plamitate (c) or 4-nitrophenyl-octanoate (d). The bottom row shows the response for the BBa_K2694000 circuit transformed into DH5⍺ cells when added to reaction mixtures containing 4-nitrohenyl-plamitate (e) or 4-nitrophenyl-octanoate (f). All reaction mixtures were 1mM of the nitrophenyl ester with 1% v/v Triton X-100 in 0.1M pH 7 phosphate buffer.
From these results, we concluded that our bacteria was indeed cleaving the substrates, resulting in the green color. The clear control remained in the controls, showing that it was our part specifically that was inducing this change.
Quantitative Testing
Once we had shown that our bacteria could cleave the substrates to some extent, we wanted to try to show this more quantitatively. In collaboration with the University of Calgary’s iGEM team, we designed an experiment to test our reaction in a time course, using their spectrophotometer, in order to more accurately determine the color change.

Design of insulators
In addition to the “short connectors”, we designed a set of “long connectors” that function as genetic insulators. They fulfill the same basic functions as the short connectors, providing fusion sites for subsequent cloning. Additionally, they consist of 300 bp “neutral DNA” flanked by two strong transcriptional terminators.
The purpose of these long connectors is to reducing cross interaction between neighbouring transcription units, mainly transcriptional read through, a phenomenon that was described previously (Mairhofer et al. 2015) .  The design of “neutral DNA” started with generating 300 bp of random DNA which do not possess recognition sites of BsaI, BsmBI and any of the enzymes used in Biobrick Assembly, using a self-made Matlab script. These sequences were analyzed with the reverse mode of the R2oDNA designer (Casini et al. 2014) . The R2oDNA designer can take a DNA sequence as input and quantifies the extent of secondary structures, repeats and forbidden sequence motifs, such as promoter or
RBS
motifs. Because the genome sequence of V. natriegens is not included in the tool, a BLAST search was performed manually with the sequences to check for homologies with the genome of V. natriegens. The top hit was considered as a fourth score to quantify the quality of a spacer sequence. At the end of this process, four scores were assigned to every sequence, each describing a different characteristic. We decided that spacer sequences with decent scores in each category are better suited as insulators than sequences with a superior score in one and inferior scores in other categories.
Figure 8: Design of our insulating connectors
300 bp neutral DNA are flanked by two strong terminators. A BsmBI site for level 2 cloning is incorporated at the 5'end
We developed a Matlab script to find the “best” spacer sequences by increasing quantiles and picking spacers that fall into the lowest quantiles for all four categories. For example, the best sequence was found to be among the best 28 % of all tested sequences in terms of secondary structure, repeats, forbidden motifs and homology to the genome of V. natriegens.
The selected sequences were flanked by"
Berkeley,2010,Team:Berkeley#Clotho_-_-_TEXT.html," to databases using whatever schema is encoded in the database. In this way, we get the best of both worlds.  Tools all work with the same standard data model when working atop the Clotho API, but databases based on a different data model can still talk to Clotho via customized ClothoConnection Apps. This architecture guarantees that different tools written by different people nevertheless interpret a ""Part"" the same way.  This makes the exchange of data within Clotho across tools not only possible but a fluid and natural to the user. The standardized API also allows Clotho to validate data before it is saved to a database and shared with other users, which is especially important in the light of biosafety. More information is available on our Human Practices page about how Clotho makes doing synthetic biology safer.

In the team, I have learned a lot and gained valuable experience. Working with other people courage me to improve myself. Outside of lad, I love to watch Korean TV show and play card games.
Jinkai Wan
Student
As a junior student in Fudan University, I chose biology to be my lifelong major and I am Wan Jinkai. I worked in the cell group and my main duty is to culture cells. I spent most of my time in the lab and in the car between two campus. It’s a wonderful experience while working in team. In my spare time, my favorite thing is work out. I spent a lot of time in gym and I hope to have a fit body.
Xuanye Cao
Student
Hello everyone,this is Cao Xuanye. I am a junior year biology major with experience working and great social ability. As a leader of our team, I played a significant role in the part of design and experiment. However science is not my whole life, in the spare time, I am a violinist. Thanks to the IGEM, I met my girlfriend and it’s romantic to run this team with her.
Heqing Yang
Student
I'm a junior in the School of Life Science, Fudan University. I work on starting and running our team with Cao Xuanye. During this summer, I focus on the work related with molecular cloning operation, such as the construction of TET induced expression system and Cre/loxP system. It has been a really intense but exciting time, for I cherish more about the process of the experiment than the result. The challenges we face every time often motivate me to think more. I'm rather interested in the way life operates, and eager to figure out how it works, finally to make a life act in the way we designed. Outside of the lab, I enjoy ball games and jogging. I'd like to make friends and exchange ideas with iGEMers all over the world.
Siyu Xiao
Student
As the only sophomore in this team, I am Xiao Siyu. I interested in biology since high school and joined this team immediately after heard about it. Even though I lack of some basic knowledge about this field, I still enthusiasm about it. My main job is human practice and run an organization about iGEM in Fudan. In this team, I learned a lot from others about experiment, design and even run"

Cell Lysis and Protein Extraction of MaSP2 9-mer and 12-mer constructs from BL21(DE3) cells
Followed using the protocol from Teule, et. al. 2012.
Lysis resulted in an extremely thick and viscous supernatant, with a clear yellow/tan color.  Initial addition of deoxycholic acid to the cells seems very extreme; 1.5g/g of cells in lysis buffer.  Results in a very thick paste forming; not quite sure if the membrane proteins are truly precipitating.
Additionally, a white, film/fibre like substance formed a layer on top of the lysate.  Not quite sure exactly what this debris may be, but will run on an SDS PAGe gel tomorrow to analyze debris content.
Pellet saved after supernatant formation  is viscous and snot like in nature; may possible be genomic DNA.  Residual genomic DNA in the sample must be digested using DNase (3 uL total), to remove DNA from the solution before IMAC purification."

OVER VIEW
Synthetic biology is still in an early developing stage in China and it is believed to bring new opportunities to biotechnology and to solve critical problems and scares that we might face now and in the future, like food and fuel crisis.
However, similar to the situation in western countries, synthetic biology is still in an emerging field in China that lacks clear definition and safety laws. The lack of a well-accepted definition and safety concerns do not seem to stop the Chinese government and scientists from pursuing synthetic biology. In recent years, high standard labs and institutions have been set up featuring mainly on research of synthetic biology. Funds from Chinese government on synthetic biology increases significantly. There are several universities that are playing the leading role in the field of synthetic biology in China, while more and more universities and colleges are joining in. A good example to show the Chinese students’ curiosity on synthetic biology might be the increasing number of universities that took part in the iGEM competition through the past five years.
Fig.1
The iGEM competition opens the door of synthetic biology to the new generation of Chinese college students. What the iGEM offers is not only a new study field, but also a new way to conduct scientific research work: work as a team. What’s more important is that this competition gives students a chance to evaluate the safety issues related to a new scientific field which is not yet widely known by the public.  Hence we know that our project might raise some safety concerns and we have the responsibility to inform the public of potential risks of biotechnology and synthetic biology, and also teach them how to avoid these risks in the lab and our daily life. The public’s opinion in turn, could be used to help us examine our safety protocols as well as considering the general safety principles of synthetic biology. Therefore, for our Human Practice we have organized and participated in various events. We organized the Open Lab Day for kids from a primary school in Xiamen. Our team members"

Lethbridge,2010,Team:Lethbridge#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria and can be further degraded into usable resources such as ethanol or methanol.
Previous iGEM teams have been able to remotely activate E coli’s DNA degradation pathway which is the pathway responsible for terminating the cell.  This is a very powerful tool, as part of the apoptosis pathway degrades the cell’s DNA. By providing the ability to destroy our custom cell through DNA degradation, we ensure that the cell will not escape into the environment, the DNA will be degraded eliminating the potential for horizontal gene transfer between other species present in the tailing ponds, and the relevant enzymes will not be destroyed.
Our iGEM project last year was the assembly of synthetic microcompartments to isolate pathways from the rest of the cellular environment.  These microcompartments will be used to house the catechol degradation pathway so that the pathway can be isolated from the cell and administered to the tailings in a powdered form.
Optimization
Using selective evolution in the presence of catechol we will engineer an E. coli which is able to live in high concentrations of catechol.  This will allow for optimization of the catechol degradation pathway using.  The next step will be to further use selective evolution with the tailings sample so that the pathway will be optimized for the environmental conditions that the pathway will administered to.
Our Expectations
Figure 1. A depiction of the project overview.
Short-term Goals
We expect to have the biobrick parts submitted to the registry for all of the separate modules.  Once we have the biobrick parts we will then be able to assemble the proposed system of the catechol degradation pathway , induced cell death and microcompartments .  Our short-term goal will be to provide characterized biobricks for the degradation of catechol in tailings.
Medium-term goals
We will accomplish the optimization of the system by selective evolution.  To accomplish this we will use the tailings sample provided to optimize the assembled of the optimized catechol degradation pathway.
Long-term Goals
We will fully assemble the optimized modules for the tailings sample by selective evolution in preparation for use.  The optimized pathway will be created into an easily administered powder which can be added to the tailing ponds which will degrade the catechol without addition of live organisms.  This will allow for the tailings’ cleanup which will leave a smaller environmental footprint while simultaneously decreasing the time necessary for the tailings cleanup.

UCL,2013,Team:UCL E#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," the classroom. We have successfully applied for a social enterprise grant to work with different communities in London and explore the potential of citizen biotechnology to increase science literacy and contribute to the solution of community problems.
With the funding secured, we are now approaching the first communities, such as Hackney City Farm and the Somerstown Community, which is in need of quickly increasing confidence about biotechnology, as it is faced with the construction of the Francis Crick Institute.
Speed Debate
We were invited to host an event for the Bloomsbury Festival, whose topic was ""The Future of Food"". This allowed us to explore, amongst other food-related topics, the idea of using Darwin Toolbox as a food testing device.
For the event, we opted for the speed debating format, which we pioneered last year and even gave a talk about at the annual science communication BIG event.
MakerFaire Rome
In October, we were invited to attend the MakerFaire Rome and present the work-in-progress prototype of Darwin Toolbox. We shared a large booth with The Kitchen, a London based BioArt studio and together we presented our own projects, iGEM and the Registry of Parts, and DIYbio. Rome gave us a tremendous boost of confidence. The response and enthusiasm we got for Darwin Toolbox was overwhelming, and almost a third of our visitors asked to purchase one. These included field researchers, but also parents who were keen to explore biotechnology with their children and get them interested in Synthetic Biology.

Digested ‘A&B’ and ‘C’
Trying a different method for attaching ‘A&B’ w/ C
‘A&B’ cut w/ Spe & Pst
‘C’ cut w/ Xba & Pst (insert)
When these parts were ligated together, there were many colonies on the experimental plate, few colonies on the vector control, but many colonies on the insert colonies.
We had a theory that since Part C and Part C plasmid are very close in bp, we may have extracted both pieces when gel extracting.
We wanted to do a PCR screen, but we ran into a problem, seeing as there were no bands – at all.  Even if there is no product, you would see primers, but the primers here were very faint.  Likewise, PCR screening was not working when screened with other parts as well.
Time for an investigation:
Run test on PCR screening process
1. Old forward 1/10 dilution primer  1 uL
2. Old reverse 1/10 dilution primer         1 uL
3. New forward 1/10 dilution primer  1 uL
4. Old reverse 1/10 dilution primer  1 uL
5. 100% oligos of forward primer  1 uL
6. 100% oligos of reverse primer  1 uL
7. 1/10 dilution of forward (1 uL), 1/10 dilution of reverse (1 uL) in 18 uL dH2O (old primers)
8. 1/10 dilution of forward (1 uL), 1/10 dilution of reverse (1 uL) in 18 uL dH2O (new primers)
9. Re-PCR’ed parts from yesterday that failed 5 uL
a. Maybe it wasn’t run long enough because Taq was compromised
b. Yesterday rano n 25-27 cycles, today ran extra 18 cycles

We shared ideas of ethical issues their team might want to look into, like the elimination of jobs by the introduction of their technology, and the accessibility of their product to different municipalities and inequalities this might contribute to.
Beyond being a local team and the former home team of one of our members, OLS Canmore was also working on a project that had a special connection to the University of Alberta and the UAlberta iGEM team.Their project involves the use of mCherry, a fluorescent protein that was invented by team UAlberta’s principal investigator. This connection was a perfect opportunity for collaboration. We sent them purified mCherry for use in their experiments, and we were also able to provide them with information on the environmental persistence of mCherry from the lab the protein was invented in.
Calgary
This year was our second year attending aGEM, held by the University of Calgary. This collaboration with the Calgary iGEM team involves bringing together all of the Albertan iGEM teams. The conference allows iGEM teams in Alberta, to gather for a mock iGEM experience, by having each team present, participate in workshops, and work together to mutually improve. This year, the Calgary team was gracious enough to plan and host the conference on their campus in collaboration with geekStarter. The aGEM conference also helped facilitate our collaboration with the OLS Canmore Canada team, and other iGEM teams.
Utrecht, TUDelft, and Leiden
One of our team members spent the first two months of the iGEM season studying abroad in The Netherlands. This opportunity was used to connect with Dutch iGEM teams, specifically the teams at Utrecht University, Delft University of Technology, and Leiden University. We met with them in person to learn about their projects, and to share information about our work. We were also able to compare our progress and the difficulties we were experiencing in the early months of the iGEM season. We also kept in contact with these teams after our meetings. Team members at TU Delft were able to supply us with contact information for former members of the Wageningen 2016 iGEM team, who had also worked on a bee-related project. This connection allowed us to have conversations with Wageningen alumni about how they had created their kill switch, and considerations they had taken in making sure their product was safely contained in the environment.

PmerT is a promoter from Tn21 mercury resistance (mer) operon. Transposon 21 itself is carried by plasmid NR1 (Nakaya, Nakamura et al. 1960), which was originally isolated from Shigella flexneri in Japan in the late 1950s (Liebert, Hall et al. 1999).
The regulatory region of mer operon consists of two tightly overlapped, divergently oriented promoters – PR and PTPCAD.(Park, Wireman et al. 1992). PR is the promoter of the regulatory protein gene, merR, and PTPCAD is for the transcription of the structure gene – merPTCAD. Both of them are called merOP as a whole. MerR always binds to merOP as a homodimer and enhances the occupancy of PTPCAD by RNA polymer"

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," prosthesis. We realized that it wasn’t the core of the problem. Indeed, the technology missing in this field was the actual interface between the prosthesis and the osseointegrated steel/titanium/ceramic stem inside the human body, limiting the field of the bionic prosthesis. We decided to focus on this interface and started to talk with Dr. Benjamin Bouyer, a lumbar rachis surgeon, on how we could deposit the biofilm on or in the osseointegrated stem. We realized that the stem would be in direct contact with the surgeon meaning that if we coated the whole structure with our biofilm, it would probably be stripped off, get deposited on the gloves and contaminate other areas. We also spoke with one member of the board of directors of ADEPA, “Association de Défense et d’Etude des Personnes Amputés », which translates to « Association for the Defense and Study of Amputated Persons” who is himself an amputee. He gave us great advice on the designing phase of this interface and raised the issue of the socket causing excessive sudation and discomfort for the patient. After meeting with experts from i.CERAM (Ceramic medical devices company, Limoges, France) and the CERAH (Center for Studies and Research on the Equipment for the Handicapped), we learned more and more about the different materials used in the making of prostheses. At this point, we realized that doing a full stainless-steel interface would stimulate the growth of bacteria in a biofilm structure. Therefore, we decided to switch and do the part in direct contact with the patient in ceramic, knowing that we still have the same problem that i.CERAM and the CERAH were facing currently. Indeed, steel doesn’t last as much as ceramic, which could be a problem when creating an interface composed of both materials. We knew then that the patient would probably need corrective surgeries to fix his osseointegrated stem. Having considered these parameters, we then decided to start modeling our prototype by integrating those different aspects as much as possible. Because we wanted it to be cost-effective and injection-moldable, we want to build our future prototypes in ABS, a thermoplastic polymer that could be molded by injection. We ordered the electronic parts composed of a charger, battery, and amplifier, and assembled it into its current state as our POC.

Biological components design
The most unique feature of IGEM is that it makes gene modularized, standardized, and simplified. The DNA of the plasmid has four restriction sites, EcoRI, Xbal, Pstl, and Spel. When ligasing the fragment DNA into the vector, we only have to use the restriction enzymes to cut the Xbel and Spel restriction site.
Convince to design
By using the IGEM registry of standard biological parts, we can design a new biological device or a biological system to solve problems around us. And the platform served as a great resource for us to stand on the shoulders of giants and complete our ideas easier!

Using the steady-state and kinetic knowledge of the antibody, derive                         the relationship (9):
\begin{equation}\begin{split} [R_TA]=&Cexp[-(K_{d2}+K_{a2}[R_T])t]\\&+\frac{K_{d2}(K_{d2}[R_TA_0]+[R_T])-K_{a2}([P_0]-[R_TA_0]+[R_T])[R_T]}{K_{d2}+K_{a2}[R_T]}                         \end{split}\tag{9}\end{equation}
equal meaning between \([R_TA_0]\) and \([R_TA]_0\).
By simplification of relation (9) and combining relation (2) inside the grayscale model content,                         relations (10) and (11) can be obtained:
$$[R_TA]=Cexp[xt]+y\tag{10}$$
$$\mathrm{Grayscale \ value}=\frac{\sigma exp[xt]+ \Psi }{\beta+Cexp[xt]}\tag{11}$$
According to this relationship, a detection curve expressed by a fixed antigen-antibody                         concentration can be obtained. The relationship between the high-sensitivity detection curve and                         the low-sensitivity detection curve (slide detection sensitivity and positive correlation of                         antigen-antibody pairs) can also be obtained. Fig. 5(a)(b)(c) can be listed:
(a) Relationship between fixed antigen-antibody concentration and                                 detection time
(b) Relationship between different fixed antigen-antibody                                 concentration and detection time
(c) Gray value and detection time relationship diagram
Fig.5 Predictive graph during detection
From the analysis results, the detection time can be optimized to achieve the most effective                         time. At the same time, for a fixed antigen-antibody pair, this value is proportional to the                         initial reaction rate; the optimal time is approximately the same. Finally, there is a clear                         relationship between the detection time and the gray value relationship.

We attended the 88th Genetic Society of Japan and had a discussion with 5 Japanese iGEM teams (Gifu, HokkaidoU, Kyoto, Nagahama, and UT-tokyo). Our topics were how iGEM Japan would be in the future and reached a consensus of our apporopriate cooperation. We had a good oppotunity to exchange information and to deepen our friendship."

From the heat chart, it is clear that the raative error in a system has much less effect on the accuracy of testing than that of input, which implies us that it is vital to control the deviation of input. Thus, we have to find a stable and precise way to deal with our histamine samples. The better the input error is controlled, the more accurate the testing is.

How do you know what gene is responsible of a given function?
There are several ways to know that, but sometimes can be very difficult to know the answer to that question.
Firstly, to know the function of a given gene, scientists try to delete that gene and see what effects causes in the cell which possessed that gene. For example, if the depletion of the gene makes the cell unable to divide, that gene can be involved in the mitosis process. A huge amount of information about genes has been obtained from the studying mutants lacking genes./
Secondly, some genes can have a similar sequence to other genes with a known function. Using bioinformatics is easy to compare different genes and sometimes it is possible to predict the function of a gene thanks to its homologies to other gene.
How far are we from create life from zero?
That question is impossible to answer with certainty because the question is that maybe we have to wait several decades or centuries to see that. The closest scientific achievement to the creation of life was the synthesis of the whole genome of the little bacteria Mycoplasma genitalium by the American scientist Craig Venter in 2010. You can read more information about it clicking the next web address. Mycoplasma laboratorium
Can Synthetic biology be useful in the war against climate change?
Synthetic biology is a tool that can be used to solve many problems. However, it is still a very young discipline which is given its first steps that has a long road to cover.
The climate change is caused mainly because of the CO2 emission to the atmosphere by the human being. If we want to preserve our planet we have to diminish these emissions that are responsible of the progressive warming which is affecting so many different animals and plants and changing the climate patterns. One way we could do that"

CU-Boulder,2013,Team:CU-Boulder#Project#Kit#RestrictionEnzymes_-_-_TEXT.html," gels than DNA, much of the DNA would enter the gel during this short time, leaving most of our methylase. This is referred to as our gel purified lysate.
We then set up four samples. In the first we added plasmid DNA (amilCP on a vector) to our lysate. In the second, we added only lysate so we could see what background showed up. The third contained only plasmid that would be unprotected from EcoRI so we could compare our results to uncut plasmid. Lastly, we added plasmid DNA to our gel purified lysate. These samples were incubated at 37C for 1 hour to allow the methylase time to methylate the DNA.
Each of these samples were then digest with PstI and EcoRI. The results can be seen below.
As can be seen in lane 2, much genomic DNA and the plasmid DNA from our methylase is present in the lysate; however, in lane 4, most of this DNA is removed by our purification method. We do loose some functionality of the methylse possibly by loosing it in the gel or decrease in concentration but it mostly works
Since the start of summer we have successfully isolated the EcoRI restriction enzyme gene. We have also isolated the EcoRI methylase gene and confirmed that it functions in vivo and in vitro.
The Next Step
Continuing with our project, we would like to obtain a functional EcoRI methylase to then express with a promoter RBS. We then would transform plasmids with the expressed EcoRI and EcoRI methylase into bacterial cells and observe any changes in growth rates and to purify out the produced EcoRI protein.
Other restriction endonucleases we would like to express through a plasmid are: ApoI, PstI, SpeI, and XbaI.
ApoI for Malaria Testing
Another application of our project is for testing for antimicrobial resistant malaria strains. Malaria is an infection of Plasmodium falciparum and caused approximately 660,000 deaths in 2010 [1]. Chloroquine, an antimicrobial drug, is widely used to treat malaria; however, an increasing prevalence of chloroquine resistance has complicated malaria treatment. This increased resistance is linked to a mutation in one of the membrane transporters of Plasmodium falciparum (pfmdr-1) where a tyrosine residue is replaced by an arginine residue and a mutation of the transporter pfcrt where lysine is replaced by threonine"

Interview
At the beginning of our project, we interviewed Doctor Xu at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. After the interview, we realize that it is essential to improve the current diagnosis and treatments on colorectal cancer. Biomarkers may be a way to improve the techniques. The interview suggested the importance of diagnosing colorectal cancer at its early stage. It was later posted on our team’s WeChat official account.
Later we had another interview with Professor Zhou at Wuhan University, School of Basic Medical Science. The questions are more focused on experiments and technique development instead of clinical implementations like what we talked about in the previous one. She suggested the using of microRNA as a biomarker and told us about its function as a target in cancer treatments. After reading reviews on microRNA and cancer, we decided to focus our project on the application of miRNA-21 as a biomarker.
Professor Zhou provided suggestions on the future direction of microRNA biomarker. She told us that microRNA biomarkers not only serve for the diagnosis of cancer, but also help people to improve the treatments; that is, the marker developed can function in both diagnosis and treatment. Our group was at first focusing on the role of microRNA"
Macquarie_Australia,2016,Team:Macquarie Australia#NoteNBchloro_-_-_TEXT.html,"5a strains grew on the media, suggesting a successful ligation and transformation of the Ultra Operon.
Week 6
(5th - 11th September)
From the DH5a colonies possessing the Ultra Operon, the plasmids were isolated and prepped for PCR to confirm the presence of the Ultra Operon.  A total of 75 plasmid samples underwent PCR and were prepared for analysis via gel electrophoresis in the following week.
Week 7
(12th - 18th September)
To identify successful ligation of the mega operon and super operon, the 75 PCR products that were prepared in the previous week were visualised using gel electrophoresis.  Along with these PCR products KAN and CAM backbones were also digested and run on the gel to ensure correct size, confirming backbone functionality.
No bands were visible across all 75 PCR samples indicating unsuccessful ligation of the super operon and mega operon.  KAN and CAM backbone samples showed bands at 2kb region, agreeing with the expected size, indicating that these backbones are still appropriate to use in future.
Fig 7. Part 1 of PCR of the ligation between Mega Operon + Super Operon (Ultra Operon) shows no evident bands across all 75 samples.
Fig 8. Part 2 of PCR of the ligation between Mega Operon + Super Operon (Ultra Operon) shows no evident bands across all 75 samples.
Mid-semester Break
(19th - 2nd October)
Functionality of the super operon was identified using a spectrofluorometer. There was successful chelation of magnesium into protoporphorin IX.
When incubated for an hour with Protophorphorin IX, ATP and MgCl2 there is an increase in emission intensity, peaking at 591 nm. This indicates the presence of a functional magnesium cheletase complex consisting of the 5 subunits ChlH, GUN4, CHLD, CHLi1, CHli2, Suggesting the presence and function of the appropriate genes on the super operon. There is an evident peak on the blank sample, indicating the endogenous protoporphorin.
It was found that our original mega operon was unreal. The mega operon only contained YCF54-CHLM and POR-CHLP-DvrI-ChlG genes, missing the ChlG gene and the SpeI restriction site.  Therefore, a new mega operon was made and sent for sequencing in order to confirm the"

Week 13: July 22 - July 26
Turns out by re-configuring the light source immediately after importing .pdb files into Maya, the ribbon and atom models will render beautifully. Unfortunately this trick doesn't work for the surface models. Nonetheless we generated some really high definition pictures (8192*8192 pixels with 220 pixels/inch) for the website. At the same time Justin has been transferred to work on Maya with us. I taught him everything I knew, from creating simple objects to do basic dynamics.
Rai asked me to do some modelling on β-lactamase, which will likely be the reporter in our system. What she wants to get out of this study is to understand, when given two different concentrations of substrates, at what time will their differences be largest such that we can tell them apart. Unfortunately β-lactamase is very fast enzyme and that reaction mechanism has not been studied in detail. Then I remembered what my chemical engineering professor taught me: when reaction is fast, model mass transfer. For our lateral flow strip system, the substance will spend most of its time diffusing before react with β-lactamse, whose reaction will be rapid. Then by timing when the reaction occurs we have a measurement of the diffusion and hence will tell us how much substance was there initially.
Week 14: July 29 - August 2
Cesar asked us (Justin and I) to divide up our work. So I was working on the quantitative modelling while he worked on the qualitative modelling. The task I was asked to do was to figure out how to simulate TALE binding to DNA, according to laws of physics. We were hoping for using the electrostatics plug-in and derive the reactions from Brownian motion, but I had no luck with any of these. We are still working to understand how Maya will perform for dynamic models. We are uncertain if Maya is the best tool to achieve our vision for quantitative modelling.
Justin has made good progress with animating TALE binding to DNA without any physics. He did the most of the work of creating two animations while I rendered them into .avi files. Together we now understand the entire process from importing .pdb files to output animations to .avi files; we are ready for production.

Picture 3: The group photo of all organizers from 6 IGEM teams
Organizing:
During the preparing time, our team showed great enthusiasm about organizing and making plans, helping other 5 teams to finish the preparation together. Since it was the second time of our human practice, we had more experience over other college teams. Minghao Zhou gave the revision of the PPT based on the previous one, which made it more acceptable for children in a young age. The language using in the PPT was changed into informal one, causing better understandings for those kids toward our topics of formaldehyde's harmfulness. In the process, comics from Tianlun Yu were the most important part. Many young audiences could not understand our content, because they are just elementary students who knew exactly nothing about synthetic biology. Using comics is quite innovative educational method that could help kids to comprehend the professional knowledge.
Picture 4: The comics designed by Tianlun Yu to illustrate our project
When it came to the game, Jiayue Wu gave a lot of suggestions as the leader of our team. She proposed that although complex games could help students to learn more knowledge, fewer students would participate in the game. So if we simplify the game into an easier one, we could have a larger impact among participants in this activity. The new game would also help those children to understand the damage of formaldehyde and the value of our project.
Game part:
In IGEM, our team's project is mainly about the decomposition and detection of formaldehyde, leading to the principle of our game. Given the structural formula of formaldehyde, Children would make the ball-and-stick model of formaldehyde by themselves. This game is easy for small kids to play, testing the ability of observation and inspiring their interests upon biology and chemistry. After the competition, they had remembered not only what formaldehyde is, but also its structural formula and ball-and-stick model. Of course, many parents also showed great passion in the game.

Nanopore Sequencing
For the past several years, a third generation sequencing platform [ 1 , 2 ] has been under development that has its roots in biophysiologic studies of channel proteins. It utilizes a dually biotic and abiotic architecture to generate nucleic acid sequences of near limitless lengths from electrochemical data without the need for target sequence modification [ 1 - 11 ]. It is called nanopore sequencing, and it seeks to revolutionize the accessibility of genetic data through the use of molecular machines.
The history of nanopore sequencing is as brief as it is wildly promising. In the mid-1990’s, it was first proposed that a heterogeneous ssNA could be analyzed when passed through an interface by way of a nanoscale pore [ 3 ]. The Deamer group took inspiration for this idea from the electrophysiologic patch clamp technique, traditionally used to characterize membrane channel proteins, and reasoned that the procedure could be manipulated to quantify the apertures of ssNA protein channel candidates [ 4 , 5 , 9 ]. Shortly thereafter, they demonstrated that nucleotides passing through a channel could be distinguished given the reproducible number of ions predicted to be displaced by each of the bases3. Kasianowicz also showed that the translocation of nucleic acids through an alpha-hemolysin channel partitioning two chambers containing potassium chloride allowed characterization of polymer length via discernable blockage of ionic currents[ 5 ].
The foundational experiment leading up to today came when Deamer showed distinct patterns of pore current blockage were produced by chemically distinct oligonucleotides; pyrimidine oligos could be distinguished on the basis of blockade amplitude, while purine oligos could be distinguished on the basis of blockade duration[ 12 ].
A great number of refinements have since been made to this method, including the modulation of"

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," nm) of liquid culture: 0.44
OD (600 nm) of liquid after flowing through the chip: 0.41.
Interpretation
We expected a much lower OD after liquid flow through the chip, so this suggests the presence of a leak in the chip, that allowed the liquid culture to flow without retaining the bacteria.
Second experiment
A few drops of RFP expressing DH5alpha E. coli liquid culture were poured in a membrane microchannel chip. The chip was then observed under a microscope.
Interpretation
Membrane is located on the right side, and liquid culture was poured on that side, before the membrane. Bacteria was still able to flow to the left side, but they were not following the microchannels, instead they were all just flowing in a single direction, suggesting the membrane lifted the microfluidic chip from below and thus caused massive leakings in the microfluidic circuitry.
Figure 23: Membrane microchannel chip under microscope
Third experiment
A few drops of E. coli liquid culture were poured in a membrane microchannel chip. The chip was then observed under a microscope.
Interpretation
The membrane is located on the left side, and liquid culture was poured on that side, before the membrane. Bacteria this time wasn't able to flow to the right side, the membrane stopped their progression . It is clear on figure 24, that the left side is crowded with bacteria, and the right side is empty (apart from a few PDMS impurities). Final conclusion on the membrane microchannel chips is, that although the integration method of the membrane filter in the chip is complicated and a bit improvised, some chips apparently do fulfill their purpose , demonstrating this way the confinement of the bacteria with a membrane. Leaks observed in previous experiments were also probably caused by membrane filters that were not correctly stretching across the whole chip.

Tufts,2014,Team:Tufts#ribosponge_-_-_TEXT.html," presented by the gram-negative predator of gram-negatives, Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus. This organism also has two distinct life phases. A free-swimming attack phase allows it to roam and locate its prey. After finding a suitable host, B. bacteriovorus attaches to the unfortunate gram negative bacterium and digests it from within.  A recent transcriptome analysis by Karunker and colleagues has shown that the most common RNA identified by sequencing was a non-coding segment which houses a c-di-GMP aptamer. (11) This RNA was only present during the motile attack phase. In addition, it accounted for just as many reads as all protein coding sequences combined and is about as common as structural nucleic acids such as rRNA. These results imply a different mode of action for the bacteriovorus riboswitch. The sequence acts more like a sponge which sequesters available c-di-GMP than a switch which responds to its presence. The discoverers have dubbed this 445nt transcript massively expressed regulatory RNA (merRNA). (11)

Methods
The merRNA from Bdellovibrio could be introduced into the genome of other bacterial species and placed under the control of an always-on constitutive promoter. Cyclic di-GMP RNA aptamers are known to bind 1000-fold more tightly to their messenger (KD ~ 1nM) than other regulatory proteins like PilZ (KD ~ 1µM). (10) Thus, these transcripts of the merRNA should in turn sequester the secondary messenger. As a result, the pathways responsible for the transition to a persistent state should not be activated. One advantage of this strategy is that the ribosponge is a non-coding RNA construct; the metabolic burden of transcription should be much lower than that demanded by the transcription and activity of a phosphodiesterase or genome editing enzyme.
We designed a strategy to express merRNA in E. coli and test its effects on biofilm growth using SnapGene molecular biology software. The merRNA sequence was obtained from Karunker et al (11) and identified in the Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus HD100 genome at position 1,073,741−1,074,185 with a length of 445 nucleotides.. Since the goal here was to physically sequester c-di-GMP in cells, we aimed to produce large quantities of the RNA and thus decided to place it under the control of the T7 promoter which is both constitutive and leads to very strong expression. In turn, this sequence is flanked by a set"
Calgary,2011,Team:Calgary#Outreach#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," composition, depending on which pond they were taken from, and even which section or depth of the pond they were taken from.  Because of this, we decided that it may be interesting to test the viability of E. coli in different samples of tailings pond water.  The Lethbridge team has access to one sample of tailings pond water, while we have access to two others from different locations.  We decided to access E. coli viability in all three tailings ponds to see if we can observe any differences.
Protocol
50 mL of LB medium was made with tailings water and filtered through MILLEX filter Unit GS MF-Millipore MCE Membrane 0.22 µm in order to sterilize it and appropriate antibiotics were added. The tailings LB was inoculated with E. coli DH5α cells containing BBa_K331009 to an OD600 of 0.1. The flask was incubated at 37˚C with shaking for 7 hours, during which photometric readings were taken every 30. Photometric readings were taken using the Pharmacia Biotech Ultrospec 3000, as the OD600 readings reached 1.0 the solutions was diluted with LB media to keep the OD600 reading between 0.1 and 1.0. The same protocol was used to observe cell growth of E. coli DH5α cells containing BBa_K331009 in 50 mL of LB medium made with MilliQ H2O.
Results
On the right, we see the data set obtained from our team, where we graphed OD over time for our E. coli grown in two different samples of oil sand tailings ponds, as compared to just LB as a control.  Points are the average of two data points and standard error bars are indicated where necessary.  The graph on the left shows the University of Lethbridge data set, which again shows OD over time.  The graph on the bottom shows the change in OD for the cells grown in the tailings pond samples, as opposed to the LB only control.
Discussion
Because we saw so much variability in growth from the two data sets, we decided to graph the change in tailings ponds viability as compared to the control (just grown in LB) for both sets of data (the bottom graph).  This was interesting, as it shows that Lethbridge saw a much smaller difference in viability between E. coli cultures grown in tailings pond samples v.s. LB.  This suggests that some tailings ponds may be more suitable for E. coli growth than others.

Team
Thirteen students and nine advisors are working on this four month project. We split up into several subgroups whose focus and results you can follow on the Notebook and Project pages. If you want to know more about the subgroups and the people involved, meet us on our Team page and let's get to know each other better at the Jamboree in Boston.
HEARTBEAT
Our team worked on a computational approach for the rational design of promoter libraries . Similar to existing methods which predict spatial preferences of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) by detecting statistically overrepresented motives we used Promotersweep to analyze and process the information of over 4000 human promoter sequences.

The iGEM idea
iGEM (international genetically engineered machines competition) is an international competition in synthetic biology, hosted by the MIT in Boston. The aim of this competition is to answer a basic question that Randy Rettberg, the director of iGEM, once described as follows: ""Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology just too complicated to be engineered in this way?"" The iGEM-approach to answer that question is to actually try to engineer biological systems with a proper function. To this end, more than 100 interdisciplinary student teams from all over the world, mainly consisting of undergraduate students in biology, biochemistry, engineering, informatics and mathematics, carry out different projects during the Summer. These projects reach from medical applications, i.e. genetically modified bacteria used in cancer-treatment to environmental and manufacturing projects, i.e. the construction of a watch-like counter"
