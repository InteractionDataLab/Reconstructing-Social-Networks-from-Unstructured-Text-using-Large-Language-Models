Homology modelling procedure
To generate our models we followed the procedure from the basic and advanced tutorials of the Modeller web page with some modifications. We first selected ten templates with known structures for our peptide-contaning scaffold. In the case of the protein G scaffold, this was done using the best five results from the Modeller ""profile.build()"" command and the best five results from an homology search in the Protein Data Bank; the PDB files of the selected templates are: 1PGB, 1FD6, 1FCL, 1QKZ, 1EM7, 2GB1, 1GB1, 2RPV, 2QMT and 3GB1.
In the case of the GFP scaffold, the selected templates were only those from the results of the ""profile.build()"" command; their PDB files are: 1XSS, 1OXD, 1XA9, 1MOU, 1XMZ, 1UIS and 1GGX.
Before starting with the alignments, we made a secondary structure prediction using the GeneSilico Metaserver . The consensus data was parsed from the results of the metaserver and processed so that the secondary structure information was associated with their corresponding amino acid residues.
The PDB files from the selected templates were aligned using the ""salign()"" command to generate a template alignment with the ""alignment_type"" in ""tree"" mode. The fm01645 family tree was used for the protein G scaffold template alignment and fm02248 in the case of the GFP scaffold. Then the sequence of each of our peptides was aligned separately to the template alignment using the "".append"" method. Ten initial models were generated for each peptide using the secondary structure data as restrains; the best model with the best DOPE score was selected for loop refinement. The loop refinement generated ten models for each peptide; this was iterated until"

Run PCR products on gel
If successful, clean up fragments, run on gel again, cut with restriction enzymes NheI and BamHI, clean and then ligate together fragments.
The objectives written in grey coloured text are objectives fulfilled in today's lab session, the objectives written in purple coloured text are objectives which were changed and the objectives left in black coloured text are objectives not achieved.
Tomorrow's lab session will be centred around the following objectives:
Run products of PCR reaction involving the arsR BioBrick (BBa_J33206 in pSB1A2 missing promoter) and cadA promoter region
If successful clean up product, run on agarose gel through electrophoresis, excise band and carry out gel extraction.
Cut cleaned and excised fragment with BamHI and NheI
Carry out ligation (possibly an overnight ligation)
Cut pMUTIN4 and cotC (i.e. PCR product 3) with BamHI and HindIII
Ligate the fragments (possibly overnight)
Stochastic Switch Team
We run the restriction digests stored in the freezer from Wednesday to see we really have the biobrick (sspB + pSB1AT3)
We had the results on the gel as we expected. We saw the bands for the plasmid backbone which were all equal in 11 columns. The 11th column had mCherry + pSB1AT3. mCherry has around 1000b and sspB has around 550bp which can also be confirmed from the gel.
This result meant we had our first manual biobrick! sspB + pSB1AT3 ligation worked and when we cut the ligated product we had the bands as we expected.
Today we did restriction digests using fast digest enzymes of pGFP-rrnb (EcoRI + NheI) pMKRQ+kinA (EcoRI + NheI) and James and Hanny's sleB (EcoRI + NheI). Gel extraction was done on pGFP-rrnb.

Gold Medal and Integrated Human Practices
This page will contain information for your Gold medal Human Practices work, which you can also use to nominate your team for the Best Integrated Human Practices page. To make things easier, we have combined the Gold medal page with the Best Integrated Human Practices page since we expect the work to overlap considerably.
iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the Human Practices page .
Gold Medal Criterion #1
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Best Integrated Human Practices Special Prize
To compete for the Best Integrated Human Practices prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Jun 4: My first day in lab
Today was my first day in the lab. I was warmly welcomed by a group of girls who had an ungodly amount of energy at 9 am in the morning. After all of the introductions to my lab mates, I started work by going through a tutorial on some surface applications using Visual Basic and the surface software development kit. I made my first mistake in lab today by wearing my headphones while working. I learned that headphones impeded my ability to communicate with my fellow lab mates. After working on the touch surfaces, I was allowed some"

Berkeley,2013,Team:Berkeley#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," her impeccable taste in expensive pipettes. In wetlab, she worked predominantly on isolating and characterizing several of the glucosyl transferases we tested, and she also made our BioBrick parts for the Registry. Ramya played a role in creating our poster, presentation, and most of the written content for our material. She specializes in eating Thai food, throwing used centrifuge tubes into distally located waste bins, and never submitting sequencing on time.
Thomas Rich
Thomas Rich aka 'Sir Thomas' is in his final semester of Bioengineering at Berkeley. He was focused on mutagenizing some of our GTs to expand their substrate specificity and working on potential applications for our indigo biosynthesis pathway in yeast. He designed the introductory slider and did most of the Wiki styling and plugins. Thomas aspires to use his iGEM experience to help him think outside the box in all of life's applications, and eventually, become a high school teacher. Most notably, Thomas' facial hair grows at a most rapid pace, engulfing his face a mere week after shaving.
Mentor: Zach Russ
Zachary Russ is a 3rd year graduate student in the Dueber Lab tasked with guiding our team down the path of science. He helped us define many of our research objectives and troubleshoot many of our assays. In particular, Zach experimented with indigo production in yeast which could broaden the applications for our current biosynthesis pathway. His most prized skills include his ability to pun his way through any conversation and consume vast quantities of tangerine juice.
Mentor: Chris Eiben
Christopher Eiben, another iGEM mentor, is a 2nd year Bioengineering graduate student from the Keasling Lab. His protein engineering experience with FoldIt was extremely useful in helping us better model our GTs and hypothesize Glu activity. When together, Chris and Zach deliver a formidable onslaught of puns that both awe us and make us contemplate dropping out of iGEM.
Advisor: Terry Johnson
Terry has a master's degree in chemical engineering from MIT and is currently teaching bioengineering at UC Berkeley. He hopes that by doing so, he will be giving students the tools that they will need to repair him when he gets older.

Temporal Control
Engineering Approach to Module Integration by Temporal Control
This temporal control platform showcases our engineering approach in the E.ncapsulator project. It allows us to integrate all our modules in a simple and elegant way.
We’ve made our entire system modular, where we trigger the succession of events using this control system. Here, we have tackled a drug delivery problem, but this ""Black box"" approach can be applied to any other system. This is our novel engineering approach, which is extremely reusable in synthetic biology.
Timeline of Temporal Control
This timeline shows the sequence of occurrence of these events:
  About the timeline, its explainations, and to view our testing construct.
Conclusion
Module integration has allowed us to link all our modules together, to create a working network.
It also allows us to showcase the advantages of synthetic biology as the marriage of engineering with biology. By integrating the engineering principles of reusability and simplicity of system, we have developed this platform to program biologcal systems.

Cambridge,2010,Team:Cambridge#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," documentary to be broadcast on ARTE which will bring a better understanding of synthetic biology to the general public. We also wanted to get a message across to the scientific community; the Gibson assembly technique which we performed frequently is not as widely used as we believe it could be so we chose this to publicise and produced a music video to do so. The song has over 3000 views so far and researchers have contacted us for more information about our experience with the technique.
Many iGEM teams were similarly open with their ideas and results and this helped to foster the culture of collaboration that we believe is important to iGEM. We were however disappointed to see that some teams were less open. Three weeks before the wiki freeze 58 of the 127 teams participating had little more than an abstract on their wiki. This meant we were unable to engage in potentially valuable dialogue because we had little idea about what they were researching. To help encourage future teams and scientists generally to be more open with their work we produced a short video summarising our arguments. Previous iGEM teams have made interesting contributions to the field of human practises which perhaps have not had the desired effect on the way people conduct their science because not enough other scientists have seen them. We hope a short and more light-hearted summary might reach more people and help translate our conclusions into future action.

B-POM: Biological proportional operational Mu-circuit
In 1990s, Eric Mjolsness and several researchers developed the concept of genetic circuit from electronic circuits, to facilitate research in modeling gene expression and regulation (Mjolsness, Sharp et al. 1991, McAdams and Shapiro 1995, Reinitz and Sharp 1996, Sharp and Reinitz 1998). Upon the inspiration, Ron Weiss, a computer engineer of MIT, constructed an AND-gate genetic circuit in 2001 (Weiss, Knight et al. 2001). Based on Weiss’ pioneering result, the team of Jeff Hasty took IPTG (isopropyl β-D-1-Thiogalactopyranoside) and aTc (anhydrotetracycline) as the inputs and GFP (green fluorescent protein) as the output; demonstrating the AND-gate circuit in a more lucid and applicable way (Hasty, McMillen et al. 2002). In 2005, to investigate the prospect of genetic circuit, Oliver Rackham proved that other kinds of logic circuits are feasible by orthogonal topological structures (Rackham and Chin 2005). In 2013 iGEM, we inherit the idea of resembling electronic circuits. By incorporating AND/OR gate and operational amplifier into one circuit, we create our device-Biological Proportional Operational Mu-circuit (B-POM).
In comparison with Weiss’ invention, B-POM has only one homogeneous or heterogeneous input and output. Besides, multiple magnitudes of input are distinguishable by the new circuit, and a given input corresponds to a certain output. Moreover, whereas general genetic circuits are vulnerable to the noise of cellular background, B-POM seems more interference-free, implicating the prominent stability of our device.
In applications, we plan to enhance Bio-electric Interface, the device designed by 2012 Edinburg iGEM team. If the input is biochemical signal molecules and the output become electrons, B-POM can be coupled with Bio-electric Interface,"

Novozymes currently base their production on easy accessible proteins and carbohydrates such as sugars and starch and as cheap as possible, but Gernot J. Abel is open to the idea of using waste streams as substrates. However, he also made us aware of some the main points of the Novozymes strategy, which our technology must accommodate in order to be viable.    Gernot stated that having a process, where the fermentor is cleanable and the fermentation controllable is essential: “One question is if we can make these cell factories cheaper… It has to be controlled, it needs to be clean and temperature controllable. You have to bring in all the nutrients. Cell factories is our heart and our production system, so it’s extremely important.”
Like Novo Nordisk, Novozymes have one main goal and that is to deliver, what the customers require both in regards to meeting the demand for quality and quantity.
“Novozymes is about manufacturing. Our RD research is important in developing but in the end of the day, you have to deliver to the market and be able to send enzymes and ship them to the customers... For us it’s more important that our enzymes can do their job. We keep trying to optimize our enzymes to perform better. That is where our focus is compared to changing our production host.”
Summary of the main points from the Novozymes interview:
The process should be cleanable and controllable.
Production on waste streams should be cheaper compared to traditional production.
Quality and quantity of the product is the most important.

DESCRIPTION
Exploring the possibilities
After the interviews with Novo Nordisk and Novozymes, we were even more confident in our project. Insulin is most likely not produced from waste sources anytime soon, although the tools we have developed during this project might actually yield a viable production of bulk products in the not so distant future.

Next day we observed white and blue colonies in the plates, and all blue in the negative control as is was expected. Therefore we selected those colonies of each clone which were white and we did colony PCR on them.
The PCR was performed with Dreamtaq polymerase and as follows:
Primers ch1 and ch8.
Volume per reaction 25ul:
- Mastermix --> 12.5ul
- Water --> 5ul
- ch1 --> 2.5 ul
- ch8 --> 2.5 ul
- DNA* --> 2.5ul
* DNA is actually the selected colony diluted in 20ul of distilled water.
PCR's settings:  1st- 10min -- 98C --> Cell lysis
2nd- 3min -- 95C --> Activation
3th- 30sec -- 95C --> Denaturailzation
4th- 30sec -- 55C --> Hybridation
5th- 2min -- 72C --> Elongation
Repeat from 3th to 5th 25 times
7 minutes -- 72C --> Final elongation
After the PCR we ran an electrophoresis with the product but the gel was empty, it might have been because the polymerase Dream taq we were using was spoilt since the control wasn't amplified, therefore we repeated the PCR with another aliquot of Dream taq polymerase under the same conditions of PCR and after we run a new electrophoresis.
The Control plasmids is a PCR where only clean plasmid (after miniprep) was added.
The Control colony corresponds with a common colony PCR with an strain which contains the pFNS0, our backbone plasmid.
Finally we had reason to be happy :D. Since we had some positives. In this case all the clones except BGI.
Therefore we could start doing the phusion proteins, since we had all the clones for the proteins with only the His-tag.
In parallel we run another PCR but changing a detail, we realized that if we did the cell lysis in the thermocycler, as it had been done until now (see above), the resolution of the electrophoresis was not so good, then we decided to repeat the electrophoresis but doing the lysis before in a thermoblock.
The protocol followed is the following:
1º 5min - 100C --> Cell lysis
2º 5sec - vortex --> Homogenization
3º 3min - centrifuge"

To achieve this goal they use the collateral effect of the AOX enzyme (Alternative oxidase) mainly designed to generate heat in response to a cold-shock, using the hybB promoter. This effect increases the bacteria growth at temperatures below 20°C. Finally we design a prototype device with a better cold shock promoter (CspA promoter) developed by UNAM-CINVESTAV Team in 2010, in order to give our E. coli a “Intelligent Coat"", which means that not to only survive a cold-shock but to also still been able to keep up with his duties due to improve their expression mechanism at low temperature.
Regulation with Quorum-Sensing, THU,Gold medal
They  dedicate in pursuing the goal of the construction of a biological oscillator, which they call 'ECHO', the abbreviation of 'the E. coli Homochronous Oscillator'. With two Escherichia coli populations expressing gene one after another, they give red and green fluorescent light alternately. E.coli populations communicate bi-directionally by a class of signaling molecules involves in bacteria quorum sensing, that is, N-Acyl homoserine lactones (AHL), to regulate the gene expression of each other. By engineering their gene circuits, two groups (name as CELL-A and CELL-B) will form a network, with B inducing A and A restricting B, thus able to realize oscillation. A mechanism is set up to change the rate of an AHL expression, allowing us to control the period and the phase of the oscillatory cycle.
As a translational regulatory tool, our device achieves more precise tuning of protein expression when compared with transcriptional tools. The controlling elements we use in this device are codons and tRNAs, the major participants of translation process. Thus manipulating these elements exert direct effects on protein biosynthesis. We just try to summarize something  useful  for more teams to refer to.

Evaluation of iGEM@home, a new tool in Science Communication
In order to evaluate our Human Practices approach, we investigated the perception of iGEM@home in three ways:
We monitored the activity of users
We conducted an evaluative survey
We screened the content of the forum for important feedback
Here we list the most relevant results of our evaluation.
1. Website and client activity monitoring
(as of 12.10.2014)
User: The iGEM@home website currently counts more than 400 users from 42 countries. About 75% of supporters do also support other iGEM Projects. The Users are organized in more then 80 teams that build smaller communities and associations inside the BOINC community. The Age ranges from 12 to 88 years.
Computation power: More than 1,100 calculating computers are connected to the iGEM@home network and more than 100,000 jobs have already been computed in this project consuming 1.2 Million CPU hours. This is equivalent to a 28,190$ per month cloud computer cluster by amazon web services
Communication: Users of iGEM@home already posted a 190 times on into the forum (mostly providing bug reports and suggestions for further development steps). The screensaver has shown up 1300 times for an average of 2:08 hours. In this time it displayed about 40,000 screensaver slides.
For the most up to date information visit the server status page , the official BOINCstats and our forum .
2. Online survey on iGEM@home
Close to wiki freeze we conducted an online survey to gather some additional information about the users and evaluate key features of iGEM at home. The majority of survey participants are male (88%) whilst they spread widely across the age spectrum (12-88 years old). 89% of participants decided to join the iGEM@home project to support the science of the iGEM teams. Only a few users are interested in the teamwork aspect of distributed computing or in comparing computer power with other users. The survey was well received by the community and covered 20% of the total users of iGEM@home, starting with 55 replies at the first day and dropping to less than 5 replys/day at the second day.
A set of results regarding the content and setup of iGEM at home is visualized in figure 1. The data in"

Combined-chain reaction (CCR) and multiple-mutation reaction (MMR)
Several methods for PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis have been developed. Among these, the combined-chain reaction method proved to be very rapid and reliable (Bi & Stambrook, 1997). The principle of this method is the use of mutagenic primers that hybridize more strongly to the template than the external primers. The mutagenic primers are phosphorylated at their 5’ ends, and these are ligated to the 3’-OH groups of the extended upstream primers by the action of a thermostable DNA ligase (see the Figure beside for the principle). Moreover, the DNA polymerase employed must not exhibit 5’ 3’ exonuclease activity, to prevent the degradation of the extended primers. In our view, Pfu and Pwo polymerases are both well suited. The original protocol describes the introduction of two mutations simultaneously. In a previous study, we used a combined chain reaction to mutagenize four distant bases in a DNA fragment in a one-step reaction.
The MMR is a further development of the CCR and allows the simultaneous introduction of up to nine mutations in a single PCR approach (more have yet to be proven; Hames et al., 2005). The MMR was especially designed for the work with Mycoplasma genes in order to express recombinant genes in E. coli . The species Mycoplasma differ in their genetic code and use the opal codon (UGA) to introduce tryptophan instead of terminating the translation. Hence, it is absolutely necessary to exchange the opal codons, if present, with UGG codons (TGG on DNA level). Meanwhile, the in vitro synthesis of oligonucleotides is getting more inexpensive and will replace this method in the future, especially, because the MMR can be very time consuming.

BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Limiter#network_-_-_TEXT.html," repression of G, independent of its level of activation.  We might face the issue that increased expression of inducer A would surpass the repressor's ability to oppose gene G's activation.  Thus, instead of a constitutive promoter, we could ensure that the repressor for the gene of interest is under the control of a promoter that also takes the same inducer A as an input (Fig. 3).  This would mean that the amount of repressor expressed in the system scales with the amount of inducer, eliminating the possibility of our repressor being swamped by incresing induction of G's transcription.  However, both of these constructs have a critical flaw- they would always repress gene G, even when and where its expression is at a normal, healthy level.  Repressing gene G completely could cause problems by eliminating the possibility of gene G functioning normally.
To keep our repressor from interfering with normal levels of transcription, we need a way to turn off its activity when activation of G falls below a certain level, the threshold of healthy expression.
Bistability & Feedback
A bistable switch is a simple circuit in which, depending upon the nature or quantity of the input, two stable outcomes are possible.    Such a switch can afford a circuit the ability to alternate between two modes of activity in response to varying levels of input.  In one of the seminal publications in the field of synthetic biology, Gardner, Canton, and Collins of Boston University developed a genetic bistable switch [1] capable of switching between two distinct output states at a threshold level of input to the system.
The mechanism of bistability in this genetic switch is mutual inhibition (Fig. 4).  Two repressing transcription factors are put under the control of the promoter to which the other binds.  Thus, whichever repressor has a slight edge net negative effect on the other's transcription will ""win,"" repressing the other further and removing repression from its own transcription to create a feedback loop in which the system is stable.  Either factor can exist in an induced state, and when it is, the other is repressed.  The system can exist in two distinct, stable states.
Bistable mutual inhibition between two repressors provides precisely the sort of threshold switching behavior that we would like to apply to our factor R.  To set a threshold at which the system toggles between two stable states, we compare the expression induced by A on promoter G to a constitutive promoter by putting a repressor under the control of each (alpha and tau, respectively) and setting them in mutual inhibition.

○ Introduction
Recombinase, most of which come from bacteria and fungus, is a kind of enzyme that can make gene recombine [27][28]. It’s usually used to change the structure of genome, regulate the expression of gene and so on. A special sign site in genome (30-40bp) can be recognized by DNA recombinase, and the DNA recombinase will catalyze the recombination of the gene between two sign sites [29]. This ability allows the recombinase four basic functions: gene excision and insert, inversion, translocation and cassette exchange. These functions can be applied to edit the structure of genome, and also to regulate the expression of gene directly [30][31]. There are many kinds of recombinase, such as Cre, Flp, RecA/RAD51, Tre, Hin and others. Different kinds recombinase have different recognized site, so they wouldn’t interfere with other recombinases’ function.
○ Design
In order to fine regulate the pH of environment, we introduce the recombinase system here. We have two libraries of acid and alkali, when the different assembles of acid and alkali is used in our whole system, we need to use different methods to regulate it. So we designed three gene circuits using different kinds of recombinase to achieve the fine-regulation function.
1)Cre-LoxP and Flp-FRT circuits
Cre is a kind of Tyrosine recombinase (YR) from P1 bacteriophage. It can catalyze the recombination of the gene between the two specific DNA sign sites (LoxP site). The Cre-LoxP system consists of recombinase Cre and LoxP. When the two LoxP sites are in the same direction, the gene between them would be excised. However, if two sites are in the opposite direction, the gene would be inverted (Fig.7) [32]. Cre does not need ATP or other cofactor to achieve its function [33][34]. The length of LoxP is 34 bp, it contains two inverted repeat sequences (13 bp) and the interval sequence (8 bp). The interval sequence also can define the direction of LoxP(Fig.8).

Flp is the other kind of recombinase found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It can recognize the FRT sign site. Flp and FRT form"

Figure 1. Modified from Adler et al. Miniature Escherichia coli cells deficient in DNA.
What is a minicell?
Uneven cellular division in bacteria can yield a normal parent cell and an achromosomal “minicell”.
Smaller: At 400 nm, E. coli minicells are much smaller than their parental cells. [1]
Nonreplicating: Their lack of chromosomal DNA means minicells cannot replicate and cause infection, yet they still retain surface proteins and express plasmid genes.
Nonleaky: Minicells have stable, non-leaky membranes and inherit the cytosolic composition of their parent cell, maintaining protein and ion concentrations.
Figure 2. Doxorubicin leakage shown over the lifetime of a minicell. Retrieved from (MacDiarmid et al). Bacterially Derived 400 nm Particles for Encapsulation and Cancer Cell Targeting of Chemotherapeutics
Targeting Potential: Since their plasma membranes are derived from the parent cell, minicells have to potential to keep membrane targeting systems put in place before their production (i.e. surface proteins like invasin or antibody coupling).
Our Goals:
1. Make Minicell formation easily accessible to iGEM Teams
We aim to create a standard BioBrick that induces minicell formation in E. coli cells and to design additional safeguards to make our chassis as safe as possible. Research has shown that the overproduction of the tubulin-homolog FtsZ leads to minicell formation.
Figure 3. In E. coli, an oscillating FtsZ  ring controls the site of division. Normally this ring stops equatorially for even division, but overproduction of FtsZ  with our BioBrick can cause this ring to stop at the cell poles. This leads to the formation of minicell buds [2].

PCR Machine Inspiration and Design
We attended the University of Maryland meet-up in June. We had been working with the idea of a cheap DIY PCR machine because we had discovered one of the main barriers to colleges, community labs, and high schools getting into biotechnology was the price of the equipment. While at the meeting, we talked to the William and Mary team and discovered they had to get up ridiculously early to use a PCR machine in an advisor’s lab because they didn’t have their own machine. Upon hearing that, we agreed to sell our low-cost thermocycler that had not even been fully designed yet to William and Mary’s iGEM team. At the conference, we also spoke with the University of Maryland team about thermocyclers because they were also in the process of building a one for themselves. We discussed and, after the conference, continued a dialogue about the best, lowest cost options for design, Peltier chips, and code for the Arduino. The results of the collaboration can be seen on the Project Overview page.
Another point of collaboration was our meet-up with UNC’s iGEM team. This is the first year UNC will be going to the Jamboree, and we wanted to discuss our ideas and see if there was any way Duke iGEM could offer them support or collaboration with their project. Our projects were in different areas, but we enjoyed learning about their projects and answering questions about the structure of the Jamboree to the best of our ability."

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer

Project >Project Discription
    Pollution of toxic heavy metals generated by anthropogenic activities is a worldwide concern while aquatic environments are frequently the final recipients of most of heavy metal pollutants (Bakis and Tuncan; Boyd). For instance, enhanced accumulation inferred from sediment and ice cores clearly show mercury continually accumulates in waters and rivers (Fig.1 Tchounwou et al., 2003). Traditional techniques to detect or decontaminate heavy metals in natural samples can be costly and time consuming, especially at low metal concentration; therefore, robust and inexpensive methods to detect and decontaminate heavy metals in water are highly desirable (Tecon and van der Meer, 2008; van der Meer and Belkin). Namely, we need to develop a high-performance heavy metal decontamination kit which can accomplish the detection and absorption of heavy metals in aquatic environment conveniently.

This strategy was chosen to improve the purification caused by a step by step increasing Ni-NTA-elution buffer concentration. The elution was collected in 10 mL fractions. In Figure 8 only the UV-detection signal of the wash step and the elution are shown, this is because of the high UV-detection signal of the loaded samples and to simplify the illustration of the detected product peak. A typical chromatogram of purified laccases is illustrated here . The chromatogram of the ECOL elution is shown in Figure 8.
Figure 8: Chromatogram of wash and elution fractions from FLPC Ni-NTA His tag purification of ECOL produced by 12 L fermentation of E. coli KRX with <partinfo>BBa_K863005</partinfo>. ECOL was eluted at a concentration of 50 % (equates to 250 mM imidazol) with a maximal UV-detection signal of 292 mAU.
The chromatogram shows two distinguished peaks. The first peak was detected at a Ni-NTA-equilibration buffer concentration of 5 % (equates to 25 mM imidazol) and resulted from the elution of weakly bound proteins. After increasing the Ni-NTA elution buffer concentration to 50 % (equates to 250 mM imidazol), an UV-detection signal peak of 140 mAU was measured. The area of this peak indicates that a high amount of protein was eluted. In addition, a second peak right behind the first peak can be detected. At this point it is not clear which peak contains our product and which peak is caused by impurities. The corresponding fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to detect ECOL. A last peak can be detected after increasing the elution buffer concentration to 100 % (equates to 500 mM imidazol). This peak could be explained by impurities which were strongly bound on the Ni-NTA-resin. All corresponding fractions with an UV-signal were analyzed by SDS-PAGES"

These promoters control genes which are used for infecting the injured plant.  This virA gene was isolated from the TI-plasmid of A. tumefaciens C58. An illegal PstI restriction site was removed by site-directed mutagenesis. The functionality of this BioBrick was proved with <partinfo>K389015</partinfo> and <partinfo>K389016</partinfo>.

synthesized, new
This is the VirG response regulator from the VirA/G receptor system. The VirA/G receptor system is used by A. tumefaciens to detect phenolic substances secreted by injured plants, e.g. acetosyringone. In presence of these substances, VirG is activated by the VirA receptor and induces the transcription of genes under the control of a vir promoter. Normally, VirG needs the rpoA gene (RNA polymerase subunit) from A. tumefaciens to work in Escherichia coli but this virG BioBrick is mutated, so it works with the rpoA subunit from E. coli. For this reason the point mutations G56V and I77V were brought into the gene ( YC Jung et al., 2004 ). Because this BioBrick is synthesized (Mr. Gene GmbH), codon usage is optimized for E. coli and illegal restriction sites were removed. When you use this virG gene in a VirA/G signaling system you do not need <partinfo>BBa_K238010</partinfo> anymore to get the system working in E. coli.

Vir-promoters from A. tumefaciens are induced by phosphorylated VirG response regulators and control genes for infecting plants in their natural host. They are part of the VirA/G signal transduction system. This is a vir promoter from A. tumefaciens C58. It is located on the TI-plasmid upstream the virB genes.

It was so inspiring to met with these future scientists and we are very glad if we can teach them even a little thing. -We didn’t just work also had fun with science!  We organize two party to met with new people and have fun together with help of science. Our first party was SynBio Party and it has a concept of science and Synthetic Biology. With help of this party we can explain what is synthetic biology and what is our aim. -And finally we get rid of our stress by smashing some PETs!  We say our friends they have 10 seconds to smash plastic water bottles and record their achievements. Of course while playing this game people got curious about what are we doing and why. So we had to chance to explain our PET project to more people.
PET degredation is a crucial thing but why it can’t be also fun?   As an answer this question, we played a game with some team members and genetics students. In this game, we wanted from people to bend max number of plastic bottles in 10 seconds. Our aim is to tell people about our iGEM concept, our project and synthetic biology in an amusing way.     Have fun
SynBio Party! #2
Hello everyone! On 5th of April, we held our second SynBio Party. Approximately 200 people joined and had fun with Live Music and then DJ performance begun. It started at 09:00 pm and continued untill 02:00 am in Matiz Bistro & Pub in Ankara.  As you can see in photos, our team members wore lab coats and served colorful shots in experiment  tubes. It was important for us because in this way people might be learned more about what is synthetic biology and iGEM . While we were selling our party tickets, we gave lots of informations about them and informed them about our project. We tried to design a striking party poster. Thus, we used visuals that are related with synthetic biology such as, experiment tubes . When students from different deparments saw our posters, they automatically ask what is iGEM ? , What does synbio mean? In this way, we had a chance to explain. Now lots of people in our university have known these answers and we have reached our goal. Scientific Truth : Everybody loves drinking colorful things in experiment tubes! :D
SynBio Party! #3
Autumn is coming! Before the midterm season, we decided to organize SynBio Party #3  but this time our concept was ""Autumn""!   Approximately 150 people joined. They really loved Autumn"

BBa_K1166001
The Fumarate-Nitrate Reductase protein or FNR helps hypoxic promoters to have a more sensitive hypoxic response, it works as an activator and repressor for oxygen-dependant genes. Activity is proven by comparing the expression of GFP (BBa_E0040) by promoters with and without the simultaneous expression of the FNR protein (BAL38390.1).
BBa_K1166002
We assembled this device to save time and ligation reactions for future teams wanting to use the E.coli secretion system. This secretion device includes all the necessary elements (linker-HlyA secretion signal peptide and the expression cassette for HlyB and HlyD) for the secretion of expression cassettes cloned in the 5' terminal of the device.
This secretion device is usable by Silver standard fusion in its 5' end for proteins with no stop codon. Codes for both the proteins HlyB and HlyD (native from uropathogenic strains of E. coli), which, along with the constitutively expressed TolC protein, form a secretion channel. This secretion system recognizes proteins tagged with the C-terminal secretion signal peptide HlyA, and secretes them to the exterior of the bacteria.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users"
Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," Bob Mulder, the communication specialist of Wageningen UR and team adviser, pointed out the following principle: ""Don’t change the consumer, change the technology"". After several conversations with beekeepers from the NBV and through Bob Mulders advice, it became clear that an improved product must meet the following criteria:
It should be effective and specific, not killing the bees or have any negative influence on the beekeepers.
It should be adapted to the hobbyist character of beekeeping, ensuring the viability of E. coli in the sugar water so no changes have to be made in beekeeping practices.
It should not interfere with honey, like the curent usage of thymol does.
Design
We contacted the Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) to help us in designing an applicable format for BeeT. After mutual visits, a design student from the DAE – Thieu Custers -  proposed a product that incorporated the daily practices of beekeepers and BeeT: A juicebox-like product that beekeepers apply to the sugar water just before the start of the winter.
BeeT design and product description by Thieu Custers, Design Academy Eindhoven.
""I am interested in combining disciplines to discuss ideas and come to new solutions. By using science and art together, I aim to tell stories about what could be our future. I want to take existing conflicts or themes and envision what could be their consequences or solutions, to broaden our understanding of the present.
BeeT is an innovative approach to solving a man-made problem. Implementing a genetically engineered bacterium into the agricultural sector is something that should be done carefully. It opens up a dialogue about the use of altered organisms in daily life. Communicating both the risks and the merits of such a precise tool is the most important to me. Genetic engineering is a new technology that is met with a lot of fear, but by completely and openly showing the inner workings, it can be assessed honestly.
With BeeT specifically, the challenge is going to be to gain acceptance in the world of beekeeping. The design of the BeeT container is meant to be clear in use, and will show which hive is currently being treated with the bacteria. The marking label is still connected to the container of the bacteria, ensuring no mix up of labelling.""
BeeT will, via the sugar water, end up in the brood food and be transported to cells where bee larvae grow and where the mites are present. Inside the cell it will ""sense"" and kill the mite, strongly increasing the chances of survival for the colony. Existing technologies use for example thymol"

INTRODUCTION
In 1997, Dove, Joung, and Hochschild showed that they could initiate prokaryotic transcription through the interactions of two proteins fused to the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase and a lambda repressor, respectively. The system fused the lambda repressor to a bait protein and the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase to a target protein (Figure 1). The interaction of the bait and target proteins stabilizes the binding of the RNA polymerase allowing the initiation of transcription [1]. This P2H (Prokaryotic two-hybrid system) developed by Dove et al was used primarily as a way to screen protein-protein interactions, and was spun into the BacterioMatch kit produced by Agilent [2]. Its utility as a detection mechanism, however, remained unexplored.
Fig. 1 - The original prokaryotic two-hybrid system, with the single modification of cloning in our RFP indicator.
Inspired by the yeast two-hybrid system designed iGEM Tsinghua 2017 [3], we fused antibodies and dCas9 proteins to the subunits of the P2H system, creating a versatile platform capable of detecting specific DNA sequences, small molecules, and proteins. Our DNA detection system works with dCas9-protein fusions, which can be targeted to specific DNA sequences (Figure 2), and is called casP2H (cas9 prokaryotic two hybrid system). Our protein and small molecule system works by fusing single-chain-antibodies specific to different epitopes of a target protein or small molecule, and is called SCAP2H (single chain antibody prokaryotic two hybrid system).
This detection system is unique because it utilizes transcription. Detection-induced transcription allows genes to be activated by the presence of a user-selected molecule, therefore creating a genetic output to a chosen input. For example, a therapeutic protein could be transcribed in response to a disease biomarker.

Overview
SZU-China iGEM’s multifaceted approach to tackling concrete cracks is innovative and unique. In order to facilitate the development of our novel ideas, we have spent each stage of our project visiting and interacting with experts in the field, adjusting design carefully with the feedback of current civil engineering experts in mind. On the whole journey of iGEMer's practice, we have also experienced team work for fun, regional conference for project communication and instruction,. All of these works outside the lab broaden the possibility and creativity of our original idea.
ABOUT SAFETY CONCERNS
To fully condsider the application of our ""self-repairing concrete"" in the real world, we came to attend the workshop attend the synthetic Biology Regulation Workshop in HKUST
We first attended the lectures on overview of gene drive system and Ethical, legal and regulatory issues of gene drive. It was given by professor Kenneth A.Oye from MIT and professor King.L.Chow from HKUST. It was very rewarding and we also asked two professors some questions on bio-safety of our project during the tea break. And we really appreciated the advice.
During this workshop, we discussed the wetlab operation safety and the further risk invoving in synbio bacteria functioning in real world. The professor first gave positive review on the low risk of Bacillus Subitilis operation, providing us the basic risk level measurement for experiement. After discussing our novel 'concrete' idea with them, they suggested that several bacterial embedding situation should be paid more attention to, such as their pressure endurability, the bactreial dispersion risk. Based on their own long-term research experience, we got inspired to help improve our design
Exploring the feasibility of application for real world
Thinking about the application of our project in real world, we interviewed certein experts on Civil Engineering for suggestions and even investigated several buildings in different areas. We are engaged in exploring the feasibility of our self-repairing concrete in real world.

Using this strategy, five constructs were designed with the constitutive promoter J23113 as the basis for the sequence following the downstream FNR binding site.  The construct that worked best as an oxygen-sensing promoter (J6, [ BBa_J376003 ]) was fully characterized and is shown below.
The oxygen promoters were characterized using a Tecan infinite M1000 microplate reader.  Each sample was grown overnight on plates and transferred to a 96 deep-well plate for overnight growth.  After 16 hours the samples were tested in the Tecan, where measurements would be taken for around 12 hours.  Sometimes, measurement of growth of three successive plates (serially diluted from the preceding one) was needed before the appropriate steady state could be recorded.
Results
All measurements were taken using the Tecan Infinite M 1000 spectrophotometer.  The following is a graph of the raw fluorescence values recorded by the Tecan for two oxygen promoters, D5 and J6.  Each construct was duplicated in the 96-well plate.  One was allowed to grow normally under aerobic conditions, while the other sample was covered in 100uL of mineral oil to create an anaerobic environment.  Serial dilution of two plates resulted in 3 sets of data for this experiment, as seen below.
The next graph shown is the Raw data for OD for the same constructs shown above.  The OD is proportional to the number of cells growing in the media, so dividing the fluorescence by these values is approximately proportional to the fluorescence per cell.
Shown below is the Fluorescence over OD of each sample.  As the samples reach steady state, the graph should become a horizontal line.  Notice how the graph comes closer and closer to reaching this steady state with each successive plate.  Also, it is important to remember that evaporation comes into play here when comparing anaerobic and anaerobic samples with each other.  Since the anaerobic samples are covered in mineral oil, it is expected that the evaporation rates of the media underneath is less.  This means that, for aerobic cells, the OD becomes artificially inflated as the same number of cells have become concentrated in less and less media.  It is not known to what extent the evaporation effect has on these data.
Next, the fold-change was calculated for each sample. That is, the fluorescence/OD for anaerobic growth of the sample was divided bye fluorescence/OD for the"

The Topics
As expected the most discussed topic were GMOs and their legal regulation around the world. But we also managed to touch upon topics such as social responsibility, education of public, Crispr/CAS9 or accessibility of science. It quickly turned out that two hours dedicated to the discussion were not nearly enough to satisfy the curiosity of our audience. Luckily the coffee and cookies served after the event helped us to prolong stay of the panellist and ignited more interesting exchanges even after the event finished.
THE PANEL
TAKE HOME MESSAGE
This event gave us more inside look into different opinions outside just iGEM or scientific environment and was a great opportunity to collaborate with iGEM Stockholm. It was also great experience to organize event of this magnitude. From designing posters, handling the marketing of the event, inviting speakers, managing refreshments and gifts for the speakers, this was a great opportunity to try all of these things for the first time and get some hands on experience with event planning. We would like to thank our panelists to participating with no promise of fee and to our audience that came and participated with interest. Lastly we would like to thank iGEM Stockholm to sharing these responsibilities and experiences with us.
Our most important work resulted in creation of the Ethics guidelines for which we used knowledge from this panel discussion and our Webinars which are fully available to everyone who is interested in synthetic biology on YouTube.
We took these experiences and used them in our other attempts to involve public in our project. We presented at a Biosummit in Boston. We have helped and got new ideas during the Biohacking event in Uppsala. We shared our project during events such as SynBio hours which iGEM Uppsala organizes and that attracted around 150 people. Our presenting team took the opportunity to reach out to new Uppsala University students during Student Science Conference where they won the best presentation! Most importantly while organizing and preparing these events we learned a lot about the project and got plenty of interesting ideas to work on."

Our collaboration with Tec Chihuahua from Mexico involved human practice activities. We offered our social media platforms to get responses on the surveys they were conducting. The survey was targeted at general public and centered around the concerns and issues relating to Synthetic Biology as perceived by common people.
IIT Kharagpur India
Our collaboration with IIT Kharagpur included Skype sessions where we shared construct designs, exchanged thoughts about improving them and insights about effective human practices. We disseminated their survey which sought to understand the perception of Synthetic Biology among the general public of our region. Given the current political situation between our two countries, our skype sessions, discussions, and idea sharing not only enabled us to bridge divides and share science across borders, but also laid the groundwork for long and lasting relationships for the future. We even listened to the 'Aman ki Asha'(The want of Peace) song together!

Local Public Engagement
In order to gain acceptance of our project, we need to allow the publics in Hong Kong to know about our project and synthetic biology. We achieved youth education on synthetic biology by our workshop, introduced participants to what synthetic biology is and induced their deeper thought on ethical issues connected to synthetic biology. Through on-campus activities, we promoted synthetic biology to our schoolmates of different majors and specialties, aroused attention to this topic. Holding outreach activities, we connected our project to the public, and gained opinions so we could make further improvements for the real-life practice of our project.
One day Synthetic Biochemist workshop (4 FEB 2017)
Around 30 students from 12 different high schools (as listed below) participated in the workshop for hands-on experience about synthetic biology experiments under our guidance. The day camp consisted of lab experiments, lectures of basics of synthetic biology and genetics as well as sharing of our project. We also discussed synthetic biology-related ethical issues. We conducted surveys before and after the workshop. It shows that students have increased understanding of synthetic biology after this workshop! Through this activity, we would like to inspire high school students’ interest in synthetic biology.

UT-Tokyo,2010,Team:UT-Tokyo#HumanPractice May_-_-_TEXT.html,"Many people said that they would take the medicine produced by genetically modified bacteria described in question 3. However three quarters of the people said that they would rather choose the medicine over death. These results indicate that people have ambiguous concerns about the safety of genetically-modified products and that they do not want to use them if possible. Therefore, it is more important to organize a framework that enables the public to accept it than to insist its safety.
4
The result that chemical-free modified crops is more acceptable than crops cultivated with conventional pesticides indicates that products originating in nature are more familiar to people than apparently artificial products such as chemical substances. However we cannot ignore the fact that more than 30% people said that they could not accept modified crops and 28.62% people did not respond.
5
Most consumers excessively trust the labels on genetically-modified food issued by the national agency and do not doubt it. Therefore the use of national agencies should be effective in acquiring reliability.
6-10
The results indicate that using genetically-modified crops as feed for domestic animals is more acceptable. So, people tend to think that it is not important that genetic modified crops are cultivated unless they eat the products.
12
We should thoroughly notify the public that genetically modified products are treated carefully under the regulation so as to avoid their diffusion to the environment.This is because many people are worried about them breeding with wild species. There was an opinion that we should use seeds that are sterile, but this conflicts with antitrust law. Meanwhile, public opinion will not interfere with the progress of scientific research and the development of products using genetic engineering technologies because these are well appreciated by the public.

Endelig knagede det ene æg efter det andet: “pip! pip!” sagde det, alle æggeblommerne var blevet levende og stak hovedet ud.  “Rap! rap!” sagde hun, og så rappede de sig alt hvad de kunne, og så til alle sider under de grønne blade, og moderen lod dem se så meget de ville, for det grønne er godt for øjnene.  “Hvor dog verden er stor!” sagde alle ungerne; thi de havde nu rigtignok ganske anderledes plads, end da de lå inde i ægget.

Bladder Cancer Sniper
Combine Biological Unnatural Amino Acid（UAA）Orthogonal
genectical system with logic ""AND"" gate gene circuit
to kill bladder cancer cells precisely
Quick View
Why is sniper?
Sniper means to shoot the target precisely. Distinguish from the conventional therapy such as radiotherapy and chemical therapy, the synthesizing system we construct target bladder cancer cell specifically without harming the healthy cells.
<
>
1/6
Background
Nowadays,bladder cancer is one of the urologic tumours in the world. However, the conventional therapy have focused on mass cell  killing without specific targeting. Therefore, targeted and specific therapeutic strategy turns out to be a promising approach to the treatment of bladder cancer.

2/6
AND GATE
AND gate is the synthesizing gene circuit which only operates in bladder cancer cells that behaves as a logical AND gate on two input promoters. It activates an output only when both promoters are capable of driving gene expression in the tested cell lines.

5/6
Result
The result shows that the expression of the output reporter gene being detected in bladder cancer cells were significantly higher that of other cell types, which suggests our circuit can selectively perform its function in bladder cancer cells. Our orthogonal system is also verified to work in high efficiency since it only demonstrated significant activity in bladder cancer cells with Ack.

That is, the engineered E.coli cannot sense and control the plasmids due to the deficiency of its functional parts.
To solve the problem above, we aim to employ the Lambda Red Recombination system to integrate the functional parts of our project into the genome. The two main factors which will influence the recombination efficiency are the target sites and the length of homologous arms.
After a period of try-error, we have successfully integrate several functional circuits in the form of DNA linear fragments into the chromosome of E.coli DH5α. The efficient tool of genome editing based on recombination has expanded the application of our project and greatly facilitated the measurement of our setting thresholds when the plasmid comes to the low-copy concentration.

Bootcamp
This is how it begins. The iGEM bootcamp at UCL is intended to prepare us for the roles we are going to play this summer. We get to talk to some of the founding members of iGEM and meet two other iGEM teams from London, from the Biohackspace in Hackney and Birkbeck College.
Monday 15th
We met at 09:30 in the lab. It is the first time we could all meet each other after our exams. The team members from the Biohackspace and Birkbeck were there as well. After the briefing on lab safety and other things we started with a SpeI and PstI digestion using the backbones from the InterlabStudy 2015: J23101 , J23106 , J23117 .  As an insert we used an RFP containing vector from the iGEM 2014 distribution. We confirmed the digestions through an agarose gel electrophoresis and went for a break in the sun. Afterwards we performed the ligation of the insert and the backbone.
In the afternoon we had a skype meeting with Randy Rettberg from the iGEM foundation and learned something about the spirit and history of iGEM.
Tuesday 16th
We split up into two groups to transform bacteria with the ligation reaction from yesterday. One group was using electroporation and the other chemical transformation. We incubated the bacteria overnight.
For the afternoon we split up into different groups preparing us for the individual roles that we will take in the team.

Controversy on Stem Cells
Stem cells have been an object of interest for many biotechnology researchers. Stem cells are cells that can divide and differentiate into diverse cells types. They have potential to treat tumors, tissue regeneration, diabetes, Parkinson, neuronal regeneration and hearth attacks.
The controversial discussion around stem cells is because of their origin. In the beginning, they came from  embryos which were destroyed after the cells were obtained. The problem is that life begins once the embryo is fertilized.
What most people don’t know is that there are different types of stem cells: Embryonic and Adult. The embryonic stem cells are obtained from a fertilized embryo; meanwhile, adult stem cells are obtained from other sources such as teeth, bone marrow and umbilical cords. These type of cells could be used to avoid controversy and they may also be used in therapeutic treatments.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#notebook 9_-_-_TEXT.html," of hope, and this week has definitely been a big leap for our DB. This time Liao finally realizes that we are actually making the next-generation standard of SBML, haha. Settling a brand-new standard of bio-modeling has actually become the core of our work. As far as I’m concerned, we have made 3 shifts on our goal, UI -> simulation -> bio-modeling standard, this is poor goal-setting, we didn’t make a clear map of what we are doing at the very beginning. I talk on DB and modeling with 2 junior students, they are all confident and eager to learn, I think they can handle it properly very soon. I just don’t have the time to talk with Soimort and Kun.
Sep 12 ~ Sep 19, 2010 Plan: Write note on UI&input, discuss UI&input with Soimort. Discuss ODE solver with Kun. Settle the final edition of DB. Writing DB of EPF-Lausanne with 2 junior students. Have fun working.
Summary: Write a detailed note on UI&Input and discuss it with Soimort. I believe it is not easy for him to understand the whole design of UI&Input and its connection with the database, I should spend more time to explain the details for him. Kun says he has finished the L2V4 update of ODE solver, he is now working on the boolean value judging module which will be used in Liao’s code. Liao’s first edition of document on DB standard is done, it’s now my turn to refine it and fix the bugs. Zhengda He has written part of the DB of EPF-Lausanne 2009 under my guidance, we can see the whole DB by next week, hopefully. Another junior student Zhaoyi Li is working on synchronized E.coli oscillator, a biological breakthrough published on Nature 2009. Last but not least, this is a busy week for scheduling trip, paying fee and talking to sponsor. Handling these things cost me lots of time, we should have a secretary for this, luckily we find one, she is Jue Wang. My boss doesn’t push me so hard on finishing his assignment, and I’m grateful for that, he must know that I don’t have much time. I do have fun working this week!
Sep 20 ~ Sep 26, 2010 Plan: Finish EPF-Lausanne database, finish E.coli oscillator database, update DB document. Discuss UI with Soimort and push him to work faster, discuss synchronized E.coli"

Preparation of chemically competent cells
Take a trace of Escherichia coli from a glycerol stock vial and put it on a LB plate with the correspondent antibiotic.
Incubate overnight at 37ºC.
Pick a colony and inoculate 10 mL LB medium containing the relevant antibiotic. Grow overnight at 37ºC.
Add 1mL overnight culture to 100mL prewarmed LB medium containing the relevant antibiotic in a 500mL flask, and shake at 37ºC until an OD600 of 0.5 is reached (usually 90-120 min).
Cool the culture on ice 5min, and transfer the culture to a sterile, round-bottom centrifuge tube.
Collect the cells by centrifugation at low speed (5 min, 4000 xg, 4ºC).
Resuspend the cells gently in cold (4ºC) TFB1 buffer (30 mL for 100 mL culture) and keep the suspension on ice for 90min.
Collect the cells by centrifugation (5min, 4000 xg, 4ºC).
Discard the supernatant carefully. Always keep the cells on ice.
Resuspend the cells carefully in 4 mL ice-cold TFB2 buffer .
Prepare aliquots of 100-200µL in sterile microcentrifuge tubes and freeze in dry-ice-ethanol mix. Store the competent cells at -80ºC
Transformation of chemically competent cells
Take 1 µL DNA to be transformed and put into a cold sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and keep on ice.

Human Practices
Overview
Our work in human practices focused on answering two questions: will our diagnostic test responsibly impact the world in a positive way, and if so how can we best tailor our design to the needs of those seeking to use it. To answer these questions, we sought the advice of professionals specializing in paper-based assays and the opinions of those who would feasibly come into contact with the test at each step of the diagnostic process. The insight we gained from these interactions demonstrated that Yeast ID has a high potential to responsibly improve the lives of those suffering from yeast infections. By listening to feedback from these key stakeholders we were also able to identify and correct previously unforeseen problems in assay design, propelling us closer to our goal of making as large and positive as possible. Our human practices process consists of six basic steps.
Step 1
Doing research on the problem and learning diagnosis and treatment processes
Follow up on findings from literature review by investigating diagnosis and treatment processes first hand.
Who we talked to:
Practicing OBGYN: Dr. Lisa Yang
On any given day, Dr. Lisa Yang could expect to visit with regular patients for checkups, perform surgeries, coach a future mother through labor, and deliver multiple babies. Dr. Yang additionally oversees surgeries and tests performed by residents in training. Apart from answering our questions pertaining to current diagnostics for yeast infections (see problem page), Dr. Yang described the ideal yeast infection diagnostic. The ideal diagnostic has the following characteristics:
Able to produce results in the office without the use of specialized lab equipment
Produce a comparable number of false positives and negatives compared to the ""gold standard"" diagnostic
Inexpensive
If her staff is able to perform the test because she either has to conduct the test herself or send it into a lab
Requires minimal training and expertise to complete
Step 2
Developing our Paper-Based Assay
Throughout the process of building our paper-based assay, we consulted professionals who"
BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU#Medals_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM Sustainable Labs Challenge hosted on the Sustainability@BU app, in which teams tracked sustainable actions such as sharing autoclave cycles or powering down equipment to earn points. Targeting three major areas in which impact could be reduced, BostonU and participating teams diverted 98 pounds of waste, reduced CO2 emissions by 1300 pounds, and saved 2900 gallons of water. We created GreenGEM, an online repository which documents best practices for sustainability so future teams can improve lab best practices. Following the success of the iGEM Challenge, BostonU is broadening the scope of our efforts by facilitating a Biological Design Center Sustainability Month, which will feature an expanded challenge between labs at Boston University. BostonU is spearheading sustainable practices, helping Boston University Sustainability pilot a Green Labs Initiative. Find out more about our human practices and GreenGEM .  In addition, we ran several outreach events to introduce students of varying ages to synthetic biology. BostonU participated in panels, improving upon past activities for students, and leading bioethics forums. These experiences were valuable for exposing young students to synthetic biology.

Gold Medal:
1. Integrated Human Practices
We focused on incorporating what we learned about sustainable lab practices into our daily routine at the lab. At first, this took the form of reusing gloves and recycling cardboard boxes. Soon after, we built up to committing to preliminary experiments in the shaking incubator. The eVOLVER, the novel culturing platform we used to characterize our strains, uses up about 3 liters of media per 8 hour experiment. By conducting preliminary experiments in the shaking incubator that require tens of milliliters of media, we can make sure that only working yeast colonies are shuttled into larger eVOLVER experiments, saving media as well as the great amounts of energy used to autoclave media. Read more about how we changed how we conducted our science here .

Introduction
3A assembly (which stands for three antibiotic assembly) is a method for assembling two BioBrick parts and selecting for correct assemblies with antibiotics.3A assembly is now the preferred assembly method at iGEM HQ and the Knight lab at MIT.
It differs from Standard Assembly in that it relies on three way ligation (between the two parts and the backbone vector) for assembly rather than two way ligation between a part and a part + vector.  It uses effective antibiotic selection to eliminate unwanted background colonies and eliminates the need for gel purification and colony PCR of the resulting colonies. In theory, about 97% of the colonies should be the desired assembly.
More recently, the Registry has been providing iGEM teams and Registry labs with linearized backbone plasmids to further improve this assembly method. This page has been updated to reflect the most modern approach.
Motivation
3A assembly was designed such that gel purification of the digested parts is unnecessary.  Incorrect assemblies are selected against via either positive or negative selection.  The motivations for eliminating the gel purification step are as follows
Gel purification is slow and not easily susceptible to automation and scaling.  As the Registry moves to larger scale assembly of parts, gel purification can be a limiting step in terms of how many assemblies can be done in parallel.
Gel purification tends to be inefficient especially on small pieces of DNA.  It can be difficult to isolate small pieces of DNA (< 200 bp) from a gel.  Thus, when assembling two small pieces of DNA, 3A assembly might prove advantageous.

The left part is in a plasmid with an antibiotic resistance cassette for antibiotic A.
The right part is in a plasmid with an antibiotic resistance cassette for antibiotic B.
A construction plasmid is selected with neither resistance A nor B. It has antibiotic resistance C.
The left part's plasmid is cut with EcoRI and SpeI.
The right part's plasmid is cut with XbaI and PstI.
The construction plasmid backbone is a linear piece of DNA. It has a few bases beyond the EcoRI and PstI restriction sites"

7/22:  I prepared minipreps of our transformations as well as make glycerol stocks of YFPc + pBad and YFPc+pCat.  I did a restriction digest, again cutting at X and P, of GFP+term, RFP+term, and BFP+term so that I can combine it with an RBS/promoter.
WEEK 8: 7/25-7/29/2011
7/25: This morning I ran a gel of my restriction digests from 7/21 and 7/22 of the fluorescent protein genes combined with terminator.

The inserts from the restriction digest should have been around 1350bp, 810bp, and 849 bp for GFP+Term, RFP+Term and BFP+term respectively.  However, on the gel, only one band shows up with the incorrect size.  Also, the samples of BFP+term from 7/15 did not show up at all on the gel, thus are not viable samples.  With the other samples that only produced one band, the restriction digest must have only cut at one place and did not fully complete.
7/26: Since the restriction digest from 7/25 did not work well, I decided to increase the nanograms of DNA in my reaction from 500ng to 2000ng so that there is more DNA that can possibly be digested.  The RD was still run for 2 hours and involved the GFP+term, BFP+term, RFP+term.
