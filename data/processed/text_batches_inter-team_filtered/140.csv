Introduction
Since we got the Midi Prep of kinA transformation, we have enough plasmid which are enought for digestion test. We take Chris's advice to use new ladder which would be more accurate in measuring DNA's size.

Other three digest sample came from Jess's mini prep for sac transformation.
Conclusion
Lane 3,4 were K1, K2 digested result. The kinA fragment is 2048bp, so the kinA band should be at the same position with the 6th band of lamda ladder or the 8th band of 1kb ladder. But the gel picture showed that those three bands were not at the same level. Even the ladder are not consist with each other. To confirm our kinA clone result, we need digested pMK-RQ as a standard control.

Typical E. coli growth curve with O.D.start evaluated by Threshold algorithm in LB
Typical E. coli growth curve with O.D.start evaluated by Threshold algorithm in M9
A model-based approach was proposed to estimate many interesting parameters, such as the HSL synthesis rate per cell, and an algorithm was proposed in order to evaluate the O.D.start for every self-inducible device.
In the figures below, the O.D.start and the HSL synthesis rate as a function of the strength of the promoter (RPU) controlling the signal molecule production are reported for <partinfo>BBa_K300010</partinfo> (Sender&Receiver device in HC plasmid) and for <partinfo>BBa_K300009</partinfo>/<partinfo>BBa_F2620</partinfo> (Sender device in LC plasmid in combination with Receiver device in HC plasmid).
O.D.start and K_HSL as a function of RPUs of the promoters controlling the signal molecule production for <partinfo>BBa_K300010</partinfo> in high copy number plasmid in M9 medium
O.D.start and K_HSL as a function of RPUs of the promoters controlling the autoinducer production for <partinfo>BBa_K300010</partinfo> in low copy number plasmid used in combination with <partinfo>BBa_F2620</partinfo> in high copy plasmid in M9 medium
A strong correlation between the promoter strength, previously measured in RPU, and the O.D.start is depicted by the reported graphs. This is consistent with the expected behaviour of these parts, since the HSL synthesis rate is an increasing function of the upstream promoter's strength.
For RPU values greater or equal to 1, the expected behaviour is not confirmed anymore. This is probably because too high luxI expression levels and/or synthesis rate of HSL are injurious for the cell.
The combination of promoter strength variation and plasmid copy number modulation allows the creation of a library of self-inducible devices able to perform autoinduction at many different O.D.600 values, in any cellular growth phase.

We tried to run heterodimer analyses of each primer against the cage gene itself, but the program timed out since the cage gene is so long. In any case, not much can be done about unfavorable annealing at this point. If anything weird happens we can simply gel purify the correct band.

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Once again, the primers will be attempted to be design and optimized today, with the consideration of the secondary structures.
Since there was extensive secondary structure after analyzing the primers on IDT.  Some of the codons will be changed to avoid overlap.  Using the DNA codon table from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_codon_table .  The goal was to get a deltaG under 9kcal/mol for any homo/heterodimers, as suggested by IDT.
A new file was made on Benchling called PCquad Optimized 2.0.  This includes the previous version optimized to avoid iGEM RE sites, as well as an attempt to optimize for primer design.  The edits were first done on PCquad Optimized for pET22b.   Several changes were made in at the beginning and end of the protein cage sequence.  NCBI blast was used to verify that the amino acid sequence was the same as the original PCquad.   The new file to be used for our protein cage is “PCquad Optimized 2.0”

SMMU-China,2018,Team:SMMU-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," The different views of the masters on synthetic biology inspired us to look into the problem we met in our research in another way.
As a preview, three of our team members gave a presentation of our project in English and answered questions from judges and other iGEMers attending to the meeting. During the process, we found many drawbacks of our program, such as the bio-safety parts and modeling parts. We were suggested to hand over the safety form to the organizing committee of iGEM due to the use of AAV. We were also recommended to build a mathematical modeling, which is closely attached to our research, to guide the production and ensure the effects of the antibodies. These parts were not considered in our project because we were not familiar with the rules and the competition. But, luckily, these problems were pointed out by the judges and iGEMers. In the poster presentation, our team visited many outstanding teams’ posters to learn about their experiment design and other good points in human practice, mathematical modeling and so on.
Near the end of CCIC, we joined in the round table conference with Meagan Lizarazo, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the iGEM Foundation. In the conference, Mrs. Meagan shared us experience on the Giant Jamboree, like how to deliver a good speech, attentions on the trip to America and so on. Through CCIC, we learned more about iGEM not only in the attentions and points, but also attracted by the positive research atmosphere. Everyone in the iGEM team had tried their best to fight for more and more achievements and came up with new and better ways to fix the teams’ trouble.

Figure 2: Efficiency of the blue light system using different time intervals of illumination.
To test the efficiency of the light system, SEAP expression after illumination was determined.           The SEAP assay was performed 24 hours after light exposure. Cells were incubated with           blue light for 1 hour, 2.5 hours and 5 hours. Labjournal
The blue light system is effective in activating the reporter SEAP which was introduced        into the cells before illumination by transfections. As we know       that the duration of illuminating the system with blue light (452 nm) is critical       for its efficiency, we tested various time intervals for illumination. Our results       indicate that five hours of illumination lead to the highest level of SEAP expression (Fig. 2).
Another important finding was the specificity of the blue light system.        In the dark controls, we found almost no activation of the SEAP reporter,       leading to a very low background level in our system.
SEAP as a Reporter
In order to test the capability of the blue light system for pattern generation, we transfected HEK-293T cells with the appropriate plasmids (PKM292 and PKM297) using seap as a reporter gene (PKM084). Cells were transfected in suspension and seeded on 96 well plates afterwards. Single wells of these plates were covered with a photo mask that prevents exposure to light. All other wells on the plate were illuminated to induce SEAP expression. SEAP that was secreted into the culture"
Groningen,2018,Team:Groningen#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," For fossil fuel based styrene a value of 3,1 KG needs to be added to this  (Croezen & Lieshout, 2015) because these emission will lead to a net carbon emission. (see figure 1) (Croezen & Lieshout, 2015). A full LCA should also include other impact categories, however it is decided not to include these; we discovered the LCA analysis in a late phase of the project which forced us to simplify the analysis.
Figure 1. Figure retrieved from: http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1021-20192013000200001
Analysis
For our analysis, we compared the process of producing styrene from a bio-based feedstock to the process of producing styrene with petroleum as a feedstock. To define the cradle to gate emission of petroleum-based styrene we contacted two experts of the company CE Delft, the authors of a report stating the GER for industrial feedstock (Croezen & Lieshout, 2015). With their expert help, we were able to define the cradle to gate emission of petroleum-based styrene for our analysis, the value being: 7.8 CO2-eq per kilogram styrene.
Now we need to compare the GER of petroleum-based styrene with the GER of our StyGreen. In order to do this we need to define the GER of StyGreen. The first step in defining the amount of CO2-eq per kilogram StyGreen is: defining the feedstock. We explored many different feedstock options . After comparing many possibilities, we decided to use recycled toilet paper. The main reason for this choice was the sustainability aspect. Recycled toilet paper is not used for anything at this moment. Therefore, it could be argued that it does not hold monetary value or even a negative monetary value. This means that we can add value to the life-cycle of toilet paper. Another reason for choosing toilet paper, is that we do not want to compete with the food industry. It might be feasible to use sugar, or first generation resources to produce styrene, but this does not fit into our view of a better world.
The second step was to calculate the carbon footprint of recycled toilet paper. The carbon footprint of a feedstock in a certain phase of the Life-Cycle analysis is proportional to the monetary value the feedstock holds in that particular phase. Since the recycled toilet paper is derived from paper, we looked into the monetary value of recycled toilet paper in combination to the"

I would like to ask you if you have the information about the genes coding for these MAAs?
Again I don’t have much experience with         the biosynthesis of MAA and I don’t think         many of the genes are known. There is a little         bit literature on the subject and again in         the review the biosynthesis section may         put you in the right direction.

Do you think that production of yeast extract enriched with MAA would be a valuable combination?
Yes.
What can be the possible difficulties in producing MAA in yeast? What do you think how we can overcome them?
Codon usage could be the potential problem but you should try first the genes from cyano.
Whether the additional exposure to sunlight have the same effect in yeast as in Cyanobacteria in terms of increasing concentration of MAA? In your opinion, what can be done to increase the yield of MAAs in yeast?
It varies organisms to organisms depending on the nature of the promoter.
Would you please suggest anything to increase the yield of porphyra-334 compared to shinorine? Do you think whether the change in serine/threonine proportion would have an effect on the ratio porphyra-334/shinorine?
You can try changing serine/threonine proportion but I think         it will depend on proteins responsible for conversion of MAAs
In your opinion, do we need to add some additional compounds to our sunscreens to increase photostability of MAAs. If yes, what compounds we can use?
MAAs are highly stable but its stability will depend on the final composition of sunscreen which needs to be tested.
How do you think, is the combination of Shinorine and Porphyra-334 reasonable for sunscreens?
Efficacy of the final product can be tested against targeted goal.

We drafted a petition to have residents of our city sign, indicating that signatories support urban beekeeping in Lethbridge. As we talked to residents, they agreed that bees play a crucial role in our lives and that we need them in order to survive.
After petitioning city residents, we presented to our city council about what we wanted to change in our city.
Meeting with MLA—Shannon Phillips
Team members with Shannon Phillips
Shannon Phillips, the Member of Legislative Assembly for Lethbridge West, and the Minister of Environment, as well as the Minister Responsible for the Status of Women is a local representative for the provincial government. Minister Phillips showed support for our project. She showed respect for our work as well as that of other scientists, stating that “there needs to be a healthy respect for scientific method, [and] for evidence based decision making”. She also recognized that our society may be entering “a phase of people being skeptical of science”. She felt that the only way to overcome this obstacle is through education. Minister Phillips also showed support for genetic engineering in general, stating that she “[doesn’t] see any problem with genetic engineering at large and in most of its applications”.

Beekeepers Visit and Interview
Team members visiting bees
Following this interview, we were able to get in contact with two urban beekeepers. They allowed two of our team members and an advisor to tour their beehives and to speak with them about their experience with urban beekeeping. The beehives were surprisingly inconspicuous. Both of their neighbours are aware of their beekeeping practice, and have not had any issues with the bees, noting that they rarely notice them. The beekeepers did mention that in urban beekeeping, in comparison to commercial beekeeping, you need to be “really diligent with hive management” in order to control swarms, which may instill fear in citizens. When asked about their speculations on why the bylaw may exist, the beekeepers (who asked to remain anonymous) reported a heavy stigma surrounding beekeeping, and a lack of education on the subject. They felt that legislators and the general public were uneducated, and therefore fearful of urban beekeeping. The beekeepers also provided some advice on how urban beekeeping could be successful in Lethbridge. They stated that beekeeping was so easy in B.C. due to the “excellent beekeeping community”. Based"

Therefore, we designed FimE(wild-type) ( BBa_K1632010 ) ) whose nucleotide sequence completely matchs that of the wild type’s fimE. Comparing these two parts, two differences were confirmed. First, FimE of 2008_Caltech lacks the nucleotide sequence of N-terminal 15 residues. Second, FimE of 2008_Caltech differs from the nucleotide sequence of FimE(wild-type) by C-terminal 2 residues as shown in Fig. 3-3-3-8.

IIT-Madras,2018,Team:IIT-Madras#IntegratedHP_-_-_TEXT.html,".com . The features of the website are minimal with basic information that we felt was very useful and referred to multiple times in our own experiments. Data includes commonly used strains of A. baylyi and vectors. We also included detailed data on vectors and laboratory pages on basic protocols that were helpful in our own experiments. Further, in an attempt to highlight the vast multitude of applications of A. baylyi as a host, we made a “Research in baylyi” section that includes a set of informative papers for each of the applications of A. baylyi.
Results:
The website was curated by members the bioprocess and metabolic engineering lab in the Department of Biotechnology in IIT Madras. These researchers work with A. baylyi on a regular basis and include our instructor and advisors. We received valuable insights in designing the structure of Baylyi News throughout the course of the project. We hope to connect more researchers and have created a form in the “Contact Us” section that allows visitors to send us queries. In the future, we hope to connect with the researchers working with A. baylyi around the world and help beginners troubleshoot their problems with ease.
Addition of A. baylyi data and other organism data onto ChassiDex
ChassiDex is an online information resource and database that equips one to work with unconventional synthetic hosts with ease. Having started work on this database from 2017, we faced challenges such as ensuring credibility of data and verifying the correctness of the codon table generator. Since we managed to verify the latter with the results of our project this year, we decided to work on the former.
Our contribution:
We sent out a google form across to researchers willing to add data through a google form. After that, we manually curated all the data and changed all the descriptive data to a collection of tags to reduce plagiarism and increase searchability through this markdown approach. Motivated by our preliminary successful results in our endeavours with A. baylyi, we decided to add our data and parts collection in the A. bayli section of ChassiDex.
Collaborations and future directions:
Our collaborative efforts using the portal on the iGEM page motivated Team Marburg that worked with V. natrigens, another unique host to add their data and comprehensive list of parts onto ChassiDex. We hope to publicize our efforts and collaborate with many more such teams with successful results through the interaction at Giant Jamboree 2018 while simultaneously maintaining the credibility of the data. Further, we will write about our results and initiatives"

Company 5 -called, not in the office, so I left a msg. Follow up  July 23.
Company 6 -called the lady for the 20th time in the last 10 days, she’s not in her office and there’s APPARENTLY no one else who handles sponsorship. GRRRR. But I’m gonna keep harassing her. Customer service APPARENTLY has no way to get a hold of her but they saw coming in and out of her office so she’s not on vacation.
GlaxoSmithKline - this is the new company that I found yesterday. Called, left  a voice mail. I need her email address so as soon as I get a hold of her I’ll talk to her and send pkg
I also edited the newsletter that Jamie sent to the marketing team last night. I’ll discuss the corrections tomorrow. Then I checked over a couple of marketing emails that Jeremy and Fahd were sending out companies. Then Fahd and I wrote up an email toVWR and Mandel Scientific requesting specifically the reagents and pipettes that Thane wanted us to order. We checked the email over with Jeremy before sending.

Building inside the eukaryotic cell
I was working in Second Life for most of today, specifically the eukaryotic cell. I scrapped the previous endoplasmic reticulum and installed a new one and it looks much better. Scripts were added to make it ""sparkle"" in order to give it that ribosomal look. Smooth ER was also created today. Experimentation with particle systems proved to be a worthwhile endeavor. I had trouble with changing the settings, but I eventually figured out how. the result was vesicles coming out of the Golgi body periodically (you should check it out!). I have also chosen a location for the cell and thus, was able to script some of the organelles to move and expand. Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Gregor about ethics at 10 so that should be interesting.

Hannover,2016,Team:Hannover#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," part of science is the ethical questions that need to be answered every time one starts a new project. So we decided to talk about the ethical aspects of genome editing and the future abilities you have when your project is ready for the industry or a medicinal facility. Questions that come up are “Where are the ethical limits?"" or ""What happens when they get extravagated?” Most of the time, scientists just see the positive impacts of their work and in the process, forget to think about their negative consequences.
We talked to a group of science students about the fact that genome editing gives us the possibility of healing cancer and hereditary illnesses, and how this could introduce discrimination of disabled people or the beginning of “designer babies”.
Selling cake
While selling cake in the lounge of our university, we tried to inform people about the competition and our project. We got to talk about TALEs and how genome editing is? no longer just a dream. Everybody enjoyed good conversations and some sweet treats.
Social media
Because we live in a time where social media has such a big influence in the world, we tried to build up an online community on Twitter and Facebook. We attempted to connect with other teams and keep everybody updated on our progress. We also wanted to inform the public about the competition and our team. Reaching out to the community is very important in order to get new ideas, solutions for lab problems or just to exchange knowledge.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#ImprovePart_-_-_TEXT.html,". Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the"

From 2013.igem.org
One of the most important parts of science and scientific progress is commonly forgotten by researchers. Working and communication between teams is not only beneficial for both in technical terms, but also opens a bridge that is essential for science; collaboration.
This year we crossed words with a fellow Latin American team. Team: Buenos_Aires started the conversation and our ideas began to flow we talked about how we were achieving hypoxia for our hypoxic promoters characterization and how they were measuring their arsenic sensitive promoters. After some discussion we concluded that we could improve each other’s measurements and agreed to make the collaboration.
When we received the part Team: Buenos_Aires we proceeded with transforming its DNA into Escherichia coli TOP10 chemocompetent cells. Selection of transformants was done with Tetracicline and we continued with a restriction analysis using EcoRI and PstI enzymes. The resulting agarose gel is shown by duplicate in the following pictures.
After transformants were proven to have the correct plasmid by restriction analysis, we started induction with sodium arsenite. Different concentrations ranging from 0 ppb to 1000ppb were used as induction and measurements were done at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours.
In each column, 10mL cultures of E.coli transformed with the measurement device were grown until 0.5 OD600. After that, cultures were induced with different concentrations (in ppb) of sodium arsenite. Measurements of RFP fluorescence (AU) and OD600 were taken every time specified in the time (h) column and AU/OD600 is reported. A public water source and water from a nearby lake were also assayed.
Using the last measured fluoresence/OD600 value plotted against the concentration of arsenite used as inductor, a calibration curve was obtained.
With the use of the newly obtained calibration curve we also measured two samples that we obtained from our neighborhood. We took samples from a nearby lake and from a public water source. Following the same procedure, we grew E.coli cells until .5 OD600 and induced with the samples we obtained (after using a 0.0002 mm syringe microfilter) until 8 hours of induction. After measuring AU/OD600 for 8 hours we obtained the following data:
Taking the latter into account we might be more careful from where do we have contact with water. These results encourage us"

MakerFluidics:
MakerFluidics is a microfluidic fabrication protocol that leverages open, low cost, and easily accessible tools to fabricate microfluidics. In this toolchain, microfluidics are created using a CNC mill to create channels in a thermoplastic, biocompatible stock. MakerFluidics uses open source software, including 3DuF, and now Neptune. Neptune is developed to be compatible with MakerFluidics; in Neptune SVG design schematics are generated, ready to fabricate with a CNC mill. This protocol was developed by our mentor Ryan Silva.
Fluigi Core:
Fluigi Core is a place and route tool that takes MINT files that the user inputs into Neptune, and it performs an optimization placing of channels, valves, and other components onto the microfluidic chip. In essence, Fluigi Core generates design schematics from the MINT standard microfluidic specification format you provide it. Neptune wraps Fluigi Core, it is the algorithmic library to our software. This program is currently in development by our mentor Radhakrishna Sanka.
NetSynth:
NetSynth is a logic minimization library for Verilog. The original purpose of NetSynth was to take a Verilog description of a circuit, and convert this into a netlist of wires and gates that realize the design description. Our iGEM team has joined the prior work of Prashant Vaidyanathan to refactor NetSynth into a tool that can also perform logic minimization on microfluidic designs. Prashant is responsible for originally repurposing NetSynth for microfluidic design, and our team has further contributed to this by integrating NetSynth outputs with the Mushroom Mapper tool we created.
Document at least one new substantial contribution to the iGEM community that showcases a project made with BioBricks. This contribution should be equivalent in difficulty to making and submitting a BioBrick part
Our contribution to the iGEM community is not a single hardware device, nor a one-off software tool. Our contribution to the iGEM community, and the synthetic biology community as a whole, is much greater than that. This summer we built a completely integrated, seamless, end-to-end microfluidic design, fabrication, and control workflow. This workflow enables the rapid, modular, and parametric design of microfluidic chips, and our workflow integrates with low cost, open fabrication methods. This is something that has never been possible in microfluidics before.

Venom composition
Snake venom is a complex mixture of proteins, enzymes and other substances with toxic and lethal properties. Its function it to defend against threats, immobilize the prey, and help the digestion. Some of the proteins in the snake venom have very specific effects on biological functions, such as blood coagulation, blood pressure regulation and transmission of nervous or muscular impulses.
Proteins constitute 90-95% of venom’s dry weight and are responsible for most of its biological effects. Enzymes make up 80-90% of the Viperidae family venom and 25-70% of the Elapidae family venom [1]. The most common enzymes are oxidases, phospholipases, metalloproteinases, hydrolases and serine proteases. Polypeptide toxins include cytotoxins (effects mainly on local tissue), cardiotoxins (effects on heart tissue) and neurotoxins (effects on nerve tissue).
Venomic studies have enabled the characterization of venom composition, from snakes species of medical importance [2]. From these, it can be shown that the venom between snake species, even within families, is more similar than expected [3]. Major protein families like metalloproteinases (SVMPs), Phospholipases A2 (PLA2), cysteine rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) are present in all snake families, with the relative abundance in the venom composition being the only difference [4].
However, these studies have also shown that there are certain enzymes that are probably innate to snake families, for example the prominent serine proteases in the Viperidae venom, or the much more abundant three finger toxins (3FTx) in Elapidae venom.
Choice of enzymatic assay
In Australia, immunoassays based on venom-specific antibodies have been developed to distinguish between the most lethal snakes in that region [5]. Immunoassays have been used or suggested to be used as a detection mechanism for snake venom for many years [5,6].
We apply an alternative approach to detect snake venom circumventing immunoassay based methods. We want to create a proteolytic enzyme assay based on a linker sequence which contains a cleavage site for proteases that are characteristic for the venom of different snakes.
Proteins that give off signals when a linker sequence is cleaved, are not a new invention. FRET (Föster resonance energy transfer) has been used for many years in research, to gain a"

Ultimately our success on long-duration missions will be directly related to the life support systems that we bring with us, with a closed-loop system representing a pinnacle of achievement.
These responses from these distinguished men were very helpful in guiding our team in our exploration of our project. They gave us insight into what aspects and factors need to be considered, from the economic to the social aspects, when tackling a future problem towards prospective manned Mars missions. Ultimately, we could not have developed and understood the implications of our research without having reached out to these experts.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.

How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some"
XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," of interest. [5] What's worse, the premise of using ELISA is to find the corresponding antibodies, but the fact is that not all proteins can find their specific antibody protein. That is to say, the use of ELISA is also limited.
In terms of binding assays, using aptamers as affinity ligands to recognize specific proteins are better than those using antibodies. Aptamers are short, synthetic single stranded oligonucleotides (DNA or RNA) that can bind to target molecules with high affinity and specificity. [6-9] They are commonly selected from random sequence libraries, using the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) techniques. [10] Advantages of aptamers over antibodies include longer shelflife, improved thermal stability and ease of modification and conjugation. [11]
An interesting binding assay is to use aptamers as the target recognition probes and CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) as the signal amplifier, which is called Aptamer Based Cell-free Detection system (ABCD system, Figure 1). We developed this system to detect those biomarkers of protein-type for the purpose of disease detection or staging.
Figure 1. Aptamer Based Cell-free Detection system.
Abstract
The core of the ABCD system is the specific binding of the aptamer and its target protein. We immobilize the aptamer- ""complementary strand"" complex on a solid phase, using a ""competitive"" approach to free the ""complementary strand""; then the ""complementary strand"" was detected using the trans-cleavage property of the Cas12a protein, which allows the fluorescence recovery of the static quenched complex whose fluorophore and quencher are linked by a ssDNA. In summary, we initially transform the protein signal to the nucleic acid signal, then transform the nucleic acid signal to the fluorescence signal. We use aptamer SYL3C [12] against EpCAM, an epithelial cell adhesion molecule that is highly expressed on the surface of adenocarcinoma cells, to test the feasibility of our system.

        There are three main types of lithic relics in Hangzhou; they are stone sculptures, stone towers also known as Dhavaja, and stone inscriptions. The stone sculptures are primarily represented by Feilai Peak (飞来峰), Ciyun Ridge (慈云岭), and Statue of Mahakala in Baocheng Temple (宝成寺麻曷葛剌). Stone Towers are primarily represented by White Tower (白塔). Stone inscriptions are primarily represented by Hetingwuhe Fubei on Lonely Mountain (孤山放鹤亭舞鹤赋碑).
        Plus, Feilai Peak and White Tower are National Key Historical Relics.      Most lithic relics encounter physical, chemical and biological interaction, resulting in weathering corrosion, pulverisation lesion, cracking, contamination, and colour mottling. Those phenomena jeopardise the value of lithic relics and even lithic relics themselves, and the lithic relics in Hangzhou are not of exceptions.
        In 2002, some of the classic lithic relics were inspected and it was found that the surface of Feilai Peak Sculpture was greatly ruined (Figure 1), and there is leaking on Ciyun Ridge Sculpture (Figure 2)..
    Meanwhile, Cultural Relics Department of China has been trying to maintain and recover the lithic relics. Since 2002, Cultural Relics Department of China mainly has been removing surface deposit, depleting pounding, strengthening crag, and changing flora; the government washed Feilai Peak Sculpture for many times (Figure 3).Government built a top above the Ciyun Peak Sculpture, this relic no longer had to expose to sun and rain henceforward (Figure 4).
    White Tower was comprehensively cleaned and strengthened by silicone by Zhejiang University of Technology (Figure 5).
     The power plants and railways were removed. During the washing, the staff intentionally left part of this tower intact, and made an contrast for further research of anti-contamination and anti-weathering (Figure 5-3, 5-4)

The assembly plan of the Killing system.
Background
Bacteriocin
With the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, we decided to use bacteriocins as our antimicrobial agent. A bacteriocin is a peptide that is produced naturally by certain bacteria and targets its close relatives. Unlike general antibiotics, the targets of bacteriocins are very specific. The bacteriocin, colicin Fy is produced by Y. frederiksenii and it should mostly target other yersinia species.  Bacteriocins will either attack the cell membrane or a mechanism inside  the cell, such as gene expression or protein production. [1] One of colicins Fy main targets is Y. enterocolitica. It kills Y. enterocolitica by creating pores in its cell membrane. Y. enterocolitica is also one among the common pathogens that infects the gut and causes some serious symptoms [2] . These were some of the reasons to choose colicin Fy as the bacteriocin to express.
Spot42 sRNA
Our goal was to design a seek and kill system. This implies that we only want to express the colicin Fy when our bacteria is close to the target. We chose this strategy because the cell would stress out to express colicin Fy all the time, even when not in close proximity to Yersinia. In order to make our bacteria express the colicin Fy only when we want it to, we have designed an sRNA system. We have based our design on the system that Team Uppsala iGEM 2012 implemented. .
The sRNA, spot42, consists of an antisense region that recognizes a specific RNA sequence to interact with as well as another region that recruits the protein Hfq. The Hfq protein blocks and prevents mRNA from binding to the ribosome. We have redesigned the antisense region so it will specifically recognize our USP45. This will make it bind to our USP45 and recruit the Hfq protein to stick to that region. [3] USP45 is the secretion tag that we have coupled to the colicin Fy. The sRNA will stick to Hfq and bind to the mRNA of USP45-Colicin Fy gene and that will block"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#CFPS_-_-_TEXT.html," harvest at an OD600 = 3-4 would be optimal. At this time of cultivation there would be enough cell mass for the following purification steps but no risk of being in stationary growth phase. Cell harvest at this OD600 would furthermore be consistent with published data ( Kwon and Jewett, 2015 ).
How to create highly active cell extract
To generate crude cell extract, the bacteria have to be disrupted. This can be achieved by different methods, for example bead beating ( Sun et al. 2013 ) or homogenizing with high pressure ( Yang et al. 2012 ). We decided for sonication as a recent publication from Kwon and Jewett showed that it is fast, cheap, reliable, easy to perform and that it works for small volumes ( Kwon and Jewett, 2015 ). We share the opinion that sonication can be recommended to iGEM teams in particular because equipment is relatively cheap compared to other disruption devices ( Shrestha et al. 2012 ).
The parameter with the greatest impact on crude cell extract quality is the sonifiers energy output (expressed in Joule per second) ( Kwon and Jewett, 2015 ). Insufficient energy does not lyse cells efficiently, whereas too much energy inactivates proteins. Although we had access to a Branson sonifier, we faced a problem: The device did not display its energy output and its technical specifications also shed no light on the issue. After consulting the technical support, we were able to tackle this problem: We measured how the temperature of a water sample changed as a function of sonication time. With an equation that takes all important parameters into account we were able to correlate the sonication time needed for a desired energy output (for details please be referred to protocol section ).
Cell disruption - outcome
We wondered how effective our sonifier was when it comes to the disruption of E. coli. For this we cultivated, harvested and washed cells of our working strain ER2566. Then we sonicated them in 24 cycles of 10 seconds because this was the optimal sonication time we determined for our specific sonifier setup. We took aliquots and plated them onto LB plates to get a first idea about the efficiency. As expected, we observed a decrease in cell viability with increasing sonication time.
Sonication efficiency test. 10 µL aliquots were taken out of the 1.5 mL vessel containing the resuspended cell pellet. Aliquots were diluted in 990 µL of water, then 20 µL of these samples were plated on LB. For details see"

Catechol Degradation
Our home province, Alberta, has proven oil reserves of 171.3 billion barrels.  These reserves make up the second-largest proven crude oil reserve in the world.  This is enough oil to meet Canada’s current oil demand for almost 400 years1.  The oil reserves are in the form of tar sands: a sand, clay, water, and bitumen mixture2.  The bitumen is separated from the sticky tar sand by washing it with hot water.  The heated water acquires toxins from the tar sands: resulting in an environmental issue.
Catechol is a toxic organic molecule commonly found in tailings ponds.  Furthermore, many other toxic compounds, such as naphthenic acids, can be metabolized into catechol. Pseudomonas putida demonstrates great metabolic diversity and is able to utilize a wide range of carbon sources, including molecules few other organisms can break down3.  The Lethbridge 2008 iGEM isolated the xylE gene ( BBa_K147002 ) from P.putida, which codes for catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (xylE).  However, the Edinburgh 2008 iGEM team isolated the xylE gene ( BBa_K118021 ) from P.putida, along with a ribosomal binding site (rbs), so we chose to work with this part.  This year we have engineered Escherichia coli DH5αto express xylE.  xylE rapidly converts catechol into 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (2-HMS).  2-HMS is a non-toxic, bright yellow molecule that can be metalbolized by E.coli DH5α.
Figure 1.  Part BBa_K118021 submitted to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts in 2008 by team Edinburgh. This part catalyzes the conversion of catechol to 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde.
We will then use our lumazine synthase (LS) microcompartment to isolate the xylE protein.  The LS has been previously characterized and shown that it is able to encapsulate other molecules.  We can target a protein into the LS"
Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,". It’s good news that it eventually comes out we got the recombinant DNA.
The third we love is the Lactobacillus recombination vector (RBS-EmR-CP29-RBS-aeBlue/pLBA169 [BBa_K2230004]). Because we met challenges of unavailable antibiotic resistance gene and an extra site of SpeI, we overcame and tackled the obstacles by acquiring the plasmid carrying the erythromycin resistance gene with the help of iGEM team HKUST’s instructor who have used it in 2010, as well as luckily complete the site-directed mutagenesis in just one experiment.
The fourth  we don’t actually love but appreciate our team members’ work are that the parts of glucose responsive promoters (PI [BBa_K861170] and Pcar [BBa_K861171]) ) are neither unavailable from iGEM HQ nor getting plasmids from re-transformed E. coli with the plasmid got from the previous iGEM team. We de novo designed the primer and cloned the parts on pSB1A3 (PI-RBS-RFP-T/pSB1A3 [BBa_K2230005] and Pcar-RBS-RFP-T/pSB1A3 [BBa_K2230006]).
We thank iGEM HQ to provide service of sending BioBrick parts which are not in the Distribution kit (actually we asked 3 times in separate times), and appreciate the favor from team CSMU_NCHU _Taiwan to amplify the genes of transporters of Salmonella for us.
The most challenging and difficult part in our project is performing the functional assays. In testing the glucose responsive promoter in response to various concentrations of glucose, we got in trouble that we can’t repeat the data of previous iGEM works. We tried many conditions and just got slightly increasing response to the increasing concentrations of glucose. Luckily, when analyzing glucose responsive repressor system, we got the corresponding repressible response reversely proportional to the concentrations of glucose. We thought the different responses may result from the sensitivity differences between RFP and GFP. In the suicide circuit assay, it’s a beautiful data demonstrating the suicide circuit activates the killing process when running out the environmental glucose.
In glucose uptake analysis, it is unexpected that the high-affinity active glucose transporter is the worse one for bacterial growth and glucose absorption. Compared to the normal E. coli, the one overexpressing low-affinity facilitated glucose transporter gave a 1.2 times increase and achieved 97% of glucose absorption in 4 hours. The"

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Tag-Optimization_-_-_TEXT.html," optical density (OD) at a wave length of 600 nm, i. e.  the absorption peak of indigoidine interferes with the measurement of cell density at the preferred wave length (compare to Fig. 13 , grey dashed line).   Thus, for measurement of NRP expression without time consuming a priori purification of the tagged-protein, a method to separate the cellular and pigment-derived contributions to the OD is required (compare to Fig. 13 , brown and blue lines, respectively).
Figure 13: Quantification of dye in cellular culture by OD measurements at robust and sensitive wavelengths. The contribution of the scattering by the cellular components at the sensitive wavelength, i.e. 590 nm for indigoidine has to be subtracted from the overall OD at this wavelength. For a detailed description of the calculation refer to text below. Figure adopted from [15].
The method of choice, as described by Myers et al. [15], requires the OD measurement of  cell culture at two distinct wavelengths: the robust wave length ODR and the sensitive wave length ODS.  The concentration of indigoidine will have to be deducted from measurements at ODS = 590 nm: $$OD_{S,+P}$$ $$[Indigoidine]= OD_{S,+P}-OD_{S,-P}$$ with $OD_{S,+P}$ being the overall OD measurement and $OD_{S,-P}$ being the scattering contribution of the cellular components at the sensitive OD.   The scattering contribution of the cellular compenents at $OD_S$ ($OD_{S,-P}$) can be calculated from the scattering contribution measured at the robust wave length according to the following formula: $OD_{S,-P}= \delta*OD_R$. The correction factor $\delta$ is be determined by measuring the OD of pure cellular culture without indigoidine at both the wavelength $[OD]_{S,-P}$ and $[OD]_R$ and calculating their ratio.  Finally, the indigoidine production can be determined as $$[Indigoidine]=OD_{S,+P}- \delta*OD_{R}$$  For the calculation of the cellular component when measuring indigoidine producing liquid cell cultures, OD measurement at 800 nm as robust wavelength is recommended. By the approach described above, quantitative observation of the indigoidine production in a liquid culture over time as well as the indigoidine production in relation to the cell growth can be conducted.

AND GATE
Combine Biological Unnatural Amino Acid（UAA）Orthogonal
genectical system with logic ""AND"" gate gene circuit
to detect bladder cancer cells precisely
The AND gate in digital logic gate circuits:
As we all know, there many logic gates in digital circuits.Among them,AND gate is the most basic logic gate circuit.
It can be seen as a switch, but we need two or more keys to open it,and it's very according with our requirements.When we need multiple factors limit,AND gate is undoubtedly the best choice,because only all of our requirements are satisfied,the switch can be opened, and our system can run normally.
The AND gate of our project
The AND gate of our system has two keys,and that is two promoters, hTERT and hUPll.The former is a cancer cell specific promoter,and the later is bladder cell specific promoter. When two keys exist at the same time and two promoters will start gene expression,the whole system can operate.Using AND gate to achieve specificity recognition,when it is compared with the traditional therapy,it is the biggest advantage of synthetic biology,and it’s also the basis of our project.
hRluc is a reporter that can produce RLUC which is a kind of luciferase.There is an amber stop codon UAG in the sequence of Rluc. When the system is verified having a function,it will produce an active hRluc.

ETH_Zurich,2017,Team:ETH Zurich#Experiments#Anti Cancer Toxin_-_-_TEXT.html," verifies the bacterial colonization of the tumor bacteria via MRI, focused ultrasounds will activate Cell Lysis releasing an effective dosage of azurin to the tumor.
For more details about azurin and its role in our system, go to our description of the Anti-Cancer Toxin .
Overview of the Experiments
In our experiments, we replaced the AND-gate promoter in the genetic circuit depicted in Figure 1 with a well-established inducible promoter, Plux, in order to control the expression of the operon. Moreover,  we coupled the expression of azurin with a fluorescence output as we exchanged the bacterioferritin gene with a gene encoding for superfolder GFP. In that way we could indirectly assess the functionality of our operon in a controllable manner (Figure 2). This circuit was transformed in E. coli TOP10 which was used for the production of azurin-rich bacterial lysate. Finally, the application of the bacterial lysate on different cancer-cell lines in vitro helped us to emulate the delivery of the anti-cancer payload via cell-lysis against different solid-tumor types.
Figure 2. AHL diffuses into the cell and binds to LuxR. The AHL/LuxR complex activates pLux, which results in transcription of both GFP and azurin. In a further step the cell-lysate containing the products of the operon is applied on different tumor - cells in vitro.
Several preliminary experiments were conducted before the application of the bacterial lysate to different cancer-cell lines. Initially we examined the production of azurin from our engineered bacteria after induction with AHL, indirectly by detecting the fluorescence of the co-expressed sfGFP. An SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the presence of azurin in the cytosolic fragment of E. coli after AHL induction. Further culture scale-up to 50 mL volumes allowed us the production of azurin-rich bacterial lysate via sonication.  A second SDS-PAGE confirmed cell-lysis by sonication as all the overexressed azurin and sfGFP were detected together with the native proteins of E. coli within the lysate. Thanks to our collaborators from Freiburg , we were able to quantify the azurin content of our bacterial lysate, as they provided us with purified azurin, which we used to create a standard curve of purified azurin concentration on the same SDS-PAGE gel.
With our bacterial lysate at hand we had to define the following parameters regarding the experimental set-up of mamalian cell incubation with our lysate:

Not just a pretty picture on a small regular agar plate,         like this well-known example, but on a large scale. This should produce nice paintings, which keep evolving into ""Bacterial Beauties"".         iGEM Groningen 2012 assisted with preparing the XL agar plates and painting them with bacteria.         Resulting in beautiful pictures, that were exposed at the Night of Arts and Science, a festival in Groningen which attracted 15.000 visitors.
Because of the microbiological background of many team members, we could not only help Leen during the making of the pictures,         but we could also take the opportunity to teach the visitors of the Night about the beauty of bacteria, their use,        synthetic biology, and our project.
In addition to the bio-paintings and the huge ""bio-billboard"", time lapse movies of bacteria growing on a normal        plate, and microscopic images of bacteria were displayed. Furthermore, to aid in explaining synthetic biology,        our team showed some paintings with an overview of our project.
As an extra feature, a ""bacterial wall of fame"" was built using handprints of ""famous people from Groningen"".

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Human#Containment_-_-_TEXT.html," coli in soil, we set up a separate experiment. This experiment was started by our work experience student Kiran and carried on by us after he left.
We placed soaked small discs of filter paper in GFP expressing E. coli and put these into autoclaved and non-autoclaved soil. The bacteria were incubated for over six weeks. Cultures were grown up in medium containing both ampicillin and kanamycin every week. These cultures were plated out and checked for fluorescence to check for presence of the plasmid. To ensure that we were not growing up antibiotic-resistant soil bacteria, we grew up cultures from non-inoculated soil as negative controls.
3. Result After three weeks, the bacteria were still growing in non-sterile media and expressing GFP. In addition, there were bacteria present on the plates that were resistant to ampicillin and kanamycin and some of them expressed GFP. It is therefore very likely that the GFP-expressing bacteria passed on the GFP-expressing plasmid to other bacteria in their environment. After six weeks, fluorescence could no longer be detected on the plates grown up from non-sterile soil cultures.

A rhamnose-regulated device based on existing and new (2016) BioBricks. This is designed to induce production of a fusion protein between E. coli OsmY (a secreted protein) and Serratia marcescens Hfq (an RNA binding protein). Co-expression with Serratia sRNA may generate a specific RNA secretion system."

LC-Cutinase esterase activity will cleave the ester bond on PET and releasing terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol as a product. Fusion strategy of lpp-ompA on LC Cutinase gene is one of our way to create a whole cell biocatalyst which will be an effective molecular machinery to degrade PET on the environment. Due to constitutive expression of the recombinant protein in E.coli, there is a possibility of formation of insoluble protein inside the cell (inclusion body), because of that, we put tet operator upstream of RBS for further regulation (Georgiou et al, 1996).
Self-Regulatory Module
pIBPAB is a hybrid promoter that induced by inclusion body from unfunctional protein. This promoter followed by strong RBS (BBa_B0034) , make a new part called Bba_K1387005
This casette (BBa_K1387002) consist of TetR (BBa_C0040) and Double Terminator (Bba_B0015) . TetR is tetracycline repressor that bind to operator region and repressing the expression of downstream gene. In our system, the degradation module consist of TetO (Tet Operator) which is region of TetR (Tet Repressor) placed.
The construction of reporter module is consist of inducible promoter PibpAB (BBa_K339010) RBS (BBa_B0034) , amilCP (BBa_K592025) , and double terminator (Bba_B0015) . BBa_K1387000 consist of RBS (BBa_B0034) , amilCP (BBa_K592025) and double terminator (Bba_B0015) , while the complete module was contained in BBa_K1387001 . The reporter module will have a blue chromoprotein when the inclusion body is formed in the cell. This mechanism then acts as an indicator of cytoplasmic stress, in this situation is caused by inclussion body.
Convertion Module
Improvisation the part submitted by UC Davis team BBa_K936024 by combining the construct with terminator, so we can characterize the expression of the enzymes and performe the assay for ethylene glycol utilization better than before. We name this BioBrick as convertion module.

Week 1 (May 1-May 5, 2017)
We are all fully trained in laboratory safety! We each completed 6 online courses and 2 seminars on lab safety and biosafety. In the lab we practiced important protocols, which include media preparation, overnight culture inoculation, preparing chemically competent cells, and transforming chemically competent cells (see protocols here )
We also researched ways that we will be able to use synthetic biology to extract synthesized Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) from cells, without the use of traditional chemical or mechanical lysis.
Week 2 (May 8-May 12, 2017)
We practiced more important laboratory techniques: plasmid minipreparation, preparing master plates of transformed E. coli, and agarose gel electrophoresis (protocols are here ).
We also narrowed down our PHB extraction method to a hemolysin type I secretion system native to E. coli, like what was used by Team SDU-Denmark in 2016. We uploaded sequences of the hemolysin secretion tag (HlyA) fused to Phasin ( Part:BBa_K2018024 ) and two parts of the hemolysin membrane transport protein unit (HlyB : Part:BBa_K2018027 and HlyD: Part:BBa_K2018029 ) onto Benchling and began designing"

Marisa
Jeffrey is a junior studying biomedical engineering. He was first turned on to the idea of participating with the iGEM team when he started working in Wilson Wong’s lab under the mentorship of Ben Weinberg in January 2016. He has nothing but extreme gratitude for the opportunity they have given him to grow as a scientist. Jeffrey intends to go on to graduate school doing a PhD in epidemiology and infectious diseases. His dream is to work with the CDC or WHO doing work in the field of tropical diseases, and ultimately take his experiences and teach a new generation of scientists. In his spare time, Jeffrey is an avid musician performing at bars and restaurants in both Boston as well as back in Westchester, NY. A fun fact about Jeffrey is that he has a twin brother, Jason, and he is an avid collector of art. Jeffrey's work with the iGEM team focused on the development of the genetic logic circuit used in our work as well as the writing you see on this wiki and co-authoring the bioethics forums.  In addition, he, along with the rest of the team, worked on the cloning that built the Gemini Library.
Kami is a senior studying biomedical engineering. She has worked in the Tissue Microfabrication Laboratory under Prof. Chris Chen since her sophomore year and decided to join the iGEM team to gain some insight into how synthetic biology could play an important role in the field of tissue engineering. She aspires to a career in medicine. In her spare time, Kami enjoys chasing after balls on the volleyball and tennis courts and painting masterpieces on canvas. When the sun is out, you’ll find her hiking or quadding through the trails of Vermont, and overall just enjoying the tranquility of nature. A fun fact about Kami is that she does not have an appendix. Kami's work with the iGEM team focused on mammalian cell culture for transfections, data analysis, and the design of the images and figures used by BostonU.

As a negative control to demonstrate the necessity for F+ receivers, we transformed the indicator plasmid used in the receiver cells into E. coli DH5α (F- strain) and used it as a receiver population. We expected no successful messaging with F- receivers because the F pilus, which is only present in F+ strains, is required for the mechanism of message delivery using M13 particles.
In addition, we plated senders and receivers individually on our selection plates to check for contamination.

2. Experimental design for Gene VIII complementation
After making our constructs, we set out to determine if our helper plasmid with gene VIII knockout (BBa_K1039017) could be complemented with a messaging phagemid consisting of M13 origin (BBa_K314110) - RFP expression cassette (BBa_J04450) - Constitutive Promoter and Ribosome Binding site + M13 gene VIII (BBa_K1039020) in pSB1C3. We expected the expression of gene VIII from the messaging phagemid to produce a viral coat protein so it can complement the helper plasmid with gene VIII knockout. With a complete set of functional proteins, the virus should be able to assemble itself and package the messaging phagemid through recognition of the M13 ori to successfully deliver the message to the receiver population.

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html,"0011 , the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 , the newly created BioBrick K2020001 and the terminator BBa_B0010 . BioBrick K2020001 is a composite part itself and includes the secretion tag pelB ( BBa_J32015 ) and a subtilisin E gene optimized for Escherichia coli codon usage ( BBa_K2020000 ). Once introduced into E. coli, this BioBrick is able to produce subtilisin E, an alkaline serine protease, which non-specifically digests proteins, and simultaneously secrets the enzyme into the periplasm of the cell. Caused by the lacI regulated promoter BBa_R0010 , the expression system can be induced by addition of IPTG. With the iGEM promoter BBa_R0011 , which was integrated in our sequence at first, it was not possible to successfully express subtilisin E due to fatal mutations inside the expression system in all analyzed colonies. Either there have been single base deletions or insertions in the pro-peptide, which led to a frameshift of the whole protein, or a 23 base pair deletion in the promoter. Both types of mutations result in an incorrect expression system, so that an expression of the protease is impossible. Since the promoter BBa_R0011 is leaky and induces the expression even without addition of IPTG, it can be assumed that subtilisin E is toxic for E. coli. Hence, we exchanged the promoter against BBa_R0010 . For achieving this, we carried out a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to extract everything but the promoter and the RBS and simultaneously extend the remaining DNA sequence with the pre-fix of iGEM. Afterwards, we assembled it with the BioBrick J04500 and in parallel cloned it into the vector pSB1C3 - by cutting RFP out of the BioBrick J04450 . The implemented BioBrick J04500 itself contains another IPTG inducible promoter ( BBa_R0010 ) and the same RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). An expression with the newly integrated promoter BBa_R0010 led to a colony with the correct sequence in opposition to our trial of gaining a positive clone while working with the first promoter BBa_R0011 . We continued our experiments by performing a skim milk assay on agar plates. Therefore, we poured LB skim milk agar plates containing IPTG and the needed antibiotic and streaked out the E. coli BL21 cells containing the plasmid with the expression system.

All cultures were made in triplicate at 30°C with shaking at 150 rpm for several days. As quercetin is not soluble at pH=7, shaking important to avoid precipitation.

2. Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning (CPEC)
Abstract: Circular polymerase extension cloning (CPEC) is based on polymerase overlap extension and is therefore free of restriction digestion, ligation or single-stranded homologous recombination. CPEC is highly efficient, accurate and user friendly. Once the inserts and the linear vector have been prepared, the CPEC reaction can be completed in 10 min to 3 h, depending on the complexity of the gene libraries.
☞☟ 
Introduction
CPEC is a single-tube, one-step reaction that normally takes 5–10 min to complete for everyday laboratory cloning. The method is directional, sequence independent and ligase free. It uses the polymerase extension mechanism2 to join overlapping DNA fragments into a double-stranded circular form, such as a plasmid. In a typical CPEC reaction, linear double-stranded insert(s) and vector are first heat-denatured; the resulting single strands then anneal with their overlapping ends and extend using each other as a template to form double-stranded circular plasmids. In CPEC, all overlapping regions between insert(s) and the vector are unique and carefully designed to have very similar and high melting temperatures (Tm), which eliminates vector reannealing and concatenation of inserts and makes CPEC very efficient and accurate. The low concentrations of fragments in the reaction favor plasmid circularization and effectively prevent plasmid concatenation. After the CPEC reaction, the perfectly formed double-stranded circular plasmids, with one nick in each strand, can be directly transformed into competent host cells.
Steps
1. Design of overlapping sequences between vector and insert(s).
The key to successful CPEC library construction and multiway CPEC is to carefully select and design the overlapping sequences between the vector and the insert(s) so that all overlapping regions share very similar Tm. The Tm of the overlapping regions should be as high as possible (ideally between"
Tokyo_Tech,2015,Team:Tokyo Tech#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," experiences in 2014, iGEM Team Nahahama gave us these 2 advices about chemotaxis experiments.
    1. In order to increase the chemotactic activity of E. coli, the best concentration of agar is 0.3 %.
    2. It is better to directly stick the chip inside the agar and then inject the E .coli, than to place the E. coli on top of the agar.
Also, Team Nagahama gave us the raw data along with the protocol of the experiments for assaying the chemotactic activity of a wild type E.coli, following the protocol written above.

Our plan at first was to integrate the chemotaxis experiment into our overall project. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain positive results from the gene that we constructed, before the Giant Jamboree. However, the advice we received from Team Nagahama helped us a lot. We would like to say thanks to all the help we received from them.

The Lac operon
What it is
The lac operon is responsible for transport and metabolism of lactose in E-coli, and has the following architecture: The lacI gene codes for the LacI protein, which inhibits transcription of the genes downstream by binding to the operator region (po). This inhibition is effective because the RNA polymerase is forced to drop off the DNA template when encountering a bound operator region. LacZ encodes the enzyme β-galactosidase responsible for the degradation of β-galactosides. Since lactose is a β-galactoside, the enzyme will degrade lactose into galactose and glucose. This gene is sufficient to degrade lactose. LacY encodes for a permease located to the outer membrane, thus ensuring the transport of lactose into the cell. This is a key element of the lactose operon as it acts as a feedback mechanism in the genetic circuitry. In fact, when lactose is present, it stimulates the production of large amounts of permease thus acting as positive feedback. The LacA protein encodes β-galactoside transacetylase. The exact function of this protein in the lac system has not yet been determined.
Animated Explanation
This animation by McGraw-Hill clearly explains the action of the famous Lac Operon.

Our team has created a virtual reality which allows everybody to have access to a synthetic biology lab. Also, it makes possible to teach in an easy and comprehensive way what SynBio is and how it works.
Help a registered iGEM team from another university in a significant way by characterizing a part:
We developed a satisfactory collaboration with Norwich team, by agroinfiltrating their part to test it. They also sent us their Mo-Flippers, which allows to convert our Golden Braid assemblies to BioBrick standard.
Our team and Tuebingen team joined forces and made a collaboration , by making an important assembly of a CDS for them.
We also participated in small surveys and other projects in order to help a bit other teams.

POST 2 | A General Overview of Intellectual Property in Synthetic Biology: Part 2
The Basis of Patent Law in Synthetic Biology: Software
Synthetic biology research is pushing the bounds of what we once thought was possible in biology. Because of this, synthetic biology is also pushing the limits of how we as a society have defined ownership and property. While sixty years ago the question was inconceivable, today it is completely reasonable to ask, “can I patent a genome?” or, “can I own the property rights to a living creature?” These are big, important questions! Interestingly, the best answers the U.S. courts have to solving these questions comes from, of all places, the world of software.
Prior to the development of computers, intellectual property could be protected by trademarks, copyright laws, and patents. These classifications proved robust and effective up until the emergence of software applications. Software, unlike anything seen before, is a written programing language that results in a function or utility. Thus, it makes sense that one could copyright the contents of their code, and patent the functionality of their software tool. As some examples, Mario is a copyrighted character in Nintendo games, and the functionality of the Excel spreadsheet is patented under Microsoft.
People studying intellectual property rights in synthetic biology quickly realized that the closest example from which to draw a conclusion would be software. Software is similar to synthetic biology for multiple reasons; namely, developers (or researchers) create programs (or biological parts) that code for high level functions (such as transcriptional regulation). Therefore, today many of the intellectual property rights that define synthetic biology are drawn from software laws. As we compare intellectual property in synthetic biology to that in software, it is important to be aware of the differences between the two, the most important being that you can patent both DNA and software code for its function, but you cannot copyright DNA code, as you could for a piece of software.

Results indicate that there was no difference between older and newer virus; best results were given with an infection time of 2 x 8 hours.
For testing, if centrifugation brings better transduction efficiencies, mouse cells were infected with the different viral supernatants and centrifuged for 45 min, 1800 rpm, 32°C. In two wells it was tested if the double amount of Polybrene brings better transduction efficiencies. However, we found out that cells were death after centrifugation.

Government Policy
Legislators have the difficult task of balancing a number of diverse and often conflicting intellectual property consideration. On the one hand, the government must incentivize innotvation - IP is an essential means of achieving this, as demonstrated by studies showing how patents can positively influence innovation by a margin of 15-25%2 .
The flipside of this is the responsibility of the government to prevent the creation of monopoly and to ensure that ideas are shared so as to maximize productive research. Again, there is research indicating that intellectual property is crucial to maintaining this balance, as some studies have expressed concerns that patents on initial discoveries may 'delay, hamper, or deter' innovations building on the patented work. The transaction cost of working with patented material is unattractive to many researchers, particularly individuals and start-ups.3.
Based on our research and our experiences during iGEM and in the field of IP, we believe that one of the most important roles for the government is to lead a new, more imaginative line of thinking about intellectual property protection, and to move away from analyzing these issues within the traditional and deeply engrained innovation v access dichotomy.
Creating legal mechanisms to support this kind of innovative and flexible thinking about IP will be increasingly important to synthetic biology and to iGEM as the field grows increasingly complex and the dynamics between the many different interested parties continue to evolve. In order to successfully balance the demands of the public interest, investors, the environment, researchers, and inventors we will need to be more open minded when considering how to deal with IP in the future. It will not suffice to simply ask whether 'to patent or not to patent' and suppose that this is the extent of the available options.
A further issue which we believe needs addressing by a change in the law is the current incapacity of the law to provide protection for computer code and algorithms. This is an issue which extends far beyond iGEM. Counter-intuitively, the lack of protection for algorithms means that this information can justifiably be kept secret rather than being visible and accessible to the public and/or regulators. The danger of this situation was demonstrated only recently by Facebook's so called 'social experiment' during which the company controlled the newsfeed content of users in an attempt to manipulate their emotions. Jim Sheridan, a member of the Commons Media Select Committee, expressed his 'worries about the ability of Facebook and others to manipulate people's thoughts in politics or other areas', and stressed the need"

Virginia iGEM
The Virginia iGEM team conducted a survey about the awareness and use of biocontainment in iGEM projects, which our members completed, giving them many more data points for their analysis!
HKUST iGEM
Building upon the collaboration we started in 2015 as the joint HKUST-Rice iGEM team, we hosted a number of HKUST students at Rice this past summer. They traveled to Rice to construct gene dosage-tuning devices that would 1) tune the effective             plasmid copy number, and 2) involve antisense RNA interference; additionally, they studied the approach toward modeling used in our project and helped establishing mathematical equations we used in our model.
The Rice and HKUST iGEM students interacted with each other in lab, and in Team Rice’s group meetings. Beyond the lab, the HKUST students also attended events on Rice’s campus, including a BioSciences Department retreat, the Rice Biosciences             Summer Research Institute (SRI) journal club, and the Rice IBB Summer Research Poster Symposium!
UT Austin & Texas Tech
iGEM teams Rice, UT Austin, and Texas Tech had a state iGEM meet-up at the 2016 UT Austin Fall Undergraduate Research Symposium (FURS). The three teams got together to practice their Giant Jamboree presentations (the iGEM teams’ presentations           for the symposium itself had 8-minute time limits), and were able to exchange valuable presentation feedback!"

Science Open House
Waterloo iGEM had the privilege to be involved in the University of Waterloo’s Annual Science Open House. Children and their families had the chance to get involved in all sorts of hands-on science activities exploring many areas of science.
Waterloo iGEM hoped to accomplish a few things by participating in this year’s open house:
Foster kids’ interest in science.
Introduce children and families to the idea of synthetic biology.
Inform attendees about our project using our Snake35 game.
We hoped to accomplish this through our activities centers. Using arts and crafts material, children got to design their own microorganism. They were introduced to the concept of using synthetic biology to modify existing microbes to perform awesome tasks. Each child created their own unique micro"
Wellesley_TheTech,2015,Team:Wellesley TheTech#Team#Notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html," targeted for a more scientific audience-- both of which are required as part of our summer spent doing research at Wellesley.  We also have decided to incorporate videos into our exhibit, and so we’ve asked the interns to find some informational and educational videos about synthetic biology and the cell duplication process.
We also confirmed an appointment with Larry to go down to the machinery and cut the tangibles out.  Our materials arrived, and we’re looking forward to meeting with Larry to cut next Wednesday!
In the afternoon, we updated the “reset” functionality so that the petri dishes fully reset when the user clicks the “Reset” button-- previous there were some bugs that included the bacteria and other buttons still appearing when they should have been removed from the screen.
7/27/2015: Day 40
Over the weekend, Casey sent us some beautiful art files.  When we came in today, we immediately updated everything that they had sent us-- their art makes our work look so much better and makes the exhibit so much easier to understand!  For example, they’ve sent us a glowing flask and animations of a plasmid entering a bacteria, which greatly help users understand how to proceed and what their actions are representing.  Other art changes include a glowing animation around status bars which draws attention to the change due to the user’s work.  We also finished the logic for programming the bacteria to go to a certain part of Mars depending on their “Have” or “If”, and fixed a bug that was displaying the wrong animation at certain points.  Looking forward to continuing to work tomorrow!
7/28/2015: Day 41
We stayed late today to finish our exhibit!!! Yay!!!  This included creating and adding information messages, sending Larry our tangible files to prepare for laser cutting tomorrow (!), researching and adding additional scientific background for each gene, incorporating the rest of Casey’s animations, making editing when the status bars flicker, and adding videos to the project.  I love how it looks, and I’m so proud of how far this exhibit has come.
7/29/2015: Day 42
This morning we met with Larry to laser cut our tangibles!  It was such an exciting process to see them being made and have the physical parts present.  We created a video of the current prototype for Romie and Anja, and then focused most of our day on building our poster.  It is very visual and colorful, and I love it!

Background
The Type-I Incoherent Feedforward Loop and Fold-Change Detection
The type-I incoherent feedforward loop (I1-FFL) is a gene network in which protein X activates a gene Z while simultaneously activating the production of a repressor of gene Z, labeled Y.
For this year’s project, we are aiming to construct an I1-FFL that can detect fold-changes in the levels of protein X. In other words, the expression of Z would be reliant on the relative change in X as opposed to absolute values of X. For example, if X changes from an arbitrary concentration of 1 to an arbitrary concentration of 5, the expression from promoter Z would be exactly the same as that resulting from a change from a concentration of 5 to a concentration of 25 of X (a fold-change by a factor of 5 in both cases).
How Fold-Change Detection is Achieved
This fold-change detection is enabled through the repressor Y. Take the case when activator X, repressor Y, and protein Z each have an arbitrary concentration of 1 in the cell (1:1:1 ratio). If the concentration of X is doubled, the ratio between X and Y now becomes 2:1. X immediately activates Z, but since the repressor Y takes time to fold, it lags behind, and the concentration of Z spikes to 2 due to the activation. When Y folds into its active form and carries out its repressive activity, the concentration of Z returns to its initial concentration of 1. This is because at this point, X and Y return to a 1:1 ratio in the cell. In order for the concentration of Z to reach 2 once again, the X:Y ratio must first return to 2:1 - thus, X has to reach a concentration of 4 before the same output of Z is produced. In this way, fold-change detection is achieved.

The Design of our Gene Network and the Interactions Between Components
In our proposed design, rtTA will act as our activator (X), Lacl as our repressor (Y), and sfGFP as our reporter protein (Z). Each part is detectable via a different fluorescent protein. A visual representation of our pathway is shown in"
