Public & Government
Water industry is an important basic industry that affects every aspects of our lives. To introduce or replace bio-process with conventonal methods for water treatment, we need to get the approval from both public and government. Those two different groups needs different information to accept our project. On this page, we summarize the efforts and thoughts relating to public acceptance and government approval.

Public Acceptance
What does public concern about a project like ours? Even though we didn't conduct any surveys, from our publicity experience the main concerns is safety and necessity. In this section, we focus on expanding the necessity research by graphing the data of water shortage in China.
Publicity in SSTM
On August 8, our team went to Shanghai Science and Technology Museum (SSTM) to reveal our idea to the public. IGEM teams  which included FDU, TJU, ZJU, SJTLU, NYU Shanghai, SJTU Software and our team are invited to participate in the publicity activity.
We introduced iGEM, synthetic biology and our project to public. We tried to make our publicity, popular and easy to understand with the consideration of level of audience's biological knowledge.

The post of our team
The publicity works, though it is not as good as we expected. When we concluded this activities, we found the key point missed during publicity was let the audience know why the project is so significant for water security for present time as well as for future. Thus, the audience cannot connect with us for what we do. Based on that study, we summarized the water shortage report of China to make public awareness about water security.
Water shortage report
There's great amount of data relating to Chinese water shortage problem, however they are cold chart that is hard to understand for the public. We wanted to make the water shortage report as a map on the basis of available data in China to make understand the public in easy way . Also, the maps"

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," decided to take our collaboration one step further and a physical version of the Lithuanian “Spaceship E.Coli” comic book. We have hoped that the physical version of the comic would generate even more interest as many people agree that reading a paper version of a comic book is a much more exciting experience!
Therefore, we have prepared a printable version of our translated comic book and even managed to find the sponsors “Kopicentras” who would later print out the books for us and even gave us tips on how to prepare them correctly.
Finally, our Lithuanian physical comic book version of “Spaceship E. Coli” was completed. We have then proceeded to distribute them by giving them out in our educational events, after our various synthetic biology lectures in universities and schools, also in conferences and popular science events.
We truly believe that such comic book is what we have needed in order to grab the attention of young students in schools and universities. In turn, we are extremely happy OUC-China team have initiated the collaboration and the line of communication between China and Lithuania!
Participation in various surveys to help out fellow teams!

- Modulation of Cellular Function by TAT Mediated Transduction of Full Length Proteins (2003)
Johan: Similar to the first article but older
- Protein Transduction: Generation of Full-Length Transducible Proteins Using the TAT System (2003)
Johan: Talks about using CCPs with recombinant approach (what we will use. Most other articles expresses CCP and cargo seperately and then fuses them aided by some chemicals). Nina and Andreas, he talk about an Appendix, for example to read more about “further background into creating fusion cDNA”. Does anyone know how to find this appendix? I cant :(
- Cell Penetrating Peptides in Drug Delivery (2003)
Johan: Similar to the first article but older
Johan: (6 articles of him that I downloaded, of his ~90 articles in total). Seems that this field is going forward rapidly and that we should only focus on new articles (preferably newer than 2007 so they include data not present in the first article)
Protein A
Protein A would be secreted from the bacteria, penetrating the skin and bind IgG antibodies - that in vitiligo patients bind melanocytes - so that the igG antibodies can not induce an immune response.
""It binds proteins from many of mammalian species, most notably IgGs"" - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_A (Find better source)
Johan: Good as IgGs are the main antibody in excess for vitiligo
“It binds with the Fc region of immunoglobulins through interaction with the heavy chain. The result of this type of interaction is that, in serum, the bacteria will bind IgG molecules in the wrong orientation (in relation to normal antibody function) on their surface which disrupts opsonization and phagocytosis.” - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_A
Johan: The disruption is what we want (are there more disruptions to think of, other than opsonization and phagocytosis?)
Nina: Those are the most important ones, which is very good that happens in our case. Later would be if we could combine this with an IgG protease that would destroy the auto-antibody IgG.
“It binds with high affinity to human IgG1 and IgG2 as well as mouse IgG2a and IgG2b. Protein A binds with moderate affinity to human IgM, IgA and IgE as well"

Project Description
Chemtaxis , which can make strains move, interest us this time. By reprogramming the strain (CL-1), which lacks the CheZ gene, we can create mathematical patterns. CheZ gene belongs to chemotaxis family of E.coli. Protein CheZ can dephosphorylate CheY-P, one that allows E.coli swimming smoothly. The ΔCheZ bacteria can’t dephosphorylate CheY-P, so the strain won’t motile until CheZ is involved in. That means the motility of E.coli can be precisely control by stimulus (e.g. IPTG). We try to construct logic gene circuits to make E.coli recognize environmental stimulation, thus by utilizing the controlled chemotaxis which named pseudotaxis we could command bacteria to form patterns such as ellipse, hyperbola and so on.
The intrinsic motivation that drive us striving for the above project is that we want to simulate the process of stem cell differentiation. In the organs development, stem cells differentiate while aggregate together to form heart, liver and kidney what have precise shapes. Perhaps some mathematical principles that govern the differentiation process. By simulating differentiation, we want to get a closer understanding of the differentiation process. However, E.coli can’t sense as much stimulus as stem cell, we intend to utilize RNA aptamers what has the potential to response to almost all stimulus to cover that shortage. Thus, we can get a more precise stimulation.
Besides, we try to utilize pseudotaxis to accomplish some experimental meaning. As far as we know, the motile ability is proportional to the amount of protein CheZ in certain range. By measuring the average chemotaxis distance, we will get a precise evaluation on the RBS efficiency that is evaluated by fluorescence strength previously.

Safety Questions
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of research safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
There are potential safety concerns with our project, but they do not exceed the normal caution exercised when working with antibiotic-resistant organisms. Although the team is working with a lab strain of E. coli that must be provided with the proper nutrients to survive, we are also working with a variety of antibiotic-resistant plasmids. While we follow proper sterile protocol in our work in the lab, there is still a chance that a wild pathogenic bacteria may enter reactions. In this event, a wild bacteria may have the chance to acquire an antibiotic resistant plasmid. If it were to be removed from the lab, this bacteria could exchange this resistance factor with other bacteria.
We do not work with virulent or potentially hazardous strains of bacteria in the lab, and thus would not risk infection or illness from these antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The only hazard is in allowing these antibiotic-resistant bacteria to transfer their plasmids to pathogenic bacteria outside the lab. Here there is the possibility of danger to the public or the environment depending on the strain of bacteria.
Since some of our project ideas require the use of specific antibiotics, their use and disposal must be taken into consideration. Some of these compounds are toxic or even carcinogenic to humans and must be handled appropriately. These compounds may also be toxic to the environment or public if they were to not be disposed of properly.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
None of our BioBrick components raise any safety issues other than the antibiotic resistance they carry. Steps must be taken to ensure the antibiotic resistance is not accidentally imparted to a pathogen bacterial strain. Otherwise all of the BioBricks created by the team are for analytical purposes only and can only produce fluorescent proteins when correctly used.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If"

Biohackathon in Vilnius, Lithuania
In early August, we participated in the Biohackathon hosted by the Vilnius iGEM team. We developed a search engine that efficiently extracts and displays information from iGEM wikis and the iGEM distribution kit.
Students participating in iGEM for the first time usually have a hard time finding the desired content. Instinctively, the students turn to the gigantic wiki-library that has accumulated since the inception of iGEM as a means to gain a better understanding of the competition and synthetic biology. From personal experience, we also faced issues in finding the right biobricks in the iGEM distribution kit sent out by the iGEM foundation. Discussing this with iGEM teams that we met at conferences and iGEM events we realized that this was a common issue among other teams.
To highlight the importance of this gathering, the event was kicked-off by an inspirational speech from Virginijus Sinkevičius, Minister of Economy. He talked about the importance of why initiatives like iGEM and Biohackathons strengthen the bonds between IT and Life Sciences.
The charismatic researcher Urtė Neniškytė got our brains ready for the 48 hours ahead by holding a lecture about current research in brain performance and what we can do to improve it.
Previous Next
During the 48-hour timeframe of the competition, we created a dedicated search engine tailored specifically for iGEM teams and researchers in synthetic biology to search iGEM-wikis and the distribution kit in a more comprehensive manner. This allows the user to more easily access information about previous iGEM team projects and gain knowledge about, for example, what current research already exists and what projects one can build upon.
A big thank you to the Vilnius team for putting heart and soul in making this event into a truly memorable one.

Reflection with workshop
Insights
Aspects that are still missing, like validation
To do’s to achieve a responsible and relevant synthetic biology design
Changes
Achieve relevance by validating the design at the farm
Achieve responsibility by analyzing the risks when there is false positive or false negative
Reflection of the workshop
Lists of responsible and relevant things in our project
Things that were considered as really responsible are listed below:
Reliability (this is not yet know)
GMO-free and safe
Sensitive detection
Contained
The broad range of applications of TDPs
Things that were considered as relevant are listed below:
Modules can be used separately and can be used for different purposes and broad applications: sustainable storability of TDPs
Tackling a real societal/local threat (ABR)
Costs (are unclear)
User Friendliness
Biobrick can be used for broad application and we contribute to an integrated synbio engineering system
Reflection. What is beyond the scope of iGEM and what is things we still can include?
Tackling a real problem
Beyond the scope of the project:
The need is to identify which AB is relevant to use when facing a disease. Our tool gives insights in which ABs not to use. Although we think that our strategy will help to reduce the abuse of antibiotics, the question in the market is slidely different. Prototype tests should give insights whether are device is relevant enough to tackle current challenges.
Point out which AB to use
Sensitivity and reliability
Things we can do:
What happens if there is a false positive or a false negative?
Estimate the change to have a false positive or negative
Make risks analysis: Contact TNO to talk about risks analysis
Beyond the scope of our project:
Being able to quantify detection
Make Cas13a able to detect mutated genes
User Friendliness:
Things we can do:
Contact farmer to check if we meet the friendliness requirements concerning farmers
Contact industrial designer to think along with the final design
Make a decision tree so the farmer knows exactly what to do after obtaining the test results
Beyond the scope of the project:
Develop an easier RNA extraction (specialist should look into this): Adjusting the detection protein to detect the DNA directly instead of the RNA. This would take a step of reverse transcription out of the protocol and make the assay more direct instead of indirect.
Develop a service “a traveling lab in a bus” that does this kind of ABR tests (Front end runner)

uOttawa,2017,Team:uOttawa#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," order to determine if the sgRNA-dCas9 complexes were still capable of producing results in line with those of the corresponding logic gates. Gander et. al had published results of a similar experiment with results seen below.
Figure 1 – Expected NOR gate circuit results. Varying logic circuits created using solely NOR gates. The associated truth tables and fluorescence results are depicted on the right-hand side. Figure taken from Gander et al., 2017. Grey region represents a “dynamic” zone between activation and repression parameters.
Experimental results from our simulations were not nearly as ideal. Oftentimes, only certain pairings in a truth table correlated with theoretical results and literature results seen above. While “normal” distributions were attained, the distributions would favour the side of repression/activation to be expected, however, often centred much closer to the dynamic zone than was expected. This “centering” of results was further indication that the designed model required tweaking. Possible considerations are influence of steric hindrance possibly being greater than anticipated, missing binding parameters/inability within the coding of the model, and increased leakiness as chained circuit grow. A potential consideration for the future would be to work backwards and design truth tables and pre-set modulated logic gates and evaluate the generated circuit using a “sandwich approach” of experimental results with pre-set, calibrated logic gate designs.
In short, further evaluation will be required for conclusivity of results. However, the data is weekly suggestive of sgRNA-dCas9 complexes to be capable of modulating repression much like a transcription factor on varying promoters (e.g. tet and Gev).

Citrobacter freundii is not a significant pathogen of bovine mastitis, but is a known target of Enterocin E760 (BBa_K1931007). Error bars denote a 95% confidence interval. All experimental samples display efficacy not significantly different from that of kanamycin.
Based on the success of Bactofencin A (BBa_K1931006) in our zone of inhibition analysis, we tested its efficacy over time with a growth curve analysis. Ampicillin was added to achieve standard working concentration (100 ug/mL). An equivalent volume of protein sample was added to the culture. MBP was used as a negative control. In the span of four hours, Bactofencin A displayed similar levels of efficacy as ampicillin.
A similar growth curve assay was performed for S. epidermidis with BBa_K1931007. Here, the bacteriocin again demonstrates similar efficacy to antibiotics.
A growth curve was constructed for E. coli, but this time with kanamycin as the antibiotic of choice. The expression of Colicin M (BBa_K1931009) was induced with IPTG, and OD600 was monitored over time. Again, Colicin M demonstrates similar levels of efficacy as kanamycin.
A growth curve for C. freundii was constructed. BBa_K1931007 displays similar levels of efficacy as that of kanamycin.
Future Works
Despite their small sizes, bacteriocins are known to be extremely diverse with complex post-translational modifications. This presents a challenge to us as we attempt to purify them and to characterize their activities.
Nisins and Subtilins undergo extensive post-translational modifications. Well-conserved serines are dehydrated to form lanthionines, which then undergo intramolecular Michael additions. Finally, leader sequences are cleaved to yield mature antimicrobial peptides, and a transport protein delivers the bacteriocin to the extracellular environment. As a first step, Cornell iGEM hopes to characterize these proteins by co-expressing the enzymes that catalyze dehydration and cycloaddition, then purify these peptides in large quantities. An enterokinase cleavage sequence will be used to cleave the leader sequence to yield the mature bacteriocin.
The Nisin family of bacteriocins undergo complex post-translational modifications that involve dehydration and intramolecular Michael additions, followed by cleavage of a leader sequence"
Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Safty_-_-_TEXT.html," situation, we plan to work on this promoter to improve its sensitivity and response peak, reduce the leakage expression, and create new parts for future work.
1) Redesign of CUP1 promoter
First, based on the part (BBa_K2165004) provided by iGEM16_Washington, we tried to ensure the core sequence for transcription. Researches about this promoter mainly published in the 1990s, and the mechanism of induction has been researched thoroughly. There exist 5 ACE1 binding sites (UAS), 2 TATA boxes, and one initiation element in the promoter. The complex of ACE1 and copper ions will bind the promoter, which causes the activation of CUP1 promoter with TATA boxes’ help. ACE1 complex’s binding directly increases the possibility for TBP (TATA-Box Binding Protein) to bind the promoter, which can enhance the expression.
Fig. 4-3. structure of redesigned CUP1 promoter used in our project, based on BBa_K2165004
Fig. 4-3. structure of redesigned CUP1 promoter used in our project, based on BBa_K2165004
Based on this mechanism, we redesigned the part sequence provided by iGEM16_Washington. We deleted irrelevant based on the two ends of this promoter and retained the core sequence. In this way, this promoter played its key role with fewer bases. Strains of S. cerevisiae BY4742 containing either BBa_K2165004-yEmRFP and BBa_K2407000-yEmRFP with an initial OD600 of 0.1 were grown for 24 hours in SC-URA medium at 30 degrees Celsius, and then were induced with 0.1 mM Cu2+. Samples were tested with fluorescent spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-2700) after 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours.

Fig. 4-4. structure of redesigned CUP1 promoter used in our project, based on BBa_K2165004
Figure 4-4 shows the expression of yEmRFP with both the two promoters were very similar, so we can tell the deletion didn’t influence the core function of CUP1 promoter. Based on the new part, we carried out a further improvement.

Welcome to iGEM Aachen 2016
Glossary
During iGEM we have got into the habit of using special scientific terms of synthetic biology which are not self-explanatory. But for those who do not have a biological background or want to explore an unfamiliar area, a glossary of all these terms is shown below.
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
An aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) is an enzyme that attaches the appropriate amino acid onto its tRNA. It does so by catalysing the esterification of a specific amino acid or its precursor to one of all its compatible equivalent tRNAs to form an aminoacyl-tRNA.
BioBrick
BioBrick standard biological parts are DNA sequences of defined structure and function; These building blocks are used to design and assemble larger synthetic biological circuits from individual parts and combinations of parts with defined functions, which would then be incorporated into living cells such as Escherichia coli cells to construct new biological systems. They represent an effort to introduce the engineering principles of abstraction and standardization into synthetic biology. Examples of BioBrick parts include promoters, ribosomal binding sites (RBS), coding sequences and terminators.
Codon
A sequence of three adjacent nucleotides that corresponds to a specific amino acid during protein synthesis. There is at least one tRNA for any codon, and sometimes multiple codons translate into the same amino acid. Many tRNAs are compatible with several codons.
Codon optimization
The vast majority of amino acids are encoded by multiple codons, which means that there are multiple tRNAs that carry any given amino acid. Of any group of ""redundant"" tRNAs, one is usually much more abundant. Codon optimization is switching the codons used in a transgene without changing the amino acid that it encodes for -- this typically dramatically increases the abundance of the protein, which is encoded by the codon optimized gene; because it replaces “rare” with abundant codons.

Week of Science
On the occasion of the celebration of the Week of Science in our university, Pablo de Olavide, there were organized a group of spreading activities to bring public and science closer. Some of the activities were: conferences, workshops, competitions, expositions, guided tours, practical introductions of working in the laboratory for high-school students.
UPO-Sevilla Team take part on this activities by giving a talk on November 19th called “Active learning in the limits of biology: UPO in the Synthetic Biology contest iGEM” . We introduced synthetic biology as an emerging experimental and theoretical science and as a new field which has came up of Molecular Biology, Engineering and Informatics. We also introduced the iGEM and the fantastic experience in our first participation. A golden opportunity to share with our university and encourage them to get involved in it. You can enjoy watching the conference .

Sheffield,2016,Team:Sheffield#project#device#microfluids_-_-_TEXT.html," between the yellow and blue dyes. However, the blue dye reached the end chamber before the green solution and there is no way of knowing how much blue dye will reach the end chamber before the green solution arrives.
Figure 10. Results of mixing design 2 with a 3 mm yellow well.
Design 3: The Mixing Chamber Idea
The results of design 3 are rather promising, as the two dyes managed to mix (see Fig.11). Even though the yellow dye was added first, a green solution flowed out of the mixing chamber into the final channel. An air bubble was trapped within the mixing chamber once once fluid filled the final chamber. The quality of the PDMS produced could have also contributed to the formation of the air bubble. A close up photo of the chip (Fig.12) showed that the PDMS was uneven, so the quality of the PDMS produced could also have contributed to the formation of the air bubble. In this design, the solution also did not manage to reach the end chamber. This can be mitigated by shortening the length of the final channel.
Figure 11. Results of mixing design 3. The blue and yellow dyes mixed well to give a green solution.
Figure 12. A close up photo of the PDMS of mixing design 3.The channels are not smooth and that reflects the quality of the PDMS manufactured, which may affect the results.
The Theory
According to literature, the inlet chamber is similar to a capacitor of an electric circuit5. As the blood in the inlet chamber reduces, the pressure exerted on the channels also reduces, which should slow down the flow rate. However, since the volume of solution in the inlet chamber is much more than the total volume in the channel, it can be assumed that the pressure exerted by the inlet chamber remains constant throughout the duration of the flow. Thus, the main factor that affects flow rate is the resistance of the channels.
The resistance of the channel is similar to a resistor of an electric circuit. The higher the resistance, the slower the flow rate. The resistance of a channel can be represented by the equation shown below, where resistance is dependent on the dimensions of the channel (height 50 µm, varying lengths and widths) and the viscosity of the liquid5. C(X) is a constant that depends on the aspect ratio (the ratio between the width and the height of the channel); for the dimensions that we are considering (50 µm height, 1-2 mm width), C(X) tends to a constant of 0.0833.
By rearranging the equation"

Conclusion
We showed successful extraction of artificial gene doping DNA at concentration predicted by our model using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit. Further extraction optimization is advisable to maximize extraction efficiency.
2. Prescreening
In this module, we developed a high throughput screening method to detect gene doping. The method is based on the concept of color changes induced by d-AuNPs aggregation. In this module, we first analysed the stability of d-AuNPs upon introduction of NaCl with and without single stranded DNA probe. Finally, we were able to visually differentiate between samples where target DNA is presence or absence.
2.1 NaCl Effect on d-AuNPs’ Stability
Design: We generated batches of dextrin-capped gold nanoparticles and tested their aggregation upon NaCl introduction to determine the optimal NaCl concentration.
Results and interpretation: Upon increasing NaCl concentration, d-AuNPs destabilize and aggregate, changing the color of the solution from red to purple. We scanned the visual light spectra from 450nm to 650nm for a range of 0mM to 333mM NaCl. The important absorbance wavelengths are 520nm (red color) and 620 nm (purple color). We calculated the ratio of 620nm and 520nm to quantify the expect of color changes (red to purple) (figure 5). We observed an increase in the 620/520 with an increase in NaCl concentration, indicating a color change from red to purple.
Figure 5. Influence of NaCl on d-AuNPs aggregation. At a concentration of 133 mM NaCl, the d-AuNPs start to aggregate; the peak in the spectra shift from 520nm to 620nm and the ratio 620/520 wavelengths start to increase indicating color change from red to purple. A) Spectrum of d-AuNPs solutions with NaCl concentrations 0, 167 and 333mM. B) Wavelength ratios of 620/520 of d-AuNPs solutions with NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 333mM. C) Visual outcome of the d-AuNPs solution with NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 333mM.

K1319004
TEV protease with anti-self cleavage mutation S219V, codon-optimized for E. coli
This part is a TEV protease in RFC25 that was optimized for expression in E. coli. The part contains the S219V anti-self cleavage mutation.
The TEV Protease (also known as Tobaco Edge Virus nuclear inclusion a endopeptidase) is a highly sequence specific cysteine protease from the Tobacco Edge Virus (TEV). The protease is highly sequence specific. The consensus sequence for the cut is ENLYFQ\S with \ denoting the cleaved peptide bond. This sequence can be found in the part K1319016 .
ENLYFQ\S is the optimal cleavage site with the highest activity but the protease is also active to a greater or lesser extent on a range of substrates. The highest cleavage is of sequences closest to the consensus EXLYΦQ\φ where X is any residue, Φ is any large or medium hydrophobic amino acid and φ is any small hydrophobic amino acid.
The TEV protease is commonly used as a biochemical tool to cleave affinity tags from purified proteins like His-Tags . The high specifity makes the protease relatively non-toxic in vitro and in vivo. The molecular weight of the TEV protease is 27 kDa.
Usage and Biology
The TEV Protease was used and characterizes in the K1319008 construct.
To characterize the TEV protease we used the fusion protein K1319014 . This fusion protein contains GFP ( E0040 ) bound to a dark quencher ( REACh2/K1319002 ) over a linker which includes the TEV protease cleavage site. If the TEV protease successfully cuts the linker, GFP and its quencher would separate and the FRET (Förster Resonance Energy Transfer) system would be shut down. This would result in an increased GFP fluorescence.
To demonstrate this behaviour a double plasmid system was designed using the biobrick K1319013 in a pSB3K3 backbone and K1319008 in a pSB1C3 backbone. Also I20260 was used as a positive control because it produces the same GFP as used in the fusion protein and is regulated by the same promoter, RBS and Terminator on the same plasmid backbone. B0015 was used as negative control. Induction of the double plasm"

For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project."

In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Title：E.conan detective
Zhiqi Liu Northeast Forestry University
Abstract：There is no doubt that heavy metal contamination has detrimental effects on our environment and our health. For the sake of solving this challenging problem, our team comes up with the idea of this case. In our project, we intend to construct two plasmids to carry some specific elements and flocculation gene into the E.coli host，so that we can detect whether the environment is contaminated with heavy metal ions and report the concentration of them. Owing to the flocculation gene, we can collect the reconstructed bacteria just in case
of repeated pollution. We focus on trace contaminates detection and set the goal of standardizing the whole detection protocol.
Title：Dioxin Detective Y
Yifan Wu Harbin Institute of Technology
Abstract ： Dioxins, by-products of various industrial processes, are commonly regarded as highly toxic compounds that are environmental pollutants and persistent organic pollutants. Its deleterious hazards intensify with the odorless, colorless and fat-soluble properties, which enable dioxins to accumulate in vivo thus threaten almost the whole biosphere. Considering their ability of causing reproductive and developmental problems, damaging the immune system, interfering with hormones and also leading to cancer, hand in glove with the difficulty of being tested, dioxins are worthy of the name “poison of the century”.
So as to detect dioxins blisteringly, we have constructed device for rapid detection of dioxins inside yeast. We utilized associability between the gene for testing dioxins of MOUSE as receptor and dioxins as antibodies, together with the regulation conducted by lexA operator to downstream promoters so that mouse dioxin receptor and lexA are combined, and, striding a step further, induce downstream gene with the presence of dioxins. Eventually, we can achieve our goal of detecting dioxins rapidly through the system of positive feedback of fluorescence. Concerning the properties of yeast, like non-toxic and able to survive in hypertonic environment, our project can be put into wide application in the field like food detection, hence guarantee the food safety among the community of we human beings.

Purdue,2013,Team:Purdue#Project#Standardized Datasheets_-_-_TEXT.html," from the first survey, we started designing our datasheet. From the suvey results, we determined that teams wanted a modular datasheet that could be adapted by teams to suit their own needs. So we created a design that had two components; the datasheet and the protocol form. The protocol form was going to be a table of contents for the datasheet, so that users could easily see what had and had not been done without having to sort through data. The datasheet would be where all of the data was actually presented. The first draft of our standardized system is shown below (datasheet on left and protocol form on right):
After we finished this initial design we immediately went to get feedback from the collaborating teams. Except this time, we wanted the interactions between our teams be more personal than just a survey. We had the idea of hosting video conferences with the other teams so we could go through and explain the datasheets in person, and also get to know our fellow iGEMers! So we sent out a scheduling poll to find times that worked for the teams, and over the course of four weeks we had video conferences with 28 other iGEM teams!
Our idea to get feedback from other iGEM teams proved to be one of the best we've ever had! We got so many new ideas, perspectives, and opinions on our datasheet that made the design and concept that much better. We came up with an implementation plan that would be integrated into the iGEM registry, so teams could generate and post their datasheets at the same time that they add their part pages. The other 28 teams came up with so many new ideas that we decided to completely re-design our datasheet with BostonU iGEM.
Incorporating Ideas and Finalizing Design
The amount of ideas that came from feedback of other teams was enormous. Entirely new sections, headers, pieces of data, and ways to implement the system. Once we talked with all of the teams and had some important conversations with the BostonU iGEM team, we created the final design of the datasheet system. This new system got rid of the protocol form and created a more stylized, aesthetically pleasing datasheet. The final design is below:
Implementation and BostonU iGEM
While we were finalizing the design of the data sheet, Thomas Lozanoski from BostonU iGEM came to Purdue to meet with us and discuss the implementation plan of the datasheet. We decided on the final design seen above, and we decided that it would be best if the more experienced programmers at Boston take on"

Step 2: Dilution Series Instructions
We made the following serial dilutions for the triplicate Starting Samples you prepared in Step 1. We should have 12 total Starting Samples - 6 for your Positive Controls and 6 for your Negative Controls.
For each Starting Sample :
3 LB Agar + Cam plates (36 total) is needed.
Prepare three 2.0 mL tubes (36 total) with 1900 μL of LB + Cam media for Dilutions 1, 2, and 3.

Introduction
Antibiotic resistance is a renowned and pressing global health concern. In more recent times, there has been stagnation in discovering new classes of antibiotics, particularly for gram-negative bacteria. Throughout the mid-1900s, scientists were rapidly discovering the current major classes of antibiotics using the Waksman platform, which entailed systematically screening soil and fungal microbes for growth inhibition. However, the recurring problem of rediscovery and failure of subsequent high-throughput biochemical assays led many pharmaceutical companies to abandon their antibiotic development programs. Current antibiotics are generally broad-spectrum, acting against symbiotic gut flora in addition to pathogenic invaders. Therefore, specificity has recently become a target in modern antibiotic development in order to bypass challenges of both rediscovery and indiscriminate killing.
The core of antibiotic development lies in targeting a molecule or pathway essential for bacterial survival. Bacteria themselves have already developed several mechanisms to both communicate and compete with other bacterial strains occupying similar niches, which can be exploited for the creation of new antibiotic drugs. While some systems rely on secreted signaling molecules, direct cell-to-cell contact is also used to mediate intercellular interactions. Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is one such system that allows CDI+ bacterial strains to outcompete closely related CDI− siblings by synthesizing and translocating a toxin through the membrane of strains expressing the appropriate receptor. The CDI system is common in many strains of pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, such as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, making it a potentially suitable target for future antibiotics.
This type of growth inhibition was first seen in E. coli strain EC93, in which toxin delivery is mediated by the CdiA/CdiB two-partner secretion system and the outer membrane protein BamA, which is a conserved receptor among all strains of E. coli. EC93 is protected from its own toxin, located at the C-terminal region of CdiA (CdiA-CT), by the expression of a CdiI immunity protein that interacts directly with the toxin to neutralize its pore-forming capabilities. The CdiBAI cluster is common throughout most CDI+ strains, significantly varying only in CdiA-CT"

mRFP is a Red Fluorescent Protein which has an excitation peak at 584 nm and an emission peak at 607 nm.
Connectee 1:
The first kind of connectee is designed to be tested on the membrane, which consists of three major domains: membrane anchor system(ssDsbA-Lgt), mRFP and TAL effector.
The reasons why we chose a membrane anchor are as follows.
1. TAL could bind nucleoid which may bring some negative effect on bacteria growth.
2. Membrane scaffold is a natural scaffold.
3. Exogenous proteins often form inactive inclusion bodies when expressed in the prokaryotic system.
Figure1.2.2 Connectee 1
The membrane anchor system (ssDsbA-Lgt) comes from BBa_K771000 designed by iGEM12_SJTU-BioX-Shanghai; mRFP comes from BBa_E1010 designed by Antiquity; TAL effector comes from TAL-Protein DiRepeats (BBa_K747000 to BBa_K747095) designed by iGEM12_Freiburg. We used Helical Linker to connect mRFP and Lgt, in accord with iGEM12_SJTU-BioX-Shanghai. While in consideration of any possible stereospecific blockade when TAL binds to plasmid DNA, we chose Flexible Linker to connect Lgt and TAL effector.
Connectee 2:
The second kind of connectee is designed to be tested in the cytoplasm, which only contains TAL effector.
Figure 1.2.3 Connectee 2
Connector:
As iGEM12_Freiburg designed, we can choose a TAL protein to recognize a 14-nucleotide-long sequence, TXXXXXXXXXXXXT, on the plasmid DNA.   The plasmid here is called connector.
The principle for choosing a TAL recognizing sequence:
I. It does not exist in expression vector.
II. It does not exist in the sequence of connectee.
Test Method:
1. pBluescript II KS(+) is chosen as the connector in our test for several reasons:
I. High copy number;
II.Medium length—2961bp;
III. Easy to detect whether binding a TAL may affect gene expression — through lacI & blue-white spot screening.

Waterloo,2015,Team:Waterloo#Modeling#PAM Flexibility_-_-_TEXT.html,". By using a catalytically dead version of spCas9 (dCas9), Anders et al. managed to determine the crystal structure of a dCas9 protein bound to both the sgRNA and the double stranded target DNA. This data was analyzed to mechanism by which spCas9 binds to the PAM site and the target DNA.
The PDB file containing this structure can be found in the Protein Data Bank with ID 4UN3.
Creating Computational Models of spCas9 Mutants
We developed a script that allows for mutations in the region of interest of the Cas9 protein that interacts with the PAM sequence in DNA. Our script induced in silico mutations resulting in a change of amino acid sequence in the Cas9 protein. The type of amino acid substitutions produced by our script were position-specific; this constraint was based on data from Kleinstiver et al.
in order to restrict our sample space to mutants that were likely to produce mutants with an affinity to some PAM sequence. Additional constraints were imposed based on known biochemical properties of the amino acids being mutated.
Once a mutant has been generated, a full set of pdbs with the 64 or 256 different PAM sequence variants is created to test affinity for all possible PAM sites.
Our approach for determining the PAM sequence affinity of each Cas9 mutant is by generating a combination of either 64 or 256 different PAM sequences using both 3DNA and Chimera (our choice of software will be elaborated below). These combinations were implemented by altering the original 4UN3 PDB file and were subsequently tested and scored using PyRosetta and visualized through PyMOL.
Modeling Docking with PyMOL and PyRosetta
Simulation of Cas9 interactions with the PAM region were performed with PyRosetta. Docking was performed between wildtype/mutant Cas9 and all PAM variants, in order to determine the relative stability of the Cas9 candidate and PAM sequence. Structures that result in a low docking score (and thus high stability) indicate that this complex is predicted to occur in real-life, and that this Cas9 mutant should bind and cut sequences with that PAM sequence. PyMOL was used to observe the docking and repacking protocols and ensure that appropriate actions were being done in our simulation runs.
Analysis of Simulation Data
The docking score of these simulations is tracked over multiple runs. The scores are then averaged and mutant specificity to different PAM sequences is determined, based on the clustering of the scores by PAM. Mutants highly specific for a particular PAM will be tested in the lab as"

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," reductive power
As much as this project seemed ambitious, there were numerous applications for the reductive power of Shewy. By fixing carbon dioxide with protons from water, and sending electrons from Shewy straight into oxygen, bacteria could possibly evolve oxygen, meaning that the bacteria could be used in oxygen evolving devices in spacesuits or rockets.
Mabel and Fred came up with the idea that by using reverse electron transfer we could send electrons to some other compound that we want to reduce. For instance, if the electrode is on and we are driving the electron transport chain in the reverse direction, we would add an enzyme that breaks down the fumarate (original electron acceptor) and then direct the electrons to whatever we want to reduce.
The main application we had in mind with Shewy was the synthesis of biopolymers. The idea was to use reverse electron flow to fix CO2 to lactate and then polymerise lactic acid to form PLA, which is one of the main plastics used in 3D printing. Printing circuits was another application of the Shewy idea. If the metals could be selectively reduced in an small, controlled space, they could be ""printed"" to generate circuits. By removing the proton gradient generating components in Shewy, and inserting bacteriorhodopsin, a focused light source would cause metal to be reduced in a controlled space.
In light of these ideas, we spent much of the first half of the Easter term reading around reversed electron flow. However, although Shewy is a biochemically challenging and interesting project, further research showed that it might need a lot of work if we were to render it into synthetic biology. It seemed that at least a hundred enzymes were involved in the reduction of oxygen, we needed to know inputs and outputs of various complexes, and should develop a way to specifically relate the project with engineering aspect crucial to synthetic biology. While these discussions were ongoing, Leon found a research group that had been working on a similar project and whose funding has been reduced to zero. Having done lots of research without making a lot of progress, we decided that it could take longer than this summer to narrow down the project, let alone do the lab work required.
Our Shewy space travel nose-dived in a meeting we had at the start of March, during which we realised we needed to take a step back and reassess our original ideas. George had previously worked in a clinic treating urinary tract infections (UTIs) and drew everyone's attention to how significant a problem they are.

BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Implementation#syntf_-_-_TEXT.html," pGAL1 promoter and followed by a terminator (Ajo-Franklin et al., 2007
A transcription factor is composed of a standard activation or repression domain linked to a variable binding domain.   Since these factors were originally constructed in a yeast system, the activator and repressor domains (VP64 and Sin3, respectively) were selected due to their known endogenous regulation of yeast promoters.   The binding domain is chosen such that it matches a corresponding binding site associated with a particular promoter.  Four binding domain-binding site pairs were provided to us (LexA, Zif268-HIV, Gli1, and YY1).  Each set comes from an organism aside from yeast in order to diminish off-target effects from the introduction of such synthetic factors.
More so than the activation and repression domains, the binding domains define the ability to construct a complex synthetic network.  It is possible to define which transcription factors act upon a given promoter simply by appending one of the short binding sites to that promoter.  Conversely, one can select a promoter for a given transcription factor to affect by modifying the binding domain on the protein.  This latter point describes an essential component of our limiter network, which aims to target an endogenous promoter.  In theory, as long as the binding domain of any transcription factor for an endogenous promoter is known, it should be possible to create a synthetic transcription factor to act on that promoter.  The Biofusion standard affords for considerable flexibility in this regard.
Other parts of these synthetic transcription factors include a dimer of fluorescent tags and an SV40 nuclear localization sequence (NLS).
We currently have three versions fluorescence: mCherryx2, YFPx2, and CFPx2.  Note that all three of these fluorescent domains have been codon-optimized for yeast expression.  The inherent fluorescence built into these transcription factors allows for a steady-state and even dynamic read-out of expression levels of the transcription factors.  Furthermore, the double fluorescent tags provide an enhanced stability to the protein.
Finally, the nuclear localization sequence, as the name implies, targets each transcription factor back into the yeast nucleus after translation, allowing the protein to regulate transcription.
Other schemes of regulation
While our device was built to function solely on the level of transcriptional regulation, one can easily imagine the opportunity for regulation through other mechanisms.  Our repressor for the gene of interest in the model can be replaced with a gene encoding for shRNA that targets the mRNA of gene G.  In this case, our limiter would be tuned to interfere with translation.  Alternatively, the re"

Degrade endocytosed cellulose and produce H₂ plus CO₂. Anaerobic, occur on mitochondria in the cells
A termite, Zootermopsis angusticollis
Information about Species that live inside Termites (1,2,3) .
The termites that are attacking the MIT are Zootermopsis angusticollis, a type that live in several states of USA (4) .
In Research, Termites have started to destroy plastic because of a random mutation inside one of its symbionts organisms:  The protozoa Trichonympha, one of the organisms in charge of degrading the cellulose that Termites bring inside their guts.
Termites are hard to kill, so in this hypothetical scenery, destroying them with normal insecticides wouldn’t be a definitive solution for this problem. Termites would probably resist the attacks of insecticides, and if we aren’t able to destroy them all, the plastic mutation would spread in a world that is plastic made, with the force of Darwinian evolution boosting it.
This is where Synthetic Biology appears.
Targeted microorganisms
Trichonympha, one of the protozoa that lives inside Zootermopsis angusticollis
The objective of the game is to eliminate the termites that have the mutated Protozoa, in order to save the world from the disappearance of plastic. As the termites are hard to kill, the target is the mutated protozoa, Trichonympha. But a protozoa itself is hard to kill, too. Should we try to attack the protozoa with toxic compounds? If it isn’t effective with termites, there is no reason to believe that is a good and effective strategy for Protozoa. Should we genetically modify them, in order to stop the mutation? But protozoa are eukaryotic, and because of that are hard and slow to modify. The answer Research gives to this problem is: treat this issue just as the old one. If the strategy was killing the protozoa in order to kill the termite, then kill the symbiont bacteria that lives in the surface of Trichonympha in order to kill the protozoa, and with this, kill the termite. It is also necessary to consider that the strategy used should be controlled enough in order to stop it when it is needed. The idea is to kill the termites that possess the mutated Protozoa; not the entire termite community, which could cause horrible imbalances in the ecosystem.

Program
Coding
Programmers need to track even minute changes to their code exhaustively, especially as the project scales up. Typical tools used for this process include git and svn, which create ""diffs"" which capture differences between files and send them over a network to collaborators.
However, no tool currently exists to support genome-scale changes in a useful way. Programming version control tools can be used to cover DNA data, but they aren't used to working with that sort of input and are extraordinarily inefficient. darwin is a way around that. It uses version control tools as a backend, so it takes advantage of their strength. But it preprocesses the DNA data to optimize these tested and proven methods of version control, producing a much more efficient and secure tracking system built from the ground up to be able to scale to genome-size files. darwin is completely open-source, so any security or optimization issues can be identified and solved immediately to help all users of the tool. It's also agnostic to the type of version control backend used, so it can be put into place on a massive variety of systems.
Biology
The basis for the workings of any organism is rooted in its proteins as provided for in its genome. Every single protein can be traced back to an open reading frame, a set of base pairs defined by a start and stop sequence that evenly divides into codons (sets of 3 base pairs). Every codon corresponds to an amino acid and through the processes of transcription and translation, proteins are manufactured in the cell.
While DNA is a relatively stable molecule, different things can occur causing a mutation in the genetic code. There are several different types of mutations which are defined by how they affect protein translation downstream, specifically insertions, deletions, and substitutions. These can either be synonymous meaning that although there is a changes to base pair, the codon still codes for the same amino acid so there is no detectable change, or nonsynonymous which may affect the makeup of the protein. Lastly, there are frameshift mutations which generate an entirely different open reading frame.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#notebook 9_-_-_TEXT.html,", finish E.coli oscillator database, update DB document. Discuss UI with Soimort and push him to work faster, discuss synchronized E.coli with Zhaoyi Li. Have fun working.
Summary: Today is Oct 7, and I have just start writing work summary of the last week in Sep. During last 2 weeks we celebrated Mid-Autumn Festival and had 7 day off for National Day, while others are enjoying themselves traveling, we iGEM team members didn’t take a day off. We have to seize every minute to make our software work! I guess I’m just too busy to write my work log, and right now I am trying my best to recall what exactly I did in the last week of Sep…
Here’s what I can remember.
Zhaoyi Li looked into the nature article on synchronized ecoli clock and gave a brief lecture, then he started to analyze all the reaction and species in the model, and prepare to write the DB of it. Zhengda He’s parents came to see him, so he disappeared for 3 days or so. He has finished part of EPF-Lausanne DB but not all, so Yubo Qi kicked in to investigate the proper parameters for reaction. Unfortunately, it’s almost a hopeless task, no reliable source with specified parameters can be found, so we gave up at last.
I finished another detail draft on input UI design, and Soimort is constructing our UI according to it. I tried to discuss more with Soimort and push him harder, but can’t find the right way…
My girlfriend came and we spent 3 days together. It was 3 halves of days actually, since there are tasks I cannot put aside. However, she was so thoughtful and supportive, and didn’t complain about my absence. We had our sweet moments together. Her visiting means a lot to me, and fuels me up with energy to work on.

Sep 5 ~ Sep 12, 2010 Build two tool softwares to help Zhen Wang to edit our database input files.
Sep 12 ~ Sep 30, 2010 Modify the soslib v1.6.0 source code to base on libsbml v4.0.1, Which enable soslib support sbml version2 level 4 to meet our database format requirements.

Safety at QGEM 2017
All QGEM members successfully completed extensive lab safety training (under the supervision of our PI), Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) training, and Biosafety Training Level 2 to ensure complete safety working in the wet lab. All wet lab work was performed in research labs with the supervision of graduate students during working hours. Lab safety training included the following:
Location and use of fire alarms, exits, and extinguishers
Location and use of eyewash stations, safety showers, first aid kits, chemical spill kits and response cards, laboratory gas shut off valves
Standard laboratory safety rules, including proper lab wear, protective gear, use of hazardous equipment
Proper method of disposal and spill response for: biohazardous materials, sharps, chemicals, radioactive material, ethidium bromide gels
Proper use and handling of autoclaves (undergone with the department's designated trainer)
Risk Group 1 (non-pathogenic organisms) Escherichia coli K-12 cloning strains in regulation with the Canadian Biosafety Standards were used for expressing our constructs. The primary strains of E. coli used for expression were BL21 and PQN4 (a Csg operon deletion mutant obtained from the Neel Joshi lab of Harvard University). These strains of E. coli do not pose any threat to laboratory workers, the general public, or the environment. Standard lab biosafety regulations were followed to ensure that any modified strains were not introduced to people or the environment outside of the lab."

Modifications to DNA Extraction, Restriction Digest, Instructions and Write-ups
The movement of the restriction digest tubes have been modified so they are more interactive so the user is asked what piece of equipment is required once all required items have been added in the correct order to each tube. The three pieces of equipment to touch are the water bath, heating block and incubator (for the insert) respectively. I still am required to place my restriction digest instructions into a notecard on the lab table, which I will do next week.
I have been able to modify the first five steps in DNA extraction so that the order in which a avatar proceeds is important. Now if the initial step of resuspension has not been accomplished, if you touch the lysis activity you will not be allowed to perform the activity. However, once a step has been unlocked an avatar may return to it at any time if they believe they missed something or just wish to redo a step. Once an avatar reaches the end of the activity a message is sent to all objects, which resets the entire activity. Now I will have to begin incorporating the containers that store: Wash Solution, High Salt Buffer, Isopropanol, and one containing a DNA buffer as well as one more centrifuge step.
Some more instruction were added to bacterial transformation so there is a response for everything an avatar does in attempt to complete the activity. For example, if a user drops an item into the quiz’s inventory that is of the same type that has been submitted before it will alert them to the fact that they have answered that set of questions before and will not ask them again. I have been given the task of creating more products for this activity as well so I will have to add to my transformation script so that the plates with growth will give you the proper object to be used within the lab elsewhere.
I also wrote an introduction to the virtual lab for our project description for the wiki, which generally explains the lab’s content as well as its purpose for the second life project.

Six of the other seven genes, mmoX, mmoY, mmoZ, mmoB, mmoC, and, mmoD, encode the proteins of the sMMO complex. Three of these proteins come together and form one big protein, called MMO hydroxylase (MMOH). Hydroxylation means the adding of an -OH group, in this case the change of methane to methanol (CH4 to CH3-OH) which happens inside MMOH. This reaction is assisted by MMOB, encoded by mmoB. MMOC, encoded by mmoC, is the sMMO reductase by providing MMOH with two electrons (by oxidizing NADH). Or to say is more simple, MMOC will reset MMOH so it can break another methane molecule. MMOD, encoded by mmoD, is thought to inhibit the process by blocking the binding of either MMOB or MMOC to MMOH.
The last gene, mmoG, encodes for the protein MMOG, is not previously been uses in a iGEM project. MMOG is thought to be a chaperone which will properly fold the sMMO proteins.
More technical information about the specific functions of each sMMO subproteins after the summary.
Summary:
sMMO is build out of 5 proteins, whereof MMOX, MMOY, MMOZ form one protein complex called MMOH.
MMOH, MMOB and MMOC are needed to convert methane to methanol.
MMOD inhibits the methane to methanol reaction.
MMOG is a chaperone folding the other sMMO proteins correctly.
MMOH, MMOC and MMOB
MMOH, the hydroxylase, consist of three subunits α (60.6 kDa), β (45.1 kDa), and γ (19.8kDa), encoded by mmoX, mmoY, and mmoZ2. These bound subunits form again a dimer, resulting in α2β2γ2, with in the middle a 'canyon'. On each of the αβγ subunits is a binding site for either MMOB, the regulator, or MMOC, the reductase2. Binding of MMOB to MMOH is needed for efficient hydrocarbon oxidation (the actual breaking of the C-H to C-OH bonding)2. MMOC transfers the two electrons from NADH"

Bacto-Aid
Introduction
Welcome to our Wiki
Nine months ago, twelve students went to a cottage far, far away. We were students from different lines of study and had hundreds of ideas. With the combined power of our diverse mindsets, we came up with the idea of Bacto-Aid. In the beginning it was nothing but an idea – but it was our idea. We envisioned Bacto-Aid to be a bandage with an envelope of biocompatible plastic (poly-β-hydroxybutyrate, PHB). The pad would consist of silk that promotes healing with incorporated bacteriocins, thereby preventing infections. Since then we have worked hard to make it more than just an idea. We have worked so hard that we believe that we achieved the requirements for the gold criteria.
Before explaining the idea in further details and showing you how far we got, we would like to introduce the team and everyone who helped us. You will also find an overview of what we achieved with regards to the iGEM competition and its medal requirements.
Come on, click next. There is so much to discover!

Results
Difficult to interpret results, since the source plasmid size is unknown. However, it looks like the digested sample presents a shorter fragment compared to the undigested. On the other hand, it also looks like the size difference is too big to have resulted from just excising the ≈300 bp N-CPP cluster.
Also strange is that it looks like there are two bands present in the undigested sample.

All this structure (MAGP, GPL and lipoarabinomannan) is highly immunogen like LPS is in others bacteria. Unlike to other bacteria, this complex structure gives a special resistance to M. avium. The network formed by the membrane, based on parallel hydrocarbonates, permits to the bacterium to be impermeable to several agent like ethanol, detergent or classical antibiotics.

Targeted tissu of the DVS [6,7]
DVS can be adapted to several pathologies in function of its tissue vector tropism. These last are linked to the tropism of M. avium “Wild type”, but it is possible to transform M. avium to make it sensible to some organic chemotactisms. Now, let’s discover what possibilities offer M. avium “Wild type”.
M. avium can infect an organism by oral and intravenous way. If its homologous M. tuberculosis is often seen like a pulmonary pathogen agent, M. avium can eventually infect all organs. This affirmation is verified in immunodepressed patients in which the decreased immunity permits to the bacterium to propage in the entire organism.
Deeper researches on tropism revealed some targeted organs. It is shown that weeks after infection, bacterium concentration reaches a plate in two organs: spleen and liver and later in a third one: lungs.
Figure 2: Lung, spleen, liver and thymus invasion by M. avium from 0 to 52 weeks in log 10 (6 to 10 mice)
We observe as well that during several weeks post-infection, the bacterial amount still increases. Although, this increase in targeted tissues is not correlated with a Mycobacterium increase in blood. So, the increase is due to targeted tissues invasion and not to the entire body invasion.
So, there is a tropism as well as an implantation of the vector in targeted tissues. This characteristic is really interesting because the vector is not circulating but resident.
The tissue vector first function is to deliver the cell vector in the"

DESCRIPTION
Digestion of Selected Genes
The students select the bricks they want to put in the biosensor and add the restriction enzymes to start the digestion. When the digestion is finished a heat inactivation is required in order to proceed to ligation.
Ligation of Genes
After the inactivation, the genes are ready to be ligated together. The ligation is fast and only takes an hour to complete.
Transformation of Biosensor
The ligated bricks and plasmid are ready to be put together with competent Escherichia coli cells and be transformed by heat shock. The backbone plasmid contains chloramphenicol resistance and the transformants are therefore plated on LB plates with chloramphenicol.
Test of Biosensor
A day after the transformation is done, the colonies with transformants should be there. It is sometimes necessary to test the biosensor to see if it works as expected, but it depends on the genes in the biosensor.

SCUT-China: What are we doing this year?
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change in ways that render the medications used to cure the infections they cause ineffective.
In order to deal with this situation, the applications of Synthetic Biology are used. We established a programmed antibiotic synthesis system, which can produce new antibiotics for meeting human’s needs to solve the problem of antimicrobial resistance.
Now, We are holding an exhibition at the Guangdong Science Center. The topic of this exhibition is “Toward the Synthetic Biology, Toward a better life”. This exhibition will last for one month, and is free of charge.
Exhibition Address: Guangdong Science Center
This exhibition is planned and organized by SCUT-China.

At the end, we held a discussion between the students and our team about antibiotic resistance, and their perception of the concern. We also asked how they would feel about using our engineered bacteria, and the response was positive, with most of the students saying that if their doctor recommended the treatment, they would be open to using it.

Further Considerations
Fungal Infections
“What about fungal infections?”
This question was asked following a talk we gave to Oxford alumni medical professionals. It was suggested that eliminating the bacterial population inside the urinary tract would increase the chance of the patient acquiring a fungal infection. Up to this point, we had not considered UTIs that are caused by fungi. The most common cause of fungal urinary infections are species of Candida. Infection with Candida usually occurs in patients with urinary catheters, typically after antibiotic therapy, although candidal and bacterial infections frequently occur simultaneously.  We then attended a talk by Dr. Haribabu Arthanari that discussed multidrug resistance in Candida, highlighting Candida as the second most common cause of fungal infection globally.
For a comprehensive treatment of UTIs, our solution also needs to target fungi. The most common species of Candida involved in infections, particularly in the urinary tract, is Candida albicans 3 . Unfortunately, according to a fungi specialist (Professor Neil Gow, University of Aberdeen), “there is no fungal equivalent to bacterial exotoxins”, so anything we use to sense fungal virulence must be a constitutive part of the fungal cell. Additionally, if we use a hyphal cell wall protein (as suggested by Professor Gow), this would only allow our bacteria to sense C. albicans.
If we were to use our current system and adapt it to target fungi, we would propose incorporating a system into our bacteria that senses hyphal wall protein 1 (HWP1), a protein used for hyphal development and yeast adhesion to epithelial cells, which is only present when the Candida are virulent 4 . We would then use our chassis to produce an antifungal agent that would target biofilm formation as well as breaking down the virulent fungal cells. An example of such an antifungal agent is the Echinocandin class of antifungals. The problem with this is that it is very complicated to engineer bacteria to produce these agents, so a better solution for using our current system to target fungi as well as"

NTNU-Trondheim,2013,Team:NTNU-Trondheim#Press#examplePage_-_-_TEXT.html," rbs variant gave us the functionality we desired. This construct was then used as our template for our other ToxR fusion proteins. Note: for our ToxR chimeras, we switched from an IILK constitutive dimerizing periplasmic domain to Lambda-Rep and MukF constitutive dimerizing periplasmic domains after we identified the stress promoter because they provided higher levels fluorescence in our experiments. For this reason, we collected data using ToxR fusions of Lambda-Rep and MukF.
Characterization
For characterization, we made fusion proteins of ToxR with Lamda Repressor and MukF proteins. Both of these proteins dimerize in wild-type and we expect them to help ToxR dimerize as well. We transformed ToxR-LambdaRep driven by Pstress into our reporter strain (see below for more details). In parallel, we also transformed our original constructs of ToxR-lambdaRep driven by Pbad into our reporter strains. Each construct was grown in 100 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, 25 mg/ml, 12 mg/ml, 6 mg/ml 3 mg/ml, 1.5 mg/ml, and 0 mg/ml arabinose. For our control, a known nontoxic plasmid was transformed into the cells that should not activate our reporter strain.
Data
As shown in the graph of Pbad-LambdaRep and Pbad-MukF, cells did not grow up well in the varying levels of arabinose. The relative fluorescence graphs also supported the conclusion that our constructs were toxic to the cells.
Our solution to the high toxicity of our ToxR chimeras was to have a promoter that would down regulate transcription when the cell was under stress. As shown in the Pstress graphs of LambdaRep and MukF, cells grew to a much higher OD and fluorescence especially in Pstress-LambdaRep compared to the control. All levels of arabinose showed similar results.
Function
The reporter construct give a fluorescent output that correlates to the amount of transcriptional activity ToxR promotes on Pctx (it's wild type promoter). Since transcriptional activity by ToxR dimers depends on the strength of dimerization, the level of fluorescence can be correlated to how tightly the ToxR dimerizes.
Assembly
ToxR’s native target, the ctx promoter (Pctx), was PCRed out of Vibrio cholerae genomic DNA and made into a basic part. The promoter was then placed upstream of an rbs.sfGFP part using "

I obtained my BSc. in Cellular, Molecular and Microbiology at the University of Calgary, Canada.  After which I worked as a research associate at the University of Leicester, UK working on genome and population dynamics in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  I am very interested in bridging approaches and techniques from various fields to tackle complex problems in biology.  I am a highly problem motivated scientist and enjoy experimental design, as such I am excited at the prospect to take part in this years iGEM competition.  The iGEM competition is the ideal place to branch out into exciting new fields, enhance and broaden our skill set and showcase our talent and ideas in an international setting.

Our carbon footprint
Not unlike the coastline paradox presented by Mandelbrot, our total carbon footprint is hard to measure. Calculating our total footprint is therefore virtually impossible, and we cannot take the following into account: Every single kilometer we have driven, the exact size of our trees and so forth.
The estimated carbon footprint of a flight from Copenhagen, Denmark to Boston, Ma, USA and back again is 3.430 kg/person (kilde). With a team of 14 persons this yields a total of 48.020 or roughly 48 tonnes of carbon dioxide for our team. Just from flying intercontinental. Added to this is the carbon footprint of the Danish trains at 30 g/km/person (kilde). With the same 14 persons and 175 km to Copenhagen from Odense this yields a total of 147 kg. We have been on a total of three trips, one to Langeland, Denmark, one to Copenhagen, Denmark and one to Delft, Holland. We have travelled to these destinations in two Volkswagen Transporter vans. The carbon footprint of these is 188 kg/km/car (kilde). With a total of 2320 km travelled our trips yield a total of 844,5 kg of CO2.
Thus our total carbon footprint of travelling is roughly 49 tonnes of CO2.

Week 5 (19th-24th July, 2016)
Firstly, I sent two secretion system BBa_K215108, BBa_K215107 to sequencing by using verification primer and got part of correct sequencing results. Secondly, I first digested BBa_P0440, BBa_P0412 with EcroRI and SpeI, BBa_K1491009 with XbaI and PstI and did 3A assembly of BBa_P0440- BBa_K1491009 and BBa_P0412- BBa_K1491009 with pSB1A3 vector separately. Then transformed ligation product into DH5α cell cultured overnight. Picked up colony from the plates and colony PCR to amplify the inserted part (failed). I also tried to add degradation tag BBa_M0050 to the C terminal of mRFP BBa_K1491009 and sfGFP BBa_K515005 by using PCR. The annealing temperature of both PCR reaction were 64℃, 1.5 min. Then did PCR product clean-up and each part BBa_K1491009+BBa_M0050 (145 ng/ μL), BBa_K515005+ BBa_M0050(318.6ng/ μL), BBa_K1365020+ BBa_M0050(239.2 ng/ μL).

Engineering of NRPS
With a pool of more than 500 different amino acid monomers, a peptide of only nine monomers have almost infite possibilities of composition. Yet, to our knowledge, improvement of existing NRP drugs through genomic engineering of NRPS in vivo still remains unaccomplished. This is perhaps surprising as it for long has been possible to predict NRPS clusters/operon by genomic mining and in addition predict NRP products by analysis of adenylation domains [7-9]. A classical engineering approach is therefore to simple combine modules with known specificity into a synthetic assembly line. Two years ago, the iGEM team from Heidelberg tried to imrpove synthesis of synthetic peptides by combining different modules (MISSING LINK TO THEIR WIKI). In addition, they implemented a NRPS module (indC) which produces a blue compound and they combined this module with other NRPS module to produce tagged peptides. Such a tagging system would greatly improve the synthesis of synthetic NRPS-derived peptides, but to our knowledge, it has not been possible to repeat the experiment within the group at Heidelberg since then. The reason why synthetic modular-based design of NRPS is not yet possible, may be explained by recent insight into NRPS structure provided by structural analysis [5,10]. Crystallization of NRPS is complicated by their large size and mobile structure, but domain-specific crystallisation and other structural analysis has highlighted that specific interactions between individual modules in NRPS is crucical for the catalytic acivity and subsequently transfer of the growing peptide to the next module [10].

BEstimate by experimental data
By the above relations between each group of number, the system based on assumption described above can be expressed by the following set of ordinary differential equations:                      \begin{align*} &\dfrac {dS}{dt}=rN\left( 1-\dfrac {N}{K}\right) -\dfrac {\beta IS}{S+I} \\  \\ &\dfrac {dI}{dt}=\dfrac {\beta IS}{S+I}-\gamma I \\  \\ &\dfrac {dD}{dt}=\gamma I \\ \\ &\; N=S+I+D \ \end{align*}               This system is non-linear, and the analytic solution does not exist, but we can compute the numerical solution. We used improved Euler method to estimate the discrete solution in one step size to simulate the change of number with time in days (see the results). And Runge-Kutta methods solution for variable-step by MATLAB to constructed the sensitivity analysis.
Results
The following curves (Figure 3) show dynamics of number change of each kinds of individuals.
We see that the infectious individuals grow fast before first 7 day, and then began to drop. The total number of cockroaches continuously going down.
We specify the median lethal time (LT50), which means 50% of cockroaches dead, where in this condition is about 8 day, and lethal time 80% (LT80) is about 15 day. This result is reasonable with our expectation, it proved that our product indeed control the total number of cockroaches efficiently in doors.
Figure 3: The epidemic model simulating change of each group of individual within 40 days.
Sensitivity Analysis
We use sensitivity analysis to analyze the impacts of some important parameter values (β, γ) on our model outcomes lethal time 50% and 80% (LT50 and LT80), in order to figure out what we should need to improve in future, and which parameters we need to be more certain.
We ran our model with transmission rate (β) and mortality (γ) ranging from 0 to 1 and plotted these values against the time in LT50 and LT80. What’s more, we introduced sensitivity coefficient (△t*p/t *△p ratio of the relative change of the lethal time to the relative change of the parameter) into consideration, increasing our parameters 10 percent, and find the relative change of the lethal time.

Conclusion
Upon induction with arabinose, E. coli DH5α cells containing the BamHI construct did not reproduce as the overexpression of the BamHI endonuclease digested the genomic DNA of the host cell. This is why in Figure 2 there are only 4 colonies seen as opposed to the control which shows a lawn of growth. In Figure 1, the optical density of the BamHI expressing cells reaches a plateau; however, the same sample which has not been induced kept increasing, which indicates that the expression of BamHI is affecting normal growth of the cells.
Samples analyzed by SDS-PAGE after induction of BamHI expression show that protein concentration is not significantly affected (Figures 3-5).

Overview of Outreach
At the start of the team's work we spoke with a few members of the waste-water treatment world in order to determine if our project was going to be useful to the community and if it was going to be effective.  We also spoke at a forum on synthetic biology and genetic engineering at the Michigan Science Center.  This included a presentation on our project as well as round table discussions with locals on what they thought about synthetic biology and legal, ethical, and moral complications.  After this we presented at a women in engineering excursion on our project and synthetic biology in general trying to focus on getting the students interested in synthetic biology.  We provided parts and instructions for them to make paper microbial fuel cells and demonstrated two working models.    We also hosted the iGEM midwest meetup.  This included presentations on our projects, board games, ice breaker activities, a nice lunch, a walk through the MSU gardens and an ice cream break.
The Waste-Water Treatment Plant
We visited the plant in hopes of leaving with a better idea on how to tackle the current issue of contaminated water supply.  Bob, the manager of the plant, took us on a full tour displaying everything he could from where the water entered to where the solids and the clean water departed.  Bob spoke told us about how water treatment is expensive and that the plant is barely getting by and using 40 year old equipment and machines.  Late in the tour he told us some stories from when he visited some small villages in Nigeria where the people would drink water that was clearly contaminated as they had no choice and little knowledge of the contamination.  This encouraged us to go ahead with making a cheap water contaminant detector.
Michigan Science Center
We presented at the Michigan Science Center in Detroit Michigan.  We spoke about our project to people from different backgrounds and informed them about the impacts of our project.  The attendees asked many questions about our project and its safety, so we made sure to take their concerns into account.  We had a a few memorable discussions about the risks of our genetically engineered Shewanella escaping into the environment and how one would have to deal with that.  Thankfully our bacteria is non-pathogenic and the modifications we made would not be harmful, except possibly the addition of spectinomycin resistance. "

Discussion: Could be useful to have an atomic version with more detail - bits that make up biobricks. May become part of a Master’s project (Neil).
Discussion of Student Team Ideas – TOP 12
Gastric inflammation – B. subtilis to compete with H. pylori in stomach and combat inflammation / prevent ulcers. Problem: will need to produce ammonia to neutralise acid causing irritation to mucosa.
Skin repairer – B. subtilis in dressing produces factors to heal and repair skin and outcompete / confuse pathogens (eg peptides).
Sequester metals then form spores and die. Clean up heavy metals in waste, contaminated land and acid mine drainage. B. subtilis will need to be tolerant of low pH. Also stochastic death (say 10% survival).
Hairy Bacteria – to improve biofilm stability and strength B. subtilis grows 10x longer flagellae and 10x more flagellae allied to idea 2. Mammal hair suggested but not feasible.
Bio Memory – spores store 0 and 1’s in series to later produce morse code message or image.Issues with keeping track of the locations of bits.
Cleaner Bacteria – B. subtilis to produce perfumed surfactants and enzymes to soak-wash at 15 deg C.Could be smelly hence perfume or destroy smelly substances.
Happy Bacty – general environmental stress monitor. Too similar to previous years.
Path Finding Bacteria – Stochastic decision on path by bacteria growing along a path. Could produce a tuneable stochastic biobrick for population controls (give us the edge at iGem?).
Bacteria Gum – two ideas here. a. everlasting flavour pressure sensitive gum b. teeth and gum health with strep inhibitors (peptides) and calcium deposition.
Rock Bacteria – Sound as communication bacteria to bacteria, human to bacteria, computer to bacteria and visa-versa. 1 to 50 KHz. Need to electronically reduce freq so we can hear it. Make bacteria play simple tune or squeak.

Various amounts of RNase A were added to polyU/spermine coacervate solutions and after 5 minutes of equilibrating to 27 °C, the absorbance of 500 nm was measured over the course of 30 minutes. In the case where no or only 10-5 wt% of RNase was added, significant absorbance could be measured throughout the full period of time. For higher concentrations, the absorbance fell to that of the background within the equilibration time.
Proof of the coacervation method with activated Cas13a
In order to transfer the results obtained with RNase A, we tested the effect of spermine on Cas13a. A fluorescence assay with RNase Alert (as described on the Cas13a design page) was done with the addition of 1.0 wt% spermine, demonstrating that Cas13a did not show collateral cleavage with this condition. The effect of spermine was tested with and without the presence of the target RNA. The control consisted of a regular Cas13a assay with and without target RNA. Figure 22 shows the results. We can conclude that spermine inhibits the activity of Cas13a, whereas it does not inhibit RNase A activity. For our purpose, this means that spermine always has to be added after sufficient time has given for Cas13a to collaterally cleave enough RNA.
Figure 22: Collateral cleavage reaction is not compatible with 1.0 wt% spermine. The fluorescence assay with and without active Cas13a, and with and without 1.0 wt% spermine indicates that Cas13a does not show collateral cleavage activity in the presence of spermine.
Finally, the functional Cas13a had to be integrated with CINDY Seq, to achieve a full proof of principle. First tests revealed that polyU/spermine coacervates form in the reaction buffer of Cas13a (40 mM Tris-HCl, 60 mM NaCl, 6 mM MgCl2, pH 7.3), but as said, Cas13a does not show activity in presence of 1.0 wt% spermine. Therefore, the experiment was separated into two parts. First, Cas13a with and without target and crRNA was incubated with polyU for varying amounts of time, and subsequently spermine was added to a final concentration of 1.0 wt%. It was observed that after 60 minutes of incubation and subsequent spermine addition, no coacervates were formed in the"
