Targets
The original idea of using 16S rRNA from E. coli as a target for our initial experiments came from our supervisor Aurore , with the advice from Dr. Pardee . Our pathogen targets were chosen according to the main pathogens recommended by the experts we interviewed and designed by Dawafuti . Kilian Vogele, a PhD student from Prof. Simmel´s group, kindly provided us with the viral target sequences.
RNA extraction
We tried several approaches for extracting RNA: Julian and Patrick did multiple experiments using beads to bind RNA; Jorge experimented with the FINA extraction method (McFall et al., 2015) and tried to adapt it for RNA extraction; and Dawafuti and Julian also experimented with  RNA extraction for different targets and purification methods for detection with Cas13a.
Colorimetric read-outs
As we considered colorimetric readouts for CascAID, our supervisor Jeffery helped us brainstorm and suggested two interesting options: aeBlue and the Intein-Extein readout. The initial cloning for the first option was done by Christoph , and Florian performed all main experiments. For the Intein-Extein system, Max , with help from Sven , did most of the cloning and experiments. Rob worked on the Gold Nanoparticles readout with help from Kilian Vogele, a PhD student in Prof. Simmel´s group. Kilian also kindly gave us some linker sequences necessary for testing this readout.
Fluorescence read-out
Igor optimized the RNase Alert system and cleavage assays with the in vitro targets and different Cas13a proteins in the plate reader. Dawafuti did experiments with the different targets and the Cas13a Lbu using the plate reader. She, together with Sven and Rob , tried different targets on paper. Our supervisor Lukas showed them how to use the plate reader and always provided great guidance.
Lyophilization
The lyophilization of both Cas13a and other components was done by Rob , who contacted Christine Braig from the IMETUM for guidance and equipment. With her support, Rob was able to use the lyophilization equipment at the IMETUM to make the lyophilization experiments.
InterLab
Erika and Dawafuti were in charge of the InterLab Study. They received an introduction to the Plate Reader and help setting the protocol for the measurements from our instructor Lukas . They both transformed the devices, did the measurement experiments, and processed the data.
Hardware
Our hardware team consisted of four students: Katzi , Matthias , Sven and Max . Our fluorescence detector"

Russell [6] reported in 1971 that the amount of polyamines excreted in urine was higher in patients with cancer than in healthy persons. This evoked a surge of studies on polyamine analysis that were intended to answer the question of whether the level of polyamines in urine could serve as indicators of malignant diseases.
Polyamines are excreted in human urine mainly as mono- acetylpolyamines. Acetylputrescine (AcPut) is the most abundant urinary polyamine, constituting 43% of total polyamines, followed by acetylcadaverine, N1-AcSpd and N8-AcSpd in decreasing order. Diacetylpolyamines represent minor polyamine species in human urine. The average amounts of DiAcSpd and DiAcSpm are only approximately 1.4 and 0.46%, respectively, of total polyamines, but their CV values are very small, taking their low content into account. This indicates that variation of these diacetylpolyamines in urine is very small from one individual to another, and may imply that they are secreted in a highly controlled manner.
DiAcSpm was sensitive for detecting cancer patients in that it increased markedly in about 80% of patients with cancer, reaching as high as 150 times the normal limits, while DiAcSpd was highly specific for cancer in that it was elevated only marginally in cases of benign diseases. This strongly suggested that diacetylpolyamines but not monoacetylpolyamines would serve as novel tumor markers, and these early observations prompted us to perform further studies of diacetylpolyamines.

Project
As stated, in the Polybiome Project we believe that prevention is the best way to fight cancer. For this reason, we wanted to focus our research in two main working lines. The first one, is a probiotic proof-of-concept which would act as a preventive treatment for colorectal cancer. Our aim is to modify Escherichia coli so that they are able to absorb the excess of polyamines that we ingest through our diet as well as the ones that are produced by the intestinal microbiota. This way, we will decrease their concentration to healthy levels and reduce the probability of developing colorectal cancer.
The second idea was inspired by the fact that polyamines are found in high"

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Cholera - Detection_-_-_TEXT.html," that expresses a protein that will accelerate the degradation of cholera’s biofilm. These researchers show that it is possible for E.Coli. OUR PLAN:  Our first step needs to be to get cholera-specific phages to work with. CTX theta phage is a very famous and well characterized (we found a paper elucidating it’s entire genome) cholera-specific bacteriophage. It is a temperate phage. Chinese researchers used VP4 phage to study serotype O1 cholera. In India, researchers successfully treated cholera-infected rabbits with a cocktail of 5 phages: ATCC 51352- B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5. Tomorrow I will write an email to send to these professors that Dr. Grose will then forward to them on our behalf. Another approach to obtaining cholera-specific bacteriophage is to search for them in samples of Cholera-sullied water. Clarice researched WHERE Cholera is in the United States, but unsurprisingly no one is keen to publish that their water is infected with cholera. She didn’t find anything helpfully conclusive.  Once we have bacteriophages we will coordinate with Michael, Whitney, and Nathan to clone into its genome proteins that (hopefully) will degrade cholera’s biofilm. We are researching candidates proteins. We started growing cholera today and I’ve read several articles that mention assays for growing biofilms. Once we have our engineered phage we will begin testing.
CH 3/25/13 We again did some planning of what we need to do going forward.  Plan of Attack: 1. Study phages 2. Obtain different cholera associated Phages 3. Engineer phage to penetrate biofilm then produce biofilm degrading enzymes upon infection of cholera 4. Testing  I think we also need to do more research on V. cholerae in general. What makes up its biofilm etc.  Today I set up a sequencing reaction with reverse primer BI227 (1ul undiluted) and pJG78 (2ul undiluted).

Valencia,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Molecular_-_-_TEXT.html,"isation of this construction .
TEMPERATURE-INDUCED PROMOTER
This construction is made up of three parts:
The transcription factor-binding site inside the promoter
the coding sequence, which contains a synthetic fluorescent (red) protein. Our construction uses the well-known high chaperon expression when the bacterium      is suffering from heat shock [1]. We have taken the promoter sequence of groE, one of these proteins highly produced when heat shock [2].   When is the protein synthesized? In order to obtain the red fluorescent protein a condition has to be met. High temperatures for E. coli must be reached, like for example from 42ºC degrees. We focused on 44ºC because here we got the best results.
The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is as follows: high temperatures are sometimes harmful for microorganisms, so they have adapted successfully for such a strong condition by synthesizing some proteins, called HSP (Heat Shock Proteins), that help in protein folding. Heat-shock response is mediated by the sigma32 factor [3]. This alternative sigma factor allows the RNA polymerase to bind to some consensus promoter sequence. groE has this sequence in its promoter [4]. That is because this gene encodes a chaperon protein, GroE. Chaperone proteins are a group of proteins present in all cells; many of them are heat shock proteins, whose function is to assist the folding of other proteins in the newly formed protein synthesis.
In the case of GroE, it processes a nonnative polypeptide in a cycle consisting of three steps. First, the polypeptide substrate is captured by GroEL. Upon binding of the co-chaperone GroES and ATP, the substrate is then discharged into a unique microenvironment inside of the chaperone, which promotes proper folding. After hydrolysis of ATP, the polypeptide is released into solution. Moreover, GroE may actively increase the folding efficiency, e.g. by unfolding of misfolded protein molecules. This chaperon has an important role in heat shock process too, helping other proteins not to denature.
How did we deal with this construction? We were able to activate the promoter after a heat shock, like keeping the culture at 44ºC during 5 min. However, since we wanted a very good modeling for this construction, we developed a lot of experiments with different temperatures, different times of incubation, as well as gradating the temperature ranging from 37ºC to 46ºC.

Both chromoprotein followed with aav tail to obtain the color change distinctly from green to yellow. We introduced a tet operator to operate the expression of blue chromoprotein. The express of tetR (Part ID: BBa_C0040) is controlled by the 37℃ ribothermometer on the up steam. When the temperature is below 37℃, the tetR will not be translated and both yellow and blue chromoprotein can express, therefore, the green color shows. However, when the temperature reach above 37℃, tetR starts to be translated and bind with tetO, the gene that codes blue chromoprotein cannot be transcribed. Only the yellow chromoprotein can express. As the consequence of that, the color of the colony changed from green into yellow.
Figure 2
1.3 Coastal and Marine
The repress and control system between “Coastal” and “Marine” E. coli is showed in figure 3. When the temperature is below 37℃, LuxI (Part ID: BBa_C0061) in “Marine” E. coli will not be translated, 3-oxo-hexanoyl-HSL will not express. The Lux promoter, Plux (Part ID: BBa_R0061), in “Coastal” E. coli is closed in absence of LuxR/HSL (LuxR Part ID: BBa_C0062). Therefore, tetR won’t express and both yellow and blue chromoprotein will be expressed, the color of “Coastal” E. coli is green. When the temperature rise above 37℃, the ribothermometer switches on and 3-oxo-hexanoyl-HSL starts to express, which starts the transcription of Plux and tetR. TetR binds with tet operator and stops the transcription of yellow chromoprotein. The color of “Coastal” E. coli turns into blue.  This pathway simulates the process of the rise of sea level and the coastal area flooded by sea water.

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#project-m_-_-_TEXT.html," a wall so we will be using the Oseen-Blake tensor. This means that we are also required to find a vector from the mirrorpoint of the force to the point at which we wish to know the flow.
After this it is a matter of summarizing over all the flagella to find the total flowfield.   The situation (disregarding the mirrorpoint) is sketched in figure 4. The best way to illustrate the result from this model is to see it in action, so below the time series of a system of 20 flagella (only the 4 flagella in the middel of the system is shown), where the elastic constant is zero, is shown:
It is clear that the flagella tends to lie down and stabilize in an almost flat position in this case.  In the following figure we have made many of these runs, but with varying average start-angle
Figure 5: Shows the mean end angle as a function of the mean start angle, predicted by the 2D model.
As the figure shows a very small deviation in the starting angle will cause a much bigger deviation in the end. The flagella in the systems used for making this graph were all lying down, but to which side the flagella went was highly dependent on the start configuration. When the mean angle was zero corresponding to a vertical flagellum it was pretty much 50-50, but when the start angles were pushed a bit to one side it had a tendency to shift the entire system in that direction. This tells us that if you can control the starting angle, it will go a long way towards creating a uniform flow.
A stationary 2-D model
The stationary model, does not offer much when it comes to dynamics and interesting behavior, which should not surprise anyone. It does however offer us the opportunity to investigate at which angle the flow in the tube is highest, which could be helpful when planning how to optimize the use of bacteria as a source of flow.
Figure 6: Shows the mean velocity in the z(perpendicular to the surface) and y(parallel to the surface) direction as a function of the flagella agle, pridicted by the static model.
The above figure shows the average flow velocity as a function of the angle of the flagella. In the above case only one wall is taken into account. The one of most importance is the top-one which shows the flow velocity parallel to the tube. According to these figures we get the best velocity at an angle of around 0.7 rad or approximately 40 degrees, where the angle is measured from the axis"

Events and Meetings
During the course of this project we have met a lot of important and interesting people. At the start of our project we presented our initial ideas to a panel of experts that consisted mostly of professors and researchers from our universities and VTT. They all seemed very excited for us and gave us some feedback on the ideas and even threw some new ones in the air.
Throughout the summer, in the Summer of Startups program, we also got to rehearse pitching and presenting our ideas to the general audience. We got coached by some great people, for example Marko Ahtisaari from MIT Media Lab, and they taught us to explain synthetic biology in a more understandable way. It was during one these coaching sessions/meetings that we came up with the idea of turning bacteria into superheroes. It turned out to be an easy way to explain our project to people who don't know that much about genetic engineering, let alone synthetic biology.
We also had lab tours for people who were interested in the project and wanted to see what we actually do in the lab. As genetically modified organisms and genetic engineering are a bit of a taboo in Finland, we wanted to do our part in convincing people that what we do is not hazardous in any way and allay any suspicions they might have had towards our project and GMO in general.
Spreading the word about synthetic biology, especially among our peers, was one of our main goals. So we went and talked about our project to a lot of people on all sorts of occasions. We held a small presentation of the project and iGEM in general for the Molecular Biosciences students of the University of Helsinki. We had only planned to talk for a few minutes but the audience was so interested in everything that we ended up talking for almost an hour! We also represented our team in Aalto Party, the kick off event of the academic year at Aalto University, where we had our own pop-up booth.
We had the opportunity to pitch at Pitch Night, which was an event aimed for scientific projects and was part of Thinkfest, an festival of thinking and science held by the University of Helsinki in honour of their 375th anniversary. At Pitch"

Pick colonies for Measurement Interlab Study. Three technical samples for each device and the negative control (Untransformed E.coli DH5-α)were picked. E. coli DH5-α cells were grown in 3.5 ml Luria-Bertani  broth supplied with the corresponding antibiotic at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm for 16 hours.
09/10/2014
Today we measured GFP for the Measurement Interlab Study.
Cells were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 5 minutes and resuspended in ten folds the culture volume with a phosphate buffered saline (58 mM Na2HPO4, 17 mM NaH2PO4, 68 mM NaCl), as performed by Scholz et al., 2000. Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4 were purchased from Panreac. NaCl was purchased from Fisher Bioreagents.
A GloMax-Multi Detection System form Promega fluorometer configured with the Blue optical kit (&Lamda;ex=490 nm, &Lamda;em=510-575 nm) was used to measure fluorescence. For measuring fluorescence 250 μl of each sample were placed in a black 96-well plate. Each sample was measured three times and an average was displayed on the screen.
A Biowave CO 8000 from Biochrom spectophotometer was used to measure absorbance at 600 nm. For measuring absorbance 700 μl were placed in a cubet and measured one by one in the spectrophotometer.

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#AlbertoNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," except for the 2 transformation plates that use the Alpha Select Cells. These plates contained enormous, uncountable, amount of colonies. This was indeed surprising, but then we decided to transform several ligation reactions (the leftover from what we prepared on Monday) and checked to see if the use of Alpha Select Cells will produce a consistent ligation success. On the next day, we found out that this is exactly what happened. The only problem only occurred in the fluorescence composite parts that were ligated with the R2000 promoter. They either produced a small amount of colonies or nothing at all. Because R2000 is described on the Parts Registry as working well with E0240 (GFPc), it may simply not work well with other parts. Hence, we all decided to stop using R2000 for parts other than GFPc.
My recent ligation attempts involve the use of YFPc because I ran out of digested GFPc. So I prepared some more gel extraction samples of GFPc (cut with X and P) and then ligate them with different promoters: I14033 (pCat), I13453 (pBad), R0040 (pTet), and R2000 respectively. While the ligation may seem like a straightforward process, I decided to figure out several things here: First, is there any difference in behavior between part with high DNA concentration versus good 260/280 ratio? I did this because I have 2 GFPc parts, one with DNA concentration of 10.6 ng/uL and the other with 260/280 ratio of 2.13 but DNA concentration of 3.2 ng/uL. Second, does a combination between parts with different concentration produce different number of colonies? I found out on Sunday that the plates for E0240_R0040 and E0240_I13453 contained an enormous amount of colonies. The E0240 used for these ligated parts are the one with 3.2 ng/uL DNA concentration and 260/280 ratio of 2.13. The other plates only contain a small amount of colonies (5-10). These colonies appeared to be white. Nevertheless, we cannot determine anything from this since they both were done on Ampicillin plates and there was a contamination problem with the SOC. At least they worked.

Summary:
Although most gel extraction samples had low DNA concentrations, gel electrophoresis proved that they indeed contain the DNA (i.e. cut plasmid).

Yeast Terminator
To stop the transcription of the genes we are expressing in each of these two pathways, we use a transcriptional terminator specific to yeast.  Since we can only express one gene on each transcript, each ends in the same way with a nonselective terminator. Goffeau A, Barrell BG, Bussey H, Davis RW, Dujon B et al (1996) Life with 6000 genes.

Escherichia coli
Constitutive E. coli Promoter and Ribosome Binding Site
As with the yeast constitutive promoter, this promoter allows for a gene to continuously be expressed in E. coli. This promoter is drawn from the registry of standard biological parts. Although this sequence promotes the continuous transcription of the gene we would like to express, it does not have a ribosome binding site to allow for translation. By adding such a site to the end of the sequence, it could not now be used for constitutive expression of a protein. Registry of Standard Biological Parts. August 8, 2006.

Ice Nucleation Protein
In 2012, the Pennsylvania iGEM team produced a protein that would allow for the expression of other proteins on the surface of E. coli. This protein was based off of an ice nucleation protein found in Xanthomonas campestris that allowed for the nucleation and formation of ice crystals. The modified form of this protein results in a shorter sequence, and with the addition of a chain of glycine and serine residues, can be used to have the cell surface display a particular protein.

Also, the university has consistently been voted as the most innovative, most likely to produce the leaders of tomorrow, and best overall University in Canada for over 18 years (according to Maclean's Magazine). Waterloo's reputation is however based on its excellent and pioneering co-op program which offers students a balance of work and school on a per term basis, making it a unique learning experience. The city of Waterloo has recognized University of Waterloo and its students, by meeting its demands in terms of funding and involvement. The University has also opened up two new campuses; the pharmacy building, and the joint McMaster medical building in Kitchener, as well as the architecture building in Cambridge, contributing to not only the city of waterloo but the whole Grand River area.
WATERLOO - KITCHENER COMMUNITY
City of Waterloo mainly revolves around the two universities: University of Waterloo and Laurier University. Waterloo is surrounded by Kitchener and thus, the two cities are known as the twin cities, also referred to as Kitchener - Waterloo. The population of the city of Waterloo is always fluctuating due to temporary residents at Waterloo's two universities. Total population in 2009 was recorded to be 121, 700; approximately 20,000 of which were temporary post-secondary students. Due to its small size, people in the past have tried to merge the two cities together but have been unsuccessful. As of today, both cities have their own identity and their own separate city governments.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," EPO gene is mostly expressed in renal cells, from where the EPO protein is secreted into the bloodstream. The identification of any concentration of EPO DNA sequences  in blood however, are considered a positive result for gene doping within current detection methods. Considering the growing concern over gene doping, as well as the EPO availability of new molecular biology tools, the Brazilian Doping Control Laboratory (LBCD) implemented, improved, and validated 2 amplification assays for EPO cDNA using the real-time PCR instrument QuantStudio12K (Thermo Fisher, São Paulo, Brazil). All work was performed with WADA-certified reference material for EPO gene doping within a range of 1 to 4000 copies of reference material spikes and EPO gene-doping-positive samples. However, in view of the absence of interlaboratory tests among the laboratories accredited by WADA, the analysis was not performed on the Olympic samples; it was only performed on samples selected exclusively for research. ( Pereira, et al. 2017 )
2018: ADOPE
Our enthusiastic team set out to tackle gene doping to promote responsible use of synthetic biology. Read more about our project here .
We assessed the topic further through train debates and public surveys complemented by athlete interviews and contact with the Dutch Doping Authority as well as sports organizations as NOC*NSF, the Dutch National Sports Organization, and a sports psychologist . We found that up to 55% of the general public would like to use gene doping for performance enhancement without necessarily ascertaining its safety. These high figures amongst the general public together with the enormous pressure that is put on athletes give an indication of the need for detection.
“Given the huge amounts of money going on in doping development, gene doping will already be happening for sure!”

Statistics on the willingness of the general public to use gene doping for performance enhancement in The Netherlands and The People’s Republic of China based on 181 and 126 respondents respectively. More on the surveys in The Netherlands and China can be found on the Education and Public Outreach Page .
1.2 Future Gene Doping Challenges
After we evaluated the relevance of gene doping detection, we focussed on the challenges of gene doping in the broadest context. We grouped the challenges involved in gene doping in the following categories: health (both private and public, global and intergenerational), responsibility and social inequality. As became apparent during the expert discussion in Stirling , exactly these topics make gene doping different from conventional types of doping.

$$\rho \cdot \overrightarrow{f_2} \cdot \overrightarrow{n} \cdot dS \cdot dt $$
According to the mass conservation we can get the equation:
$$\iiint_D(\rho |_{t=t_2}- \rho |_{t=t_1})dxdydz=- \int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt  \iint_{\partial D} \rho \overrightarrow{f_1} \overrightarrow{n}dS+  \int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt  \iint_{\partial D} \rho \overrightarrow{f_2} \overrightarrow{n}dS$$
Assuming that \(\rho\) , \(\overrightarrow{f_1}\) , \(\overrightarrow{f_2}\)  are all continuously differentiable, according to Gauss Formula we can get that:
$$\int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt [\iiint_D \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \overrightarrow{f_1})- \nabla \cdot (\rho \overrightarrow{f_2})]dxdydz=0 $$

iGEM Networks of communication
Three main networks were analyzed:
The Slack interaction network is built from replies, mentions, invitations and reactions to messages.
The google group network is made of interactions and replies among Google group members as well as external collaborators.
The Epicollect network is built from regular survey data collecting information about the interaction in the lab with other team members.
In all networks, links are weighted by the number of interactions, and node size reflects the level of interaction (sum of link weights).
iGEM Networks of communication
Community detection was run on the whole aggregated network collapsing information from the 3 sources, resulting in two communities.
Complementary data has been collected using proximity sensors, and is still awaiting further analysis.
Summary
The three networks give a complementary picture of the interaction networks. In particular, hubs in one network are not necessarily hubs in another (showcasing communication channel preference).
The Google group data, which is the most active communication channel, reveals a variable engagement between a core active group and a more peripheral one. It also reveals a strong collaborative nature of the team with a high density of interactions.
The Epicollect data shows that the team members shared a lot of daily interactions with all other members
The Slack data is poorer in terms of number of events and is dominated by a few members who preferred this channel of communication
Comparison with the sensor based approach will allow to reveal a finer understanding of the underlying process

Public Science Education Cartoon of Gene
        We also made a catoon to illustrate what is gene and how transgenosis happen.
Set Up iGEM Club[2016.10]
        Students of our school has formed teams and participated in iGEM for six years, and                     we are going to carry the torch. As students have passion and favor, and with the support of our school,                     we established SCUT-iGEM club in the beginning of 2017.
Winter Training[2017.1]
        During the winter vacation, we had a short course on synthetic biology and invited                     professors to give lessons which enjoyed great welcome among the students. We also invited some senior                     students to share their experience about iGEM which interested the freshmen and inspired them to start                     a team to prepare the competition.
Weekly Presentation
        Many freshmen were potential members of the next year’s iGEM teams. They had amazingly                     great passion but also required the basic knowledge of synthetic biology and the understanding of iGEM.                     Thus, we instructed them to read academic reviews of synthetic biology as well as previous iGEM wikies                     and let them give presentations to share what they learn weekly. During the presentations and discussions,                     we would point out their sparkle and flaws, discuss with them and put up with solutions of their problems.
Mentor New Teams
        In May, some freshmen of our school began forming the team for next year’s iGEM.                     They were industrious, brilliant, creative and confident. We often had discussion with them and give                     some guidance to their ideas.
Science Center Teach-in[2017.3.5]
        In 5 th March, we participated in a seminar held by Guangdong Science Center, the largest science museum                     in Guangdong, China, to introduce our project to the public. We successfully raised public awareness                     of heavy metal pollution via this activity and told people the examples of using synthetic biology methods                     to solve the relevant pollutants problems.

Sexually communication among moths is accomplished chemically by the release of an ""odor"" into the air. This ""odor"" is the sexual pheromones.
Figure 1. Female moth releasing sex pheromones and male moth.
Pheromones are molecules that can undergo a diffusion process in which the random movement of gas molecules transport the chemical away from its source (Sol I. Rubinow, Mathematical Problems in the Biological Sciences, Lecture 9). However, diffusion processes are complex, and modelling them analytically and with accuracy is difficult, even more when the geometry is not simple.
For this reason, we decided to consider a simplified model in which pheromone chemicals obey to the heat diffusion equation. Then, it is solved by the Euler numeric approximation in order to obtain the spatial and temporal distribution of pheromone concentration. See more about heat equation and mathematical expressions for Euler method.
Moths seem to respond to gradients of pheromone concentration attracted towards the source, although there are other factors that lead moths sexually to pheromone sources such as optomotor anemotaxis (J. N. Perry and C. Wall , A Mathematical Model for the Flight of Pea Moth to Pheromone Traps Through a Crop). However, increasing the pheromone concentration to unnaturally high levels may disrupt male orientation (W. L. Roelofs and R. T. Carde, Responses of Lepidoptera to synthetic sex pheromone chemicals and their analogues). See more about the modeling of moth flight paths.
Using a modeling environment called Netlogo , we simulate the approximate moths behavior during the pher"

Cette expérience n’ayant pu être répété plus d’une fois, nous ne pouvons qu’être réservé par rapport à ces résultats brutes. Néanmoins différentes publications ont déjà prouvé une implantation de Mycobactérium aviumau sein des poumons, prouvant ainsi la crédibilité et la faisabilité de l’étude.
D’après les résultats ci-dessus, nous avons déterminé la signature d’un échantillon de Mycobacterium avium en cytométrie en flux (en rouge zone R1). L’image de gauche correspond au bruit de fond ou signaux parasites du cytomètre. Il aurait été cependant très intéressant de réaliser un 3e témoin, avec l’acquisition d’un échantillon de poumons de souris non infecté par M. avium.
Dans les échantillons ci-dessus, il est difficile de retrouver spécifiquement, la signature de l’échantillon de Mycobacterium. Il est aussi très difficile de distinguer une quelconque différence entre les 2 modèle murins, Nod Scid et Black 6.
L’échantillons ci-contre, ne nous permet pas de déterminer une éventuelle influence d’une tumeur sous-cutanée, sur le tropisme mycobactérien, ni même de différencier le tropisme de M. avium dans ce modèle, de ceux des autres modèles.

Cette expérience réalisée  une unique fois, n’a pas permis de répondre à nos objectifs, afin de déterminer et quantifier les tropismes de M. avium. Cependant, le manque de temps est aussi un facteur à prendre en considération. En effet, cette analyse par cytométrie en flux n’a été réalisée qu’une semaine après l’injection de M. avium dans les souris. A la lecture de différentes publications, il est intéressant de noter que les données significatives de l’implantation de M. avium dans les poumons, sont obtenues qu’après de nombreuses semaines. D’où, sans doute notre difficulté à quantifier par cytométrie, la présence du vecteur"

Purification of Protein and Interlab:
Grew up transformed bacteria that we know have our esterase gene! We grew the bacteria in 5mL overnight cultures. We used PSB1A3 + number 4 and PSB1A3 + number 6. PSB1C3 + number 5 did not grow.
Then, we added 2mL of overnight culture into 50 mL of LB AMP and we let it grow. Then, we checked the OD of our cultures so it could get to .6:
A4
.140 - 10:15
.402 - 11:15
.67 - 12:15
A6
.144- 10:15
.385 - 11:15
.740 - 12:15
We induced our four flasks. 2 were induced with 1 mM IPTG 62.5 microliter of .8 M stock. Then, 2 were not induced
After each time point of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in a shaker, we obtained 6 mL from all four flasks. We put one mL of bacteria in 4 microcentrifuge tubes from each flask. Then, we placed 5mL from all four flasks into four tubes. We centrifuges all eight tubes in centrifuge for 10 min at 400 speed to form pellets of cells. Then, the microcentrifuge tubes will be used in a gel. Then, the tubes will be frozen and later lysed and purified using a nickel column to verify the length of proteins; this will happen on another day. For now, the pellets are frozen. The group of samples that will be used for the gel will be ran on a gel another day as well.

There are only 8 of us in the picture, when the picture was taken the only female team member, Jue Wang was in Beijing for her TOEFL exam. And Shangyu Luo had been to HongKong for studying in The University of Hong Kong as exchange student. What a pity! But they will join us at igem 2010 Jamboree!
USTC has two IGEM teams this year, One wet lab team and our software team, all students majoring in biology was attracted to the wet lab team. Our team consists of students of other departments, such as Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science and so on. Thanks to our Instructors, Hao Jiang, Zhaofeng Luo. With their professional instruction, we are guided to decide the project plan, design and implementation.
About iGEM@USTC
The iGEM Team of USTC are the combination of the exact tradition of USTC and the exact vitality of the young. Rigorous daily schoolwork has provided the team members with a solid foundation of basic knowledge, and an innovative spirit enables us to stand on the frontier of the modern science.
In 2007, Jian Zhan, Bo Ding, Rui Ma, Xiaoyu Ma, Yun Zhao, Ziqing Liu and Xiaofeng Su, guided by Prof. Haiyan Liu, Prof. Jiarui Wu and Prof. Zhonghuai Hou, won the ""Best Foundational Technology Prize"" and a Gold Medal, with the project ""Extensible Logic Circuit in Bacteria"" .

Cardiff_Wales,2018,Team:Cardiff Wales#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," We found that there was expression of both reporter genes, independent of induction by ribitol, suggesting leaky expression. However, we suspect that the Agrobacterium are expressing the constructs rather than the plant.
Secondly, they suggested that we 3D print their hardware, a housing unit built for the detection system of the fungus that causes stem rust. We provided extensive details about the 3D printing procedure, and a brief review of the hardware, such as its design, how well it all fit together, and the theoretical ease of use. In addition, we also contacted a local agronomist about the design, asking what sort of role such a product could have in the UK, whether it would be useful, and whether the design seemed innovative. He gave us detailed feedback about the potential usefulness of such a product, seen in the PDF below. An image of the 3D model can also be seen below.
Figure 2. Image of the 3D printed unit for WashU. This is the housing unit for a detection system for stem rust in wheat.
Details of the whole collaboration can be seen in the embedded PDF below, which we sent to WashU. It can also be downloaded here.
In return, WashU helped extensively with the design of our wiki's navigation bar, helping to debug the system when links and the display did not function as expected. This included making the side-navigation bar functional, enabling easy navigation on smaller screens.
Warwick
Our collaboration with Warwick university began just before the UK iGEM meetup in early July. The team contacted several UK teams to ask if we could collect four water samples from the rivers in our local areas to see if they could test Legionella in the water, from different places across the country. However, instead of just providing the water samples, we collected them from specific regions from The River Taff, chosen due to the activities that occur at or near each site. We pinned the locations to a map of Cardiff, and noted the activities that occurred in each area, in case these activities could influence the sample and give them new leads to investigate. The PDF can be seen below or can be downloaded here. Initially, Warwick attempted to test the oestrogen concentration of the water, but found it was too low to detect. They also tested the water samples and attempted to isolate bacteria that may be able to break down oestrogen. No water samples from any UK teams had such genes. These water samples have enabled Warwick to conclude that catabolic pathways are rare in bacteria, even for a molecule as common as oestrogen.

Mentoring a new team from a different track : Tel Hai college
Students from Tel Hai college are going to the iGEM competition for the first time. During the month of June we met with the Tel Hai students to describe and explain all about the competition.
During the meetings and conversations over time we assisted them to understand the way to prepare towards the competition. How to begin, what to put emphasis on and where it is important to go into detail.
During the months of July to September we advised Team Tel Hai regarding dealing with the management of the competition. Providing guidelines about how they should commence, Plan and execute each step according to the competition schedules. The cooperation between us and the college students was close throughout the entire period of preparation for the competition. The meetings included close accompaniment starting by studying the idea of the cooperative competition, registering on the site, advice on fundraising, getting to know the iGEM site, important details on working with WIKI and more.
The cooperation has given us a good feeling because we, high school students, were assisting college students who are competing on a different track in the competition. Meeting with the students gave us motivation to continue working; they were grateful and very very nice.
Mini IGEM- collaboration with – BGU , Technion and Tel Hai students
This year three teams from Israel will be competing at the iGEM: One team representing Ben Gurion University, The Technion team, Tel – Hai College and us from Danciger Darca High School, Kiryat Shmona. All competitors met at the mini-iGEM at the Faculty of Biotechnology of food at the Technion. This was the reason for a meet-up with the teams from Israel. The conference was very important especially for calming emotions and excitement. The corridor chats enabled us to receive advice in many areas we were not sure about. All the senior students were very nice, tolerant and patient.

Though there are setbacks and adversity on my way, I still believe sunshine will disperse all the frog and gloom as long as I hold to my dream and never give up.
PengchengZhou
Pengcheng Zhou is a critical thinker in our team. Besides his sunny smile, he always thinks further and deeper than others, giving impressive ideas and advices. He played one of the central roles at the beginning of our project, who firstly raised the idea of weight-losing. When we were hovering in chaos in this March, his determination and decisions make us proceed. For individual reasons, he did not continue being the hero in following episodes. For now, he has left us to Australia, starting his life as an exchange student. We cherish the memory of the days we attempting together with him, and thank his contribution to WHU-China.

Brian Feng is from School of Mathematics and Statistics.
He is interested in finding the 'subtle accuracy' in qualitative questions, which is always a headache for biology student. For him, the iGEM 2012 is a best opportunity to practice his words. By taking a careful look at WHU-China 2012's program, Brian and his group members suggest to build a competition model concerning various resources and predators. At the moment, they are working really hard trying to answer the question whether it is possible to create our ideal E.coli.

Glasgow,2015,Team:Glasgow#AzureA_-_-_TEXT.html," protocol Azure A is used as a post-electrophoresis gel stain. The effect of putting it in the running buffer is unknown, other than it will definitely stain the gel-kit blue.
First, transfer the gel to a tray or container.
Glasgow team used a large clear plastic Tupperware box with a lid. A lidded container prevents accidental overflow of the stain
Azure A can stain plastics so any tray used for Azure A should not be utilised for other uses unless it has been thoroughly cleaned with 100% Ethanol.
Pour enough 1x Azure A solution into the container to cover the gel, without overfilling it.
Shake the container for 10-15 minutes, either by a low setting on a benchtop shaker, or by hand (fun)
1x stain was shown to be usable for several weeks before making up a new batch, without any demonstrable contamination issues or reduction in effectiveness.
After a 10-15min stain, DNA bands of high concentration may already be visible at this stage, but we recommend at least one round of destaining for improved visualisation.
To destain, cover the gel in the used running buffer from the gel-kit, or distilled/deionised water. Shake for 10-15 mins. The destaining solution should be  discarded into a sink drain along with running water.
Repeated rounds of destaining will improve visualisation bands of weak concentration, as demonstrated in Figure 3 above.
Band visualisation is improved by viewing the gel on a white lightbox, either inside a clear plastic staining container, or atop of a sheet of acetate to prevent staining.
Gel extraction using Azure A
Gel extraction after staining with Azure A follows the same protocol as an Ethidium bromide gel extraction, without the need to use a UV transilluminator and associated face protection. As the Glasgow team used a clear plastic Tupperware box to stain our gels, we often proceeded to place them straight on top of our benchtop lightbox after destaining and perform the gel extraction there, without having to manipulate the gel onto another surface.
Figure 4: A typical Azure A gel following extractions with a scalpel
The scalpel blade should be cleaned between sequential fragment extractions from the gel to prevent contamination. DNA extracted from gels following electrophoresis was purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit by QIAGEN. The only difference caused by use of Azure A was a change of colour not normally seen in use of the kit; after addition of yellow Buffer QG for the fragment melting stage the"

Sensynova Framework Testing (IPTG Sensor): The Results
BioBricks used: BBa_K2205009(New) , BBa_K2205012(New) , BBa_K2205015(New) , BBa_K2205016(New) and BBa_K2205018(New) .
Rationale and Aim
Biosensors, synthetic systems designed to detect and respond to a target analyte, are a common application of synthetic biology. However, the production and screening of multiple biosensor system variants is hindered by the inefficiency and specificity of the gene assembly techniques used. The production of circuit variants is important in biosensor production, as sensitivity to target molecules must be tuned.
Aim: To develop a multicellular biosensor development platform which utilises cell-mixing, as opposed to genetic re-engineering, to construct biosensor variants.
Background Information
Human Practices Quotes:
""Modularity would be a really useful aspect."" - Dr Karen Polizzi, Imperial College London ""Each generation of scientists keep reinventing the wheel."" - Dr Martin Peacock, biosensors developer
Biosensor Development. When developing biosensors, it would be useful to test multiple variants of a circuit. This is especially important in the fine-tuning of biosensor behaviour as this requires the screening of many variants to find appropriate activation thresholds for a system. Apart from the initial detection unit, many constructs used in synthetic biology based biosensors are reusable between different biosensor systems, such as fluorescent protein coding sequences or devices which amplify signals. However, these parts rarely get reused. For example"

Abstract
There are a plethora of enzymes that occur in the natural world which perform reactions that could be immensely useful to humans. Unfortunately, the efficiency of some of these reactions may render their applications impractical. The cellulosome scaffolding protein produced by Clostridium thermocellum has been shown to significantly increase the efficiency of cellulose degradation (Kataeva 617-624). It is possible that the scaffolding protein can be reduced in size and adapted for the cell surface of Escherichia coli. Different cohesion sites on the new cell surface display protein can also be introduced to allow attachment of desired enzymes. Future applications would include producing a collection of distinct versions of the scaffolding protein for unique arrangements and concentrations of enzymes, enabling construction of an extra-cellular assembly line for a variety of multi-enzymatic reactions. This would lay the foundation for making previously infeasible applications of enzymes possible through increased efficiency.
Inspiration
Tuberculosis is caused by bacterial infections of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The use of antibiotics in the treatment of tuberculosis is a double-edged sword: while curing the disease in some cases, it can also cause resistant mutants to emerge. Proper treatment of tuberculosis is typically a multi-drug regimen using first line anti-TB drugs: isoniazid, rifampin"

We say thank you to the teams TU-Darmstadt and Cologne-Duesseldorf for testing the beta versions of our gift for the iGEM community!
Preparation
To run the script, you have to install python on your device. The next step is to create the input files.     These have to look like this:
>YYYY-MM-DD
Team
Experiment (Aim/superior experimental context)
Investigators
Title (Title or main task of the experiment)
Procedure
Alternative date formats are DD.MM.YYYY and MM/DD/YYYY.  The “Team” information can be used to show the dependency of this     experiment to a certain sub team working on your project. The “Experiment” line shows the superior experimental context,     since usually multiple experiments are connected. The “Investigators” line sets the names of all involved investigators,     where it is also possible to write just the initials and replace them later automatically. The “Title” sets the title of this     experiment and is the only information visible in the collapsed format.
The “Procedure” part consists of multiple lines starting right after the “Title” line. You can write just text or add also a     minus at the beginning of each line to add bullet points. Multiple minuses for building up a hierarchy are possible, too. Be     sure to save these files with a coding in “UTF-8”, otherwise you cannot display characters like “µ” in “µl”.
Next to the main input you can provide optional dictionaries for automatic replacement of short names with full names of the     investigators and recognize keywords and create a link to your protocols. A dictionary text file is structured like this:
{""key1"" : ""substitution1"",
""key2"" : ""substitution2"",
""key3"" : ""substitution3""}
You can find more information in case of problems in the README file which comes with the other files in the ZIP file.     You can find it also here in the wiki.
Usage
To run the script, open a console and navigate via the command line into the desired folder. Then call the script.    If you are not familiar with command line tools, look in the internet how to open and use a console on your operating system.    The basic call of the script is

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," the original promoter any more. This is an example where binding changes the properties of node. Since we do not store all the possible property alterations within one part, the solution is to replace the old part with a new part that stores the correct properties.
Available nodes can be both a part on a chain or a node of binding site, which leaves a lot of possibilities in constructing complicated binding structure. Again, there are no restrictions, but parts of compartments are not suggested to appear in a binding structure.
The Basic Assumption
The basic assumption of Chain-Node Model is that a part ALWAYS carries its properties wherever it is placed in an instance of Chain-Node Model. This means no matter how complicated the complex is, you can always keep track of the location and properties of every single part. By letting complex inherits its parts’ properties, the assumption saves modelers from rewriting the structure and function of each new complex. However, we should address that the assumption is not suitable for all circumstances. For example, under this assumption, a fusion protein will carry the properties of the fused proteins, which is not true in many cases. A fusion protein may not remain its old properties and even have new properties that none of the original parts have. In this case, our suggestion is to define the fusion protein as a new part. So it is suggested that users choose different strategies of describing the same thing in Chain-Node Model base on different situations, instead of modeling everything in the same way.
Examples
With great power there must come great responsibility. In order to use the powerful Chain-Node Model correctly, please have a look at a few examples we presents.
Example of a species: E.coli cell
In MoDeL, the cell of E.coli is described as a species with only one part of E.coli(see Figure 1). Since the concept of part has been extended greatly, living cells can be described in the same way other species. Compartment belongs to “Non-sequence”, so it is suggested that E.coli only exists as a one-part-species.

Example of a species: pLacI*:LacI4 and its tree structure of binding.
Here is another example of template species with more complicated structure.(see Figure 2) In biology, LacI tetramer (or LacI4) can bind with promoter pLacI as a repressor. When bond with LacI4, pLacI is repressed and its transcription speed will decrease significantly. In order to express this alteration, as"

Overnight Culture Protocol
Agar plates with required antibiotic were taken out of 4oC to warm to room temperature.

Gel Extraction Protocol
The desired DNA fragment was excised from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
The gel slice was transferred into a microcentrifuge tube. 700 µl of Buffer QG was added.
The gel slice was incubated in a water bath at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). The tube was vortexed every 2–3 min to help dissolve gel.
After the gel slice had been dissolved completely, the color of the mixture was checked that it was yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If the color of the mixture was orange or violet, 10 μl 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0 would be added, and mixed. The color of the mixture would turn yellow.
230 µl of isopropanol was added to the sample and mixed.
A QIAquick spin column was placed in a 2 ml collection tube. The sample was applied to the QIAquick spin column and centrifuged for 1 minute. The flow-through was discarded.
500 µl of QG buffer was added to the QIAquick spin column and centrifuged for 1 minute. The flow-through was discarded.
750 µl of Buffer PE was added to the QIAquick spin column and centrifuged for 1 minute. The flow-through was discarded.
The QIAprep spin column was spun for an additional minute to remove residual wash buffer.
The QIAprep spin column was placed in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge and the DNA eluted by adding 30 µl of H2O to the QIAprep spin column and centrifuging for 1 minute.

Another emerging issue is misconceptions held by the general public. In the development of synthetic biology, as with many new technologies, there is still much to learn and discover. As a result, the information made available to the public is often not a comprehensive, accurate picture of synthetic biology.
The following are the goals that we hope to achieve through educational outreach:
1.Inform the public about synthetic biology
2.Promote an education in science
3.Showcase opportunities in the field of science
4.Create an enriched science experience for students
5.Broaden the influence of iGEM

1.2 The Events
The method that we have chosen to achieve our goals is science education. This is the avenue most accessible and familiar to us as science students. By participating in events in our community we are able to influence multiple audiences by different means. Our outreach efforts are primarily focused at young students still deciding whether to continue in the field of science, students pursing science education, and the general public. Some of the events facilitated delivering the information on a small scale (in depth discussions with one or two students) while other events necessitated speaking more generally to larger groups. The events fostered synthetic biology awareness and were great learning experiences for our team.
ESQ Partnership
ESQ ( Engineering Science Quest ) is a day camp hosted at the University of Waterloo that brings hundreds of curious young minds to Waterloo each year to learn more about science and engineering. We held two different weekly activities for campers of ages 8-9 and 12-14.
The activity for children of 8 to 9 years of age involved extracting their own DNA from their cheek cells. It was approximately an hour and a half in length, and involved not only following the outlined procedure, but also, a discussion of synthetic biology, DNA, proteins, enzymes and more. At the end of each activity, the children were allowed to keep a sealed cryovial with their extracted DNA.
The protocol for the activity, as well as the PowerPoint presentation and script associated with it, are available here.

4 Model for P170 promoter
Introduction
P170 is an acid-induced promoter. When rcfB protein is activated by lactic acid, it can bind to P170 and make it sensitive to RNA polymerase. In order to detect and control the concentration of lactic acid, we use P170 and RFP gene, which shows the relationship between lactic acid and fluorescence.

Ask Silja for origin of the enzymes for better documentation. One is from Heiko Nacke, the other from Genis. In addition the enzyme sequences can be     Blasted for identification.
Phosphatase contains PstI, which is why currently it is not compatible with biobricks. In the future the restriction sites will have to be changed, if     submission should occur (PCR modification).
Dockerins:
Heat shock transformation did not work for any of the 4 dockerins, but positive control worked fine.
Vector was cut with EcoRI and KpnI as a test and KpnI was not very efficient. Due to this the restrictions were done separately.
Next step is a ligation and a gel to verify it immediately after to find reasons for failure:
- T4 ligase working?
- Phosphorylation issues -> skip this step
- Find Plasmid formula to calculate ideal ligation ratio (depends on insert length and is usually 3:1) -> overloading the vector may cause different     ligation variants
- Can E.coli express the dockerins?
Oder dockerins as codon optimised gBlocks from IDT, as a backup.

1.) Labwork:
Enzyme 3: Transformations didn't work, so the project will be restarted from PCR stage and a new ligation.
The sequencing is also not working, possibly due to wrong primers or wrong primer concentrations.
Dockerin/Scaffoldin: both scaffoldins are at the expression stage
Dockerins in gBlocks have arrived.
Old Dockerins may not be restrictable due to missing bands around the restriction sites.
New Plasmid isolation is on the way and work will continue on the dockerins as before.
2.) 3D Model:
Debbie has checked the sequences and has the Amino Acid sequences for all enzymes, but cannot find the scaffoldin sequences. When used they result in short     fragments. Dockerins do not work either due to too many stopcodons.
Double check the files and give her new files.
3.) Human Practices:
Julian will contact people at the Xlab.
A stop motion movie is being made that simply explains our project
A talk needs to be organised around our project and synthetic biology -> Beer and Pretzels? Julian will contact some people and organise it.
Once returned from iGEM, the presenters will also present their project to the faculty at"

Horizontal Gene Transfer Inhibition
Overview
One of the main threats when releasing genetically modified organisms (GMO) in the soil is the possibility of horizontal gene transfer [1]. This is the transfer of plasmid DNA and thereby non-natural genetic content to native bacteria in the environment. Therefore, in this project a double plasmid interdependent Toxin-Antitoxin (T-A) system has been designed to stop horizontal gene transfer between our system and the native soil bacteria. Both plasmids of the designed system contain a toxin and an antitoxin. The toxin has its corresponding antitoxin on the other plasmid, making the system interdependent (Figure 1). Through this interdependence a bacterium will need both plasmids (or none) to survive. If a native soil bacterium received a single plasmid it would die. The possibility of the two plasmids to be transferred simultaneously is very improbable yet possible; however, this system makes gene transfer much less likely to occur than any other known system. An additional advantage of this system is the ability to maintain the GMO population by positive selection. As losing a plasmid is metabolically attractive for the GMO but also deadly, the system would make the population retain their plasmids.
Two sets of T-A  combinations, Kid-Kis and Zeta-Epsilon which have been studied for biosafety purposes before [2], were selected for this project. Both are type II T-A systems, meaning that antitoxin protein prevents the toxin protein from functioning by binding.

Paris_Saclay,2016,Team:Paris Saclay#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," after talking with farmers they understood their tool could not be used by farmers, and so aimed plant breeders. An other team realized they have to put more inclusiveness in their project.
iGEM Imperial members noticed how the principles changed the way they think about their project:
""Those processes shaped the way we now approach decision making during our project. They guide us through a logical, rational and societal process every time we pivot.""
And the last words to the iGEM CGU Taïwan members, who summed it up in the best way possible:
""Reflexivity makes you a good start; inclusiveness makes you a good connection; anticipation makes you a good hope.""
The question of evaluation?
Doing the test already provides a feed-back on the project. Should this feed-back be completed by an evaluation of the respect of the RRI principles? Such a tool would be useful to know where the team can improve. However the ways to respect RRI principles are diverse, and we saw teams can invent new ways to respect it every day. All of the criteria needed for an evaluation would never fit in a single evaluation, because the answers are so diverse, and new ways to address RRI principles can be invented by each team. We prefer to think the RRI Test as a helping tool for teams to think on their project, a feed-back in which they can have a look back on their choices and their compliance with RRI principles.
We would like to thank all the teams which filled the RRI Test!

Gel Shifts
According to the results we have obtained thus far, modifying native CsgA to include our selected binding domain reduces the total amount of curli that is ultimately produced by E. Coli (according to Congo Red analysis), by anywhere from 20-50%. However, the curli that is produced is stained by Congo Red, indicating that it has chemical similarity to the curli produced by wild-type cells.
Congo red assays
Congo red spin down data suggests that there is some curli fiber production in engineered constructs, however, production is much lower compared to wild type CsgA.
Colormetric assays
mRFP (BBa_E1010), aeBlue (BBa_K1033929), and amilGFP(BBa_K1033931) from team Uppsala 2011 were mixed at ratios of 10:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:10 to obtain color gradients.
Analysis
The reduction in curli production that was observed after we added binding domains to CsgA is not too great to make our system unworkable. Various methods can be used to counteract this problem, the simplest of which is to simply use a greater initial number of cells such that the desired or required amount of curli is ultimately produced. In the future, we may attempt to determine whether using linker sequences with different lengths, compositions, and 3-dimensional structures can affect the amount of curli that is ultimately produced – it is possible that the shape of the modified CsgA subunit is less optimal for the self-assembly of curli that is an important feature of our system.
Conclusion
The results of our Congo Red analysis indicate that it is possible to produce significant amounts of curli with E. coli engineered to express mutant variants of CsgA with binding domains that allow our data processing and storage system to function. Small adjustments will be made to optimize curli production and self-assembly, but we have shown that it is possible to modify CsgA in ways required for our system to function without limiting curli production to an unacceptable degree.

Primers were designed by students and produced by Eurofins. Protocol kits were obtained from Fisher Scientific, and restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs.
Yale University and the E. Coli Genetic Stock Center (CGSG)has helped by providing two strains of E. Coli which are FMJ39 and JW1228. These are the two strains where we are using to provide as hosts for our hydrogen E. Coli. Without Yale’s CGSC and the ability to mutate and knockout specific genes our project would not be able to succeed as it is a basis for our hypothesis.

Mercury Bioremediation
0 0
To design a system for biological remediation of not only mercury ions in contaminated waters, but also the more toxic form, methyl mercury, we’ve selected to use 5 genes of the mercury resistance (mer) operon of which over 10 genes have been identified and characterized in various strains of mercury resistant bacteria in the environment. This construct was assembled from the mer operon in Serratia marscecens in the plasmid pDU1358, and is designed to contain an upstream regulatory gene merR, two transport proteins merP (periplasmic) and merT (transmembrane), a gene encoding mercuric reductase MerA, and finally a gene encoding organomercurial lyase MerB. This system is regulated by a bidirectional promoter so that merR on one side of the operon is constitutively expressed and allows for the repression of the mer operon in the absence of mercury ions, and the downstream activation and transcription of merT, P, A, B when mercury ions are in close proximity.  MerT and MerP were selected as transporters for their high turnover rates to bring in mercury ions, which are subsequently bound by MerA to catalyze their conversion into volatile mercury eventually captured within a carbon filter in our device and disposed of sustainably. The organic and more toxic form, methylmercury, can diffuse into the cytosol of the bacteria where MerB catalyzes its conversion into mercury ions, which are then bound to MerA and converted into less toxic, volatile elemental mercury in an NADP dependent reaction. The system is very tightly regulated and allows for continuous turnover within our bacterial chassis as the mercury ions are volatalized and then captured externally rather than sequestered within our bacteria which would eventually lead to cell death and the requirement to replace the cells. Due to the NADP requirement of MerA, the cells are required to stay alive throughout this process, accounted for this with novel cell encapsulation technology that allows"

Data Analysis Report of
Past Human Practice Projects
Synthetic biology is a newly emerging field that has not yet been sufficiently known to the general public. Therefore, over the course of years, numerous iGEM teams have put in tremendous efforts in human practice projects to promote synthetic biology in the society. This report aims to take the human practice projects of over 700 teams in the years 2008 to 2013, thus to spotlight the change in possible trends and correlations in human practice, in terms of types of projects done, and the regions in which they are distributed. Hopefully, this report can help form an insight into how human practice has been used to as a tool to introduce synthetic biology to the society. Read on to have a look at the report, or download the complete PDF version here .
Introduction
As the iGEM headquarters put effort to bring the topic of synthetic biology close to the society, more and more attention was given to human practice. In year 2008 to 2013, there was a total of 707 teams who joined the iGEM jamboree and received medals, and a total of 1387 human practice projects were conducted.
But how well exactly has human practice developed over the years? How much attribution was made in each region? Are some types more commonly done than others? To answer these questions, HKUST iGEM 2014 team gathered all the information since the year 2008, hoping to see some correlation between regions and types of projects done, and some possible trends over the years. To facilitate better understanding, the analysis is divided into five sections, based on the criteria concerned.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," sequences that need to be aligned, that are put on the axis of the empty scoring matrix $H$. Then a series of 4 subsequent steps follows.
Step 1. At this stage a substitution matrix is chosen that includes the scores adhered to aligning and non-aligning bases (in case of nucleotide sequences as we use here). In our case we chose the substitution matrix $S(a,b)$ as follows.
$$S(a,b)=   \left\{                                                 \begin{array}{ll}                                                 1 & for & a_{i}= b_{j} \\                                                 -3 & for & a_{i}\neq b_{j}                                                 \end{array}                                                  \right.                                                  $$
To account for insertions and deletions, another input required in this algorithm is the gap extension W_n, which is the penalty for a gap with length n. The gap penalty is the point reduction for each gap in the alignment. We use an affine gap penalty, which is subdivided into a gapOpening penalty for a first gap induction, and a gapExtension penalty for every base that the gap is extended for.
$$W_{n}=C*n+D,       \,     \,\,   \, \, \,                    (C>0,D>0)$$
$$ gapOpening = D = 5$$
$$gapExtension = C = 2                                             $$
2. Constructing a scoring matrix.
Subsequently, the scoring matrix $H$ is constructed. The matrix $H$ consists of $(p+1)*(q+1)$ dimensions for sequences of length $p$ and $q$ respectively.
$$ H_{n0} = H_{0m} = 0, \,\,\,\,\,\, for\,\,\,\, 0 \leq n \leq p \,\,\, and \,\,\, 0  \leq m \leq q $$
3. Filling the scoring matrix.
The scoring matrix is filled as follows, where $H_{i-1,j-1}+s(a_{i},b_{j})$  gives the score of aligning elements, $H_{i-n,j}-W_{n}$ gives the score for aligning element $a_{i}$  at the end of a gap of length $n$, and $H_{i,j-m}-W_{m}$ gives the score for $b_{j}$ at the end of a gap length $m$. Lastly, $0$ is for elements that do now show any similarity.

    This is the first time for us to participate in iGEM. As a young team, although our current ability is limited, we still positively try to              cooperate with other teams and carry out various exchanges and activities              to propel both side of the teams better. As a new member of the iGEM family,              we are committed to the spirit of collaboration advocated by iGEM. We              cooperate with other teams in the following areas:
As a Beginner, Be a Learner.
    As the first time to participate in iGEM, we lack experience.             In order to be more effective in preparing for the competition,             we actively contacted with other excellent team, visited their             school to ask how to prepare for iGEM. These teams include: Peking, HZAU-China, HUST-China, FAFU-CHINA, WHU-China (2015).
We took photos with Peking team for memorial after the visit.
     In addition, we also participated in the 2016CCiC (Central China             iGEM Consortium), and exchanged ideas with the participants of             the 30 other teams, receiving a lot of valuable experience and advice.
All the participants took a group photo after the closing ceremony
     In view of the overall design and experimental design of the project,             we contacted with Jiang Huifeng, a researcher of Tianjin Institute             of Industrial Biotechnology of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Kang             Peng, a Proffessor of Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry CAS.             And we went to the laboratory to study the related mature theories and             experimental techniques of Blue Leaf.
As a Beginner, Be a Communicator.
  As a sponsor and the main planner, we held an innovative activity,              named ""Talk with LanZhou, Talk about iGEM"" to live online communication              with Lanzhou team. Through the web platform, our team and our audiences              whether on the spot or in front of a phone’s screen all could take part              in the exchanges with LanZhou team and their audiences. Less an hour,              our live video had already obtained more than 1,100 clicks.              For details, please click: https://"

Welcome to the world of creation and imagination!
As the world enters upon an age of human nature destructions, of resource starvation and the ignorance of ecological balance, the earth is more and more under the control of human beings, there is less room for the survival of animals, various kinds of microorganism are being killed and regenerated circulatory in laboratory.
However, there exsits a special kind of bacterial, who is too diligent to be willing to be controlled by human, they use their magic power to learn certain skills to being survived successfully. Reviewing their developmental history, their ancestors made great contribution to the world under successive human experiments. They show us the meaning of Biobrick, they grasp the ability to adapt themselves better to the outside world, they know how to realize their value furthest and greatly, they are the E.COLI!
Now let us begin the E.COLI magical mystery tour~~
Input
In order to give users a clear and definite goal on input. The whole input process is divided into two main steps: Compartment Construction and Plasmid Construction. In the first step, users only need to focus on the input of environmental condition, compartment, spatial structure of compartments, and the species contained in each compartment. In the second step, only plasmids are editable, and users can click on each of them to assemble biobricks into functional device. Of course, useful tips will be given along with your input process.
We here give a design of our user interface of input. It is under construction.

Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#Project#Promoter study_-_-_TEXT.html,"1, PYK2 and pTEF1 in glucose and acetate conditions relative the levels of pTEF1. Each sample was loaded into three different wells in the plate reader, and error bars are shown as confidence intervals with p = 0.05, using student's t-test.
The most striking feature of the results of the promoter study was the pPCK1 promoter, which showed a much higher expression when cells were grown on acetate than on glucose, which is consistent with previous studies [4]. It could be either induced by acetate or derepressed by the lack of glucose and in this study it was not determined which of the two. Another part of the results is how similar and high the activity of pTEF1 is on glucose and acetate. It further strengthens the reputation of pTEF1 as a true strong constitutive promoter. Still, the expression of the acetate induced pPCK1 is even higher than the pTEF1 expression. Therefore, pPCK1 might be a good choice for overexpression of AQR1 in acetate conditions. pGLN1 seems to be a bit stronger on glucose than on acetate. In general, a clear variation in strength between the different promoters can be seen.
The pictures taken with the fluorescence microscope are in general consistent with the data from the plate reader even though they are just a qualitative measurement of the promoter strength. A few of the pictures can be seen below in Figure 2 and 3. Figure 2 contains the pictures from the cultures on acetate, while Figure 3 is for the glucose cultures.
Fig 2. Pictures taken with fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent yeast grown on acetate with plasmids with the different promoters. All pictures are an overlay of fluorescence and bright field channels.
Fig 3. Pictures taken with fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent yeast grown on glucose with plasmids with the different promoters. All pictures are an overlay of fluorescence and bright field channels. The pictures below are not of the same cultures as the ones that are presented in figure 1. In the picture of pAQR1, the settings of the microscope are slightly different compared to the other pictures which causes a small exaggeration of the apparent fluorescence.
Conclusions
The promoter study was a great opportunity, which allowed a good choice of promoters to exchange in S. cerevisiae to moderately upregulate AQR1 and GLN1 expressions. For GLN1, the promoter pTEF1 could have been used, while pGLN1 could have been used to replace pAQR1. According to our"

Executing Part
The executing part contains  two algorithms. Here we assume the given device chain contains at most m  biobrickes.
The first one is to  inquire the probabilities of two successive biobrickes, three successive  biobrickes, four successive biobrickes and five successive biobrickes of a  given device chain. Since all the data is stored in a hash table and the access  of hash table needs O(1) time. Thus, the time complexity of this algorithm is  O(m).
The second one is to store  the given device chain. This work is done by store the two successive  biobrickes, three successive biobrickes, four successive biobrickes and five successive  biobrickes of the given device chain into the hash table. Thus, the time  complexity of this algorithm is O(m).
Hence, the time complexity  of executing part is O(m).
Note, we only need to  execute the preprocessing part once. After the execution of preprocessing part,  all the data is store in database. When using our software, users do not need  to waste their time for the preprocessing part as it has been executed.
Experimental Results
In order to test the  performance of our software, we collected about 3600 device chains from  Registry of Standard Parts, and extracted the associate relationships among  these chains. All these information are stored in our database.
Firstly, we tested the  response time of different functions of our software. Table 1 shows the results  of different query functions. The results are averaged from 10 independent  runs. From the results, we can find that all the time is really short, less  than 0.1 seconds.

We also tested the  response time of recommendation. Table 2 listed the results in terms of  different number of given biobricks. Since our software recommend biobrick  based on at most 4 biobricks’ information. Thus, the maximum number of given  biobricks is 4. These times are really short, less than 0.4 seconds. Users  could get the recommendation almost instantly. This could greatly reduce the  time used for designing"
Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," RNA society established August 1st as RNA day. Since the University of Lethbridge is home to the Alberta RNA Research and Training Institute (ARRTI), we collaborated with them to have a booth at our local farmers market that day to engage with the public. We had a great time interacting with people of all ages by teaching them about RNA, synthetic biology, and our current iGEM projects. The people we spoke with seemed very interested in the work that is occuring at the University of Lethbridge.
Whoop-Up Days
This year, both the collegiate and high school iGEM teams had a booth during Whoop-Up days, an annual carnival that takes place in Lethbridge. At this event, we interacted with members of our community about synthetic biology and our iGEM projects. We also brought along pipettes to teach people basic laboratory techniques. The individuals we spoke with were very interested in our work and we were also able to gain insight on local opinions on the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Overall, this event was a great way to connect with the public.
Education
Literature Review
During the season, one of our team members authored a related literature review titled, ""The Biomedical and Bioengineering Potential of Protein Nanocompartments"". It is an in-depth comparison of biological protein nanocages (including virus-like particles, ferritins, vaults, bacterial microcompartments, encapsulins, and more) and their wide-ranging current and potential applications in medicine and engineering. The article is currently in preparation for submission to a scientific journal later this year."

We hope that by running the workshop, we will enable anyone to form an opinion about the topic and carry out a debate.
Human Practice. - In order to determine whether we can go ahead with the DIYbio event, Yeping has been contacting health and safety personnel around UCL for advice about taking our science off UCL campus. Also, Philipp posted a debate on the TED website, in order to get opinions for the debate we are planning for our Speed Debating event.
Sponsorship. - Bethan emailed a thank you to Promega for their in-kind sponsorship, including some photos of our lab work.

Wetlab - Reinvigorating Cells. - James and Aurelija began reinvigorating our cell line - with the aim of improving their competency. There has been increasing evidence over the last two weeks that there is a declining efficiency  of transformation - with a reduction in success from 2/3 to 2/8. Outcome: Cells were ready for beginning the competency protocol on Friday
Training - Gibson Assembly - Bouran, Aurelija, Martina and Yeping attended training in Gibson Assembly protocol, to develop a strategy of how to use it in our project.
Achievement - DVICE article. - We found this afternoon that DVICE has published an article on our project on their website.
Modelling - Joanne and Aurelija met with Professor Rowley, who told them what was wrong with their degradation equation and offered to help modify and revamp it. He has also offered to help us use Excel as alternative to matlab modelling.
Human Practice. - Yeping and Philipp met the departmental GMO officer to talk about university regulations regarding the DIYbio event. It was felt necessary to before preceding to have a health and safety discussion with people from the DIYbio community at London Hackspace so they are able to set up their own health and safety framework.
Friday 13th July
Wetlab - Cell Competency. Given we have had mixed results with the competency of our cells, we decided to test their competency by transforming them with a reference plasmid of known concentration. A positive and negative control were also set up. Outcome: Cells are imcompetent - there was no colony formation. After reinvigorating their cell lines, James and Aurelija commenced the protocol to begin a new reinvigorated cell line. Outcome: Colonies appearing on minimal agar plates allowing continuation onto day two of the protocol - after weekend culture at 30 degrees"

I.Introduction
In solid media, things are not so easy as it is in the liquid media. In this case, the bacteria are not mixed at once. Besides, we have to consider the influence of the initial position of each bacterium. Like the situation in liquid media, now for solid media, we still have three characters, the farmers, the warriors and the beggars. And the cute bacteria still face the severe war against another battalion. Now let us learn more about them.
Farmers are aimed to produce resources for all the bacteria. In our experiment, the ‘farmer’ bacteria can generate glucose; while in our online game, they can produce food for others to make their lives. But be careful, your farmer’s food can also be eaten by the enemies so you need to take care of where to initialize them.
Warriors’ skill is to kill enemies. No matter what the enemy is, your brave warriors can kill both farmers and beggars from the enemy troop and can fight against your enemy’s warriors as soon as they meet. But these little combatants can’t make a living without the food from farmers so you have to initialize them within the nutrition range around farmers.
Beggars are so lazy that they just sit around doing nothing. They don’t produce food so they have to rely on farmers. Also, they are not part of the military force so they kill ‘nobody’.

ZJU-China,2015,Team:ZJU-China#Practices#Application#Application Scenarios#first_-_-_TEXT.html," feel like it and expect them to work. Apply nematodes at dawn or dusk, because high levels of ultraviolet rays from the sun can kill them.
Storage and Handling
You need to use live nematodes as soon as possible for maximum efficacy, because they have a limited shelf life. Be careful with storage conditions, though, because extreme temperatures may kill nematodes or render them ineffective.
Environmental Conditions
Nematode effectiveness against insect pests also depends on a number of environmental conditions. Adequate moisture is the most important -- nematodes need water to move and find host insects. If they become dry, they could die.
Results and Cost
Nematodes do their work under the soil surface, gardeners don't see dead insect bodies, making efficacy hard to measure. Improved plant health may take up to 30 days to occur. For stubborn infestations, it needs to repeat the applications, which can eventually result in increased costs over chemical controls.
Boric acid
It's one of the most effective ways to kill the insects. This natural insecticide shuts down their nervous system and dehydrates them. Spray or coat wood with boric acid. Place boric acid bait stations in your garden and/or at home. Check them regularly and replenish with boric acid.
Disadvantage
Boric acid can be useful as an insecticide, disinfectant, and flame retardant. It‘s fairly safe, but may not be very effective. It can be absorbed through and damage the mucous membranes; also harmful to the kidneys and liver.
OUR ADVANTAGES
In order to attract termites successfully, deliver the packed and carried by chemical agents. This novel way of insecticide delivery create an eco-friendly model to eliminate pests and can be directly applied to other pest control projects.
As our purpose is to control termites which do great harm to people' houses, we can bring the result of the project into production. The business outlook is considerably broad because our project is environmentally friendly and closely associated with people's daily life. Those who have suffered from termite invasion might accept the product easily for the dramatic insecticidal effect and non-ecological influence.
We take advantage of synthetic biology to improve the drug production, cut the industrial cost of the drug and even save the purification process, which will make it more convenient for utilization of the drugs. We offer not only a whole system for killing pests, but also a referable model that uses nano size chemicals to pack bacteria for biomedicine, food manufacturing and cosmetic industry.

Improvement of pre-existing parts
We created a new part inspired and building on the function of the BBa_K1094400 part from the 2013 Copenhagen team , the BBa_K376004 part from the 2010 Penn State team , and the BBa_K660004 part from the 2011 Glasgow team . You can find the full method and results here .
Australian iGEM Meet Up
Thanks to the kind efforts of the University of New South Wales iGEM team, we met at their university with the iGEM teams from UNSW and Macquarie and collaboratively shared ideas by listening to the progress of each team. Ideas were exchanged and teams discussed potential avenues via which they could help each other with either research or outreach efforts. We were then treated with a good old Aussie BBQ and drinks and got to know each other better. We would like to thank UNSW iGEM 2015 again for organising the meet up and treating us with great food.
Eindhoven, Netherlands: Golden Gate Collaboration
We contributed to the Eindhoven cloning guide through submitting information on Golden Gate Cloning. This was a valuable experience as it allowed us to collaborate with other teams using the same protocol and share our knowledge. We are confident that the guide Eindhoven creates will be extremely useful, of an exceptionally high quality, and invaluable to future iGEM teams. You can see a summarised version of our Golden Gate contribution here .
ParisBettencourt, France: Rhizi platform
We, along with numerous other iGEM teams utilised Paris Bettencourt's Rhizi platform. This was extremly useful in finding other team working on similar projects or using similar techniques. We are thankful to the Bettencourt team for creating this platform and are sure it will be incredibly beneficial to future iGEM teams.

NWU-China,2018,Team:NWU-China#Intergrated_-_-_TEXT.html," natural saline-alkali land is a severe problem. Because natural soil can’t provide bacteria a suitable growth environment.
While our project was caught in helpless, Prof. Li gave us a train of thought that we can change our sight from soil into water. Modified bacteria has higher rate of survive in water than soil, and it’s easy to reproduce. If we use this method to decline the salt of sea water or cleanse the wasted and polluted industrial water, there will be a huge environment benefit and economic benefit.
Thanks to the points Prof. Li gave, our direction of project had changed a lot. The aim had changed from soil into soil and water conservation and our benefits became larger. At last, Prof. Li expressed great support and expectation to our project and he wished us a great grades in Jamboree."

Conjugation efficiency as a function of gr.
Conjugation efficiency as a function of λ.
These plots show that care must be taken when comparing conjugation efficiencies from different tests. Attempts should be made to minimize the differences in conjugation efficiency to to differences in testing parameters. This dependence of the conjugation efficiency on the intensity was noticed during conjugation testing .
Signal Propagation
The animation below shows a simplistic view of a signal plasmid propagating outwards in a lawn of cells. The conjugation timing values are based on values given in [11, 12]
This estimate ignores the effect of cell division on the propagation speed. The predicted speed (8 to 20 μm/hr) is less than the speed of radial expansion of a colony (20 to 60 μm/hr). This implies that the signal propagation will have two modes:
When a colony of cells containing the signal plasmid is growing. The signal plasmid will be directly transmitted to the daughter cells when the cell divides. In this mode the signal will propagate at the speed of the radial expansion of the colony (gr).
When the edge of a donor/transcojugant colony meets the edge of a receiver colony the signal will slow down to the rates given in the animation above. The primary means of propagation in this mode is conjugation not cell expansion.
The animations below look at the effect of spatial restrictions on the propagation of the signal. Here a single initiator cell is plated along with 10,000 receiver CFU. Note that this is not the propagation of the signal itself, but merely the growth in the channel available for the signal to propagate through. The model will be able to show signal propagation once the delay time mentioned in Assumption #5 is implemented.

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

miniTn7BB derivatives
Construction of additional miniTn7BB derivatives
The modular nature of the miniTn7BB-Gm minitransposon and the presence of appropriate restriction sites allows the easy generation of variants with new traits. We have focused on two lines: the construction of variants with different drug resistance markers and the development of miniTn7BB derivatives containing BioBrick parts suitable for specialized functions.
Derivatives with alternative drug resistance markers
Bacterial species show diverse degrees of sensitivity to antibiotics. Drug resistance markers that support efficient selection in one bacterium may not be suitable for others. To facilitate the generation of miniTn7BB transposons bearing a variety of antibiotic resistance genes, the Gm resistance cassette in miniTn7BB-Gm was flanked with duplicated NcoI and SphI sites, which are absent in the rest of the transposon and the delivery vectors. Marker replacement is achieved by (i) digestion of a miniTn7BB-Gm delivery plasmid with either SphI or NcoI, (ii) PCR amplification of the new drug resistance marker with primers bearing sites for the same restriction enzyme, (iii) digestion of the PCR product with the indicated enzyme, (iv) ligation of the cleaved plasmid and PCR product, (v) transformation in a suitable E. coli strain, selecting resistance to the new antibiotic, and (vi) scoring for loss of the Gmr marker. Using this method, we have successfully constructed pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Km, a kanamycin-resistant (Kmr) variant of pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Gm; obtaining the Kmr cassette from pSB4K5. A"

Rice,2016,Team:Rice#Humans Of Syn Bio_-_-_TEXT.html,"ky PCR results, to those larger problems with meaningful implications that you’re working towards solving, like discovering how blood vessels form in tumors. Synthetic biology presents an exciting way to tackle an astonishing variety of problems because it’s often limited only by the imagination. “Do you have anything else to say to the post reader?” “I don’t think so.” “Okay, good.” ”

“Every high schooler learns the basics of biology. I remember making paper plasmids and isolating DNA from strawberries. When I got to Rice, I realized that I had the tools all along, but I wasn’t familiar with combining them until I learned about SynBio through BIOC lab and iGEM. SynBio is like microbiology engineering. (I’d actually be open to majoring in that.) And engineering is about design. I’ve always loved design because it’s such a versatile brain teaser whether that be graphic, product, or plasmid design. My classmates actually question why I’m not an engineer since I’m interested in entrepreneurship and designing things, but I don't want to stray too far away from biology. SynBio allows me to be a wannabe engineer, and who knows what ideas I’ll be able to come up with? To every “STEM"" person, I urge you to be open to ""non-STEM"" endeavors. In an increasingly interdisciplinary world, there are so many ways to explore all your interests.”

""What is Synthetic biology? In a nutshell it is currently sitting where computer science was in the late 80's, on the cusp of revolutionising society and culture. My first impression was just that it's a new field with masses of potential, the next big medium through which society will evolve. In the future, biotech can tap into the power of enzymes and be used for cleaner, more efficient industrial processes. For instance, our current iGEM project is trying to engineer the bacteria Shewanella oneidensis to produce hydrogen when fed electrons using hydrogenase enzymes, this can be used as a new energy storage mechanism. This is just one of the new applications through which we can use synthetic biology. Evolution has created this massive diversity of incredible innovations, we just have to put them together and reform them for our purposes.""

NPU-China,2018,Team:NPU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Prof. Gu on the academic significance and possible specific applications of                         simplifying                         the                         mitochondrial genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its de novo synthesis, and he was quite                         pleased to                         learn that                         we were designing and synthesizing the minimal mitochondrial genome. He positively confirmed                         the                         remarkable                         significance of our project, maintaining that the simplified design of the mitochondrial genome                         and                         its                         de novo                         synthesis are, till now, a field that entails further exploration. Chances are great that the                         research                         like this                         will provide a new engineered idea for the study of mitochondrial genes and their functions, as                         well as                         the                         treatment of diseases related to mitochondria. There is a high possibility to create a minimal                         model                         chassis,                         providing a new yet reliable reference for the researches in relevant fields.
Prof. Gu further said that with regard to mitochondrial research, the current method is only to                         knock                         out or add                         some certain genes. However, even such seemingly simple requirements have high operational                         difficulty                         in practical                         experiments. Even with the Crispr-Cas9 method, rapid and simple gene editing will not be that                         easy.                         On                         the one                         hand,                         it is difficult to express Cas9 protein in mitochondria, yet the use of a guide peptide to                         deliver                         Cas9                         protein in                         cytoplasm is also not satisfactory. On the other hand, the difficulty of screening caused by                         multiple                         copies of                         mitochondria results in a low success rate at the same time.
It is a very convenient way to use the characteristics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that it can                         survive                         in a                         reducing                         carbon source medium in the absence of a mitochondrial genome to deliver the entire de novo                         synthesized                         genome                         directly into the mitochondrial membrane. Of course, this also requires high-quality genomic                         DNA                         and                         efficient                         delivery methods.
Prof. Gu professed that he had long had plans to do this work. He has unique experience and                         skills                         in                         mitochondrial                         genome delivery technology, and we were more than glad that he expressed his willingness to                         offer                         us                         technical                         support in the late genome delivery.

In designing the minimal S. cerevisiae mitochondrial genome, Prof. Gu suggested that we add a                         GFP                         reporter module                         to                         this minimal genome, which should make it easier to know if the genome's transcriptional                         translation                         system is                         working properly and also more vivid to display the results, rendering the project fancier.
