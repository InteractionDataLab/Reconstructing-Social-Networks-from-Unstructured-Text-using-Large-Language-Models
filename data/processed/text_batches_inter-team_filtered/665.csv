Evry_Paris-Saclay,2017,Team:Evry Paris-Saclay#Bioproduction_-_-_TEXT.html,"icose has already been presented in the literature but the yields are still too low for cheap industrial production ( Rare Sugar Bioproduction ). This is why we want to improve the bioproduction by selecting the best epimerase.
Figure 1. Reversible epimerization between D-Psicose and D-Fructose.
For that we must set up our bioproduction conditions to ensure that we are able to produce psicose. This part will focus on the insertion of an epimerase in a strain of Escherichia coli and then optimization and quantification of the bioproduction.
The D-Psicose 3-Epimerase
Since we wanted to use a D-psicose 3-epimerase (Dpe) to produce psicose we had to learn about its structure and kinetic properties. For this, we collaborated with iGEM Aix-Marseille who have a team of skilled bio-informaticians who were able to characterize our enzyme.
The Dpe from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (UniProt ID A9CH28) is the enzyme that converts fructose into psicose and the reverse by changing the configuration of the C-3 stereogenic center [3]. This enzyme requires cofactors such as Mn2+ or Co2+ for optimal activity, although it has a low basal activity without ions. Dpe from other bacteria can have different cofactors. This Dpe shows a tetrameric arrangement of 132 kDa, and each subunit has 289 amino acids with a molecular weight of 33 kDa [4]. The topology of each subunit is a TIM-barrel fold with a cluster of eight β-strands surrounded by twelve α-helices (figure 2).
Figure 2. Cartoon representation of A. tumefaciens Dpe (PDB: 2HK0). A) each subunit in a different color. B) One subunit in blue, with the β-strands shown in red.
The active site is located in the central cleft of the subunit, where there is a metal-binding site. As shown in figure 3, a Mn2+ ion is bound with octahedral coordination by four residues (E150, D183, H209 and E244) and two water molecules. The conformational change between the apo- and holo-enzymes is minimal (RMSD of 0,6 Å for the α-backbone after superimposing the backbone of the tetramers), so the binding of the substrate does not produce any large structural changes"

Aims
• Chose a method of cell immobilisation.
• Design final biosensor based on consumer needs.
Development:
• Initial sketches were done.
• iGEM Hamburg rendered our plate and 3D printed it for us.
Outcomes
• A latex nanoporous coating method on a paper base was chosen.
• A fruit sticker, industrial sticker, and plate design were all chosen as the final designs.
Impact
• Biosensor strips will be biodegradable.
• Interactions with other systems evaluated.
Overview
KEEP FRESH embodies the final biosensor device. The SENSE and EXPRESS elements were first assembled in a plasmid so the function of the overall biocircuit could be tested. Following this, various engineering considerations such as selectivity and specificity were taken into account, along with government policies surrounding GMOs, to design a feasible product with viable real-life applications. APPLIED DESIGN follows the technology and design selection process, and evaluates the impact of the biosensor on the environment.
Biocircuitry: final construct
Circuitry
Once the SENSE and EXPRESS elements of our project were optimised, the final task was to assemble them together as a final construct to create the biosensor circuitry. The genetic function of the biosensor acts like a circuit, as can be seen in the plasmid diagram below.
Activation of the biosensor occurs when the SENSE elements are switched on in the presence of ethylene. EtnR2 binds to ethylene and causes the phosphorylation of EtnR1. This complex binds to promoter DNA to also activate transcription of downstream DNA. In this circuit, the EXPRESS part of the system encapsulates this downstream segment. The expression of amilCP causes a visually perceivable colour change from white to blue. KEEP FRESH uses this circuit as the core of the biosensor device.

Valencia_Biocampus,2014,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," model should come from cell mechanisms independent on parameters of the Biobricks (promoter strength, ...). Quite on the contrary, the comparison of theoretical predictions and experimental results at larger        temperatures show that our model has not yet captured the dependence of the magnitude of the decrease in activity with the Biobrick parameters.
Standardization We have built an app that computes the standardization-stability index and generates a promoter sequence for a given expression rate.       Our wet-lab results show that Biobrick 5 is the most standard one. Our model predicts that systems with less modules or factors will be the more stable and standard. Biobrick 5 has a tetracycline depending promoter, whose limitating step is the binding of tetracycline to TetR. In this scenario, the intracellular concentration of aTc and the binding to the TetR repressor do not depend on the strain, so there is only one factor in which the strain could have an important effect: the TetR intracellular concentration, which has a constitutive expression. Analyzing the other Biobricks, we found that the strains with less expression in the constitutive promoter are those ones with higher expression when we use the Ptet promoter (but JM109 and BB1), which agrees with our prediction.
Orthogonality We have studied deterministic and stochastic models of the plasmid growth to learn about the unspecific interaction between two plasmids in a cell. We found that this system is unstable and the only way to keep the plasmid levels is by introducing a resistance. However, it is not a good way to maintain those levels: bacteria which have non-desired levels of plasmids are killed. This leads to a lower yield. Also, there is an important variability, which can drive the system away from the expected behavior.       In conclusion, plasmids with an identical origin of replication are not orthogonal per se. Although we can introduce use different resistances to tune the system, it may not behave as expected due to a great variability. As a solution, we could use plasmids with different replication mechanisms, but they could show different dynamics, making the system even more difficult to control. Therefore, new plasmids must be designed to make engineered cells more reliable and predictable, in order to progress in synthetic biology.
Open License We have modeled the susceptibility to patent a human creation and define the factors that influence it. Inventive is the most relevant variable but it is regulated by the industrial application. The highest inventive step can be reduced by almost a factor 2 with the lowest industrial application.

Falling walls is a yearly science event in Berlin where researchers can tell how their walls breaks the  walls of humanity’s big problems. The day before the Falling walls conference, the falling walls lab is  organized, where young researchers can present their work. Speakers get three minutes to tell the  audience about their project, and convince them of its importance.
Andries went to the qualifying round in Groningen where he won us the first prize. After the iGEM  finale in Boston, he will fly back to Amsterdam, take the train to Berlin, and tell a large international  audience about our bandage on November 8.

Introduction
In North America, an estimated 18.7 trillion gallons of wastewater is generated each year and only 75% is treated [1].
Sources of Pollution
Pollutants contaminate water from point sources, non-point sources such as agriculture, sanitary sewer overflows, combined sewer overflow, stormwater runoff, and erosion of contaminated soil [2]. The following figure shows an example of phosphorus from fertilizer in agricultural fields could reach water [4].
Figure 1:Phosphorous can reach water through various avenues from its use in fertilizer.
Treatment
Wastewater goes through multiple levels of treatment (shown in the following figure from reference 2).
Figure 2: Overview of wastewater treatment
The first level removes coarse debris and solids. The second level of treatment focuses more on disinfecting the wastewater. Tertiary treatment does additional treatment, including the removal of nutrients [2]. Raw domestic wastewater usually has an average of 6 to 8 mg/L average total phosphorus concentration. After conventional secondary treatment, the average total phosphorus concentration is “routinely reduced to 3 or 4 mg/L.” Using Enhanced Biological Nutrient Removal (ENBR), total phosphorus concentrations can “often” be reduced to .3 mg/L or less. “Recent studies report finding that WWTPS [wastewater treatment plants] using EBNR also significantly reduce the amount of pharmaceuticals and healthcare products from municipal wastewater, as compared to the removal accomplished by conventional secondary treatment.” [3].

ATOMS-Turkiye,2014,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#BioBricks_-_-_TEXT.html," study found that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) had a decrease in oxidative stress, including glutathione oxidation and lipid peroxidation, when xanthine oxidase was inhibited using allopurinol. (Heunks et al. 1999) Oxidative stress can be caused by hydroxyl free radicals and hydrogen peroxide, both of which are byproducts of XO activity. (Higgins et al. 2009)
Kappa-B Respond Element (kB-RE)
After removing the clot, we need an additional sensor system to compensate the hypoxia response elements transcription rates for antioxidant enzymes and proteins. Thus, we targeted to sense the ROS presence to conduct an efficient and swift solution.
Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) is a transcription factor complex of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alfa (HIF-1α) protein, which consists of two subunits, p50 and p65. This peptide is detained in cytoplasm by a complementary peptide called IkB. (Kabe et al. 2005) This detention prevents the activation of related promoter sequence existing in the cell nucleus which is named kappa-B response element (kB-RE).
In some circumstances, NF-kB/IkB complex can be separated by external effects such as radiation, cellular stress, pathogens, inflammation etc. In this case, NF-kB can enter into nucleus and integrate with compatible kB-RE sites in order to initiate transcription. (Gilmore  2006)
It is later described that one of these stimulants is the presence of ROS. (Bonello et al. 2007) We want to use this advantage to design a novel ROS inducible promoter in human cells in iGEM to be able to sense oxidative stress.
Reactive oxygen species(ROS) are effecting NFKB proteins and then this effection inducing Kappa ß response element(our ROS inducible promoter called KBRE) to product our antioxidant therapy proteins
Composite Parts
As a full designed system, we aim to combine our parts to gain maximum efficiency and robustness. We can categorize our parts into two classes: sensor genes and activist proteins.
HRE, ODD and kB-RE parts are sensor genes to detect hypoxia and ROS presence, respectively. As we predict that the yield of our activist proteins must continue constitutively to conduct a successful treatment, we want to combine our all activist proteins with our sensor genes.

There are rumors. People say things – see things – around our labs. Blonde-haired apparitions float in and out of the corners of our eyes. Visions of a gentle smile flash through team members’ minds. Perfect gels appear on the countertop, and despite the immaculate labeling, no one knows who ran them. One team member, who wishes to remain anonymous, says that on one quiet lonely afternoon as he walked by one of the sinks, he noticed it was dirty, caked with mud and beakers strewn about. Since he was the only one in the lab at the time, he decided to clean it up, but when he turned to look at the sink again, it was completely cleaned! There is agreement among the team that something … else lurks in our workspace. We’ve taken to calling our mysterious helper “Ryan” (the name just seemed to fit). We don’t know what it is or what it wants, but we do know our project wouldn’t be half as well done without it.

Collaboration with Oxford
To strengthen the sense of iGEM community, we contacted University of Oxford iGEM team to discuss the possibility of collaboration between our teams. The Oxford project aims to develop a system that can dispose of the carcinogenic, hazardous solvent dichloromethane (DCM). To do this, Oxford team has proposed the use of the DcmA enzyme. This enzyme degrades DCM to form a toxic intermediate which in turn is converted by another enzyme, FdhA, into a neutral molecule. Schematically this can be presented in the following way:
Reaction 1: DCM + DcmA -> toxic intermediate
Reaction 2: toxic intermediate + FdhA -> neutral product.
The problem for their system lies in bringing the two enzymes together to ensure efficient reaction kinetics. An idea that we discussed with Oxford was to use the star peptide platform to link the two enzymes together, in a structure similar to the following:
We worked with Oxford to study this system from a theoretical standpoint. Our team studied the 3D structure of both enzymes involved to confirm that the enzyme could in theory be"

Overview
We have improved the existing part BBa_K2332021 , which was submitted by iGEM17_UCL, using our new part, BBa_K2819103 . We hoped to understand the dynamic characteristics of the blue light repressible promoter (PBLrep) better as it has a pivotal role in our project. The existing part has a bioreporter, the coding region of the bioreporter, LuxCDABE. However, the large gene cluster (>5500bp) makes it difficult to carry out dynamic characterization due to its complexity. Furthermore, no characterisation data is available on iGEM17_UCL’s part registry page for the blue light repressible promoter BBa_K2332019 .
Therefore, our team sought to conduct a study on PBLrep by using a more suitable reporter. We altered the sequence of this composite part by replacing the LuxCDABE coding region with a commonly used reporter gene, the red fluorescent protein (RFP, ~700bp), as well as attaching different degradation tags to the reporter gene to study the characteristics of this promoter. Furthermore, this new part will have wider applications compared to the previous part, such as by serving as an indicator. As the overall plasmid size is reduced significantly, it is now easier for users to co-transform it with other constructs.
Our new part: Blue Light Activated Repressible Promoter with RFP Reporter attached to YbaQ Degradation Tag
This part contains a promoter that can be repressed by blue light (450 nm). The promoter makes use of a blue light dependent DNA-binding protein, EL222. Irradiation by blue light exposes the hitherto sequestered HTH, facilitating dimerization of EL222 and subsequent DNA binding. Repression is achieved by placing the DNA binding site of EL222 between the -35 and -10 hexamers of the consensus promoter in E. coli, creating the blue light repressible promoter PBLrep As a result, EL222 acts"

As mentioned before, deacetylases target different units in a chitin molecule. Which unit is deacetylated depends on the chosen enzyme. In the case of COD, the second position from the non-reducing end is deacetylated  [2]   [4]   [9] . If both enzymes – COD and NodB – are active at once we are able to create a deacetylation pattern involving the first two units.
In contrast to NodB, COD does not deacetylate chitosan twice, after long incubation periods  [2] .
CODs catalytic part is its N-terminal domain, while the other two domains make up carbohydrate-binding molecules. The catalytic domain correlates to a carbohydrate esterase domain (CDA)  [4] .
Figure 10. Structure of COD. Structural data from RCSB PDB. A 3D simulation of the enzymes molecular structure.  [11]
Mechanism
COD deacetylates the second N-acetyl-D-glucosamine unit (GlcNAc) of the non-reducing end  [2] , thus generating acetic acid and D-glucosamine (GlcN).
Figure 11. Mechanism of COD. The enzyme deacetylates at the second position of the non-reducing end.
Methods
We ordered the cod gene via IDT sequencing and inserted this gene into the pSB1C3 vector through a BioBrick system and verified this via sequencing.  The cod was fused to a T7-promoter  (BBa_I719005) . The vector includes the RBS  BBa_K2380024 .

For fermentation
The first device we build is for the fermentation; we want to execute any escaped engineered bacteria from the fermenter, whether the escape happened accidentally or intentionally. We used two environment factors to monitor the bacteria’s situation: temperature and population density, thet are both high and tunable in the fermenter, so our device will initiate when temperature and density are both low. We used thermal sensitive regulator (NUS iGEM2017)(Piraner et al.) and quorum sensing regulator (MIT iGEM2004) (Canton et al.)as our sensor, with sRNA(Storz et al.) and tetR family repressor PhlF(Glasgow iGEM2015)(Stanton et al.) as the signal inverter. We added an integrase (Peking iGEM2017) controlled by the thermal sensitive regulator which will enable the promoter of a lethal gene to potentially express when temperature rise in the fermenter so that bacteria can survive at the very beginning. Also, we built a model to stimulate the minimum autoinducer required at the beginning of the fermentation, same as the purpose of integrase. This model is for keeping bacteria alive at the very beginning of fermentation. Together they form a NOR gate that will lead to cell death through genome degradation when both temperature and density decrease.
For Therapy
The second device we build is for therapeutic bacteria. The device can carry out noninvasive tracing through ultrasound imaging of the gas vesicle(Shapiro et al.), release the drug (from SHSBNU 2017) controlled by a thermosensitive regulator at nidus by ultrasound tissue heating, and heat to a higher temperature to release nuclease and kill the bacteria after it finishes its mission.
For Metabolic Stress
We applied capacity monitor (Ceroni et al.) to quantify the expression burden of all our systems, and to reduce the metabolic stress, we designed another device for fermentation which used a LuxR repressive promoter (Peking iGEM2011) and cold-regulated 5’UTR region (Ionis Paris 2017). This device only involves one transcriptional regulator, which will be less energy consuming.

The lack of sufficient training and efficient surveillance will be a time bomb for which we do know that monstrous harmful bioproducts will be made someday in the future, and"

METU-Ankara,2011,Team:METU-Ankara#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"     the definition of “protein generators”.
For Protein Generators:
PartID: BBa_J45299
PartName: PchA & PchB enzyme generator
The part which is illustrated above actually fits the definition     for “composite part” but in part registry it is classified as protein     generator. This part can be functional but it needs a promoter. Even     though this part is not functional and is not capable of producing protein,     part registry assigns this product as protein generator. We suggest     that all parts in the registry, which are composed of more than one     atomic part and which are not functional on their own but can be functional,     should be classified as “composite parts”.
For Reporters:
PartID: BBa_J04451
PartName: RFP Coding Device with an LVA tag
This functional part is classified as “Reporter” in the parts registry     database. It is very clear that this part fits the same description     as Protein Generator in Biobrick part registry standards. Although,     this part has specific and known functional role, characterizing this     part as a reporter is unnecessary and contributes to the level of complexity     of information provided. Instead, we suggest that this part should be     classified as “protein generator” and related detailed information about     the specific function of this part, should be provided in the part information     page.
In conclusion, as mentioned above we tried to reorganize and normalize     the information about parts which is provided in part registry for 2010     in order to develop our algorithm for the BioGuide application. During     this process, we encountered some inconsistencies and misuses of the     terminology being used and also inadequacies about the information provided     about parts. First of all, we claim that a standard nomenclature should     be constituted for future use in the field of synthetic biology. Based     on the information gathered according to new nomenclature a professional     database should be constructed to address the needs of synthetic biology.     This will enable easy information exchange and exhibition globally.     Secondly, although there are enough information about parts exists on     parts registry database, the information which is provided for parts     need to be ordered urgently. Furthermore, there should be new experimental     standards which must be introduced to groups in the part submission     process for the subtitle “working condition”. These experimental standards     will be important because the experimental details about parts are not     satisfying the needs of wet-lab biologists for the design and the construction     of new Biobricks.

The phage therapy and bacteriophages are a serious alternative at antibiotics that are less and less efficient against bacterium that is why there are often used in iGEM competition to solve problems. At this occasion, iGEM Grenoble-Alpes worked with two teams, iGEM Nottingham and iGEM LMU & TU Munich .
Collaboration with iGEM Nottingham:
iGEM Nottingham  developped the Clostridium dTOX project. The goal was to use phages to avoid the toxicity of a bacterium which causes diarrheas in hospital sector. iGEM Grenoble-Alpes collaborated with them on the phages/bacteria interaction modeling .
Working with Nottingham on the study of the toxin released by bacteria depending on the strain (C.difficile, C.jejuni), on the initial bacteria and phages quantities and on the analysis delay helped us implementing our own modeling.
Collaboration with iGEM LMU & TU Munich:
We worked with T5 phages and their host E. coli F during our experiments. To help the iGEM team in their Phactory project, we sent them T5 bacteriophages (at around 108 pfu/mL) and freeze-dried E.coli F !

When MLS is added to the N-terminus of GFP, the GFP was directed to the mitochondria in the cells, giving patches of GFP signal that overlapped with the signals from MitoTracker®. When MLS is not added to the GFP, the GFP signal can be seen scattered all around inside the cell. Scale bar = 10µm.
Figure 2. Scatter plots of fluorescence intensities of green (y-axis) and red (x-axis) by construct. It showed that the BioBrick MLS-GFP and commercial MLS-GFP construct had a linear relationship of green intensities and red intensities while the GFP generator alone had no relationship. Pearson's correlation coefficient (rp) and Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs) were determined using the Pearson-Spearman correlation colocalization plugin (French et al., 2008) for ImageJ with a threshold of 0 and listed for each image.
Figure 3. Calculated mean Pearson's (rp) and Spearman's (rs) correlation coefficients for each construct. The coefficients were generated using ImageJ software and specific plugins. For every batch of transfected cells, four samples were used for quantification. Experimental BioBrick MLS-GFP and commercial MLS-GFP: coefficients were close to 1, good colocalization; GFP: Coefficients were close to 0, poor colocalization. Error bars show standard deviation.
CMV Promoter ( BBa_K1119006 )
Introduction
For this promoter's characterization we assembled it with GFP reporter ( BBa_K648013 ) and hGH polyA terminator ( BBa_K404108 ). The Pcmv-GFP was then transfected into HEK293FT cells and the in vivo green fluorescence signal was observed under confocal microscope. The positive control was pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) that contains CMV promoter and EGFP reporter. The negative control was the same as the experimental construct, but minus the promoter. The detailed protocols employed for our characterization work can be accessed through the link.

An Overview and History
The Malaria-causing parasite, Plasmodium, has been at war with mankind for as long as about 10,000 years ago when human settlements and agricultural advances were starting to develop. References have been made to the disease’s recurrent symptoms in Ancient Chinese scripts, by Hippocrates and by the Romans. In fact, the term malaria originates from Medieval Italian: mala aria or ""bad air"". Prior to this, the disease was called ague or marsh fever due to its association with swamps and marshland, places that contain stagnant water where mosquitoes can breed.
Symptoms and lifecycle of Plasmodium:
Symptoms typically include:
Fever
Fatigue
Vomiting
Headaches
And in more severe cases:
Yellow skin
Seizures
Coma or death
Transmitted typically by the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito, the parasite is lodged into the liver via the bloodstream. The symptoms show ten to fifteen days after being bitten and, over the course of time, may be recurrent if not treated. The life cycle of Malaria can be shown in the following simplified diagram:
Epidemiology
Malaria is currently prevalent in a broad band around the equator, in regions of South America, many parts of Asia, and majority of Africa;  85–90% of malaria fatalities occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.
An estimated 3.3 billion people are at risk of malaria. Of these, 1.2 billion are said to be at high risk. In high-risk regions, more than one malaria case occurs per 1000 people. Even though malaria was one of the first infectious diseases to be treated with a pharmaceutical drug, scientists are still looking develop quicker and more effective cures.
A disease of poverty
Malaria is involved in a nasty feedback loop with poverty. It is not only the result of poverty but is also a contributor to poverty. The WHO notes that
Malaria has significant measurable direct and indirect costs, and has recently been shown to be a major constraint to economic development. Annual economic growth in countries with high malaria transmission has historically been lower than in countries without malaria.
Economists believe that malaria is responsible"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM.

Aims of the Week
Monday 17th September
Hackspace Day 1 - Martina, Leonard and Yeping worked with William, Tonderai and Simon. Philipp took lots of pictures! We attempted genomic DNA extraction from our marine bacteria Oceanibulbus Indolifex using Qiagen QIAamp DNA Mini Kit. In the afternoon, we attempted to PCR genes antifreeze and mercury reductase.
LMU Munich Collaboration - Aurelija skyped with Simon and Julia from iGEM Munich (LMU).
Hackspace Exhibition - Philipp and Howard met today to find a location for our exhibit.
Tuesday 4th September
Hackspace Day 2 - The hackers, Yeping and Martina ran a second gel today as well as doing PCR.
The modellers venture into the lab - Shockingly, this is Erin and Joanne’s first time in the lab!  They made up some plates for a nuclease experiment which would inform their predictive models.  Their overriding impression of lab work is that agar smells really bad.

Interview with UNC"
Colombia,2014,Team:Colombia#Deterministic_-_-_TEXT.html," our expressions on the model that Liu et al. developed in 2012. LuxU and LuxO are both involved in enzymatic reactions 2-5, both are produced by a constitutive promoter at a rate a_u and a_o respectively, and each molecule has its own decay rate. Taking this into account, equations c-f were constructed.
Response →
LuxO controls promoter Pqrr. Downstream of this promoter we find TetR, which represses tetracycline promoter (pTet) downstream. This promoter controls production of a visible color output and the activator of the promoter TetA.
LuxO controls the production of TetR and it can be expressed with a Hill type equation where phosphorylated LuxO is the activator. The promoter has a small constitutive production rate alpha tr and TetR has a decay rate of gamma tr. TetR is consumed when it forms a dimer in order to repress pTet.
Equations i and j describe the production of the output and pTet activator. As in all previous equations, both proteins have a constitutive production and decay rate. In our design, there is a promoter (pTet) with a unique operator sequence (TetO) where the repressor (TetR2) and the activator (tTA) bind (TetR2 and tTA have the same binding domain). For this reason, it was necessary to propose a mathematical expression in which the repressor and the activator compete for the binding site.
Testing our equations
Before we established the above equations, we tried different versions of the systems. In order to get the desired response for our S. coli , we needed to find the right circuit. In this section, we will be showing how we did this, step by step.
The first thing we did was to establish the desired response. We wanted the system to react with a low and longlasting concentration of CAI. The figure below shows the impulse we used to test the system: two pulses with different concentrations and durations.
We knew that the equations of the CqsS protein behavior are right because they were previously reported by Lelu et al (2012). Therefore, we needed to check that behavior. The figure below shows the answer of CqsS with CAI.
As soon as the CAI molecule is present, CqsS concentration is instantly decreased, and CqsS* (which stands for the CAI bound with the CqsS protein) increases. After half an hour, the concentration of CqsS starts to decrease because it is consumed"

1.Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
During our talk to experts, we got many helpful suggestions about the perfection of our project as well as its potential. Furthermore, they introduced plenty of new ideas in the field of synthetic biology and how they benefited us, which raised the interest of the audience. We also arranged video conferences with UESTC-Software team and NAU Team, which made the first step for our further cooperation. Hence, our business plan collected all wonderful ideas of our team members who were ceaselessly racking our brain to promote ideas to make it more practical so that we can benefit and provide services for the public in a real sense soon, which is thrilling and meaningful.
All in all, human practice rendered lots of conveniences and inspirations for us and made us know its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, all of which will motivate us to do better and we hope all our readers of this website get a general understanding of our human practice through our detailed depiction and become interested in our project. More constructive proposals are welcomed!

Formaldehyde was detected, showing that SOX works as expected, however there is slight leaky expression as formaldehyde is produced when no IPTG is added.
We also decided to add Glyphosate to determine the efficiency of the native C-P Lyase pathway. Everything was repeated the same but instead we added 0 µl, 20 µl, 200 µl and 2 ml of glyphosate at 10mg/L. After 8 hours of testing and left overnight, none of the samples had produced formaldehyde according to the testing strips. The testing strips detect a minimum formaldehyde concentration of 10 mg/L, so it was possible that formaldehyde had been produced but that there was too little of it to detect with the strips.
Conclusions and Future Work
E. coli cells naturally have the C-P lyase pathway which degrades glyphosate into sarcosine. The fact that  formaldehyde was produced when sarcosine was added, but not when glyphosate was added, indicates that we have not overexpressed the C-P lyase pathway enough to produce enough sarcosine for SOX to convert into formaldehyde to be detected.
Due to time constraints, we were unable to produce an in vivo formaldehyde detector variant of the Sensynova framework. Future characterisation of this part would include using the platform customised as a formaldehyde biosensor in order to sense compound produce and therefore creating a biosensor of glyphosate.

The psbT subunit of the Photosystem II in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is a single membrane-spanning a-Helix of ~3.5 kDa with C-Terminus located on the stromal side of the Thylakoid Membrane.  Structural studies of psbT Studies have showing that removal of the psbT subunit reduces the rate of electron transfer between the QA and QB and less resistance to photo-damage. It is an integral part of the Cyanobacterial photosystem II complex and it plays an important role in the electron transfer. For iGEM 2016, our team decided to submit the psbT gene as a BioBrick due to Photosystem II being an integral part of our project. We are calming Bronze medal for this BioBrick.

As part of our gold medal requirement we further characterizes a pre-existing BioBrick in the registry. Part BBa_K1640024 was modeled using SwissModel to show the tertiary structure. The ribbon model was rendered using multiple templates of other highly characterized CP47 protein crystals found through Protein Data Bank. The sequences were aligned using the BLAST and the SwissModel script. Secondary structures were assigned based on homology and the alignment with the templates. Closer alignment allowed for better estimation of the structure. The secondary structures were then used to stack the image and develop the tertiary structure. Finally, energy minimization was done to render the most stable orientation and organization of the amino sequence in tertiary form.
The model allows for a better understanding of how the protein interacts within the complex since function is derived from structure. The secondary structures also allow for comparison and identification of key domains and motifs that are necessary for protein function. Likewise these regions are usually conserved and thus the can be used in the identification of unknown functions or the characterization of similar proteins in the organism as well as others.
UniProt was also used to identify Transmembrane regions, domains, and any motifs

Sumbawagen,2014,Team:Sumbawagen#overviews#Econey Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"oring this plasmid will give red color when the bacteria were grown with lactose or IPTG. Oppositely, the expression of mRFP will be decreased when glucose was present in medium through a mechanism called catabolite repression. We use this phenomenon to measure the concentration of glucose in honey by calibrating the color of E. coli medium using android-based mobile phone. Creation of novel circuit which consists of constitutive promoter followed by either Adenylate Cyclase or IIA(Glc) gene, which placed downward lac-mRFP circuit, may affect the sensitivity of catabolite repression. We expect an engineered E. coli, which shows red color expression in different range of glucose concentration. By changing mRFP gene with amilCP, a blue fluorescent protein, we may obtain E. coli expressing either red or blue color when different honey added to the medium due to different glucose concentration.
Even though Sumbawagen team consist of sophomore and in shortage condition to the facility and accessibility, that condition in fact push the team to think creatively in solving such limitation. For instance, inspite of using the refrigerated microsentrifuge for the transformation process we use mini centrifuge inside the refrigerator. We also created a homemade shaker for our cultivation project. Those conditions did not made our team lost the spirit to participate in the prestigious competition of iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) 2014. We encourage ourself to overcome the obstacle in front of us, like the quote from our Rector “Where there is a will, there is a way”.

This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained"

As shown in the cloning strategy, the restriction site was cloned inbetween the promoter and the RBS, resulting in  , which was expected not to influence transcription. However, when a culture containing this biobrick was induced with anhydrotetracyclin (aTc), no fluorescence was observed. This led to a modification of the cloning strategy.
A simpler part was constructed (), which only contained the restriction site in front of the aTc inducible GFP-LVA generator.
Makeup of . It consists of the I-SceI homing endonuclease restriction site and an anhydrotetracyclin inducible GFP-LVA generator.
This part was successfully sequenced and shown to work. Firstly, aTc fluorescence induction worked, as shown in the following image.

Secondly, the part was digested with PstI alone and with PstI and I-SceI. The lenght of the entire biobrick was expected to be 5095bp. The second lane in the adjacent image shows that the observed length corresponds to the predicted length. The part was also digested with PstI and I-SceI, theoretically resulting in two bands of 3204 and 1891bp. The resulting bands in lane 3 of the same figure show that these also correspond well.
Thirdly, the sequence was confirmed by sequencing the part in forward and reverse direction.

iGEM EXPERIENCE
iGEM has become a well-recognized program throughout the University of Lethbridge. It is regarded as being very valuable by both faculty in the science departments and by people in other departments, such as management. iGEM has also been recognized by the President, Vice President Academic and Vice President of Research at the University. These individuals have been extremely supportive of our endeavours over the last few years.
Steve Craig, a member of the Faculty of Management, said “Entrepreneurial iGEM is an excellent opportunity for students to expand their educational experience to areas outside pure science.  Through this initiative students develop knowledge and skills in market research, project management, stakeholder analysis / communications, ethics and risk management (among others).”
iGEM has clearly given us the opportunity to learn skills that can be applied to areas outside scientific research, such as presentation skills, creativity and social awareness. And like Mr. Craig said, in the entrepreneurial stream, we learn how to adapt our skills to a business-focused project.
For many of the members of the Lethbridge Entrepreneurial iGEM team, their first public presentation was at an iGEM Jamboree. Scientific presentations are not addressed in class until upper level courses are reached. We had to learn how to create and give an impactful presentation. We are all familiar with the scientific aspects of our project and are quite comfortable talking about them.
When we were required to give a business pitch presentation at the business plan competitions, we were somewhat less comfortable speaking about our project, as we had to address market size, financial statements, etc. At this point, we were still learning about these aspects of business, which posed challenges when it came to presenting about these topics. Due to past experience with iGEM, we already had developed the skills to give presentations and we were able to apply this to our new content. This experience made it much easier for us to do well in the business plan competitions.
The entrepreneurial stream of iGEM has given us the opportunity to explore the economic impact of synthetic biology. In previous iGEM projects"

Either way, the first mission has bacterial transformation which has been scripted in the form of a 10 question quiz by Katie, which is easier to understand than the equipment used in the more difficult levels, allowing the user to get used to dialogue box controls.
Once the lab missions are finished, we will clone the entire thing into the green island and make everything green. After the labs are complete, we will begin working on the base of Patrick’s biobrick simulator. Katie and I have a few notecards already written up on the basics, we just need to organize it in an easy to understand format with something creative that is more interesting than just reading notecards. Katie is working on having a moving ‘diagrams’ eg of DNA polymerase, etc. I am going to figure out how to embed streaming video in Second Life (maybe show a moving visualization of transcription).
We had a mini-meeting to list out all the commands and controls we thought users needed to know in the labs and the biobrick simulator so that Stefan could design some activities around teaching those. We also began to layout how we wanted the path in Synthetic Kingdom to work. Today I spent 5 minutes staring at Katie’s DNA Polymerase, which is SO CUTE. <3

Working While Dodging Meetings
Retrospective Notebook: This entry was not written on this day, but derived later from working notes I made that day.
Unlike the title, most of today was spent in meetings, so little work on my corner of the project got accomplished as a result. But now I understand everyone else's work a little better!
Moving objects around in three dimensions is neat, but it can be a bit of a pain in second life. I worked on changing the way the objects bind and unbind so that they mostly stay in the same plane, which makes them much easier to deal with.
I also started planning what elements I would show when my turn to do a video blog came around.

With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more important. Also it would raise awareness to the topic of the legal status of parts, leading to a debate which could further promote the idea of open source. At the same time we hope that examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of restrictive legal protections.

Single Cell ODE Model for the Recombination Module
1 Overview
The ﬁnal module in our construct is the Recombination module. In this module, we use Cre recombinase to separate the         origin of replication from the rest of the plasmid. Plasmids whose origin of replication has been recombined out         are referred to as ”knocked out” plasmids.
In our model, we seek to model the knockout eﬃciency after some set amount of time has elapsed since the introduction         of Cre recombinase into the cell culture, which we deﬁne as
. That is, it         is the proportion of plasmids whose origin of replication is knocked out from the original set of plasmids. Here, we         start the simulation with Cre being constitutively produced from the Time Delay module at the same concentration.
The system of reactions generally follow the analysis of Cre recombinase in [1] and can be visualized as in the diagram         below.
In the construct, there are two lox sites on the plasmid which ﬂank the origin of replication. When both lox sites         are bound to two Cre molecules, the plasmid (S) can undergo recombination where the plasmid is cut and separates         into two plasmids (P1, P2), in which one has the origin of replication and the other does not.
As shown in the diagram above, the binding of Cre to the lox sites can be in diﬀerent orders. Notably, the binding         of Cre to molecules to a lox site is cooperative, meaning that the binding of the second Cre to a lox site is made         more favorable when the ﬁrst Cre has already bound to that site.
Once there are four Cre molecules on the same plasmid, the Cre recombinase can catalyze a recombination reaction to         produce a recombined product"

Low data about the storage conditions and the loss of carotinoide during cooking
To low amount of testing people and deviations in the values by the conversions rate of carotinoide in GR  2009
Checking more data resulting to the concentration of substances, metabolites and gene activity, the sub-chronic toxicity, effects on the immune system or of anti-nutritional effects for the long- term security
Application of feeding studies by animals before testing studies ( controversies 2009 by testing Chinese children without previous feeding tests by animals)
Threat for the environment:
No information about the resulting diffusion potential of crossed rice with wild types via flight of pollen
No appraise about the hazard of damage by unwanted transfer of the GM genes in the wild relatives genome; problems concerning banish from the ecosystem and rice extension
under changing environmental conditions producing errors cause long-term damage or after a certain period of time simply technically outdated
limits of their genetic stability by the consequences of climate change
displacement of related plants in the wild or the introgression of transgenes into those wild relatives concerning to the loss of biodiversity and the difference to traditionally bred commercial varieties
Afford of the GM- rice as a problem for the poor population
Critic that the “humanitarian Board” hasn’t a member as a farmer, indigenous person or even an ecologist, or sociologist to observe and assess the project.
Demand of using more carotene containing crops  like carrot, sweet potato or papaya to receive the biodiversity in the environment and the body
Greenpeace's reaction
Concerning to a report in the ZME Science in February 2013 Golden Rice has been approved in the Philippines after 12 years of anti-GMO protests. Anti-GMO campaigns like Greenpeace has blocked the introduction of Golden Rice in Farm lands so that within 12 years from crop’s installment on fields and approve of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and the Philippine Rice Institute 8 million children died due"

The device had 2 sets of channels, one for fluid flow (labeled blue in the diagram), and another one for air exchange (labeled red in the diagram). The first model did not have a chamber or specific region for cell culturing. The inlet and outlet were connected by a tube with uniform dimensions. This model, however, had rectangular cell traps along the channel.
Cell culturing protocol
Harvest the cells were using the standard culturing protocol, and then resuspend in media to achieve 2E4cells/cm^2 seeding density.
Sequentially sterilize and wash the channel with 1ml of 70% ethanol and 1xPBS by directly pipetting into the inlet.
Through the same inlet, pipet 1ml of cells solution (1E6 cells/ml).
Incubate the whole device with seeded cells at 37 degrees Celcius.

a = 3250um; b = 400um; volume of the chamber = ~ 4.4ul. Material: PDMS.
Model 2
Microfluidic device
Since we couldn't detect any cells under 10X light microscope (24 hrs post seeding) in the first model, we proposed several modifications to the device after doing some literature research, including:
Creating a diamond-shape chamber specifically for cell adhesion. The increase in cross-section area along the channel reduces the flow rate of the fluid, making it easier for the cells to stick to the surface of the chamber
Using a syringe pump to continuously replenish media inside the chamber after cell adhesion, preventing the media from drying out inside the chamber - which happened in model 1
Including a 3D-printed frame, fitting the size of a 96-well plate, so that the whole seeding and culturing process can be monitored and captured using a microscope.
Cell culturing protocol
Harvest the cells using the standard culturing protocol, and then resuspend in media to achieve 120E4 cells/ml seeding density.
Clean and wash the chamber with 70% ethanol and 1x PBS.
Use a 5mL syringe to load 1ml of media, 0.5ml of cell solution, and another media column to a 1.59mm diameter tube.
Use a syringe pump to load media and cell solution in the tube to the device.

In relation to bioethics most arguments focus on; that for an action or technology to be morally acceptable it should be so that a virtuous person would accept it. Problems arise when it comes to determine the perfect virtuous person.
Precautionary vs. proactionary
In the discussions of different emerging technologies or therapeutics one can either assume a precautionary or a proactionary stand. The precautionary point of view tends to be a more sceptical view, where one takes a stand against just accepting and embracing new technologies or therapeutics: their motto is better safe than sorry, based on the fear of unknown consequences or that the technology in question has the possibility of changing our life as we know it.
As a proactionist the fear is not unforeseen consequences, but that the public skepticism will hold evolution and progress back. There is a tendency to see an emerging technology or therapeutics as safe, unless there is evidence that suggests otherwise KAPPEL, K. 2011. Bioetik. In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Århus Universitetsforlag. Aarhus Universitetsforlag. .
Arguments in Bioethics
There are different arguments in the discussions. The subject of discussion changes depending on what technology or therapeutics is in question. But behind the different-sounding arguments there is a structure or a system. Most of the arguments falls under different categories:
Autonomy and utility
Dignity and integrity
Teleological, natural and religious
Slippery Slope
An argument in category A is an argument that appeals to either the autonomy of an individual or that it will promote utility in the society. It’s a type of argument that one often hears from a proactionist, who normally will focus on the good aspects of an emerging technology or therapeutics. Appeal to autonomy is often motivated from a deontological point of view, but the appeal to utility is often utilitarian in nature KAPPEL, K. 2011. Bioetik. In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.)

Aalto-Helsinki,2017,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," problem among a range of different age groups. At least 60% of our responders have been diagnosed with acne at some point of their lives and at least 45% of our responders have suffered from acne for more than 1 year. Hence, we realized a need for a “continuous” treatment for acne. Further, to understand the relationship between acne severity and mental wellbeing, we carried out a correlation analysis. There was a clear effect on mental state among the people who have been diagnosed with acne, regardless of its severity. We did not, however, ask what was bothering them and to what extent acne affected their well-being. Similarly, acne had negatively affected the social interaction of our respondents. We realized that Acne vulgaris affects about 85% of young adults aged 12–25 years and hence forms our primary customer group.
The most commonly used products for acne among our focus groups were oral antibiotics, birth control pills, retinoids (Roaccutan), Ayurvedic medicine, finacea 15% gel (azelaic acid), over-the-counter topical medicines (e.g., benzyl peroxide, salicylic acid), isotretinoin Actavis, prescription topical medicines (antibiotic), laser or light treatment and natural treatments.
Of the 194 participants, 95 of them didn't report any side effects from the acne treatments. However, remaining 99 reported some kind of side effects while using the acne product or undergoing treatments.
Market Research
After identification of focus groups and realising product potential, we went for a careful market research to identify how much current acne treatments cost and what are the current acne products in the market.
Current acne treatment costs
The following cost ranges are based on approximated acne treatment expenses in the United States.
For over-the-counter daily regimens which includes a cleanser, a toner and a non-prescription medicated lotion, acne treatment costs approximately $30-60 (about 25-50€) or more per month.
An acne dermatologist visit usually costs $100-200 (85-170€). For prescription antibiotics, topical creams and ointments - or for hormone therapy, from birth control pills to a more aggressive regimen - acne treatment typically costs $45-200 (40-170€) per month. In some contries, acne treatments, such as prescription drugs and topical creams, can be covered by health insurance plans. The treatment often requires 2-3 months to see improvement. Once acne clears, it must be continued to treat the skin to prevent breakouts.

InterLab
The aim of the iGEM InterLab study is to work towards a more reliable and repeatable measurement system to make synthetic biology an engineering biology. All participating laboratories first calibrated their instruments by obtaining standard curves using sodium fluorescein which was provided in our kits. This allowed us to fix settings such as top/bottom optic, gain and type of plate used so that all conditions were the same for our GFP and CFU protocols.
Table 1 shows data for the OD600 reference point.
Table 2 shows data for the particle standard curve (standard curve below).
Table 3 shows data for fluorescein standard curve (standard curve below).
(Blue cells were raw data measurements, gold cells were calculated) After the machine was calibrated fluorescence and absorbance of GFP in 8 different devices was measured using the standardised method provided by iGEM. The results gathered were suggestive of which device had the highest strength of gene expression. The data collection sheet provided converted our raw plate reader measurements into arbitrary fluorescein and abs600 values as well as calculating the µM fluorescein per OD as shown in the following tables.
Tables 4 and 5 show calculated values of µM fluorescein per OD at 0 hour and 6 hour time points. This was calculated from OD measurements we took before beginning the assay.
Tables 6 and 7 show calculated arbitrary values of net fluorescein at 0 hour and 6 hour time points.
Tables 8 and 9 show net values of absorbance of light (600nm) at 0 hour and 6 hour time points.
What did we gain from our InterLab experience?  The InterLab study has allowed us to contribute to making synthetic biology more accurate through providing a series of standardised procedures of calibration and measurement tests. It helped our project as we were then able to use our new calibrated programmes to compare our promoters GFP assay data with iGEM standard data.

ScFv Antibody
Background
scFv consists of a minimal functional antigen-binding domain of an antibody (~30 kDa) (Fig. 1) , in which the heavy variable chain (VH) and light variable chain (VL) are connected by Ser and Gly rich flexible linker. [1] In most cases scFv is expressed in bacteria, where it is produced in cytoplasm, a reducing environment, in which disulfide bonds are not able to form and protein is quickly degraded or aggregated. Although poor solubility and affinity limit scFvs’ applications, their stability can be improved by merging with other proteins. [2] When expressed in cell free system, scFv should form disulfide bonds with the help of additional molecules. Merging to a membrane protein would provide additional stability and would display scFv on liposome membrane, where its activity could be detected. These improved qualities make ScFv recombinant proteins a perfect tool to evaluate, if SynDrop system acts in an anticipated manner. Of all possible scFvs we decided to use scFv-anti vaginolysin, which binds and neutralizes toxin vaginolysin (VLY). Its main advantage is rapid (< 1 h) and cheap detection of activity by inhibition of erythrocyte lysis (Fig. 2). Looking into future applications, scFvs are also attractive targets of molecular evolution, because one round of  evolution would last less than one day thus generating a and wide range of different scFv mutants. Those displaying the highest affinity for antigens could be selected and used as drugs or drug carriers.

BNU-China,2014,Team:BNU-China#overview.html_-_-_TEXT.html,", we designed a model to mimic the movement pattern and predict the efficiency of the Prometheus E.coli.
Modeling:
We complete our mathematical modeling with the program designed to dynamically and quantitatively simulate the behavior of chemotaxic E.coli towards root surface.  Although we didn't make it a real ""software"" with beautiful user interface, it can still show us a virtual peanut root, based on laser scanning data, and with the concentration gradient of attractant. With this setting, it can simulate a bunch of bacteria's motion, updated every second.
The input items are: 1) the vertices of the root surface based on our laser scanning data, 2) the attractant concentration on the immediate root surface, 3) the spatial gradient function and the number of bacteria. The information of our program can be seen in our wiki (modeling part).
The output is the concrete information of each bacterium per sec in the set time (velocity, direction, position, the surrounding concentration of attractant and number of bacteria reaching one requirements). The result is to be correct and successful for it fit the theoretical curve and the data from experiment well (see our wiki).
It can be used to help a student or professor who needs the data of the concrete information of bacteria every second in a chemotaxis.One run of the program needs 2.5 times of the real time. However, it still deserves to use under an emergency in which is no time to prepare an experiment. It also can avoid the error led by an operation and get robust result which can be trusted.
The one for presentation can show the process above. However, for a fluent running of the program, it decrease the accuracy. It is suitable for a simple scientific presentation.
Kill Switch
We designed a kill switch to control ""Prometheus"" and to prevent potential contamination.
One difficulty we face is how to trigger the suicide progress spontaneously at a certain time. In the medium, the bacteria are easily controlled by adding or removing regulatory factors. However, after pouring E. coli into soil, it is hard for us to control. The suicide progress needs to be activated spontaneously. Moreover, the kill switch is supposed to be “off” for a certain time in the soil, so the bacteria will gain enough time to perform its function.
Considering the problems, toxin protein MazF is the best candidate for ""Prometheus"" to suicide with, as well as for us to restrict the bacterial number under reasonable level.

NMR-GC quantification of PHB
E. coli containing the BBa_K1418050 part was grown in M9 media supplemented with glucose (see protocols page for details). The BBa_K1418050 part was modified from the BBa_K934001 BioBrick to include the lactose inducible promoter system BBa_K208010 .  After growth and purification, PHB concentrations were determined from a NMR-GC correlation as mentioned in the protocols page . The concentration found was approximately 48.5% PHB of the dry cell weight.  The figure below shows an NMR spectra of PHB produced from XL1 Blue E. coli harboring the BBa_K1418050 part, confirming the presence of PHB.

Immobilized Bioplastics
Enzymes are produced by an organism or cell culture to catalyze metabolic reactions, defensive deactivation of compounds, and other chemical conversions (Nisha et al., 2012). Enzymes can be expensive to produce, and have low stability and are sensitive to process conditions (Cao et al., 2005). To resolve these problems, immobilization techniques were developed as a means of stabilizing enzymes for prolonged activity. Berna & Batista (2006) classified the methods of enzyme mobilization into two categories. The first type is reversible enzyme immobilization, which include adsorption, ionic binding, affinity binding and metal binding. The second is the irreversible enzyme immobilization methods which include covalent bonding and entrapment processes.
Enzyme Immobilization Methods
Covalent binding is an irreversible process, which involves the direct attachment of the enzyme to the material through covalent linkage (Wong et al., 2008). Enzymes are attached to the support material such as polyacrylamide, porous glass, agarose and silica. In this process, enzymes are kept on the support material after the reaction process.
Another irreversible process is called entrapment. The process use natural or synthetic polymeric networks which act as a permeable membrane, allowing the substrate to pass through while trapping the enzymes in its network. Entrapment is a fast and inexpensive process which requires controlled, mild conditions (Bernfield & Wan, "

Overall Project
The ultimate goal of USTC_Software 2010 team is to promote synthetic biology throughout the world. To attract more people who do not have biology background to be interested in this area, we plan to develop a modeling-and-simulation game specially designed for synthetic biology. Users are taught to learn the basic knowledge in the area via constructing their genetic circuits as input to our software and try to understand the system behavior as output. This is the basic functional module. We also plan to develop a rating system to grade users' design for given tasks, and a more friendly game interface that can fill the process of input with joy and ease. Though more functions are expected, we focus on the basic module, modeling-and-simulation, at the first stage of our project.
In practice, many CAD (Computer-Aided Design) tools, such as TinkerCell and Synbioss, have been developed to model and simulate biological systems and give the system behaviors as guides. However, they all need users to provide details of the system network, such as the activation and repression of transcription and translation reactions in genetic regulatory network. It is so difficult for even professionals to construct a detailed network of a complex system depending only on their minds. In this sense, modeling through CAD tools will not reduce the work of modeling: users are actually required to model manually and input their model in details.
However, since our software is developed for non-biological background users, it is unrealistic to expect them to model their design manually. To solve this problem, the USTC_Software 2010 team attempts to take synthetic biology modeling one step further by introducing new methods for automatic modeling of biological systems.

Our bacteria therefore execute the coating process themselves, which could save a lot of effort. In the case of using chaplins as a building blocks for a hydrophobic coating, the biofilm is also used to orient and anchor the proteins in the right way. As chaplins are amphipathic, the orientation in their pure form is determined by the properties of the surface they coat as well: Using a biofilm to structure them the right way is an easy and smart solution that helps us to get around some problems of using the chaplins in their pure form as a coating.
Anti-fouling coatings
Surface hydrophobicity could also be beneficial in the antifouling industry, for instance when applied on ships. When marine micro-organisms like algae or pocks adhere to the hull of ships, they form a layer which greatly increases drag in the water. This results in higher fuel costs and increased erosion. To prevent organisms to adhere to the hull of ships, chemical antifouling paints, which often contain copper and tin, are used. A lot of these chemicals eventually end up in the oceans ecosystems accumulating in all trophic levels of marine life and contaminating estuarial silt near shipping routes. With our biological coating this impact on the environment could be greatly reduced. When tested against a number of demands set up by L.D. Chambers et al. our hydrophobic coating performs quite well, although some critical point might be present as well:

Medical coatings
Because of their surface modifying abilities, hydrophobic biofilms of none-pathogenic bacteria may be used to prevent pathogenic biofilms from adhering to prothesis or catheters. Keeping in mind that growing a biofilm, even our good biofilm coating, in a catheter or on prothesis can give serious medical problems like shock or inflammation. Of course this would have to be extensively researched before the coating is applicable. Bacillus subtilis is not pathogenic but if needed another bacterium could be used to form the hydrophobic biofilm like Lactococcus lactus, a natural inhabitant of our body. The principle via which"

iGEM Hamburg: That’s in fact very important too! Maybe we could come back to our project again. You’ve mention in the beginning, that many ways to target a disease is the best. Do you see any advantages or disadvantages of our trap to contribute to this approach?
Dr. Hammond: I don’t like looking at gene drive as “the” solution. I see it as a chance to get rid of the major vectors in the most affected areas. But then, this is not gonna be the most appropriate solution across the globe and in every region, so probably we have to use a lots of personalized ways of controlling this disease. You could for example go to small villages and towns and implements things like bed nets and insecticides but also the population controls this modified bacteria and you can put them into local breeding sites. Your approach targets not only the predominant vectors, because malaria is not only transmitted by Anopheles gambiae, but by several species. This species is not the predominant species in whole Africa, but there are also very local conditions with other strains present. There for example gene drive would not have a great effect. Your approach is a little bit broader and well-welcomed. So you don’t wanna an approach that eliminates tons of mosquitoes. You want to have a wide-spread suppression. Assuming your trap will be used, you want to use them for the most dangerous and predominant vectors and less propagating approaches to target those minor vectors. I think the technology you are developing would be extremely useful in that case, when used in regions were this non-dominant vector species are present. At the same time with other vector control program, it would be effective, because you don’t give malaria enough time to adapt to other vector species. So you want to target a range of all these vector species all at once with a range of different tools, because if rely on one tool and they become become resistant, we’re in big trouble. So I do like that.
My concerns with your strategy, are the delivery and persistence. Also dosage might me a problem. Is it feasible to get a dose that is high enough to be effective? So at what size of breeding grounds are you looking at? Are these breeding grounds permanent breeding grounds or very short term breeding grounds? Often in the rainy season, you got these very tiny puddles forming, which are formed for a very short period of time. Mosquitoes will breed in these. So is it very feasible to get your intervention into those puddles or is"

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#HumanPractice#NRP59_-_-_TEXT.html,", so there is a lot of room for discussion left. Despite of the fact that disagreement is an integral part of research and almost a prerequisite of progress, the dispute about the findings of NRP 59 are not helpful in gaining the populations trust in research results. Even worse, some researchers where confronted with reproaches of belonging to gene technology friendly organizations and therefore be biased. Scientists seemed to be careful since whatever they say may be used as a slightly out of context argument by any site of the discussion. These examples show that the polarization of the public into black and white thinking also reflects on scientists. Prof. Potrykus stated that ‘it is also the medias fault’ when asked about ‘a few that are scientifically well informed, but the majority feels ensured in their fears and prejudices because of the continued moratorium. ‘ .
National Council Mr. Markus Ritter argues in a different way as an answer to the question if people are not well informed: ‘The more we are proceeding into the direction of globalization and a highly technological world, the more people want untouched nature, culture and values, and they try to at least protect their food as an untouched refugium. They say: “No! Everything, but not our food!”‘ . Despite Mr. Ritter sees the ‘large potential’ of GMPs, ‘we now have no hunger in Switzerland; nobody in this country knows the problem of hunger. So the potential is found more in the Third World.’
That explains the answer of Prof. Potrykus, who answers ‘The people that face the danger of their children becoming blind or die due to the lack of vitamin A have no problem with GMPs yet. Never the less Greenpeace etc. work intensively towards changing this fact.’ when being asked: ‘Can the higher acceptance of golden rice in the population of poor countries be explained by the fact that the use of GMP is better communicated? Are the people in those countries informed well enough?’ .
Opinion
creative representation of the article
To conclude this little excursion into the Swiss genetically modified plant landscape, we want to give a own personal opinion on the topic: With ourselves having a strong interest in biology, research and technology, of course our view was biased towards the ‘pro’ GMP side. We hope we could block out the bias and give a neutral review of the situation. In addition, we must admit we could also find some prejudices in ourselves and could use the opportunity of digging into some material and writing this text to lower or to get rid of them.
To sum it up, the subject of GMPs is nothing science"
DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," of separation of the states shown in Figure 5. Poor transversality of the nullclines, illustrated in Figure 6, due to real world fluctuations in parameters can lead to spontaneous change of state and thereby also loss of the information stored by the switch. Systems with highly transverse nullclines are able to withstand movements of the nullclines without spontaneous change of state. Stochastic fluctuations in protein levels occur due to the fact that the number of protein and mRNA molecules are finite. This means that it is more beneficial for a switch to be based on high concentrations of low-affinity repressors compared to a low concentration of high-affinity repressors. The cost of additional protein production is balanced out by the reduction of noise in the system (Gardner, T.S. et al, 2000)(Cherry, J., 2000).

Contact with Institutions
In order to get a better understanding of what Swedish laws that govern the use of GM probiotics we decided to approach a few of the key institution that deals with pharmaceuticals and other GM products.
Our team has been in contact with the Swedish Gene Technology Advisory Board and SMER to ask them which Swedish laws and regulations would affect a GM probiotic. They did not have a concrete answer, instead  we were referred to the MPA to ask them if our product would be counted as a food supplement, like most regular probiotics, or if it would be classified as a pharmaceutical. After a discussion with a spokesperson for the MPA, we were told to send a description of our project so they could evaluate how it should be classified.
The response simply stated that they could not give any information about a specific product/project but they referred to the “Medicinal Products Act” which states that a pharmaceutical is :”Every substance or combination of substances that is provided under the pretense that it has a preventative or therapeutic effect on diseases in humans or animals”.  So, in the case of GM probiotics for treatments of diseases it is obvious that our product would be treated as a pharmaceutical and not as a supplement.
There are also some additional Swedish laws that apply when preparing clinical trials for GM products. For example as soon as a human trial is started it is considered a “Deliberate release” of GM products into the environment. This means that MPA needs to evaluate the suggested trial from both an environmental and a medical standpoint. The Swedish Gene Technology Advisory Board and the Swedish National Council of Medical Ethics are also often involved and give out statements and input in regards to the applications for clinical trials. When a GM trial is initiated anybody who wants to is free to contact the MPA to give their input on the release of GMO into the environment within the three first weeks of the decision making period. Also, all pharmaceuticals that contain any modified organism need to be labeled with “This product contains (a) genetically modified organism(s)”.  All of the trials regarding GM pharmaceuticals are posted on the Swedish Medical Products Agency’s website, which you can find here .

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.
Results

The teachers who participated in  the meetup paid attention to each team’s report and gave a lot of good advice  to immediately after the report. In this meetup, each team had 30 minutes to  answer the questions from teachers or other two teams. I thought it’s a good  program to help us get more experience and learn.
Besides,  when the guys made a discussion on the cooperation issue, we shared a lot of  new ideas with each and enjoyed funs. We planned a lot of new ways of human  practice and prepared to implement.

See How The World Affects Our Experiment
In previous surveys, it would be very encouraging to find that if our project results can play a role in the early diagnosis of kidney cancer. Under the guidance of our instructors, for experimental design, we plan design several parts based on long non-coding RNA. At least, One of them is expected to be a biomarker in the early detection and diagnosis of kidney cancer.
In the process of experimental design, we also have some collaboration with the other iGEM teams.  Of them, HZAU-China team leader’s suggestions really help us improve our experiments design. she proposed the possibility for us to try out multiple cell lines from different cancers to test out the specificity of our lncRNA.
(We are in HZAU-China’s lab)
Then, We feedback their suggestions with our instructor professor Zhou, and after discussion we decided to adopt their opinions.We selected three cancer cell lines for comparison and found that LncRNA IL7-AS we selected had significant results in all three cancer cell lines.
(We are discussing with Professor Zhou)
Thanks for HZAU-China team’s help, Our results shows that  there were significant expression differences among 293T (the healthy cell), 769-P (the adenocarcinoma cell) and 786-O (the adenocarcinoma cell) cell lines. The expression in 769-P and 786-O were higher than that of 293T, showing speciality and universality of IL7-AS.
(Fig. Compared to HEK-293T, IL7-AS was highly expressed in 786-O and 769-P cells as shown by real-time PCR)
Other Activities
Before we started designing the experiment of our project, we visited several companies in Bio-Valley, including cancer diagnostics and testing companies, and pharmaceutical companies.
We as a team visited the biolake of the Optic Valley, which is the Wuhan bioindustry base and home of leading Chinese biopharmaceutical companies like Humanwell Healthcare, Healthgen Biotechnology, and Zoncare. Kind"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Acknowledgement_-_-_TEXT.html," recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component"

Hey, everyone, I'm Jacky. I'm glad to lead the team this year. As a final-year student studying Biochemistry, I'm inteserted in all lab working. In daily life, I like making new joke, writing new poem, singing with my guitar, enjoying all kind of sports.~ Most important, I like dreaming a lot. I always hope my dream come true. One of my dream is to engineer a bacteria...which can help me engineer other bacteria with the function that I am dreaming! HAHAHA!
Thanks a lot!

I am a bachelor student of Biochemistry at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. After learning some basic concepts of Biochemistry in the past 2 semesters, I am interested in the idea of synthetic biology and joined iGEM competition. As a member in wet lab team, it is so challenging that I can learn lots of laboratory techniques by doing wet lab works. Moreover, I take part in the designing of WIKI page of this project as I am also interested in computer skills. Being one of the members of CUHK team, I hope to draw the attention of the public on scientific researches in Hong Kong, and looking forward to have more students studying in biochemistry.
