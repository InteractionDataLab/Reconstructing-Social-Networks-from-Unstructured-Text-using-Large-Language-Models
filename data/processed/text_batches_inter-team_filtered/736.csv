Valencia_UPV,2014,Team:Valencia UPV#Project#results#constructs_-_-_TEXT.html," constitutive promoter with high expression levels.  As result of these assemblies, we obtained three Transcriptional units (TU) ready for plant transformation.
To maximize the flow through of the pathway, we wanted to make sure that all three genes were co-delivered simultaneously. This is to ensure that each transformed cell receives a complete set of genes and that the expression of all three enzymes is balanced and coordinated. Co-delivery is achieved by creating a multigenic construct, where all three genes are assembled in a single plasmid.
We used the GoldenBraid assembly system to create the multigene assembly. After two binary reactions, the 3-genes construct was obtained. This construct was then transformed, by agroinfiltration, into N. benthamiana plants for pheromone production.
We used GoldenBraid 2.0 for all our cloning reactions. GoldenBraid and BioBrick parts are not directly exchangeable; however, we adapted the coding sequences of the three biosynthetic genes to BioBrick standards using a GoldenBraid-Biobricks translator developed by the NRP-UEA-Norwich team. These BioBricks have been submitted to the Parts Registry.
RESULTS-CONSTRUCTS-PHEROMONE RELEASE
To obtain a plant capable of releasing pheromones into the environment in an efficient way, we decided to use the glandular trichome specific promoter (PCPS2) ( see Pheromone Relase ).
We obtained this promoter from Nicotiana tabacum genome and tested its functionality assembling it with GFP ( see Results: Pheromone Release ).
As it proved to be an effective promoter, expressing GFP only at the glandular cells of the trichomes, we decided to assemble each of the pheromone biosynthetic genes with this promoter to reach improvements in the pheromones release ( see Biosynthesis ).
Finally, after two binary GoldenBraid assembly steps, we obtained a multigenic construct with all three transcriptional units with the PCPS2 promoter. This construct was ready to be transferred to the plant to test the release of the pheromones.
RESULTS - CONSTRUCTS-SWITCH
In order to have a tight control over the pheromone production in the plant, we implemented an inducible switch in the plant genetic circuit. This switch is induced with the presence of copper ions, activating the pheromone production pathway in the plant only when the insects mating season arrives. With this kind of inducible expression, the pheromones production metabolic cost for the"

This is a huge obstacle for the modeling’s accuracy. After discussion,             we find that though the concentration of dCas9 and gRNA of the single bacteria can’t be directly acquired, the             volume of cell can be the easiest and most accurate parameter we can get. So that our project can be evaluated             on single cell level other than a whole bunch of colony just because we took the advantage of the volume of the             bacteria which is totally measurable and reliable. Thus we improved our previous work, made it formulized and capable to be put into software. We read some paper in             the relevant research field and summarized some rules of bacterial replication growth and division, and applied             them in our project. The rules are as following: Bacterial rule of growth: $V_{new} =V_{old}e^{\mu T}$ Bacterial rule of triggering replication initiation: $V>2^{N}V_{std}$ Bacteria will divide after C phase and D phase: $T_{C}+T_{D}$

2. The ethics behind bacteria entering a wound site. (Talia) Ethically speaking this project could provide many questions which the team would need to answer. These questions are centered primarily around implementation. However, two main questions developed on the basis of this project description are: Clotting: As the Lethbridge team has chosen to use snake blood for their construct, the possibility that clotting could occur elsewhere in the body other than at the wound site is relatively high. Ethically speaking this problem could be evaluated many ways. If one is a follower of Kant's belief of dialogical ethics for example, they would be bound by their moral imperative to act rather than the rightness or wrongness of any consequences. Meaning that one could justify the potential use of snakes venom even if their was a high possibility of life threatening clotting as the means are good. They focus on the potential that we could save a life. So based off that, the use of snake venom could be an ethical approach while keeping in mind that the Lethbridge team also intends on investigating the rightness or wrongness of their procedures before any possible application to humans. Bacteria: The second ethical dilemma is surrounding the direct contact of bacteria and a vulnerable wound site. Currently this project uses the chassis e coli. This presents a problem as the directly contact of the e coli could lead to infection or septic shock. Most laboratory strains such as k-12 have very rarely if ever been directed implicated in disease. (1) This means that the likelihood of someone getting sick from contact with the construct is very unlikely. However, one could be concerned about the patient going into septic shock. Also known as sepsis can take place as a result of an infection and cause very drastic changes in the body. Often times the inflammation caused as a result of sepsis can lead to tiny blood clots. This can block oxygen and nutrients from reaching vital organs. (2) This in combination with the potential clotting of blood due to snake venom could have drastic, and life threatening effects on the patient. The ethical approach of Plato which focuses on Eudaimonia or well being could justify this action, as it is intended to create a well being.
3. The Doctrine of Double Effect (Acacia) The Doctrine of Double Effect is mostly used in the medical community, it essentially says that anything done for a positive end result, but which may cause serious harm, is ethical(1). Though this is in direct conflict with the oath to “Do No Harm” it is an accepted practice in the medical community."

Background
Breakthroughs with CRISPR gene editing have been flooding the scientific scene in recent years. This system works by repurposing a bacterial nuclease that precisely targets a position of the host genome with the help of a small stretch of RNA called a single-guide RNA, or sgRNA. Properly designing sgRNAs is crucial to the success of any CRISPR experiment yet most online sgRNA design tools are limited to a selection of curated eukaryotic genomes such as human, mouse or fly genomes. While these tools are helpful to researchers working on these model organisms, the lack of flexibility in genome choice creates a significant barrier to projects involving non-model organisms.
UBC iGEM has decided to tackle this issue by creating a flexible sgRNA design program that allows the user full reign over the choice of their target genome. This model builds off of a biophysical model of CRISPR activity published by the Salis Lab at Pennsylvania State University (Farasat & Salis 2016). Its usage is simple – provide the program with the appropriate genome and target gene sequence, and it will return a list of potential guide sequences ranked from best to worst.
Model Theory
The 20 nucleotide sequence that the CRISPR/Cas9 protein targets with the sgRNA construct on a DNA strand is called a protospacer. CRISPR-Cas9 uses a specific nucleotide combination adjacent to the protospacer, the PAM, to bind to the DNA and facilitate cutting. In Streptococcus pyogenes the nucleotide combination of the PAM site is 5’ - NGG - 3’. In any DNA sequence, S. pyogenes CRISPR"

Cooperation with other teams
With University of Science & Technology Beijing (USTB)
We cooperated with the iGEM team from University of Science & Technology Beijing (USTB) and we both learned a lot of thing from each other.
We often had friendly conversions through WeChat and told each other what our projects is about and how our projects is going. They told us that they had some trouble in assembling a plasmid they needed. They tried a lot of ways to assemble the plasmid but failed and they asked us for help. They sent us the photo of their unsuccessful plasmid and after some analyses we suggested them using a method called Gibson Assembly. They adopted our opinions and did some try again. Later, they told us that they had made it successfully and we were all glad to hear that.
We also invited them to our school and talked about our projects. We learned about that their project is about a kind of compound named notoginseng saponin. They told us about the process and purpose of their experiment in detail and we noticed that there are some cases they ignored. And also, we help them optimize the process of their experiment and gave them a hand on the analyzing of their result. At the same time, we invited them to our laboratory, showed them how our experiment goes on and also, gave them some advice on the operations they should take care of when they did their experiment. And they also gave us a lot of useful suggestions and all of us had a great and meaningful day!

Sheanne also explained to us that focusing on middle school integration gives teachers the freedom to create an option class designed to support the current curriculum.   While STEM integration is already being applied at the middle school level, our team has decided to focus on integration of STEAM based learning. STEAM helps to create a more well-rounded student by further stressing the importance of art based learning. The field of science and technology is constantly evolving, and STEAM initiatives allow for a more creative problem solving ability in such an environment. Our interview and research inspired us to draft a basic curriculum proposal to start the conversation of STEAM integration and to provide a foundation in future curriculum development in Alberta.

Media Attention
Throughout the season, the local media has expressed interest in our project. For instance, after participating in the BioTreks Scientific Journal, we gained the attention from the local newspaper, the Lethbridge Herald, and we were also featured on the University of Lethbridge website. Our presentation at city hall also gained the attention of the Global News. As well, CTV News interviewed one of our members and spread information about iGEM to the general public."
Toronto,2016,Team:Toronto#HP-Impact_-_-_TEXT.html," attitudes towards settled scientific concepts like climate change are deeply polarized (Funk and Kennedy, 2016). Groups like iGEM that generate interest in and comfort with science, especially increasingly politicized areas of science such as genetically modified organisms, will be necessary to shape public opinion such that society can navigate challenges and capitalize on opportunities.
From a policy perspective, the implications are clear. iGEM provides a multifaceted benefit to society. Governments that want their countries to succeed in the coming decades would do well to boost participation in iGEM. As we wrote in Section Three, this should be down through lowering barriers to participation: providing assistance in paying registration fees, assistance in acquiring materials and lab space, or generating greater enthusiasm among potential advisors. Don’t delay- the synthetic biology economy is coming.

Hence, even though Arendt did not link her analysis of judgment to scientific processes, it seems to be a good model to evaluate how judgments and opinions evolve, how they relate to publicity and the popularization of science, without making ethics into a matter of deontological and theological arguments.
Publicity and Popularization and a Condition for Judgment
Kant is an enlightenment thinker. His works are imbued with the awareness that people should break free from the dogma's that inhibit their autonomous thinking and that they should become autonomous agents. His most famous work, the Critique of Pure Reason, is a plea to break with the metaphysical tradition of his time. However, Kant is not only concerned with breaking with the tradition and authority of his time that dictated philosophical thought, in the Critique of Pure Reason he breaks with the previous traditions by looking at the conditions and limits of reason itself (what can I know?). Hannah Arendt argues that Kant himself did not “see the clearly destructive side of his enterprise”, which consisted of breaking with previous metaphysical thought (Arendt, 34). Instead he argued, as Arendt quotes, that the “loss affects only the monopoly of the Schools, but by no means the interest of men,” because the distinctions and concepts introduced by these different Schools never “succeeded in reaching the public mind [das Publikum] or in exercising the slightest influence on its convictions” (Arendt, 25).
Hence, we find in Kant the attempt to break away from previous dogmatic philosophical doctrines and to reassess their claims to arrive at a position where one can start anew by relying on one's own faculties of reason. Arendt argues that it is for this reason that Kant regretted that the Critique of Pure Reason never reached the reading public. Arendt relates the effort, or at least the intention, of Kant to popularize his works to the spirit of Socrates who after all philosophized on the streets in dialogue with the common public that Kant attempted to reach. For Kant, reaching the public was essential because it would be, as Arendt quotes Kant, “the test of free and open examination” (Arendt, 39). Even though a thinker might write and think in solitude, if he cannot “communicate and expose to the test of others, either orally or in writing, whatever you may have found out when you are alone, this faculty [of thinking] exerted in solitude will disappear” ("
TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#project#chitin deacetylase_-_-_TEXT.html," other, they are easy to isolate from cells because of their difference in size and density in comparison to cellular organelles. Inclusion body proteins also degrade slower and resist proteolytic attacks by proteases. Lastly, proteins expressed in inclusion bodies tend to be less contaminated with cellular substances and can be purified with less steps  [12] .
Purification and Refolding
To purify the enzyme, a C-terminal-directed mutagenesis was performed to add a His-taq. The nodB gene was again expressed in E. coli BL21. The cells were disrupted via sonication and in a second sonication step the inclusion bodies were solubilized in a highly concentrated guanidine hydrochloride buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. High concentrations of chaotropic denaturants such as guanidine hydrochloride and reducing agents (β-mercaptoethanol) provide the solubilization of inclusion bodies  [12] . To prevent non-native disulfide bond formations β-mercaptoethanol was used. To refold the bound protein, the 6 M guanidine-hydrochloride buffer was exchanged to a 6 M urea buffer. During slow removal of the denaturant urea, the protein was refolded into the native state  [12] .
Affinity purification of His-tagged recombinant proteins and subsequent on-column refolding, gives us the feasibility to purify and refold NodB in a single chromatographic step  [13] .  The protein was purified via an ÄKTA in combination with a 1 mL HisTrap column (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden).
Enzyme Reaction and Assay
Reaction
A reaction volume was set to 1 ml with 1 mM chitin pentamers (AG Prof. Dr. Bruno Moerschbacher, WWU Münster, Institut für Biologie und Biotechnologie der Pflanzen) and 2,5 µM purified NodB eluted in NH4HCO3 adjusted to pH 9. Four reactions were initiated and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After approximately 20 hours the reactions were heat-inactivated at 80 °C for 20 minutes to denature remaining enzymes.

He also suggested that we should focus on controlling the bacterial population size and should consider quorum sensing  as a method of ensuring that the population remains at a constant level.
Dr Sam Parsons
Oxford Centre for Emotions and Affective Neuroscience
Dr Parsons is a psychologist and he shared information about the psychological impact of autoimmune conditions, including the psychological impact of chronic pain, isolation, stigma, and phobias of hospitals/needles. This enabled us to understand further complications of autoimmune diseases, and encouraged us to choose an oral form of probiotic delivery in order to create a minimally invasive, easily administered treatment.
Psychological Impact
Our initial survey highlighted the importance of the delivery method in a psychological way as well as functionally. Patients told us they would like a treatment which is simpler than their current treatments especially compared to having to be on an IV. We were told that the patients found the use of needles for biological treatments can scary especially for younger patients. We were also informed how these psychological considerations are particularly important for chronic conditions compared to other conditions. For this reason, we decided to place a greater focus on the method of treatment and try to ensure we come up with the easiest and safest method for the patient.
Surveys
As well as consultation with specialists we conducted surveys with the public and members of the Oxford Biochemistry Department to gain an insight of how people would like to have treatments administered and why. We initially received support for packaging the product in a yoghurt in our first survey. We conducted two surveys with the aim of finding the preferred delivery method of the public. Our first survey was conducted at ‘Meet the Experts’ at Oxford University Museum of Natural History and our second was sent out to members of the Oxford Biochemistry department. The first was at an event for children and families whilst the second was completed by specialists with a higher level of understanding of GMOs.
The most favoured method in the Natural History Museum survey was the yoghurt drink. Injections received many votes but only from children under 12 either because of association of injections with effectiveness or because they found the idea of injections exciting.
From our survey in the department we were able to ask a significantly larger group of people their opinion as well as receiving reasons for their choices. Capsules resulted as the favoured method from this survey. Yoghurts received votes due to their convenience but capsules was preferred for the same reason as well as its establishment in medicine, ease of storage and transport, and its superior half-life.

The previous mentioned L-tyrosines now have an additional hydroxylgroup and are called L-DOPA. To determine the adhesive properties, several experiments are done, including atomic force microscopy and MALDI-TOF. These results are also very useful for our mathematical model, so we’ll get the most realistic estimation/result.
Last but certainly not least, there is the project for localisation of mfp5 in one specific part of the outer-membrane. Therefore, we will combine our construct together with a Biobrick of the SDU Denmark 2010 iGEM team (BBa_K343003). The localisation is achieved by the use of the signal sequence which originates from the complex flagellar system.  When the localisation is achieved, we can make a controllable production-line when combined with different  properties of E. coli. This is the first step to have a chip with a product-line, which will have many beneficial scale-up possibilities in the future.

Screening
“SCT - Screening Cancer Therapy”
SCT (screening Cancer Therapy) is a kit which contains of hela cells as cervical cancer cells and it was designed to screening the plants that have compund potentially for cervical cancer therapy. The kit designed with plasmid that contain with HPV 16 or HPV 18 promoter. Each promoter to be accompained by two types of fluorescence reporter such as green (GFP) and red (RFP). The reporter compound obtained from biobrick. GFP obtained from Bba_E0240 (Plate 4, well 11N), then RFP obtained from Bba_K516132 (Plate 1, well 11A). Plasmid also designed with another compund such as RBS and double terminator. GFP act as a marker for the detection viruses whether plasmids have been inserted in hela cells and RFP as a marker for checking the ability of herbal compound used in the treatment of cervical cancer.
Herbs that potentially as a therapy of cervical cancer in the kit are marked by the absence of green or red colors, while the negative results are marked by the emergence of green or red in the kit. The construct in the kit design is herbs can inhibit HPV promoter so that promoters cannot work anymore. The kit is expected to provide convenience to the researchers in the field of cervical cancer and cervical cancer effects can be mitigated with natural compound that not a lot of side effects.

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

Also talked about the scope of synthetic biology, what it can achieve, and the applications and goals of the field.
Connor McFadden, UNC - Chapel Hill : Discussed the formal definition of synthetic biology, and the subfields and components of contemporary synthetic biology.
Emma Miles, Duke iGEM : Discussed the ethical implications of synthetic biology related to its applications (human advancement), distribution (biofuel production), and procedure (status of living machines). Also illustrated the importance of bridging the disconnect which makes it hard for the public to accept synthetic biology projects due to lack of communication and education from the scientists in charge of implementation.
There were also many fun and lighthearted activities for all of us to partake in. For example, the Duke iGEM team conducted an interview asking us questions like “Why do you love science?”, “What is your favorite piece of lab equipment and why?”, “If you could say something to any microorganism what would it be?”, etc. We socialized over a dinner consisting of pasta and salad from Olive Garden, ice cream, and a movie to kick off the night.

(C) Fluorescence VS arabinose concentration       VS Time 3-D graph for DH10B. Each point represent triplicate mean. (D) Fluorescence VS arabinose concentration VS Time 3-D graph for DH5α. Each point        represent triplicate mean.
The OD600 value reflects cell concentration. OD600 for both strain in different arabinose concentration increased exponentially. Growth rate for cells without  arabinose induction (0%) was greatest for both DH10B and DH5α. For other concentration of arabinose induction the growth rates were similar for both of the cell strains (Figure  4. A and B). The similar growth rate across the 10 hour period indicates that the cell concentration for samples in different arabinose concentration increased similarly and   therefore the cell concentration at each point of measurement was similar across different arabinose concentration. We can therefore assume that differences in the cell   concentrations have minimal effect on the different fluorescence levels at different arabinose concentration.
Unlike what Groningen 2011 observed in their experiment, ( Experience page. ) we observed all-or-none response for both  of the cell strains. For DH10B and DH5α the fluorescence levelled off at 0.2% arabinose concentration. In the process of subtracting autofluorescence, we got some negative  corrected fluorescence. These region correspond to the blue areas of the 3-D graphs.
Discussion
Groningen 2011 results may not truly represent the gradual induction of PBAD promoter
We believe that it is actually difficult to analyze the promoter’s gradual or all-or-none response looking the 3-dimensional graph that Groningen 2011 team presented. The 3  dimensional graph has three parameters: time, various arabinose concentrations and fluorescence. The graph does not consider the OD600 value which can represent the  concentration of cells. If the growth rate of the cells are different in different arabinose concentration, the final concentration of cells at given point of time can vary.  Groningen 2011 team did not provide with OD600 versus time graphs. Therefore it is hard to tell well there was variation in the cell growth under the context of Groningen  2011’s experiment. Because the fluorimetry measurements, the method that Groningen 2011 used, measures the fluorescence of the entire population of cells, the fluorescence can be   affected by the concentration of cells and hence show a response that is not"

Size of Things Quiz
This activity allowed participants to test their knowledge about the relative size of things relating to biology and synthetic biology. Using the survey platform Qualtrics, we designed a five questions quiz with fun facts to help people better understand the size of things. At the end of the survey we asked demographic questions in order to find out if children under 18 know more about biological concepts than adults over 18. However, after looking at the data ee found no correlation between age and knowledge of biology concepts.
Twizzler DNA
This activity allowed participants to learn more about the structure of DNA. Children used twizzlers as the backbones and marshmallows as the nucleotide bases. The marshmallows were colored and each corresponded to a different nucleotide. This activity was supplemented with posters about the four different nucleotide bases and the way that they interact with each other. Once the structure was put together, the children could twist it to make an accurate representation of the structure of DNA.
Fluorescent Bacteria
This activity allowed participants to learn about transforming genes into bacteria from other organisms. We drew pictures on agar gels using red and green fluorescent bacteria. Some of the most popular works of art included Albert Einstein, Dory and Nemo, and Spiderman. We also created a tic-tac-toe game out of single petri dishes. Using a UV flashlight, the children were able to look at the art work and the game as they glowed. This activity was supplemented with a poster to show how the genes are transferred from one organism to another.
DNA Origami
This activity allowed participants to fold paper into the shape of a coiled double helix. We hung these from the ceiling in the lab during TouchTomorrow and attendees were able to bring their origami home!
On July 20 we participated in the Women in Science summer camp hosted by WPI. This camp gives middle school girls the opportunity to learn more about different STEM fields. We had 30 girls come and learn about synthetic biology. Using activities adapted from the Synthetic Biology Teacher Curriculum designed by the iGEM Team at The College of William and Mary we were able to teach these girls about what we do every day as synthetic biologists.

Description
These three promoters are from the Anderson Promoter Collection, which is a library of constitutive sigma70 bacterial promoters. The strength of each promoter of the library has already been estimated in saturation growth phase cultures in LB, but here we provide the characterization of BBa_J23100 and BBa_J23118 in standard units (RPUs) in LB medium, in order to add experience and data for these BioBricks. BBa_J23101 is the reference standard promoter, so it has RPU=1 for definition.

 This scan was made the next morning of the eperiment. We only see signal on the lower chambers as lysis buffer was flown on the upper channel (closed chamber valve)
2.1 Interpretation
A couple of weeks after these RFP experiments, we sequenced the plasmid that was used to double check the part. We found out that the most important part of it, that is the CpxR sensor senquence, was missing. Thus this experiment is unconclusive and we could not give an explanation about the signal we obtained.
This image shows the deletion in the CpxR sensor coding sequence.
cpxR linked with GFP on the N terminal, induced by arabinose
08-21-2014
The aim of this experience was to induce CpxR expression by arabinose. The Cpxr is fused to a GFP reporter (BBa_K1486002) allowing us to determine if the protein is really expressed. The experiment was previously done on wet bench and this one repeats it on a microfluidic chip.

1.1 Material
-768 MITOMI chip
-Lysis buffer (30mM NaOH + 12% w/v SDS)
-LB with chloramphenicol
-LB with chloramphenicol and arabinose (5mM)
-Microfluidic material
-Scanner
-Microscope
-GenePix software for data analysis
-Plasmid with pBAD promoter followed by cpxR linked with GFP on the N-terminal ( BBa_K1486002 )
 
1.2 Method
Cells were inoculated and grown overnight in 3 ml LB medium with chloramphenicol.
The next morning the cells were loaded on chip and the upper half of the chip had a flow of LB with arabinose and chloramphenicol whereas the lower half of the chip had a flow of LB with only chloramphenicol.
The cycle was the following :
-take a scan
-close chamber valves and flow lysis for 10min
-close M2 and flow LB with arabinose and chloramphenicol for 5min
-open M2, close M1 and flow LB with only chloramphenicol for 5min
-open M1 and close the outlet and main inlet valve
-culture time of 40min
Repeat 6x for a total of 3h.

Elan_Vital_Korea,2015,Team:Elan Vital Korea#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," and data we gathered from them, we have developed the long-term education plan for primary and secondary school students.  We have reached the National Science Teachers’ Association of Korea, with more than 2,400 science teachers as its members, and established a communication and cooperation network.  We have provided some materials for use for education including blogs, Youtube videos, lecture videos, booklets, brochures and simple DNA extraction kits, etc.
Second, we have learned that policy makers and education and research bodies in Korea are not sufficiently informed of the recent developments of the synthetic biology, which resulted in lack of proper safety guidelines and articulation of legal, ethical and environmental implication-related discussions and awareness.  In an effort to change the condition, we have drafted the report of our findings and suggestions, and sent our concerns and recommendations to politicians (including members of the National Assembly of Korea) in charge of science and technology-related policymaking. In the process of researching the current policy environments and developing recommendations, we have contacted universities, research institutions and small- and medium-size enterprises in order to better understand their concerns.  We have also contacted journalists, who function as major contact point to the general public.  We have distributed summaries of the synthetic biology and iGEM.  In the process, we have persuaded some of them to be our sponsors.
Third, we have developed the public awareness strategy for our project, “Early Detection of Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Using Quorum Sensing”. Incidentally, Korea has been hit hard by MERS virus as late as June this year, which greatly heightened the public awareness – and fear – of the contagious pathogens, as well as the need to learn more of the cause and cure for those dreadful diseases.  We began our public awareness campaign by researching and studying the current methods of detecting and tackling the antibiotic-resistant bacteria from Korean CDC, hospital guidelines and related research papers. We have discovered that, compared to the strict and detailed action plan in place by the US CDC, the Korean CDC has not – yet – established networks of hospitals and nursing homes that need to be closely monitored and promptly intervened as need arises. Based on this finding, we have drafted letters and papers and sent them to Korean CDC and safety committees of hospitals.  We plan to continue our efforts on this area.
Fourth, we have put the strongest emphasis on the safe implementation of our project. Our project belongs to Risk Group 1, but we have observed the lab safety rules and guidelines very tightly, and promoted the importance of observing the lab safety based on deeper understanding of the biosafety guidelines.  We have developed the Youtube"

The current version of WikiFire+ not only automatically sends html files to the iGEM servers using the Python requests library, it also automatically checks for any css or javascript files these html files link to, automatically sending these to the servers as templates. It also automatically sends any images contained in the html to the servers, and fixes the links contained in the html to point to the correct pages. Essentially it allows iGEM wikis to be developed completely locally with a hassle-free, quick upload.
The WikiFire+ is implemented in python using particularly the requests library for sending data to the web, and the BeautifulSoup html parser for automatic sending of image, css and javascript files. The tool is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

InterLab study
Background
In order to compare results of similar experiments from different sources iGEM has proposed Interlab studies. It’s a set of experiments that teams can volunteer to do in order to deal with relative results issue. The aim is to improve the tools available to both the iGEM community and the synthetic biology community as a whole.  This year’s goal was to let different teams measure fluorescence level of GFP protein.  With minor difficulties we managed to complete the experiments and submit our results.
Overview
Work done in different labs can be hard to compare sometimes due to different measurement techniques or reporting methods. In order to address this issue iGEM has come up with Interlab studies which can be carried out by different teams around the world. Results of these studies are eventually combined to give understanding of relative issues arising during the process.
One of the big challenges in synthetic biology is that measurements of fluorescence usually cannot be compared because they are reported in different units or because different groups process data in different ways.Often one works around this by doing some sort of “relative expression” comparison; however, being unable to directly compare measurements makes it harder to debug engineered biological constructs, harder to effectively share constructs between labs, and harder even to just interpret your experimental controls.
This year iGEM had two protocols for measuring GFP fluorescence that would result in common, comparable units for teams to test out.
Results
Cell competency test
Before using our competent cells in our experiment, we had to use the Competent Cell Test Kit [1] provided by iGEM to test the efficiency of our competent cells. The"
Oxford,2017,Team:Oxford#Results Protein_-_-_TEXT.html," analysis showed that the induction of the TEV protease did indeed relieve quenching of the fluorescence. The levels of unquenched and Quenched+TEV protease did not differ significantly for IPTG levels of over 5µM, and even at 0µM the level of fluorescence was significantly higher in the strain with the TEV plasmid. These observations can be explained by analysing the dynamics using the time-course graph.
We used the statistical F-test (Figure 5) to show that there was a significant difference between Flu/Abs of the sfGFP+Quencher and the sfGFP+Quencher+TEV protease; by an F value of 26.3 which is larger than the critical value of 0.000124. This suggests that the TEV protease is able to relieve the quenching by cleavage of the linker between the sfGFP and the quencher.
This test has also shown a significant difference in Flu/Abs when the quencher is present compared to the no Quencher version of the part, as the F value is 58.7 which is larger than the critical value of 1.47x10-6.
Figure 5: ANOVA statistical tests to show the significance of our data.
As can be seen in Figure 6 below, until 200 minutes the strains appear to be acclimatising, and then induction begins to happen, this section of the graph is expanded below. From this graph it is clear that the level of induction does have an effect. The steady-state level of TEV protease produced is presumably different, and this leads to different rates of increase of sfGFP. Induction with only 5µM IPTG leads to a higher difference in fluorescence at 400 than at 600 minutes. The uninduced strain does not increase above the quenched strain until after 400 minutes, when it begins to climb. One interesting thing to consider is if the level of the sfGFP-quenching peptide reaches steady state in the cell, as can possibly be seen from the fluorescence of the non-quenched strain. This would mean that there is a maximum possible fluorescence level, and that over time the endpoints of all three induction levels will be equal.

Summary and Conclusions
Our Results
"
TU-Eindhoven,2012,Team:TU-Eindhoven#LEC#ModellingFirst_-_-_TEXT.html," the right options for MATLAB's ode15s-solver must be used to get valid results from the sensitivity analysis.
The most sensitive parameters for the concentration of the protein-calcium complex [CaB] are the total buffer concentration [B]total and the equilibrium calcium concentration of the pump [Ca2+]eq. The parameters for the calcium concentration [Ca2+] are approximately of the same sensitivity, except for the concentration at which the inactivation is halfway [K] and the constant extracellular calcium [Ca2+]ex, which are less sensitive.
The refresh rate, to change from one clearly visible image to the next, is dependent on both the release of the calcium into the extracellular environment and the release of the calcium by the buffer proteins. To decrease the equilibrium value of the concentration of the protein-calcium complex, the rate of the forward rate constant f and the backward rate constant b should be decreased with respect to the values we used (f/b = 106 mM-1).
Improvements
During the performed sensitivity analysis, the parameters are varied one by one. To improve the understanding of the sensitivity of the parameters, a design of experiments can be applied. The possible interactions between the parameters are taken into account by this type of analysis. Furthermore, to improve the model for the aim of the project, the model will have to be made compatible for yeast cells. Unfortunately, we discovered, due to the sensitivity analysis, that this model is unfit for the calcium homeostasis in yeast cells. Therefore, a completely new model has to be designed for yeast .

Moreover, 2014 PeKing didn’t construct the parts containing both holin and endolysin. We also failed for a couple of times but we finally constructed it and successfully displayed in E.coli ( BBa_K2350020 ). Not only this, we even grouped endolysin-holin’s construct with Nrt-A and created a new part ( BBa_K2350021 ). To prove that we have successfully made up an improve part, we have done some functional test by using lactose to induce this suicide mechanism and measure the OD value of the transformed E.coli. And the result is a totally big YES! We have finally made out a functional improved part.

What we are doing now in our project is not a one-step plan, we want to go further a step, and that’s why we add in the idea of pigment molecules transformation. Indigoidine, a bacterial natural product which displays in bright blue color and might be a new natural blue dye uses in industry, is the first pigment we try to transform into our cyanobacteria. This pigment we used is the existed parts of iGEM: BBa_K1152008 . This part is at first only can express in E.coli, and we furthermore improve it by constructing this pigment gene sequence with a backbone pPIGBACK, which can express in cyanobacteria ( BBa_K2350012 ).
See more detail: Pigments - Indigoidine (IndC)
CrtZ
As we said before, we are going a further step, and so on, not only blue pigment, we also try to use another type of pigment to show a different coloured algae. And what we used this time is a yellow pigment, Zeaxanthin, which is also a member of carotenoid families. CrtZ, the part we used was a part released in iGEM ( BBa_I742157 ) . Same with indigoidine, we also construct this part on our special designed backbone pPIGBACK so that it can be expressed in our microalgae and resulted in yellow microalgae.

As a result, a group of experiments from module 2 was changed to use GFP as an indicator of successful communication between IODs. The use of color indication in the further research proved advantageous (at least partially), and the use of color indicators will always be considered in later experiments.
A recommendation was made to test the agglutination on a slide. As a result, since we had the possibility to perform our experiments in microfluidics, we listened to this advice and used microfluidics as well as microscope slides in our agglutination experiments.

Multinational general public vs. biologists GMO survey
Team Chalmers Gothenburg offered us to participate in their GMO survey. We asked 63 biologists and 50 respondents from the general public to fill in the survey. Same thing was done in Sweden. Thanks to this, we had the opportunity to compare GMO knowledge in Sweden and Czech Republic. Big thanks belongs to the team Chalmers Gothenburg for statistical evaluation of all data.
Key outputs
The positive attitude and further interest of many respondents delighted us.
However, although anticipated, the difference in opinions between biologists and the general public is disturbing. On that account, we are going to arrange more lectures about synthetic biology at our university and also for the general public in Czech Republic.

Safety
We did not only wholeheartedly followed standard lab safety techniques and complied with the national GMO laboratory regulations but also considered the broader safety assumptions of our technology. We discussed our idea with non-biological specialists as well as experts, which enabled us to improve the design and get a better grasp of the notion our project idea transmits.

Staining
Gram and spore stains of Bacillus subtilis was desired to ensure that after transformation had occured the cells still gave a result that was expected. B. subtilis is a Gram-positive bacteria, and when a Gram-stain is performed on it a purple to dark blue colour is expected, where as Escherichia coli is Gram-negative and would stain red to a pink colour.  During a spore stain of B. subtilis the spores stain green and the cells stain pink. E. coli was used as a positive control to ensure that the stain worked, providing a colour that was expected, and that the bacteria was growing successfully in our lab.  Two Gram stains for each of E. coli, B. subtilis were performed, as well as two spore stains for B. subtilis were performed.  Before the stains were performed new streak plates of the bacteria were madeto incubate at 37 ° C overnight, ensuring that the bacteria came from fresh colonies.  The bacteriawere plated on regular LB agar plates for incubation.  The spores for B. subtilis were not streaked, as Israt and Anna Fei were taking care of the spores by changing the water in which they were stored to keep them maintained properly.

Nine sets of known aptamer (90np, 15 microliter, 100nmol/L) costs only about $135, and every set is sufficient for 250 microfluidic chips.
    c. During this phase we also need to rule out unknown influences on the device caused by switching to new assembly conditions, such as switching to fermentation flask instead of tightly controlled experiment chamber.
    d. During this phase preserving microbes will greatly affect the cost of production, and affordability is one of the most important characteristics of JACOB.
2. Medium Scale Trial
    a. Duration: 4-5 months
    b. When the production of microfluidic chip is resolved, how to prepare it for using will be on the agenda. Currently the chip we used for final packaging needs to be soaked in ethyl alcohol and acetone for about one hour, which pose a question for mass production.
We asked 博奥 mainly on how to control the cost of microfluidic chip production¬. From their experience we found that chips cost much more in the early development, but its cost diminishes quickly in later stages when mass production is reached, ranging from $0.1 to few dollars. However, there exist a conflict of material. In the iGEM version we picked optical cement instead of PMDS for its advantages of adequate solidification speed, feasibility, bio-inertia, and precision of altitude. However, PMDS production industries are much more matured. There is currently no companies offering mass production of optical cement microfluidic chips. Thus, we must decide the better material.

To verify the availability of a CRISPR software, the correctness of identifying  potential off-target number is a very important indicator. For the number of off-target sites for 14 sgRNA, we draw the following table for statistical analysis (here, we only count off-target sites of the PAM is NGG, because the total number of off-target sites of the other two software are inconsistent, although we can find the number of off-target sites containing PAM is NGG and NAG).

Week 17
10/13/13-10/19/13
We're back to doing more construction as we try to replace the pTet promoter in front of TBS2+GFP with our chosen Anderson Promoters. After a few issues, we managed to transform the promoters from the iGEM distribution kits and use Standard Assembly to assemble them together with TBS2+GFP which we PCR amplified out of our previous constructs. Our Standard Assemblies were successful, so we did contransformations of the Anderson Promoters+TBS2+GFP in pSB1A2 and our Riboswitch2+TAL8 RiboTAL in pSB3K3 . We had hoped to start testing our new constructs in the Tecan on Thursday, but due to the lack of/slow growing colonies for our cotransformations testing will have to be held off. Tecan testing will start next week, due to other unforeseen circumstances.
Week 18
10/20/13-10/26/13
This week was full of Tecan runs. With all of our constructs contransformed and stored as glycerol stocks, it was just of matter of getting them all onto plates and finding time to run them in the Tecan for 8-10 hours. All of our runs were done in triplicate with 6 different arabinose concentrations and 5 different theophylline concentrations. Our run schedule went something like this:
Monday
J23100+TBS2GFP // R2T8
Tuesday
J23109+TBS2GFP // R2T8 and J23105+TBS2GFP // R2T8
Wednesday
J23106+TBS2GFP // R2T8 and J23101+TBS2GFP // R2T8
Thursday
J23106+TBS2GFP // R2T8
Friday
J23105+TBS2GFP // R2T8
Not all of our runs gave us satisfactory data, so some were redone. Overall our data is looking good. A lot of work is now going into analyzing our data and using it to improve our model.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!

The final form of DeTaXion will give a quantifiable BRET signal, which will be measured as the change in the ratio of RLuc over eYFP luminescence (R/Y). In our experiments we defined a positive BRET signal as a change in R/Y of at least 0.5% because this has been shown to represent a detectable BRET signal (Cui et al., 2014; Shimizu, Delalez, Pichler, & Berg, 2006).
Results
Figure 5: Expression of eYFP::CheY. (A) E. coli DH5 transformed with eYFP::CheY and  (BBa_K2736101 ) and CheZ::RLuc (BBa_K2736103 ). (B) E. coli UU1250 transformed with eYFP::CheY and  (BBa_K2736101 ) and CheZ::RLuc (BBa_K2736103 ). Scale bars are 10 um.
The coding sequences of the BRET pair proteins were created by Gibson assembly of the parts BBa_K569017 and BBa_I15017 , and BBa_K629003 and BBa_I159001 to create eYFP::CheY (part BBa_K2736100 ), and CheZ::RLuc (part BBa_K2736102 ) respectively. Subsequently, 3A assembly was used to add the promoter part BBa_K608003 to these coding sequences (parts BBa_K2736101 and BBa_K2736103 respectively). The resulting vectors were transformed to either E. coli DH5α, which expresses wild type Tar, or E. coli strain UU1250, which lacks the Tar gene.
To confirm expression of eYFP::CheY we imaged bacteria by fluorescence microscopy. Expression of YFP was clearly detectable, confirming the presence of eYFP::CheY (Figure 5).
We next incubated the bacterial cells in PBS containing 7.5 µM coelenterazine (CAS# 55779-48-1 Nanolight #3031), the substrate for Renilla luciferase. However, we did not observe any emission of light, neither by immunofluorescence microscopy nor using a photospectrometer. We hypothesized that this result was due to the low permeability of coelenterazine through the cell wall. However, due to time constraints we were unable to further investigate this.

I took a look of code from NetworkX and pygraph but made modifications and left out everything we have no need for. I included a bidirectional dijkstra algorithm to make the shortest path calculation go extremely fast (less than a second!).

This week I worked on creating a script that would determine whether or not the reaction is reversible. I also worked on a few administrative tasks. I spoke with the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Research to discuss what kind of support they could provide us. I also took a look at a few grants that we could apply for in order to get funding for next year.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

In harmony with the BioTROJAN conception of caring about a local issue (vector-borne diseases), one of our main human practices approach (see all our approaches on Human Practices - Overview ) was based on to care about another serious brazilian issue: scarcity of quality materials for scientific and educational purpose in our language.
We brought to portuguese speaking community scientific and educational materials in which they can get interesting and confiable information, besides how they can improve such materials! For this purpose we translated BioMech, a high quality, iGEM developed, synbio game and we organized the first brazilian edit-a-thon for biology related subject.
BioMech
BioMech is a board game that integrates concepts of molecular and cellular biology along with creativity to create solutions to as more diverse situations and all of it in a synthetic biology approach! The game was developed by the iGEM team of University of Exeter and presented on the last iGEM competition (2016). One of our current members was there and played the game, it was such a cool experience that he introduced us to the game this year. We loved BioMech as well so we asked to the Exter team it we could use it, and they agreed. So we translated the game from English to Brazilian Portuguese, version that can be accessed and downloaded here.
Essentially on BioMech the players are supposed to find a synthetic biology solution for a given situation. The situations they have to deal with go from light production to saving an entire city from hunger! They should"

An informative digestion was performed, where a presence of two bands, one of which at ~800 bp would indicate an unsuccessful reaction. The gel shows only a single band in each well, signifying a removed resistance gene.
Gentamicin resistance removal was confirmed with a gel showing the results from a SphI restriction digestion of C18 and R6 plasmids containing cumate.
Figure 13. Informative digestion of C18 and R6 with Gm gene (C18/R6 Gm+) and C18 and R6 without Gm gene (C18/R6 Gm-) using SphI. SphI restriction site flanks the Gm gene.

Hypothesis 1: Cloning of AsR pH-sensitive promoter with colicin and double terminator into pSB1C3
We attempted to clone the AsR promoter with its native RBS BBa_K1231000 obtained from iGEM HQ with colicin E2 and double terminator into a pSB1C3 backbone. The idea is to create a complete system that would be controlled by a pH gradient, potentially applicable in an acidic environment (e.g. the stomach).
Digestion was performed to remove the backbone and isolate the fragment of interest. The AsR promoter has a length of 140 bp. However, the gel shows the AsR promoter with a length of 1300 bp.

The lunch lecture was about iGEM and our project and was conducted for Chalmers students, primarily biotechnology students. We answered questions and encouraged the students to get interested in synthetic biology, to support us and join the team next year.
Even though the lunch lecture was great, the team was not content with only reaching out to biotechnology students. Therefore we reached out to Chalmers Public Relations section and they made a mini series in three parts which they distributed on their Facebook page. This way, we reached a broader crowd, both within and outside the university. In the two first episodes we explain our project, our achievements and plan for the Jamboree in Boston. The last episode will be released after Boston, where the viewers will see how great the Jamboree in Boston was.
Public outreach
Lecture about synthetic biology with team iGEM Lund
We collaborated with team iGEM Lund and held a lecture about synthetic biology in Lund at Lunds University’s 350 year anniversary. The lecture was open for the public and the information was kept at a popular scientific level. The lecture started with the history of traditional genetic engineering and continued with the description of synthetic biology. When the audience understood the concept of synthetic biology, each iGEM team presented their own project and how they used synthetic biology.
The lecture continued with future applications of synthetic biology and the ethical aspects were discussed. Research and responsibility goes hand in hand and the main message of this part was that it is important to think and discuss ethical dilemmas and questions before conducting any experiment. Different views on different subjects were presented in a natural way to let the audience create their own opinion. The lecture ended with a talk about scientific communication; how the communication work between researchers and the public today and why it is important to establish such a conversation.
After the lecture, the audience had the possibility to talk with the speakers and either ask questions or discuss specific subjects. There were questions about the project and some discussion about ethics, showing that the audience got interested and started to form their own opinions.
Lung cancer survey
To further reach out to the public and to get their help when designing a screening program, we created a survey about lung cancer screening program. We wanted to see what the public thought about having regular examinations for lung cancer, similar to how we screen for breast cancer in Sweden. We also investigated if the public thought that the tax money should finance or subsidized these screenings. This survey was open for everyone to answer and spread via different communication channels. A few more results from the survey is presented in Integrated human practices, screening program .

High School Sharing session
Inspiration can be the best flower of our research.
Research can be limited when we are only busy by ourselves with our own development while to communicate with other groups surely will do us a great favor in widering our mind, so does the sharing meeting with our high school fellows. We specially made a chance to share with high schoolers the basic genetic knowledge and present them the work we do. Vivid pictures and live videos have attracted them deeply into the world of genetical engerneering, and when we played a game with each of us leading a small group of them and helping them explain the detailed work of genes, they showed great interest in discovering the new world. This is indeed what we need, to gather every single inspiration to prolong our research and promise our program a better day.
United, and we are stronger.
We have communicated with many schools, such as Beijing University, Fudan University, Harbin University, Xiamen University during the time when we are undergoing our research, sometimes they come along to meet us and we can talk about the work we are now busying with, sometimes they can provide us with some stuff or instruments which we are lack of. Cooperation benifits each other. We learn from one another, either technically or theoretically. Every team joins iGEM to compete, but what they want isn't only about winning the game, there're something about a better day, a better day when every partner fullfills his or her dream of getting the hang of reconstructing the biology system. It's a great dream, so we want to be united"

Leader from the start similar to that of a deity it might be difficult to overstate the contribution made to this project by Raffy. An avid reader of literature during project choice and development and a master biobrick builder on SnapGene Raffy’s contribution continued through to the practical fulfillment of our ideas. Even if she is covert in her acquisition of coffee from Elaine’s office she was not with her hard work in the lab, on the wiki and in organising us as a team.

Despite his degree designation clearly stating ""Chemistry"", Leon has long fallen to the dark side since taking iGEM on and now chiefly regards himself as a synthetic biologist through-and-through.
When Raffy is occupied with other engagements, the helm of the team is typically Leon's to take up, but being the team's resident lab nerd/guru he'd mostly rather be left alone by the bench to think about new experiments. Leon was the mastermind behind the bulk of the experimental molecular and microbiology, having been responsible for the literature review and BioBrick design together with Raffy since the project's inception, all the way through to the planning, delegation, and execution"

In this time, we used a  stronger colony from a new plate with revived strain. As we expected,  fluorescence intensity of all samples kept at higher levels than ones of  experiment on Wednesday. Both top value and the time when it appears of every  sample with specific arabinose concentration are almost parallel with previous  ones. Besides, we also used a new type of clear plate with a cap to take  kinetic fluorescence measurements with the same gradient of arabinose  concentration after we finished interval test.  But curves showed us an unsatisfying result – top values were totally  low and tendencies of fluorescence intensity were not obvious. We thought the  cap of the plate made the strain grew in an oxygen-limited environment so that  green fluorescence proteins could not be oxided So far, tests about fluorescence  intensity of the strain with a plasmid called PBADRLT have nearly  been finished.

Background
Planning Biobrick construction is perhaps the most important iGEM activities. To do this, participants have to be able to understand constructs designed by other teams and go on to design their own. This includes knowledge on what will happen when a specific BioBrick promoter is connected to a gene, and further when such complex parts are combined.
In addition, in order to reach a full understanding of how a developed construct may behave, we believe it is important for one to be able to create an image of how protein concentrations may evolve in time. We have found that this is often especially difficult for students getting started with iGEM, at which time many seem to have a fuzzy image of how protein production could be 'on' or 'off.' As the project proceeds, students may need to assess the feasibility of the constructs they intend to create (for have already created). Many teams do not get around to doing this or in some cases attempt this at a stage when construction has already ended and it is too late to turn back. If you open a textbook on systems biology to learn the dynamics, students may find themselves put off by the mathematical knowledge required or the volume of the text, often unnecessary for a simple iGEM project. So it would be helpful if there is a tutorial from which beginners can learn sufficient information about gene network dynamics for an iGEM project. Such aid should result in more teams being able to predict and to test the behavior of their constructs,  leading to improvement of the quality of the parts submitted.
We have also created a tutorial for the purpose of helping users understanding what modeling is and what sort of information can be gained from it, as well as creating their own model. We have noticed that many iGEM participants want to make models for their project,  and also that iGEM HQ is recommending modeling. However, large number of students do not even know what modeling is, and tend to leave it up to members who have technical skills, if present. We wanted to make a tutorial for such people to learn what can be achieved by modeling. This basic program will hopefully be a sufficient stepping stone before beginners move on to more advance software such as Matlab.

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Boswell Wastewater Treatment Plant
Not all WWTPs are as large as the one in Taipei. One of our advisors (Jude Clapper) went to visit the Boswell WWTP in rural southwestern Pennsylvania. We learned that the same processes that occur in the Taipei Dihua WWTP also occur in the Boswell WWTP, but with different water flow rates and waste quantities. Since both facilities use a similar water purification process, we were inspired to create our current prototype design--a rotating polymeric bioreactor coated in biofilm--which is applicable to both WWTPs. This prototype will be placed in the secondary sedimentation tank, where the majority of organic solids have been removed and only smaller particles exist. The plant manager, Robert J. Blough, also confirmed that since our project is bacteria-based, it will be killed by UV light and chlorine in the disinfection tank, similar to the Dihua WWTP, before the water turns into effluent and goes to the rivers and oceans.

Taipei Museum of Drinking Water
We visited the Taipei Museum of Drinking Water hoping to find out more about how tap water is treated. We learned that water filtration methods vary in different areas of Taiwan, with Taipei’s filtration method being the simplest since the water is relatively clean compared to other regions, such as Kaohsiung, where the city is heavily industrialized. In Taipei, the source of tap water comes from a protected zone upstream of Xindian river. We also learned that they use sedimentation tanks and flocculation to help clump up and remove impurities. Due to the lack of a disinfection step, however, we realized that our project would not be applicable here, since our project depends on the use of E. coli bacteria. (Whole team activity)

Summary of Week 2: June 12 - June 18
In the second week we attempted midipreps instead of minipreps of our available cell stocks. Midipreps were unsuccessful, likely due to centrifuge limitations. LR reactions to generate more usable promoter-gene pair parts continued, expanding to include the CI434-VP16, LexA-VP16, and Mnt-VP16 genes, whose expressed proteins activate the appropriate corresponding minCMV promoters. Most of the LRs done were not successful, reason unknown at this time.

(Consider the categories of risk listed in parts a-d of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the environment, and malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
Our plan is to make pens with E. coli in ink as a result transduction. If children lick the pen, they might mistakenly intake E. coli.
Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them.
In order to deactivate E. coli, we grind E. coli containing the parts we developed.

Lethbridge,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"aceous mold from the fungi family). Dextranase, by degrading parts of the EPS matrix would allow for Mnase to further seep into the biofilm, and thus increase the overall efficiency of the mixture.   What we are doing differently. Past projects have targeted the bonds within the biofilm structure to disperse the biofilms, but since there is a variety of major bonds found within different biofilms, the effects of the construct have been limited to some bacterial species. But, by targeting the extracellular DNA and the exopolysaccharide matrix (common components of almost every biofilm), our aim is to create a general all-purpose dispersant, capable of working on a variety of biofilms, thriving in a variety of settings.  Extracellular Polymeric Substance Matrix: Sticky Stuff! The bacteria in the biofilm are surrounded by an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix. This matrix is comprised of water, which hydrates the cells; various sugars, to provide nutrients and the sticky structure of the biofilm; proteins, which are typically enzymes; lipids; and extracellular DNA, which serves as a structural component of the biofilms. The EPS matrix constitutes 50-90% of a biofilm’s organic matter. The purpose of the EPS matrix is to adhere the bacteria to a surface and protect the biofilm against any harsh environmental conditions. The matrix also provides a “transport system” so that nutrients, water, and enzymes can move around the structure to meet the needs of each cell.  The production of the EPS matrix is, in part, regulated by quorum sensing; this is a way for bacteria to communicate with each other via chemical signalling molecules. Like a “quorum”, once there are enough bacteria, the bacteria are able to communicate with each other to collectively express a gene, in this is case they would be producing the EPS.

Uppsala,2017,Team:Uppsala#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," dialdehyde, another ligand, the common acetaldehyde was chosen to be able to compare the enzyme's specificity. Acetaldehyde was run in a separate simulation to crocetin dialdehyde.
Before the pulling simulations can be started, it is required to select an initial configuration where the ligand is bound to the active site of the enzyme. This position was found by docking the ligands with one subunit from the CsADH2946 tetramer. The location of the active site was found by looking at the template molecule for the homology modeling (PDB entry 4fqf) (8). The active site of this homology template can be found at a loop containing three cysteines (C301, C302 and C303). In our homology model that corresponded to C337, C338 and C339, and docking was therefore performed in the patch of the protein where this loop can be found. The docking of both ligands were done using SwissDock (9, 10), where the structure used for CsADH2946 was an equilibrated conformation 40 ns into the production MD simulation. The best docked structure where the ligand was in close contact with the triple cystein loop was then chosen as starting configuration for the pulling simulation.
Pulling
Steered molecular dynamics (pulling) is a way of estimating the binding affinity between a protein and a ligand. We based our simulations on a previously defined protocol by Justin Lemkul (11). Before starting the simulation we needed to select a trajectory in which the ligands were to be pulled. The choice of trajectory was based on a path that was not obstructed by any residues. After being equilibrated for 200 ps, the pulling simulation was run for 8000 picoseconds pulling the ligands at a velocity of 0.25 nm/ns. The results from the simulation can be seen in the movies below (figure 4) and in figure 5.

Then, an acyl-homoserine latone (AHL), 3OC12HSL from LasI in CELL-B will bind with LasR, lighting the green fluorescence and inducing the expression of LuxI, who synthesize 3OC6HSL. C6 accumulates in the culture and permeates into CELL-B, where it binds with LuxR. This process activates the expression of TetR and CFP, and therefore, represses LasI to produce C12.
Let’s have a review of the principle of oscillation, that is, A induces B, B represses B2, and B2 induces A, forming a feedback network with a delay part. Corresponding to the network is the three lines of gene, based on the interactions of C6/Lux, C12/Las and TetR/aTc.
When the concentration of C12 is high and C6 is low in the very beginning, luxI is intended to produce C6. As C6 mounts up, tetR starts to restrain the expression of C12. Then, under a certain rate of degradation, C12 decreases, resulting in the same decrease of C6. Once C6 is less than the threshold, tetR stops repression, and C12 is generated again. All in all, the oscillation begins.
3. Project Highlights
Several oscillation systems have been established by scientists, and our ECHO is not alone. But we must say that, ECHO is special and, to some extent, unique. So, besides the basic functions of an oscillator, what else can our system achieve?
In our expectation, ECHO is not just a single oscillator. Parameters that determine the property of an oscillation is the period and the phase, and we hope to maneuver each of the three independently.
The period of the cycle is up to the reaction rate. Suggest we want to elongate the period, so we need to slow down the rate. In our system, we use aTc to generate a delay. The molecule aTc will bind with TetR once it’s added into the culture, which results in the anti-repression of Line B2, thus, much more time is needed for the procedure. In that way, we realize a longer period.
As for the phase adjustment, we focus on the accumulation of AHLs and try to change the degradation. We design an extra gene, pBad, to generate AHLs under commands. When promoter pBad is activated by arabinose, C12 is produced to counteract the degradation. That delay a certain"

For children, probiotics are the important method to maintain remission. But for adult patients, it is still hard to observe this effect. Actually, intestinal flora is in large quantities and very complicated. Therapeutic mechanism of supplementary micro ecological preparation (probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, etc.) is not clear and sometimes it is hard to determine the clinical effects.
A2: Intestinal microecology is one of the factor causing inflammatory bowel disease. Treating inflammatory bowel disease completely through changing intestinal microecology still have a long way to go. For example, fecal bacteria transplantation is effective only in a few patients. (But for the inflammatory bowel disease with the concurrency of infection of clostridium, it is the first-line therapy.) Personally, treating inflammatory bowel disease in the direction of intestinal microecology is very promising.

This survey consists of three major parts: intestinal diseases, gut flora and synthetic biology. As people know life-related diseases, i.e. intestinal tract diseases, better than merely intestinal diseases, the survey is needed to start from a boarder aspect and be narrowed to intestinal diseases.
363 shares of answers are received, with 81.82% of which have no idea about iGEM. People above 40 years old contribute to 46.55% of all answers and people from 26~40 take up 15.43%. People below 26 account for 15.43%. Participants come from all walks of life, with only 36.36% of them being students.
In the first part we investigated people’s cognition in intestinal diseases. People believe that cancer and AIDS are the most severe diseases. Heart attack ranked the third, followed by Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s, then the pneumonia. Intestinal tract diseases are among the least severe common diseases, as expected. However, 84.3% of participants have witnessed the suffering of intestinal tract diseases, with the cost of treatment covers a long range. 8.82% cost is below ¥100, 29.41% ¥100~500, 24.18% ¥500~1000 and 23.2% beyond ¥2000 . Only 6.21% participants claim that 1~2 days are needed to cure the disease, while different people suffer from various intestinal tract diseases, with the time required to cure ranging from days to more than half a year. Furthermore, 50% people get the diseases once or twice, while the rest suffer more often. Among all the intestinal tract diseases"

Based on what we got, we can draw the conclusion that we used three proteins, SasA, CikA and RpaA to connect the KaiC’s oscillators with the output signal. But the big step in utilization of circadian in synthetic biology still needs further work and more efforts to realize it.

Inoculation:
The conidia are harvested by adding 5 ml of MM and firmly rub with a sterile Grigalsky spatula. The conidial suspension is pipetted to a sterile 500 ml shake flask containing 100 ml MM. The cultures are incubated at 30 °C with 150 rpm of shaking over night (14-20 hours).
Mycelial harvest:
A funnel with a sterile Mira cloth (filter) is used to harvest mycelia. To remove residual glucose from mycelia the biomass are washed with Aspergillus protoplastationbuffer (APB).
The filtered biomass is transferred to a new Falcon tube with a sterile spoon.
Protoplastation:
Mycellium is resuspended in 10 ml filter-sterillized(0.45μm filters) APB containing 40 mg Glucanex/ml. The Glucanex is dissolved in APB with gentle magnetic stirring less than 100/min.
Mycelia with dissolved Glucanex are mixed at 30 °C with 150 rpm of shaking for 2-3 hours.
Protoplast solutions are diluted in APB adding up to 40 ml mark. An overlay of max. 5ml Aspergillus transformation buffer (ATB) diluted to ½x with sterile MilliQ-water is carefully placed on top of the APB.
Centrifuged at 13 min 3000 RCF in Sorvall centrifuge. Protoplates should be observed as a halo of with slurry in the interphase of the two liquids.
Withdraw of the protoplasts are done with pipette and placed in a Falcon tube.
ATB is added up to 40 ml mark. Centrifuge at 300 RCF in 13 min and supernatanted are discarded.
The protoplastes are resuspended in 1 ml ATB with a 5 ml pipette.
Genetic transformation:
Aliquotes of 50 μl are transferred to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube containgen 10 μl of DNA for transformation.
Protoplast and DNA are incubated at room temperature for at least 30 min.
Protoplat and DNA suspension are added to 1 ml PCT in a 15 ml tube and shake gently.
Incubate for 1-5 min at room temperature.
Dilute in 3 ml ATB. The tube is filled with molten transformation medium (TM) agar (temperature of 40-"
Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," help in characterising the enzyme. In order to have the final product, an enzyme capsule capable of detoxifying a bucket of water, these pieces of information are crucial.
Our localization analysis together with the final enzyme activity assay gave us quite conclusive results about the two constructs we had used in these experiments. MC-degrading activity was observed in the enzyme samples taken from the fraction containing the inclusion bodies, plasma membrane and cell wall as well as from the post-refolding fraction containing the plasma membrane and cell wall. This suggests that active forms of the enzyme are localized in the plasma membrane. There is a possibility that the refolding step does not refold all of the inclusion bodies, which could mean that even though our enzyme localizes into the plasma membrane and or the cell wall after refolding, it could actually still be partially in the inclusion bodies. Yet, it is highly unlikely that a protein in the inclusion bodies would work properly, i.e. have activity. Therefore, the activity results give quite conclusive information about the enzymes’ likely localization.
It seems that the MlrA without the mating factor α has a slightly higher activity than the MlrA with the mating factor α. The activity of both constructs had been analysed from the insoluble fraction after cell lysis since they localized mostly there. However, in the first expression of the yeast constructs, there was also some MlrA without secretion tag localized in the soluble fraction. Since this was not the case in the second expression, we decided not to analyse the soluble fractions from the second expression due to resource constraints. In addition, our hypothesis was that if the enzyme is localized in the membranes, it probably needs the membrane conditions in order to function properly. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see what kind of activity the soluble fraction would have given, since our positive control was from the soluble fraction of E. coli .
If we had more time, we would have wanted to test our hypothesis about the enzyme needing membrane conditions to function properly. To test this, we would have analysed the activity of the soluble fraction as well as purified the plasma membranes from the fraction containing them and the cell wall. If the hypothesis had been correct, we would have tried to quantify the amount of MlrA in one plasma membrane in order to be able to calculate the amount needed for the detoxification of a certain volume of water. However, if it seemed that the soluble fraction had higher activity, optimization of the purification process would have been needed.
Our plan was to have a final product composed of the microcystinase and lysozyme. If we had obtained results of the quantification of produced"

Our Project for this summer: Remediation.
During this summer we wanted to work on an iGEM project, which has the potential to become a real world application, since we believe that it is an important step for Synthetic Biology to provide alternative solutions for global problems. For this reason we focused on Bioremediation: The use of organisms to remove emissions caused by humans and to bring the environment back to its natural state. As water is a resource which is absolutely essential for all living organisms, we decided to focus on the pollution of aquatic ecosystems.
Choice of the appropriate chassis for a water filter
Remediation is not new to iGEM, in fact it is a topic the iGEM community has worked on for nearly 10 years now. Therefore a set of promising BioBricks was already available in the Parts Registry, which we wanted to use in order to increase the knowledge on these effector proteins. Having found suitable effector proteins, we discussed about the most suitable chassis for our application. Most of the previous projects on Bioremediation were based on E. coli, whereas we decided to use a plant instead. Photosynthesis carried out by the plants will allow the water filter to maintain and renew itself without the addition of any nutrients. We considered algae such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Bryophytes such as Physcomitrella patens and higher plants like Arabidopsis thaliana. In the end Physcomitrella patens was the chassis of choice as it already grows in a filter-like structure and can be cultivated in terrestric as well as in aquatic conditions. Additionally it is a well established organism in biotechnology. Working with Physcomitrella patens is not easy considering the 1-2"

With its roots dating back to the former University of Toulouse, founded in 1229, Toulouse III – Université Paul Sabatier was officially created in 1969 by merging the former Faculties of Medecine, Pharmacy and Science. Today, the Toulouse III - Université Paul Sabatier is one of the leading universities in France, renowned for its scientific influence, the diversity of its laboratories, and the courses it offers in the fields of science, health, sport, technology and engineering.
With 14,000 alumni, INSA Toulouse is an international, multidisciplinary, state engineering school recognized for the excellence of its five-year curriculum. Created in 1963, it has made a priority out of developing its international dimension as INSA Toulouse has worked to attract many foreign students and developed international programs. Aside from training engineers, its mission includes developing ongoing training, scientific research as well as its valorization, which is why it offers research masters and PhDs.
INSA Lyon is a leading engineering school with strong humanist values that have formed the basis of its business model for more than 50 years. Created in 1957 by philosopher Gaston Berger and Rector Jean Capelle, INSA Lyon is the oldest and largest of the six schools making up the INSA Group. INSA engineers lead careers built around a logic of high adaptability, a pioneering approach to science and technology, and a strong sense of social responsibility. This hallmark of the INSA Lyon model is a living tribute to its two founders. It is to them that we owe the humanist commitment of the INSA schools, and their openness to different origins, cultures and social backgrounds.
