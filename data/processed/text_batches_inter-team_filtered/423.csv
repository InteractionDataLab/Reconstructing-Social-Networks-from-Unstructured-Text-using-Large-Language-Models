The NEPTUNE Flow
Neptune abstracts a very intricate workflow to provide an intuitive experience for its user. Below is a detailed depiction of all of the components that are under Neptune's hood.
Each of BostonU Hardware Team's members played an integral part in the success of Neptune's development.
Liquid Flow Relations & User Constraints File | Shane McCormack
In order to increase accessibility of our tool (and microfluidics in general), a method for describing microfluidics in a few simple lines was formed! This standard consists of Liquid Flow Relations (or LFR), and the User Constraints File (or UCF). The LFR file is where the user describes the inputs, outputs, and tells of any operations which occur on those inputs and outputs. These operations are described as symbols on the LFR, but are informed by the UCF. The few lines of LFR are the only things needed to run a chip through Neptune; a sample UCF is provided with Neptune that can be fine-tuned, but will not need to be written in its entirety.
The UCF can be thought of as a library of microfluidic components where, once a component is defined, it will never have to be written again! In more detail, once a component is defined inside the UCF, all subsequent LFR files can utilize the symbol the component is linked to without redefining the details of the component. The UCF leverages the MINT standard of describing parametric microfluidics. This parametrization unlocks great potential in the rapid prototyping of designs, where one number can be changed in the UCF, and all subsequent designs will have the updated component! For example, if our fictional synthetic biologist Dr. Ali found that his mixer's bends were too short in length, with one number edit in the UCF he could fix every bend of every mixer in all of his designs thereafter! This is far more accessible than redrawing every bend by hand on AutoCAD"

Introduction
Please take a look at our journey through the development of our simulation. We hope future iGEM teams will be able to take inspiration from our approach.
Week 23/06 - 29/06
We made a start on modelling the Brownian motion of the toehold switches and RNA using MATLAB. Many hours were spent toiling over getting the simulation just right, it seemed every time we thought we fixed something it caused something else to go wrong. Thankfully, by the end of the week we had a basic ‘working’ 3D model of the brownian motion, although it only worked using a few of each of the molecules (laptops don’t have much computing power surprisingly - time to look into accessing the university supercomputers!).
The main aims for the model this week were:
Making individual toehold and RNAs bind irreversibly to each other only.
Initially creating a 2D simulation which could then easily transferred to 3D using plot3 statements.
Week 30/06 - 06/07
After speaking to the lab and getting a long list of requirements, the simulation got more complicated as we started to build a list of variables within the system as well as an accurate description of how the system should behave. Achieving this included:
Getting the complexes to split after being combined for some time, as realistically the combined toehold and RNA would not stay bound indefinitely. This was achieved through changing the way the coordinates were generated after the split - they were randomly created after splitting for the number of remaining time steps. However, this also broke our code so we lost a few days trying to fix it
Establishing which variables had values that could be researched, finding these values and applying them to our model. These included:
Binding distances
Viscosities
Temperature
Small tweaks to make the simulation more realistic, this included incorporating a spherical binding site"

Safety training received
Prior to the researches of the project, our team members received all basic trainings on biosafety and laboratory safety in turn ,lectured by professors in the laboratory.The safety training included  many aspects, such as the proper usage of all the equipments, how to deal with the experimental rubbish correctly, and wear rubber gloves, lab coats when making operations. Before using the super-clean bench,we must sterilize,etc.
Environment safety issue and biosafety group
Hela cells are commonly studied in labs, and they are not generally considered to be dangerous. Minor risks are contained in our research since the organism and plasmids, which causes no severe infection to human and animals, will be handled properly by well-trained personnel after every and each experiment, and the chemicals in frequent use are proved to be friendly, except EB ,which is separated along with related devices in a special section, the contact with which requires such protections as a pair of rubber gloves. Thus no major safety problem will possibly be encountered, which will be under control if they would emerge. We are supported and financed by Department of Automation, instructed and supervised by its professors and engineers studying life sciences. And laboratory assistants give us quite a lot of instructive suggestions including problems on biosafety. safety form 2(part1) safety form 2(part2)

New Database Language
A new language called MoDeL (Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language) is proposed for automatic modeling of biological system. Due to introducing of novel concepts of species and reaction templates, which are two main components in MoDeL, interactions between species need not to be completely provided and thus making automation possible.

Demos of Automatic Modeling
To show results of our program, some classical genetic regulatory networks are provided as demos, including toggle switch, repressilator as well as quorum-sensing oscillator. Each selected demo, representing a certain pattern of reaction network in biological process, is carefully designed to cover all our features as much as possible. [Learn More]
Human Practice
We started a long term human practice, “the C project”, since this summer to explore the approaches of promotion of synthetic biology. “the C project”, as we call, consists of three parts: Curriculum, Communication and Community. All three parts are carefully designed and organized. [Learn More]

Week of June 17th-24th June 17th: First general meeting with lab volunteers, addressing general lab etiquettes and safety procedures. Explained the general lab working outline and project design. Exchanged contact information and constructed a lab schedule for volunteers and lab leaders.
June 18th: Lab leader (Emily) inoculated parts 118-PSB1C3 backbone(Cmr), 119-InL(Ampr), 120-InR(Ampr), 121-GFPR(Ampr),122-GFPL(Ampr) and 123-Lox (Ampr). All parts except 118 are in puc57, which is ampicillin resistant. Cultures inoculated in LB broth, incubated at 37° C overnight.
June 19th: Volunteers invited into the lab with a brief opening and orientation. Two volunteers trained and conducted miniprep of overnight cultures. Samples are quantified using Nanodrop Spectrophotometer
June 24th: Digested samples (118-122) with Fermentas Fast-digest restriction enzymes EcoR1 and Pst1 to subclone parts 119-122 into PSB1C3 (118). Digestion was incubated at 37° C for an hour (may be too long, but no star activities detected).
A diagnostic gel then follows by loading the cut samples along with the uncut minipreps for comparison.
129bp band observed for InL (119), 172bp observed for InR (120). 545bp and 399bps are observed for GFPL (122) and GFPR (121) respectively. Differences observed between the undigested and digested samples.
June 27th:  Run the sample gel as last time but with no control. Gel extracted samples using Biobasic and fermentas binding buffers.
June 28th: Nanodrop results show very low concentration (less than 1uL) for InL and 2. Gel extraction need to be repeated
June 29th: Gel extraction repeated and concentration greatly increased. Enough for ligation
July 4th: Ligation using 1:3 vector to insert ratio in moles. InL, InR, GFPL and GFPR are ligated into PSB1C3 with vector+ ligase control and vector only control. The ligation tubes are incubated overnight at room temperature.

Using NUPACK, we checked our switches had no base pairing in the ribosome binding site in both the off and on state and minimal secondary structure around the start codon in the on state. We also modelled the bound state, ensuring the structure around the RBS and start codon was correct in both the off and on state.
Having demonstrated that our design would work, we minimized the |∆GRBS-Linker|  via site directed mutagenesis (varying the sequence at specific sites). Making the |∆GRBS-Linker| as close to zero as possible maximizes the toehold switch output. This is discussed in more depth along with the other important parameters for toehold switch design on the design page .
However, NUPACK struggled to predict the specificity of the second series of switches as they had multi-step reactions. Additionally, we found that NUPACK was unable to match experimental data for molecular beacon specificity in our new form of riboregulators. Despite this, NUPACK  was suitable for accurately designing our first series of switches due to their simpler and more predictable nature.

But we were happy to see that, at the end of our presentation, they were enthusiastic to learn more about this branch of biology and its applications. They also asked to have more information about medicines created using GMOs.
Our presentation had another unexpected advantage for them: they did not know how efficient their hand-washing was. Indeed, we asked them to put their soap- and sanitiser-washed hands on a Petri dish and found that bacteria were very abundant on them. That’s why we proposed to the management to regularly remind the residents to clean their hands severals times a day, especially in the autumn and winter period when transmissible diseases are prolific and potentially dangerous for the elderly targets.

A VIDEO GAME FOR EVERYONE
We do believe iGEM is much more about straight science, but also about having fun with it. With that in mind we decided to produce a game as tool for disclosing of our project and for education purpose of subjects concerning molecular biology. Thus, we have chosen Stencyl as a platform to our game since it is a free tool aimed to education of computational thinking and an interactive community. Help ‘Pep’ to survive upon a Phage infection in “PHAGE WARS”. Tip: Pause the game and explore the actors with your mouse.

Design of Plate Practice Sequences
While we wait for the chip to come in, we have a number of techniques and protocols that we can practice on beforehand, so that when the chip comes we'll be ready to go to use what they give us.  We will be practicing the following techniques:
Cutting ZF1 out of our oligos
Inserting ZF1 into the expression plasmid in between the omega subunit and the linker before F2
Verifying that combination of our F1 from the oligo with the plasmid produces a viable, functional ZF
Amplifying subpools of oligos for testing
Inserting the expression plasmids into the E. coli containing our selection genome
Verifying that our ZF-binding site/GFP expression paradigm works
To this end, we will be ordering a 96-well plate from IDT containing oligos that will simulate the entire tube of oligos that we will receive from Agilent in four weeks.  These oligos will consist of the following:

Digestions   were again carried out of limonene synthase with RBS (BBa_I742111) and   both promoters (BBa_J23109 and BBa_J23119). Ligations were then carried   out of limonene synthase onto an ampicillin resistant backbone and both   promoters onto a tetracycline resistant backbone. Transformations were   carried out of each part into E.coli. These were plated and left   overnight at 37°C.  
Ampicillin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol agar plates were made.  
A PCR reaction was set up and left to run overnight to amplify a digested promoter. 
 
Day 41 (22/08/14): 
Yesterday’s transformations of limonene synthase and promoters J23109 and J23119 were again unsuccessful as we had no colonies on any of the plates.  
Ampicillin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol agar plates were made. 
Transformations of the following were carried out: 
-limonene synthase with RBS on an ampicillin resistant backbone,  
-promoters J23109 and J23119 on a tetracycline resistant backbone, 
-promoters J23109 and J23119 on a chloramphenicol resistant backbone,  
-RBS on a chloramphenicol resistant backbone,  
-a light inducible promoter on a chloramphenicol resistant backbone, 
-A backbone 
These were plated on the appropriate agar plates and left to grow over the weekend at room temperature. 
The PCR product was purified and ran on an agarose gel. However when visualised under UV no promoter could be seen on the gel. It is possible the promoter was lost during purification due to its small size. 
Our gene R-linalool synthase arrived! This was amplified using PCR. 
 
Week 10
Day 42 (26/08/14):
We had a number of successful transformations from Friday. We had colonies of promoter J23109 on a tetracycline resistant backbone, promoter J23119 on a chloramphenicol resistant backbone, RBS on a chloramphenicol resistant backbone and limonene synthase on an ampicillin resistant backbone. Colonies of these were selected and inoculated in LB to grow up overnight to be minipreped tomorrow.
We also inoculated a sample of untransformed E.coli into LB and left to grow up overnight ready to make competent tomorrow.
We ran an agarose gel to check that the PCR"

Slide 24 (05.06.15)
2 Slides were prepared (new iRIf slides): Each with 2 stamps: 1 stamp 40ug/ml bBSA (Gitterstempel), 1 stamp 50ug/ml His-GFP (iGEM-Stempel). Slides were only plasmaactivated and then stamped. Blocked for ~1h: pipetted 1 ml BSA(250ug/ml) on each slide and put on rotator. They were stored in PBS to be measured on next day.
06.06.2015
Slides which were prepared the day before were measured. First GFP fluoresence was checked out in microscope: were seen good in both cases (iGEM stamp). Then slide i1 was measured. Binding of antiGFP to GFP was incredibly intense.
Surprisingly, also StrepCy5 bound to GFP/antiGFP: iRIf signal was seen on GFP stamp (iGEM-Logo) at StrepCy5 step. Plate reader after measurement showed an extraordinary signal in the Strep channel on the GFP stamp (iGEM-Logo), decent signal on the bBSA stamp (Gitterstempel)
Slide i1: Under fluorescence microscope before iRIf measurement
Slide i2: Under fluorescence microscope before iRIf measurement
Slide i1: during iRIf measurement within the anti-GFP binding step
Slide i1: during iRIf measruement within the StrepCy5 binding step
Slide i1: in plate reader to see StrepCy5 after iRIf
To investigate that phenomenon we conducted some experiments with the unmeasured replicate (i2). First we pipetted StrepCy5 manually on the bBSA and the GFP spot and incubated for a while: StrepCy5 only bound to the bBSA stamp. Then we pipetted anti-GFP to both spots and checked for Cy5 fluoresence. still only bBSA spot signal was seen. Then we pipetted StrepCy5 again on the stamp, to see if it binds to the anti-GFP, but again StrepCy5 signal was only visible on the bBSA stamp (Gitterstempel) and not on the iGEM stamp. We left kinda clueless why we saw StrepCy5 in iRIf and plate reader on the iGEM stamp with slide i1. *Edit: Since the anti-GFP antibody seemed to"

We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some widespread"

Hey, you found our secret pocket!
As a freshman on iGEM and therefore surrounded by novelty, our team invested on human practices both to let nearby people know about synthetic biology and iGEM, and to reinforce on us what we had come for. And that was hugely rewarding and pretty fun!
Basically, we choose these approaches for our human practices:
Disclose synthetic biology and iGEM in Brazil (in Portuguese language);
Talk to experts in the field and with people from other areas and background to seek new perspectives;
Thinking outside the box: to go beyond the laboratory, students were encouraged to think in new ideas related to synthetic biology, seeking new bioethical, economic, educational, philosophical... approaches.
Some big questions were always raised during the course of our activities:
Why are we choosing to perform this activity?
What will we learn from this activity?
How will this activity help improving our project?

DRY LAB 6:
- Drafted an ‘all concerned’ email blast to SVA community, which will be sent out this week.
- Discussed the pros and cons of letting random participants take the samples, instead of sending a team member to the location. Consensus is that coordinating and instructing outsiders to take the samples wouldn’t be any less work and could potentially jeopardize our data.
- We looked at all the different sections we will eventually have published on our site and determined which sections we currently have content for and who will manage. We will host the content in google drive until it has been greenlighted. Tarah will make a shared website folder for content. Raul drafted a spreadsheet to manage website content.
- Updates to our project description - focus our efforts on community gardens and backyards in our urban environment.
- Missed opportunities to connect with community garden contacts and we all agreed (approved) letter addressed to sites of interest should be a priority for the next meeting, as reaching out requires waiting on others to respond.
- Discussed how to get the most pure and accurate sample from a single site. We do not have the resources to test each site multiple times, however- we could take multiple samples from each site, and process the combination of samples to get an average. - Sebastian and Tarah drafted responses to an iGEM survey about our lab and about our project.
- Made our very first iGEM submission deadline on 06/26/25!
- Jen updated us on her progress of converting the LaMotte sample forms into 2 separate custom forms for our project- one designated for out in the field and another for processing back in the lab.

Week 15: August 11th - August 15th
Since the idea of measuring three chambers (3 colours) with one sensor measurement does not seem to be working, we decided it would be better if we measure each chamber individually by sliding the sensor over the three chambers. On Monday, we had a meeting with the machine shop and discussed the change in the design. Measuring one chamber in a time will also allow us to use just one colour (one reporter). On Monday we also had a meeting with John Shelley, a lab technician at the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Schulich School of Engineering, regarding our circuits and Arduino code. He recommended we use 0.1 µF capacitors for the sensor and for the LCD display to avoid sudden changes of current that might be causing our sensor and the display to shut down. He also helped us to get a better understanding of how the sensor operates and suggested we spend more time trying to understand the LCD display too because it seems to be the limiting factor in the circuit at this point. We were able to find YouTube tutorials that explained the way LCD operates and explained the code too. We were able to get a better understanding of both the colour sensor and the LCD display codes. This allowed us to optimize the code for the circuit where the sensor and the LCD display are used together.
We also started writing functions that would analyse the red, green, and blue components from the sensor and output what colour is present on the screen rather than just outputting all of the components on the screen. However, we run into a problem with the LCD display as it stopped functioning properly. Most likely it was burned down, so we are looking to get a new display. This week we are also doing another plate reader experiment. After graphing the results of the last plate reader experiment, we saw that the RFP plate count was constant at different concentrations meaning bacteria was present but it did not grow much over night. This time we changed the set up of the experiment: we grew bacteria for about 3 hours before putting it into the plate reader to get it into the log growth phase. This time we are doing the experiment with E. coli culture transformed with RFP, E. coli culture"

All you have to do to be Sudharshana’s friend is come bearing chocolate and a joke that’s not funny in the slightest. She’s a final year Biotechnology student with a passion for all things biology, especially the creepy-crawlies that most of us are terrified of. She has a wonderful work ethic and her calm demeanour, even when things hit the fan, is truly remarkable. She always stands up for what is right even if it’s the hardest thing she has to do. She’s served her time as the President of the Debating Union and can often be seen arguing with people over why they’re wrong and more importantly, why she’s right. Her passions in life include debating, research and food. She aims to do something that truly makes her happy.
Contributions: She contributes in wet lab and with activities relating to HP.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#riboregulator#characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," averaged PBAD and absolute promoter activity over the averaged BBa_J23101 absolute promoter activity. R.P.U value of PBAD in different concentration of arabinose is shown. Leakage could be analyzed according to the R.P.U value  that shows the GFP expression of PBAD promoter in the absence of arabinose (0%).
Equation of the RPU calculation is shown below:
Based on this equation, the GFP synthesis rate (dF/dt) for the experiment ( BBa_I0500 - BBa_E0240 ) divided by the ABS (which means the absorbance or OD600) of the cells containing the experiment construct. GFP synthesis rate (dF/dt) for the reference promoter ( BBa_J23101 - BBa_E0240 ) divided by the ABS (which means the absorbance or OD600) of the cells containing the reference promoter construct.
Then, RPU is obtained by dividing the GFP synthesis rate/ABS of experiment with the GFP synthesis rate/ABS of the reference promoter.
Data Processing for data from FACS
1. RPU was calculated by first subtracting the autofluorescence (fluorescence of cells with pSB3K3- BBa_E0240 )
2. Dividing the fluorescence of cells containing pSB3K3- BBa_I0500 - BBa_E0240 with cells containing pSB3K3- BBa_I20260 .
Equation is shown below:
Based on this equation, the amount of fluorescence [F] for the experiment ( BBa_I0500 - BBa_E0240 ) multiplied by the growth rate (μ) of the cells containing the experiment construct. Amount of fluorescence [F] for the reference promoter ( BBa_J23101 - BBa_E0240 ) multiplied by the growth rate (μ) of the cells containing the reference promoter construct.
Then, RPU is obtained by dividing the fluorescence*growth rate of experiment with the fluorescence*growth rate of the reference promoter.
3. For simplicity, we assumed the growth rate of the cells transformed with pSB3K3- BBa_I0500 - BBa_E0240 and cells transformed with pSB3K3- BBa_I20260 had same similar growth rate.

Doctors, researchers and entrepreneurs discuss and present opportunities for research cooperation and product development. Here, we pitched our project vision and subsequently hosted a poster session that initiated various dialogues that we can classify in 2 categories:
Potential application Our detection system can be used to indicate the requirement of alternative treatments. The rise of (multi)resistant bacteria not only triggers a debate about responsible antibiotic usage, but also provides incentive to look for alternative treatment options. We spoke to entrepreneurs and shareholders in a company that provides phage-therapy that is particularly beneficial when antibiotics fail to dispose of a persistent bacterial infection. In this way, our novel detection system can complement phage-therapy and provide a complete workflow to help farmers get rid of a troublesome infection.
Commercialization Several business developers were interested to learn about our innovative approach as a novel synbio application to help solve societally-relevant problems. The first question they ask after the project description is: “What did you do to protect your idea?” Filing a patent, for example, is an important step to secure investment and be able to take the idea to develop the product. In conducting innovative scientific research, teams should also consider legal and business aspects if they wish to take their idea to the market.

Our team has developed SBiDer from the ground up, and my primary tasks have been the engineering of the database and the search algorithm. Development of the database and the search algorithm were daunting tasks that challenged me in many ways. Yet, I embraced the challenge. The more arduous the project became, the harder I worked. As a result, this assiduous process has provided me with a fantastic opportunity to improve my skills in computer programming, bioinformatics, and mathematical modeling. Now, I truly appreciate the value of the challenges that I faced and the priceless opportunity of this education.
Developing SBiDer codes was hard, and effectively leading a groups of people was even harder. Technical challenges not only made me a critical thinker, but also harnessed my skills as leader that ultimately made me a better scientist. In the process of interacting with my teammates, I felt a maturation of myself. I have learned to be more conscious about others’ struggles. I learned to sacrifice for others in developing the project, which is key in teamwork. I learned a lot about proper teamwork ethics. Looking back, I am surprised how much I have learned about communication, effective leadership, project development, and more. I believe these skills have made me a better scientist. Without working together, we would not have been able to develop SBiDer. SBiDer is a result of our communal effort.
I believe that science and collaboration are closely intertwined, for collaboration fundamentally advances science. I am grateful for the opportunity in developing SBiDer and working with my team: Joaquin, Jenhan, Justin, Ben, Ryan, Andreas, KP, Lauren, Valeriy, Gary, Fernando, Luyao, and Rohit. I learned tremendously from the collaboration that was coalesced with the science. And finally, we made SBiDer. The past seven months have been filled with learning opportunities, arising in unexpected manners that have led a an enjoyable and fruitful journey.
I hope the community enjoys SBiDer and can contribute to its further development.
All in all, collaboration was not only the theme of this past spring, summer, and this fall, but it will be the theme of my life.

In order to eliminate the influence of all above, we designed a microfluidic device. Microfluidic chip can provide sufficient nutrition for the growth of the bacteria and wash away excess bacteria and AHL, so that the system can run stably. Under the fluorescence microscope, we captured pictures every 5min.     
4. The construction of double period oscillation system
        In order to realize the double periodic oscillation, we also need to introduce another kind of auto-inducer into the oscillation system, we chose DPD, another auto-inducer in E.coli. We connected RBS with luxS to aiiA, which allows them to co-express. LuxS catalyzes the formation of DPD, so that the concentration of DPD in theory will be a half cycle difference with the peak of AHL, we named it as pTD103aiiA-luxS. PLsr is regulated by DPD promoter, it is followed by YFP as a reporter gene, so that we can monitor the change of the concentration of DPD, we named it as pTD103YFP. pTD103aiiA-luxS, pTD103luxI-sfGFP and pTD103YFP three plasmids constitute a double cycle system, sfGFP and YFP as reporter gene. We hope to observe the green and yellow light stable appear alternately, and each cycle length is fixed.     
5. Detection of double periodic oscillation system
         As the method we used for the detection of single period oscillation, we put the treated bacteria solutio into the microfluidic device, and inject the fresh LB with proper flow rate, in order to stabilize the system. Under the fluorescence microscope, we captured pictures every 5min.

What we have been doing so far is focused on promoting Synthetic Biology and iGEM to general public, in order to provoke thinking and debating of food safety, production sustainability and microorganism drug resistance issues. However, the general public are not the ones who own the knowledge of skills to turn Synthetic Biology into real products. Those who do are gathered in research labs of universities and companies. And they should be our target audience. We hope our efforts can stimulate these researchers' interest in Synthetic Biology, motivating more research work. This is the way we can make Synthetic Biology to change the world.
Enterprise Outreach
During this past summer, we had in-depth discussion with 10 companies. After shown to our drug resistance research work, they grew great interest in related fields. At last, four companies, namely Genewiz, Dongsheng Biotech, TransGen Biotech and Generay Biotechnology became collaborators or sponsors of our project.
The following is some products supported by our sponsors. Genewiz also provided very lower discount for our gene synthesis of polykitide synthase domains and gave funding on our team uniform and brochure.

Cells were measured every 6 hours via fluorescence microscopy for eGFP and captured images were processed as described in our Measurement page.
Figure 1 shows nalidixic acid induces all MT promoters, albeit MT1 and MT2 most strongly. Interestingly, induction via nalidixic acid appears to be 50% stronger than H2O2, a chemical commonly used to induce cellular stress (Figure 2).
This data shows that over the concentrations we tested, nalidixic acid has the potential to cause cellular stress to both bacteria and mammals, an interesting result especially due to nalidixic acid’s pharmaceutical uses. Further testing, using additional and/or therapeutically relevant concentrations are necessary to follow up on this result.

Fig.7 :Bacteria in Group 1, 2 and 3 all show significantly stronger fluorescence intensity than Control Group. So we can conclude that through recruiting interacting domain and ligand, we can assemble proteins into a complex.
It is proved that membrane proteins with interacting proteins could interact and dimerize with each other. Thus, by recruiting E.coli native membrane protein Lgt, interacting proteins (SH3, PDZ, GBD) and downstream enzymes, we can easily build a Membrane Accelerator. The construction of Membrane Anchors with split EGFP are Part:BBa_K771402 , Part:BBa_K771403 , Part:BBa_K771404 , Part:BBa_K771405 , respectively.
Application
Membrane Accelerator could be easily put into use by attaching functional enzymes to corresponding membrane anchors.
To verify the superiority of membrane accelerator system, we recruited Fatty Acids Biosynthetic pathway , and proved that biosynthesis rate can be increased sharply with Membrane Accelerator.
What's more, we noticed that previously published researches on Scaffold system all focused on accelerating Biosynthetic pathway, which would no doubt have practical significance. Nevertheless, no one has before applied scaffold system into Biodegradation. Biodegradation plays crucial part in environment restoration, especially at such a time when pollution is more serious than ever. Some Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons are toxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic and persist very long in environment. Sulfur in crude oil could cause various problems. Thus, we are trying to recruit Membrane Accelerator to accelerate PAH degradation and DBT desulfurization pathway .

EMW_Street_Bio,2016,Team:EMW Street Bio#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,", which include building out an in-house community laboratory and                     managing the international course “How to Grow (Almost) Anything,” we first engaged with youth                     through a collaboration with the Cambridge Science Festival (the first-of-its-kind celebration                     highlighting fun and leading edge STEAM projects in our region). Importantly, as educational                     curriculums move from STEM to STEAM, educators and students alike are realizing the false dichotomy                     between science and art and how the two disciplines synergize immensely well in many respects. In                     April 2016, EMW collaborated with Amino Labs on a 2-day workshop for                     youth as a part of the                     Cambridge Science Festival. Over the course of a weekend, more than 20 youth, from late elementary                     school to middle school, participated in a hands-on workshop where they learned about synthetic                     biology and applied their knowledge to culture bacteria in the Amino One, a table-top bacterial                     culture system. The students cultured E. coli and transformed bacteria with recombinant DNA.

Pioneering the Youth Science Initiative
Following our successful collaboration with the Cambridge Science Festival, Street Bio aspired to                     make a commitment to local youth engagement through STEAM in an effort to foster a fun learning                     environment conducive to boundless scientific curiosity and unlimited imaginative exploration. As                     luck would have it, Crystal Johnson, a parent of one of the participants at our Street Bio/Cambridge                     Science Festival program connected with Street Bio founder, David Kong. Johnson, founder of                     Integrative Sustainability and Environmental Solutions and accomplished energy strategist, shared                     our excitement regarding continued youth engagement in the sciences. After several teleconferences,                     we planned a recurring weekend youth program focused on engaging local youth at the forefront of                     science, and thus, EMW Bookstore’s Street Bio Youth Science Initiative (YSI) was born.
In an effort to advance Street Bio’s mission, the YSI has been geared towards engaging                     underrepresented and disadvantaged local youth in science - girls, youth of color, low socioeconomic                     status. Upon forming partnerships with local biotechnology startup Ginkgo Bioworks, research groups                     at MIT Media Lab, and an astronaut at NASA, we ultimately developed a theme centered on                     sustainability and a timeline for recurring weekend workshops where each YSI session would take                     place at a different laboratory and we would spend the day learning, asking questions, building,                     experimenting, and bonding over our shared love for science.

Stanford-Brown-RISD,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," downstream verification of protein production, and a 6x His tag for protein purification. A challenge incurred when designing these parts was that the His tag maintains some affinity for metals, including copper. This would interfere with downstream modeling and experimental analysis of the interaction between copper and the HHTC domain. We therefore added the Mxe GyrA Intein between the Lumio/His tag and the rest of the protein, as this intein could be cleaved through addition of 50 mM DTT through thiol-mediated cleavage after protein purification [19]. After DTT was added, we were able to obtain the fusion proteins ready for downstream application (as per Figure 2).
Figure 2: Schematic of the design of the fusion proteins (HHTC-Re x n) and the method in which they bind copper.
We also produced an RFP-CBD fusion protein to visualize the distribution of chitin on the surface of a piece of mycelium, as well as a proof of concept for aesthetic design purposes.
2.5 Wet-lab Experiments: Fusion Protein Production
Once all three constructs were ordered (IDT gBlocks), we ligated the linear DNA constructs to the PSB1C3 iGEM backbone using Gibson Assembly, transformed NEB T7 competent E. coli with our new plasmid, and plated the colonies on chloramphenicol selective LB plates. The colonies were incubated at 37℃ overnight or until there were distinct, visible colonies, and never longer than 72 hours. The existence of our DNA constructs in the colonies was confirmed using verification primers (VF2 and VR)  in a colony PCR. We then performed His-tag purification on crude cell extract from our colonies using Thermo Scientific HisPur Ni-NTA spin columns. Following protein purification with the spin columns, we confirmed the presence of our protein in the final elution using Thermo Fisher Scientific’s Lumio Tag Detection Kit [20]. The standard protein purification protocol was modified by introducing a buffer containing 50 mM DTT for on-site cleavage, so the desired fusion protein could be eluted with the His-tag removed. We then performed a BCA Assay to determine our total protein concentration in each elution.
2.6 ITC Testing
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC; MicroCal iTC200) was employed to determine the association equilibrium constant (Ka), enthalpy (ΔH), and the number of ions bound per ligand (n). Ka describes the affinity of a ligand for its substrate, and we used it to quantit"

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#EricDesign_-_-_TEXT.html,". The sensor is expected to show no specific localisation, because of the missing import sequence. We calibrate the sensors in living yeast cells and physiological ranges so that we can not only perform relative but also quantitative measurements. We aim to confirm our hypothesis of an more oxidized redox state of roGFP2 in peroxisomes with violacein pathway activity and want to measure differences in pH within yeast strains with peroxisomal membrane anchored pex3-bacteriorhodopsin protein (membrane proteins) .
Once expression and localization of the sensor is proven by microscopy, measurements with a plate reader or a fluorometer are acceptable. This allows a high number of replicates to be measured accurately in reasonable time. Microscopy is performed with a filter based Nikon Eclipse TI fluorescence microscope at 100-fold magnification and plate reader measurements are performed with a Tecan infinite plate reader (Mahon M. J. et al., 2011) . For pHLuorin2 emission intensity is measured at 535 nm upon excitation at 405 nm and 485 nm. Same settings were used for roGFP2 (Schwarzländer M. et al., 2016) . Evaluation of the reported signals is done by the excitation ratio of the the corresponding excitation wavelength.
Nootkatone
In order to have a proof of concept for our compartmentation strategy we intend to establish the nootkatone pathway inside the peroxisome. Therefore we aim to target the three enzymes for the nootkatone production to compartment. Before starting the actual lab work for the ambitious plan to establish a completely new pathway in the peroxisome, there are several aspects that have to be considered first.
The initial step is to find a reliable source to prove the abundance of our precursor Farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) in yeast peroxisomes. So far there is no proof of existence of FPP inside yeast peroxisomes yet. However it is predicted to be present, as it was detected in mammalian and plant peroxisomes Olivier et al. (2000) .
Figure 7.1: The structure of FPP the precursor for nootkatone.
The precursor FPP is converted into valencene by a valencene synthase (ValS). We chose the one from Callitropsis nootkatensis because of its comparably high efficiency in microorganisms. It achieves greater yields in yeast than the citrus valencene synthase. Furthermore, the product specificity is relatively high, while production of byproducts is low"
Goettingen,2015,Team:Goettingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," were not distributed with the current plate of the     iGEM Distribution Kit, we ordered those parts including the right restriction sites as gBlocks from IDT.
As a first step eforRed and amilCP were restricted with KpnI and SacI to make them compatible with our dockerins in pBAD.
After purification restricted colours were ligated into pBAD_BCEL and pBAD_CCEL by T4 ligation (sticky end ligation) and transformed into E. coli TOP10.
Ligation into pBAD was followed according to the protocol in the methods collection. After over-night incubation colonies were picked, plasmids extracted     with the QIAGEN QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and test restricted with KpnI (Fig.2).
Once restriction controls showed the correct bands, pBAD_amilCP_CCEL #1 and pBAD_eforRed_BCEL were sent for sequencing. Sequencing showed that both     plasmids were correct.
To make our constructs compatible with the iGEM shipping vector pSB1C3 the desired EcoRI and PstI restrictions sites were added by PCR.
After purification, the PCR products were restricted with EcoRI and PstI, the same with pSB1C3, and afterwards ligated into pSB1C3 by T4     ligation (sticky end ligation) and transformed into E. coli TOP10.
After over-night incubation colonies were picked, plasmids extracted with the QIAGEN QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and test restricted with EcoRI     (Fig.3). Due to the reason that our dockerin CCEL contains an internal PstI restriction site we continued working only with the eforRed_BCEL     construct.
Once restriction controls showed the correct band, pSB1C3_eforRed_BCEL was sent for sequencing. Sequencing showed that the plasmids were correct.
RESULTS
Sequencing showed that the dockerins ACEL and CCEL contain an internal PstI restriction site. Therefore all the constructs containing ACEL or CCEL     showed in the end truncated dockerin sequences and could not be send in as BioBricks.
We also build a construct where the enzyme esterase was fused to our CCEL dockerin (pBAD_Est_CCEL) following the same strategy. But again, due to the     reason that our dockerin CCEL contains an internal PstI restriction site we had to stop our work at this point.
Furthermore we collaborated with the current iGEM team of Aachen and tried to fuse three of their enzymes"

[ more news ]
We invited the commissioner for Bio-Safety in Bavaria. In a two hour discussion we explained the details about our projects and wanted to know all the ""what ifs"" that came to our mind. Most of the applications with our spores we thought of dealt with the filtration or degradation of molecules in water, blood or the human gut.
What regulations, laws or aspects do we need to keep in mind: - during construction of our spores... (antibiotic resistances, toxins,...)? - during purification of our spores?
Which laws apply for which application?
Is our spore a GMO?
The complete protocol of the meeting and the responses will follow!

Technion_Israel,2016,Team:Technion Israel#Modifications#Rosetta_-_-_TEXT.html," These           results led us to design and perform a two-step cloning assay,           in each step we insert the mutations with single PCR reaction.

Lactose and Glucose
Awareness among people regarding lactose intolerance is rapidly increasing. Thus, we want to offer a detection solution using the Rosetta's computational design applications. Therefore, we redesigned the Tar LBD to bind Lactose.
Figure 3 and figure 4 demonstrate the library we obtained for Lactose after running several cycles and filtration.
Fig. 3: Alignment of Tar ligand-binding domain (LBD). The alignment presents            the 7 variants in the library with the native Tar (wild type).
Fig. 4: 3D imaging of the 7 variants in the library with the           native Tar (wild type), each color represents a different variant.
As this is a novel design of a Tar ligand-binding domain to bind a sugar molecule, we decided to           have a proof of concept with a smaller and suitable molecule to bind, a Lactose component - Glucose.           Glucose is well known monosaccharide and is the main compound used in the production of           energy in living organisms. For this reason we can find existing chemoreceptors for Glucose (2), however redesigning the Tar LBD to bind Glucose was performed as a preliminary step before redesigning           it to bind Lactose.
Figure 5 and video 2 demonstrate the library we obtained for Glucose after running several cycles          and filtration.

Video 2: 3D imaging of the 8 variants in the library with the            native Tar (wild type), each color represents a different variant.
Analysis of the results shows one main region of mutations, around the 75th amino acid the LBD sequence. These results led us to design and           perform a single PCR reaction to insert the mutations.

Qiushi Science Summer Camp
From Aug. 6th to Aug. 10, Qiushi Summer Camp for Biology Science was held in College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University in which 72 high school students from all around China participated. During that time, members of ZJU-China iGEM team played a special role. Three members illustrated the experiment methods and skills of molecular biology when these students visited Room 413 of Biology Experiment Center, the home of ZJU-China iGEM. Younger students showed amazing interest in genes and the experiment instruments daily used by iGEMers.
Later, two of our team member, Zukai Liu and Yujie Chen gave an interesting presentation to all the students and teachers involved in the summer camp with the topic “A glance at iGEM” in a meeting room. ZJU-iGEMers introduced the basic information of iGEM together with several creative projects to make clear the goals of synthetic biology. In question-and-answer section, students were all passionate to discuss with our team members about various aspects from our project details this year to the requirements of becoming a good iGEMer next year. Qiushi Science Summer Camp acted as an opportunity to popularize iGEM and synthetic biology indeed.

Respectively, the repressor PhlF turns off the promoter(PPhlF) of T3, and blue light can induce the PPhlF. After the process of circuits, red-, green- and blue-light signals can respectively induce the P, PcpcG2-172 and PPhlF promoters.
Figure 2. The RGB system is encoded on 4 plasmids. The genes and genetic parts are shown.
The ‘resource allocator’ which connects the ‘circuits’ and ‘actuators’, is based on a split-RNA polymerase(RNAP) system[2]. In the system, a non-active ‘core’ fragment is constitutively expressed by promoter J23105. The sigma fragments(K1F, CGG, T3) regulated by P, PcpcG2-172 and PPhlF can conjugate with the core fragment to form full-functional RNA polymerases, and the RNA polymerases are then directed to three promoters and activated the expression of actuators respectively. It is worth mentioning that the sigma fragments are chosen that exhibited the least cross-talk. Furthermore, insulators (BydvJ, BBa_K2598010, and RiboJ[4], BBa_K2598014) were added to reduce the crosstalk among the three sigma fragments.
.
The “actuator” module implement the biological functions that are the outputs of the RGB system. There are three output genes responding to three light sensors activated by different wavelength of light. In order to implement customized outcome, theoretically, you can change them into any genes you want. The actuators we chose here were three kinds of color protein: fluorescent protein, chromoprotein and enzyme which can produce colorful products. The fluorescent proteins mRFP(BBa_K2598065), GFP(BBa_K2598063), BFP(BBa_K2598064) were chosen to test our system and achieve our final results because fluorescent reporters can be measured easily by ELIASA (microplate reader) and flow cytometry and the expression period is much shorter than those of chromoprotein and enzyme. What’s more, We use chormoproteins amilGFP (BBa_K2598055), amilCP (BBa_K2598057) and eforred (BBa_K2598056) to prove our concept. We also constructed a plasmid containing lacZ(BBa_K2598025), bFMO(BBa_K2598029) and gusA(B"

A high calcium level leads to the exposure of the nuclear localization signal and the transcription factor is transported into the nucleus.  NFAT proteins play important roles in developmental processes and in the immune system [39] .
Kid3
Kid3 is one out of the huge amount of C2H2 zink finger proteins, that are known in eukaryotic organisms. Because of their DNA binding zink finger domain they are involved in gene expression in the role of transcription factors, especially in the early embryonal development, cell growth, diﬀerentiation and tumorigenesis. Kid3 has a Krüppel-associated box domain (KRAB) at the N-terminus, that performs  a transcription repressing function, and a C-terminal C2H2 zink finger domain. The consensus binding sequence of Kid3 is 5'-CCAC(C/G)-3' [66] .
Proteins
LDL receptor
Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL receptor) is a cell surface protein which is responsible for the cholesterol supply of the cell.  The receptor recognizes the protein B100 which is part of the LDL particles. Binding of the B100 protein to the LDL receptor leads to endocytosis via clathrin coated pits. The vesicle fuses with an endosome, the resulting shift in the pH value leads to the detachment of the LDL and the receptor can be transported back to the plasma membrane (receptor recycling). Through this process the cell takes up the cholesterol which is associated with LDL.  LDL accumulation in the blood is responsible for atherosclerosis and many cardiovascular diseases. The LDL gene is regulated by the intracellular level of cholesterol. A low level of cholesterol leads to the activation whereas a high level results in a decrease of transcription [40] .
HMG CoA synthase
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMG CoA synthase) is an enzyme catalyzing the condensation of Acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA). There are two distinct HMG CoA synthases, the cytosolic and the mitochondrial form, encoded by two different genes. The reaction catalyzed by the cytosolic enzyme is a part of"

Melittin Expression
Melittin Expression
Melittin
The 2014 Stony Brook iGEM team accomplished an astounding feat- they were the first iGEM team of any State University of New York school and they managed to fund and conduct a project to combat antibiotic resistant bacteria using a protein that causes pores to form in the membrane of bacterial cells. After isolating the melittin gene directly from honey bees, the team cloned the sequence into E. coli cells. A system was devised in which melittin could be produced in its in active form as a GST fusion protein with a TEV cut site placed between melittin and the GST tag. Once outside of the cell, the GST could be cleaved and the protein would begin forming pores in the adjacent cells, effectively circumventing the need for futile attempts to kill resistant bacteria with antibiotics.
Improvement
The 2015 Stony Brook iGEM team not only had an interest in infectious diseases, but chronic diseases as well. We just couldn’t leave melittin in the -20 and not improve on last year’s project! While we waited for plasmids to digest and cell cultures to grow for our project, Nephrotides, we started on improving the melittin BioBrick. Expression of melittin had been low and upon further investigation, it appeared that the melittin sequence in the part was not codon optimized for E. coli cells- understandable since the sequence came directed from honey bees. Once the dry lab portion of our team, a collection of genius Geneious users, worked through the melittin sequence to optimize it for expression in E. Coli cells we worked to express that protein and quantify the improvement. We attached the gene encoding for mCherry to the original melittin sequence as well as our codon optimized melittin optimus and compared the expression levels. We saw a great deal more coloration in the cells transformed with the codon optimized melittin mCherry sequence so we can infer that the codon optimization enhanced the expression of melittin.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Tag-Optimization_-_-_TEXT.html," homologous recombination based cloning approachInsert and backbone fragments sharing overlapping regions at their ends are transferred into a single reaction set-up in molecular ratios determined by equation 1 (compare to 5.1.4). 2)  The insert/backbone reaction mixture is heat-denaturized and subsequently cooled down to 53°C to allow for annealing of the complementary overlaps.  3)  By polymerase chain reaction, the single strand hybrid-regions are filled up to double strands yielding circular, double-stranded molecules with nicks at overlapping regions. 4) Plasmids resulting from CPEC can be used directly for transformation.
CPEC relies on a simple polymerase extension of the DNA fragments to be assembled. Crucial to this concept is the design of vector and insert fragments which must share overlapping regions at the ends ( Fig. 11 (1) ). In a single reaction set-up, insert DNA fragments and linear vector are heat denaturized and allowed to anneal at elevated temperature, resulting in specific hybridized insert-vector constructs ( Fig. 11 (2) ). Subsequently, the single-strand hybrid constructs are extended under PCR-elongation conditions (72 °C for 20 s/kbp of longest fragment) which yield completely assembled, double-stranded circular constructs ( Fig. 11 (3) ) ready for transformation into competent cells. The single strands nicks introduced on each strand due to the unidirectional nature of the polymerase chain reaction will be removed by endogenous ligases upon transformation into Escherichia coli.
We provide instructions ( RFC 99 ) for a rapid and cost efficient cloning and transformation method based on CPEC which allows for the manufacturing of multi-fragment plasmid constructs in a parallelized manner: High Throughput Circular Extension Cloning and Transformation (HiCT)
CPEC was performed according to the following protocol: The total mass of DNA used per CPEC reaction varied between 50 to 200 ng. The insert to backbone molar ratio was 3:1 for insert-backbone and 1:1 for insert-insert molar ratio. Conversion from mass concentration of fragments to molar concentration was done using the formula: cM = c*10^6/(n*660), where c is the measured oligonucleotide concentration [ng/µl], n is the number of dinucleotides of the fragment and cM is the resulting concentration [nM].   The final reaction volume was adjusted to 6 µl with polymerase master mix (Phusion® High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with HF Buffer, NEB"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated HP_-_-_TEXT.html," the high risk group is greater than the general population. Therefore as more true positives would be picked up, the cost of unnecessary CT scans would be offset by the additional correct diagnoses. Everyone with a positive test result would have a CT scan anyway to confirm the presence of their cancer.
The major drawback to a low specificity is the psychological impact of a patient being told they have cancer when in fact they do not. Again, through using multiple miRNA signatures in tandem - i.e. the levels of different miRNAs related to a single disease, and calculating a weighted score involving all of them, so that an abnormal level of just one miRNA does not necessarily lead to a false positive.
We can also alleviate the problem of false positives by ensuring doctors tell patients that the results our sensor provides just indicate the need for further testing, and are not a diagnosis.
Dr Desai also advised that the result from our test could be combined with a score from patient history to quantify their risk (e.g. Tammegami et al.’s probability score). This total score would then be used to increase accuracy of the test.
NICE Criteria for screening tools
To incorporate the feedback from doctors into the applications of our project, we have explained how our sensor meets (or would be applied so that it meets) the NICE criteria for a screening tool.
NICE Criteria
Our Sensor
The condition being screened should be a serious health problem in terms of frequency and/or severity
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality, with 1.6 million deaths worldwide in 2012. In the UK in 2014, there were 46,403 new cases and 35,895 deaths. [4] 80-85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC. [5]
The epidemiology, natural history and development of the condition from latent to declared states should be understood and/or there should be robust evidence about the association between the marker and the disease
Much is known about NSCLC, and although there are still a lot of research going into understanding cancer characteristics. The same is true for most other cancers. Although miRNAs are still being characterized, Hennessey et al. demonstrated a potential link between miR-15b and miR-27b to NSCLC. However, validation is still required with a large patient cohort for clinical use. Expert Dan Pregibon anticipates that the use of miRNAs as biomarkers is not far off.

How does it work
Objective:
      By inputing weather data of the past few days, users can get the population size of pests. The types of pest include Bactrocera dorsalis, Bactrocera cucurbatae, Spodoptera litura, and Spodoptera exgua Hiibner.

Hypothesis:
      According to a great amount of research paper, the weather condition influences the maturation of pests to some extents. Take oriental fruit fly as an example; rainy days lead to their maturation. In contrast, low temperature results in a small group of oriental fruit fly. As a whole, in building this model, we presumed that there exists the connection between weather and group size of the pest.
Features:
      The features we chose to utilize included average day temperature, the highest day temperature, the lowest day temperature, rainfall, pressure, wind velocity and relative humidity.
Model selection:
      We are using two famous and frequently used models, Supported Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) in building the prediction system. In processing and testing data, the member of NYMU discovered that SVM made an incredibly great prediction (~100%) when the datasets are big enough, while RF has an average score of 80%. However, in some cases, when RF model reached 60~70% of accuracy score, SVM has 50% or worse. Thus, we decided to build a simple ensemble prediction model, with different hyperparameters and classifier. Moreover, choose the pest population size that most classifiers agree.

cooperativity tetR to pTet promoter
Parameter estimation
For parameter values, first estimates were made through bibliography and                     methods which were used also for TALE, such as RBS Calculator.
The parameters for which it was deemed necessary to do further analysis, as                     bibliographic references proved to be quite uncertain, are the binding and                     unbinding rates between doxycycline and tetR and also those of tetR with                     DNA, in the two position of pTet promoter. So the sensitivity analysis, was                     applied to these parameters.
Figure 2: Sensitivity analysis on uncertain model parameters. Sample                         from each parameter: 20.000. Parameter sets: 120.000
As can be seen in Figure 2, the kon2 between tetR and DNA shows                     approximately 0.6 first order index and taking into account also higher                     order interactions, this is the most influential parameter of the system.                     The toxicity of dcas is an important limiting factor which we should                     consider.Therefore, its concentration must be under control via the tetR                     repression and the Doxycycline dose.
Taking into consideration all the above, we decided to examine the system                     behaviour with different sets of parameters. Specifically, we used all the                     parameters that was used in sensitivity analysis and we created 5000                     different sets. The values of the kinetics ranged from 0.001 to 10.
Figure 3: Scatter plot from the analysis under different parameter                         settings.
The data from the analysis (Figure 3), indicate that the mean value of                     dcas9 concentration is approximately 0.826 nM. This result appears to be                     problematic, as a concentration this low, would set an upper bound on the                     final repressor and by extension, sfGFP could not be independent from the                     copy number, in any case.
While trying to locate the problem, we noticed that, in order for the                     system to acquire a reasonable dcas concentration, we had to change its                     dissociation constant, .In Figure 3, kd’s                     maximum value is ,but scanning this parameter for a bigger range                     we found that if we                     increase it to ,we will finally get satisfying                     results.
Figure 4: dcas concentration over time. Effects of tetR repression for                         different kd.
After we shared this result with Wet lab, combined with the fact that the                     kd for which our system works, disagrees with those found in bibliography                     [4][5], we decided to make an experiment to validate the functionality of                    "

As the signal ""ticks"" the clock, the clock changes color and observer can use the color or combination of colors to tell what ""time"" it is. Their team built a linear clock which can be used to keep track on what metabolites are present and what are being produced in the biological system.
In their construct, ribolock 1(CR) prevents translation of gene Y and in the presence of ribokey1(TA), gene Y is translated to activate transcription of another ribokey2(TA) which can open up the loop of another ribolock2(CR). Although they claimed to design and construct some of the parts including key3C and lock3d, no characterisation result was found regarding these CR and TA.

Abstract: Peking 2007 project concerned with the ability for bacterial cells to differentiate out in homogeneous conditions. They aimed to build devices conferring host cells with the ability to form cooperating groups spontaneously and to take consecutive steps sequentially even when the genetic background and environmental inputs are identical . In order to achieve this,  they needed two devices responsible for temporal and spatial differentiation.
To meet the need of spatial differentiation in an assembly line, the system of hop-count conjugation for cell-cell communication was developed in E. coli.  The signals transferred are represented by DNA sequence, and record the times of transfer by losing tandem region at every conjugation event. To construct this system, tandem oriT pairs are inserted into signaling plasmid, and relaxase responsible for initiating conjugation events are removed from natural conjugation system and (attaching a terminator) inserted between these oriT pairs. At each single conjugation event, with the expression relaxase, the corresponding tandem oriT pair is lost with the"

Growing the bacteria
The strains that we had in possession were Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus (ATCC 11842), Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. lactis (ATCC 10697), and Lactobacillus acidophilus. At first, due to our unfamiliarity, we had a hard time growing up the bacteria. We have written a protocol for growing strains of Lactobacillus here . In short, Lactobacillus requires MRS medium, anaerobic conditions, and a longer incubation time.
Transforming the bacteria
The major uncertainty in our project was the task of transforming the Lactobacillus. From our research we found a electrotransformation protocol by Serror et al (App and Env Microbiology, 2002). Further research convinced us that electroporation was the strategy we needed to abide by due to the inability to transform Lactobacillus chemically, given that it is a gram-positive bacteria. Finally, we discovered that Lactobacillus strains were only electrocompetent with a very limited range of plasmids, due to possible DNA restriction and other factors.
plasmid pTG262 - Last year's Edinburgh team worked with the plasmid pTG262 in trying to transform it into different gram-positive bacteria. They had not transformed it into Lactobacillus but were optimistic that it could be, since pTG262 is known to be able to replicate in strains of Lactobacillus. Dr. Chris French was very helpful and graciously supplied us with this plasmid. Working extensively with this plasmid with all of our strains of bacteria, we were unable to successfully transform pTG262 into Lactobacillus, and we have concluded that it is our opinion that pTG262 cannot be electroporated into Lactobacillus delbruckii. We have added characterization to this part's main page and user review page, here .

Following our halfway-presentation at the end of August, ing. Liesbeth Idema, online editor of the Wageningen University, published a short article “Support Wageningse iGEM-team bij detecteren tropische ziektes” on the Intranet. The intranet of the Wageningen University is only accesible by employees. The article covers our aim and raises attention for our Crowdfunding project.
Bionieuws
Bionieuws is a magazine for biologists in The Netherlands. Via drs. Gert van Maanen, a small article in their magazine on the iGEM competition was posted (25 August 2017, year 27, page 12), featuring all Dutch iGEM teams, including iGEM Wageningen. The article, “Zes Nederlandse teams in iGEM-competitie” cannot be reached online, but the page of the magazine can be found below.

Comparing its spectrum with the one provided from the database seems to be (z)-11-hexadecenal, a desired pheromone,  which is being produced by the plant itself using an endogenous alcohol oxidase. Nevertheless as it is produced with a low yield, the FAO1 of C. tropicalis search is still in progress.
The rest of the samples were prepared for the GC-MS analysis.
The samples were weighted, introduced in the vial and added with EDTA and CaCl2.
94,0 mg of P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos leaf (replica 2)
102,4 mg of TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos leaf (replica 1)
92,0 mg of TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and TU EaDAcT and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos leaf(replica 2)
Results of the replicae analysis are shown below:
In this replica, the sample with the TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos construction shows a huge production of (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol.
In this replica, the sample with the TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and TU EaDAcT and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos shows a higher abundance of (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol and z-11-hexadecen-1-ol acetate.
In order to verify that the analysed compounds are the desired pheromones, we acquired standards for (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol and (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol acetate and (z)-11-hexadecenal, and indeed, the analysed compunds were the right ones.
08/14/2014
We had problems to amplify the FAO1 gene, so in order to obtain it we performed a colony PCR. Using this method, it is possible to amplify a fragment directly from a colony rather than a DNA sample.
We made two different PCRs, one of them as a positive control and the other one to amplify our disered DNA fragment.

Possible directions:
1. Super metal-resistant cell
2. Magnetosomes—Dr. Rao not a fan. Can’t just stick a plasmid in to get it to work.
3. Metal Immobilization
4. Metal mobilization
Working on metal resistant cell for now since it’s a prereq for everything else we would want to do with metals.
challenges with metal systems: Dr. Rao tried to activate fer with iron but never able to do so. LB isn’t gonna work, going to have to use minimal media, chelate treat to pull out ions. Have to make sure there aren’t any metals around. Most not active at high concentrations of metal. Chelating agent in media to keep it from the cell.
try to find salmonella counterparts of the genes in e.coli
ZntA expressed by one of Dr. Jin’s grad student and it works to export zinc. Exports lead and copper too. Just express a few efflux pumps and it should be pretty resistant to most metals.
People to talk to:
Dianne Newman—looking for a mechanism of 3-4 genes to clone
mutagenize e.coli, grow on metal until something that survives. Chop up DNA, put it on plasmids, transform, see which lives, that’s the one with the metal resistant gene.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Project#Entrepeneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," of the CINDY Seq.
Cas13a is patent-pending and therefore the owners of the Cas13a patent have time to develop their own on site detection methods that integrate with Cas13a.
CINDY Seq is open source due to the iGEM competition and therefore, easy to copy.
Figure 1: Outcome of our SWOT analysis.
Our patenting process
What is a patent?
A patent is a set of exclusive rights to inventors of a non-obvious solution to a technical problem. Once a patent is granted, the holder has the exclusive rights to the commercial benefits of the invention. For our novel detection method CINDY Seq, we filed a patent application with the Netherlands patent office (Octrooicentrum Nederland, Den Haag). The idea came up in one of our weekly meetings, in which we discussed weekly updates and thought about better ways for a readout of our Cas13a  detection assay. Clearly the interdisciplinarity of our team was an asset here. We speculated about the feasibility of using a phase transition as readout, and from that moment on it went pretty quick. We first tested the principle by showing that a non-specific RNase (RNase A) would redissolve RNA/spermine coacervates. This was indeed the case as we describe on the results page , and we speculated that the RNase A could be interchanged by activated Cas13a. Later in the project, we also successfully did this, giving a full proof of principle of CINDY Seq.
When could we file a patent?
Although in principle it is possible to file patent applications for an idea on itself, we were advised by patent attorneys to give a proof of principle before filing. In the following we would like to share some of our experiences how we got to this point. The entire process was accompanied by our supervisor Louis Reese, patent officers from TU Delft, and patent attorneys (from NLO). In the process of filing, there were several important steps that are chronologically described in this section. Once we realized the novelty of combining the physical phenomenon of coacervation with Cas13a, it also appeared that there might be enormous potential for even broader applications. Therefore, it was decided to disclose our idea to the patent office from TU Delft. This amounts to filling in a standardized form in which the inventors are listed and briefly describe their invention. At this stage, the invention is still not to be made public, as this internal disclosure does not provide actual protection on the intellectual property. This meant that it still had to be"

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
In order to amplify different DNA-templates, preferably from plasmids, different PCR approaches were used - with the following component amounts for 50 µl of a total volume. 31.5 µl of water, 10 µl of 5x Q5 Reaction Buffer, 4 µl of 2.5 mM dNTP solution, 1 µl of DNA template (200 ng), 1 µl of 10 µM Forward and Reverse Primer, 1 µl of DMSO and 0.5 µl of Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase. Apart from Touch-down variants and annealing temperature gradient analyses, thermocycler programs consisted of the guideline annotated below.
Assembly PCR
in case of Gibson Assemblies subsequent to fragment amplification, a reduction of fragment quantities to less than five was soon considered appropriate for more efficient Cloning. Assembly PCRs were established for halving the amounts, by using a consecutive double PCR strategy. Expect for Forward and Reverse Primers, all components of a Standard PCR were joined as mentioned above. A first PCR was done with an annealing temperature derived from the sequences of overlapping template regions. Elongation temperature was estimated by considering the fragment length of the larger DNA template (1 kBP per 30 seconds). Five cycles were performed. 2.5 µl of 10 µM Forward and Reverse Primers, both"

Secretory module-parts design
In the secretory module, we choose GAL1-controlled expression vector, which contains an alpha-factor signal peptide to facilitate the secretion of our exogenous proteins. (see Figure 6)
Figure 6 Map of pYES2/CT/α-Factor
And then, we insert varied target gene sequences respectively into the multiple cloning site shown as a square box below. (see Figure 7)
Consequently, there will be four types of recombinant proteins. They are alpha-tubulin (pYCα-α tubulin: BBa_K2220022) , β-tubulin (pYCα-β tubulin: BBa_K2220023) , mcherry fused with α-tubulin (pYCα-mCherry-α tubulin: BBa_K2220024) and β-tubulin fused with mGFP (pYCα-β-tubulin-mGFP: BBa_K2220025) . (see Figure 7) We also designed a vector which contains alpha-factor fused with mCherry as our positive control in protein expression analysis. This positive control part is pYCα-mCherry. (BBa_K2220021)

Figure 8 The schematics of microtubule polymerization on yeast cell surface
Mixing the yeast of module 1 and the production of module 2 in one system, we can then accomplish the self-assembly of microtubules on the yeast cell wall in suitable conditions. Once the assembly is stabled by Taxol®, the fluorescent intensity of the sample can be different. So we can wash the remaining free tubulin dimers and test the affinity effect by the fluorescent intensity difference.

What is flagellar filament?
As we all know, the flagella filament is a helical structure composed of subunits of flagellin. And among various flagellin, the FliC has its own unique features. The N- and C-terminal regions of the FliC are important for filament formation (Klein, 2012), which are the D0"

The boys and girls were always stimulated to speculate, trace hypotheses and show arguments (for or against), but direct answers were not easily given to them. After each group final presentation, students were argued and evaluated by other students (their pairs!), which decided if the group efforts deserved or not a reward (two yummy chocolates…).

Colanic Acid protection of cells
Background
RcsB (biobrick BBa_K200000 is the gene responsible for generating a colanic acid capsule around our bacteria. Having a colanic acid capsule around them will protect them from being degraded by the high acidic nature of the stomach environment.
Aim
Here, as proof of concept, we have designed a simple experiment that will show that colanic acid has a protective effect on our growing bacteria in acidic environments (simulating gastric conditions).
Experimental Method
In a multiple well plate, 2 different types of cell cultures were grown, both containing the BBa_I13522 construct, which is a constitutive promoter expressing GFP.  The differences were:
Sample cultures contained colanic acid (chemically induced by p-Fluoro-L-phenylalanine (FPA))
Control cultures did not contain colanic acid.
Triplicates of the samples and controls were performed.
Growth rate of the cell cultures and levels of GFP expression were monitored over time, at different pH values in order to decide if induction using colanic acid provides extra protection to the construct.

1.int_evalue=-\(\log_{10}\)(evalue)
Evalue is the main threshold parameter, unfortunately the value, which varying from 1e-6 to 0,is too small for SVM to do classification. To solve this, we use the int_evalue to replace it.
2.pident
int_evalue limits the similarity of the hits by control the probability of the hits’ appearance in the whole searching space, for every specific hit, we use pident.
3.pqlen=length/qlen
To filtrate the short fragments, we bring in the ratio parameter pqlen.
High similarity requires high value of all three parameters
(2) Constructing training set
We‘ve randomly chose 1/10 items from BLAST result and identified them by manually comparing the consistency of the two sequences in the databases they belong to, with labeling the idented items with 1 and unidented with 0.
(3) Training
Sklearn is a well-known machine learning package for python, which is powerful and convenient to use, we use it to do our classification. [3][4]
gridsearch
We use gridsearch strategy to search for the optimal parameters, for coding sequence, the result is: degree=3,C=0.44,penalty=l1, which make the accuracy of 3-fold cross validation reach up to 0.985.
Fig.4.Decision boundary
Result
The result of 3 fold cross-validation shows the accuracy of this model reaches up to  0.985. For coding sequence, we labeled the 8590 items after the preliminary screening with this model and get the result as follows: True:6404 False:2186
Fig.5.Prediction result
We compared this classifier with SVM(support vector machine) classifier, the 3-fold validation accuracy of SVM classifier is around 0.93, lower than the value of logistic regression classifier(about 0.98). We plotted the ROC(receiver operating characteristic) curve of this two classifier, the result is as follows:
Fig.6.ROC curve
The AUC(Area Under roc Curve) value of logistic regression classifier is 0.99, while the number of SVM(support vector machine) is 0.94, which shows that the former one is better.
Prediction Model
CNN
Based on the LeNet-5 structure, we constructed a convolutional neural network to predict promoter. Through the movement of the convolution kernel on the input data, it will extract the most basic features.

Single Expression
This really cool 13C labeling experiment was done at the research center 'Forschungszentrum Jülich', where Prof. Dr. Wiechert offered all necessary equipment and components to us. Jannick Kappelmann instructed two iGEM Team Aachen members (Jonas R. & Tobias S.) during the whole experiment.
Summary
A batch fermentation with 13C labeled methanol as an additional carbon source was done to demonstrate the functionality of our methanol assimilation pathway. Afterwards 13C labeled carbon atoms were measured  via mass spectrometry.
Two different constructs were tested in E. coli BL21 Gold (DE3).
Methanol Condensation Cycle scheme
Sugars are the first metabolites that will contain 13C if the pathway works successfully. The initial step is the assembly of formaldehyde.
One of them was the polycistronic expression cassette and the other one was the mdh behind a IPTG inducable T7 promoter in pSB1A30.
Different amounts of methanol were added to each reactor to make the polycistronic construct comparable with itself to generate more independent data.
Offgas analysis of one cultivation with the mdh construct was done constantly during the fermentation. Ideally, it detects labled carbondioxide which is produced via the detoxification pathway of E. coli as a response to the formaldehyde produced by the Mdh.
The samples for analysis of cytosolic metabolites were taken after one doubling time (ca. 2:25 h).
The analysis was done by mass spectrometry of fructose-bis-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate and ribose-5-phosphate.
The MS-detection of cytosolic metabolites covered additionally DHAP, Xylulose-5-phosphate, Fructose-6-phosphate, E4P, 2Phosphoglycerat/"

A) This figure shows that R-GECO in cells are activated after the 200mM KCl inducing. We take this group as the positive control group since we consider that the indicators were full-activated at this state. This is because 200mM KCl can cause plenty of calcium influx into the cell through calcium channel in cells membrane. B) This figure shows the light induced R-GECO activation, the light can cause the conformational change of CoChR, then cause calcium influx into the cell. The sharp peak on this curve proves that the light inducing is much more sensitive than the chemical signal.
Based on the result, we determine to use 470nm to activate the CoChR and 395nm for the excitation of GEM-GECO.
Genetic integration of synthetic circuits into C.elegans strains
We used the miniMos system to integrate the gene circuits into C.elegans genome. After injection and selection (Fig.2), we successfully obtained  the inserted worms (Odr-10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry and str-1::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::GFP) .
Fig.2  F1 Negative selection. peel-1 is a negative selection marker used to select against animals carrying extra- chromosomal arrays and assist with identifying animals that have endogenous locus insertions. This marker was co-injected with the target gene along with the heatshock promoter, after heatshock the worms with multiple extra- chromosomal arrays will all die (A) while the worms with endogenous locus insertion will survive (B). After 34°C,4h heatshock, these alive worms will be picked out for fluorescence checking.

In-Vitro Characterization
In vitro Main | Why TetR? | Mutant TetRs | MITOMI Data | In-vivo & In-vitro outline
When we generate new libraries of transcription factors using site-directed mutagenesis, we need to have a precise and high-throughput characterization method. These two requirements are met by the microfluidics MITOMI device that we used.
Characterizing a lot of different mutants will allow us to get a better understanding of the mutations influencing the specificity and affinity of a transcription factor. With these parameters in hand, we will be able to fine-tune the characteristics of the newly produced transcription factors.
The new transcription factors mutants characterized in vitro then need to be tested in vivo. This last step is explained in the "" in vivo characterization section"".

Tomorrow, Katie and I will also be giving our notecards some more editting and readthroughs and then sending them to over (every time I read mine, I think of something else I have to add, which is kind of bad...)
Wiki Updates and Clean-up
Did the daily blog/news update for the wiki. I also converted a few elements on all the pages to templates (eg. the notebook sidebar) to make it easier to edit multiple pages at once, and make the code cleaner so people can read it more easily. We figured out that the easiest way to make tables is to type them in excel, save them as a html file and then copy the source.

A new day, a new bunch of code to write
Retrospective Notebook: This entry was not written on this day, but derived later from working notes I made that day.
Toyed with the idea of making enzymes which produce some small molecules or other, or degrade the same (AiiA for example). Couldn't figure out a good way to control such objects, once again, clicking is already reserved for movement, so it would be necessary to create yet another screen in the HUD to manage these enzymes.
Today was a day of choices though, most of the rough edges on the previously implemented features had been sanded away, now I got to choose what to try to implement next. The two big contenders were cofactors for dna binding proteins, and the biobrick designer aka biobricker, with the interaction checker a distant third.
I settled on the biobricker, because the ability to easily build devices of any configuration is such a huge part of what the simulator is meant to be, and it will actually be an extremely useful tool for building and testing all of the remaining parts as well. Cofactors would increase the range of the simulation, allowing lac, tet and lux operons to be more accurately described. But that just means more extremely painful assembly by hand of even more biobricks for each level! Interaction checker would have the same problem, to really put the checker through its paces and test lots of different systems in different configurations means having lots of biobrick devices available, which means a working biobricker.
So, I got right to work, and produced this basic outline for the biobrick display by the end of the day:
display += ""Biobricker     "";        display += ""X Name         "";        display += ""X Name         "";        display += """

Introduction
As we develop our IL-2 delivery mechanism, we have considered the ethical, practical and legal implications of implementing such treatment in the current Canadian oncology institutions. How reasonable is it to mass produce for regular usage? Who will be paying? How will it be administered? Who will regulate it? How secure is our product?
First, we introduce our prospective product: the lactobacilli in a pill form, similar to a probiotic pill.
Product Description:
The pill will contain our engineered bacteria condensed within a microcapsule to protect them from the upper GI tract and help localize to the colon. Specifically, we are aiming to use resistant starch which cannot be metabolized by pancreatic enzymes but is fermented by gut microflora in the colon, releasing our bacteria.1 In addition, starch is non-toxic and a normal component of human diet, making it less likely to cause adverse reactions. Additionally, we know from past work that lactic acid bacteria that is protected by the potato starch granules can survive for 6 months in room temperature, and 18 months when frozen.1 This indicates relatively moderate shelf life if our product is"

The colorectal cancer
Colorectal cancer includes tumors affecting a segment of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. It is treatable and, in most cases, curable when detected early, before they haven`t spread to other organs. Most of these tumors starts from polyps, benign lesions may grow on the inner wall of the large intestine.
The estimated new cases in Brazil in 2013 was 32,600, 15,070 men and 17,530 women. These values correspond to an estimated risk of 15 new every 100 000 men and 16 women per 100 thousand cases. While the number of deaths was 14,016, with 7,198 woman and 6.818 man, as updated in 2011. According to the National Cancer Institute (INCA) was estimated incidence of Colorectal Cancer, 2006, as the 5th most common malignancy among men (with 11,390 new) and 4 among women (13,970 new cases) cases, being higher in the age group between 50 and 70 years, but the potential development has increased from 40 years. (INCA, Souza et al, 2008)
The diagnosis requires a biopsy (take tissue fragment removed the suspicious lesion), made by handset introduced by rectum (endoscope). This procedure is invasive and often inhibits patients to submit to this practice, hampering the discovery of cancer at an early stage and thereby reducing the chances of effective treatment and cure. Thinking this bias, our group, The Colonyeast, is developing a methodology for noninvasive diagnosis.
DNA-L
From different approaches to colorectal cancer screening, Klaassen et al (2003) proposed a noninvasive method to it. Analysis of stool samples from colorectal cancer patients contain increased concentration of human DNA. This increase could be explained by decreased apoptosis of bowel cells and/or increased shedding of cancer. Ahlquist et al. (2000) have already demonstrated that large DNA fragments were amplified from DNA in stool samples from colorectal cancer patients more frequently than from healthy volunteers.  Analysis of human DNA extracted from stool specimens is a recent, simple and potentially interesting approach for"

TO THE NEXT GENERATION
To introduce the synthetic biological methods to reduce antibiotic residues to more people, especially students interested in biology, we came to deliver a speech to high school students on the topic of antibiotic and synthetic biology.
In the speech, three of our team members talked about the concept of synthetic biology and the iGEM competition. Also, we focused on our own project, especially the exposure to varied antibiotics, which is really a health hazard to everyone. (Fig. 2)
Fig. 2
After the speech, the students showed great interests in the competition and asked several questions like the ideas about synthetic biology as far as they were concerned and other ways to reduce antibiotic residues in the environment. Delightedly, we discussed some related topics on synthetic biology such as biological safety. Meanwhile, we’d got a lot of ideas from the audience. This presentation introduced synthetic biology to the next generation and raised their interests.
WITH COUNTERPARTS:
During a wonderful meeting held at PKU, we met iGEMers from Peking University, Tianjin University, and Beijing Institute of Technology. First, each team took 10-15 minutes to introduce their project design (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the team BIT was also working on a TA module-based kill switch. They have focused on a toxin from MazF family, while we tested varies putative toxins from a database provided by our Instructor. Having found the similarity in our projects, we discussed how to characterize the toxicity of a toxin protein, as well as protocols for measuring the growth curve of bacteria.
Fig. 3a
Fig. 3b
Fig. 3c
Next, we discussed problems and obstacles we had during the experiments. Sometimes talking with others can really help us with solving upsetting problems in the lab.
Fig. 6
We also got suggestions from PKU on how to measure the growth curve. Initially, after shaking for 12 hours, we dilute liquid culture for 1000 times. IPTG is added subsequently to induce the expression of the toxin.                         However, some members from PKU suggested that we induce toxin expression when the value of OD600 is approximate to 0.5.                         By doing so, we"

This week we spent a night at an outreach event ""Beakerhead"" downtown where we helped the public draw with fluorescent bacteria. We spent the weekend with the team at aGEM, where we gave a presentation of our project and received helpful feedback on it. During the meeting on Sunday, we took on the task of biobricking our 20 synthesized constructs so that they can be submitted to the registry. Below is a table that we made which we will update at the end of each coming week so that we can keep track of what parts get to what step, which ones succeed and also when some fail (which we all know they will) that we will know where they failed and then can begin taking it back a step (or two) to see if we can get it to work on a second try. We have given each part in the ""synthesized construct"" column a shortened name: easy to identify the full name if you go to the Benchling account and look under ""Assembled Constructs"". Some synthesized parts have not been able to be successfully transformed yet into E.coli. I am going to start with the ones that have and once I am through the process once I will go back and attempt to transform them again.
Week 16: Sept 8 - 12
Blood PCR has shown to work wonderfully, with PCR products formed at a blood concentration of 20% v/v; the KAPA blood PCR kit used claimed to have optimal efficiency up to 10% blood v/v. The blood-compatibility is conferred by a second-generation Taq polymerase, engineered via directed-evolution, that is resistant to polymerase inhibitors typically found in blood. For comparison, PCR with typical first-generation Taq showed drastically reduced efficiency of amplification at blood concentration of 1% v/v.
The next step was to show that isothermal PCR (RPA), supplemented with the blood-compatible Taq polymerase, would work efficiently even in the presence of blood. 25, 50, or 75% of the volume of the isothermal PCR reaction (i.e. the buffer and water) was substituted with the KAPA blood PCR mix. Results showed that indeed the blood PCR kit supplement allowed isothermal PCR to work in the presence of up to 10% v/v of blood, when 25% of the volume was by the blood PCR mix. Unfortunately at 50% and 75% substitution, the reaction did not work at all"
