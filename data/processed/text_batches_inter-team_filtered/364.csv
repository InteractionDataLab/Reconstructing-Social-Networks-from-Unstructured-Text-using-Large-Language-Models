BIT-China,2015,Team:BIT-China#modeling Fine-regulation circuits.html_-_-_TEXT.html," Bxb1 (Fig.9). Bxb1 can invert the constitutive promoter to both sides, thus, the eventual pH level is determined by strength of both acid and alkali.
Fig.9 The gene circuits of Bxb1 regulation system.
The processes of the regulation circuit are described as followed:
(1) At first, because normal fermentation pH tends to be acidic, J23119 is in the direction of GadA production (alkali device).
(2) In alkaline environment (pH＞7.0), P-atp2 is induced and produces Bxb1, which switches the direction of J23119 to generate LdhA (acid device).
(3) Bxb1 will switch J23119 to both sides, and eventually the inversion efficiency of Bxb1 to both sides are the same.
(4) The final environmental pH is determined by strength of acid and alkali produced by LdhA (for acid) and GadA (for alkali).
Here we assumed that Bxb1 had reached stable condition, where the inversion efficiency of Bxb1 to both sides are the same.
Basing on processes above, the reaction equations are described as followed:
Results proved that with the application of Bxb1 regulation circuit, pH Controller could regulate environmental pH to the level determined by the strength of acid and alkali (Fig.10).
Fig.10 pH level change led by Bxb1 regulation circuit. In alkaline environment, p-atp2 is induced, activating downstream Bxb1 to invert the direction of J23119. Bxb1 can invert the constitutive promoter to both sides, thus, the eventual pH level is determined by strength of both acid and alkali.
FimE Regulation Circuit
The last fine-regulation circuit is led by recombinase FimE (Fig.11). This recombinase can only invert the promoter for one time.
Fig.11 The gene circuits of FimE regulation system.
The processes of the circuit are described as followed:
(1) Similar to Bxb1 circuit, the initial direction of J23119 points to GadA.
(2) When pH raises higher than 7.0, P-atp2 is induced and produces recombinase FimE.
(3) FimE will change the direction of J23119 to acid production. The circuit will generate acid till stable condition.
The reaction processes are:
The differential equations are:
Results proved that with the application of FimE regulation circuit, pH Controller could regulate environmental pH to the level determined by the strength of acid (Fig.12)."
Lethbridge,2017,Team:Lethbridge#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,") days are defined as a variety of specialized training sessions to help administrators and teachers improve their ability to teach [1]. To better integrate synthetic biology concepts within the existing Alberta curriculum, the teachers we spoke with suggested that PD days would be an effective way to ensure that teachers understand the concepts to effectively teach students. Our team paired up with SynBridge, a makerspace located in the University of Lethbridge, to begin the process of hosting these workshops. Our team will work on designing the workshops to be held on PD days, with SynBridge providing the space to host them and acting as a resource for teachers after our iGEM season has ended.
We met with Emily Wilton, the coordinator for SynBridge, to discuss how we would work on the design of the Professional Development Day workshops. Emily told us that they would like to provide the workshops free of charge or at a subsidized rate for the schools, which help to accommodate the limited teaching budgets. We would also work on the design of experiments to teach, while keeping in contact with teachers to ensure they would meet the curriculum needs.
When we discussed our plans with the Winston Churchill Science Department, the best direction to have the PD days instilled was discussed. They suggested forming a collaborative community. In Alberta, a collaborative community is defined as a group of teachers being able to focus on any one school-related topic and is open for any teacher to join. Moving forward in this direction, this would also allow these PD days to be open to the whole school district in Lethbridge.
The teachers are planning on visiting SynBridge facilities on April 9th and plan on using this visit to move forward with the development of more synthetic biology initiatives in their curriculum. We plan on this being a long-term goal to be continued on after our season has ended.

To make navigation as easy as possible, we've used the default iGEM pages and spent a long time thinking about the structure of the rest of our site. The navigation bar was significantly revised four times in efforts to make it as easy to find the relevant pages as possible, and we've tried to avoid using hidden nested subpages. If you do want a full list of pages with subpages you can see our sitemap . We set up several redirects to make it easier to guess links, although we believe they shouldn’t be required with our navigation bar. In addition, we scattered links throughout our text to prevent you having to hunt for the right page when we reference another part of our project.
We believe many teams don't take full advantage of the template system Mediawiki offers. By compartmentalizing all the repeated sections we made our code more readable, allowing members of our team with no coding experience at all to go in and edit sections (unfortunately they won’t now stop talking about how they’re programming geniuses). Templates also makes it easier to update styles - ensuring all our pages have a consistent feel that makes navigating them easier and look better.
We shared a lot of this knowledge with other teams, including Judd School, University of Westminster and Carroll High School. More information about this is available on our collaborations page .

Quality Aquaculture
The production of global aquaculture has risen annually owing to the exhaustion of marine resources and the population exploration, nevertheless, the food quality didn’t derive deserved care and been improved enough. Take Taiwan for example, the water for aquaculture is always drawn from groundwater, but the groundwater is highly risky to be polluted by the nearby illegal factories and the fishermen do not have effective tools to prevent it. In addition, Fisherman usually keeps fish in high density for cost down, which results in the serious sanitary problem. Moreover, a large amount of antibiotic and hormone blended in mash are widely used to keep survival rate. In the end, the wastewater will be discharged without sewage disposal. What’s worse, it contaminates the source and nature through the water cycle. If the fishermen could try our system for monitor and bring the information to the public, the customers can purchase at ease. It promotes not only the added value of aquaculture but also human’s welfare and environmental protection. Our ultimate purpose is to increase people’s faith in aquaculture and decrease the reliance of wild aquatic products at the same time.
For these goals, we have visited several institutions, experts, and potential users, looking for the real condition. In addition, we make a piece of the questionnaire to investigate the people’s opinion and hope to perfect our plan. The good news is that what we have presumed before is likely to be true - our project is right for our society!!! It’s a great deal of encouragement for us. In conclusion, what we want to do now is try our best to accomplish this project, hoping that it will continuously influence our world forever.

Material and Methods
On this figure we show the plasmid we created in order to insert the hfsG and hfsH genes.
pSB1AK3 final plasmid
The following bricks come from the BioBricks partsregistry . We chose a lactose inductible promoter so that we could easily control the expression of the genes of interest. This promoter is the BBa R0011 brick (located in the pSB1A2 ampicillin resistant plasmid).
The RBS (ribosome binding site) and the RFP bricks are located on the same plasmid (BBa K093005). RFP is a reporter gene. If the glue is not released (or we can not detect it), we will know the genes are expressed.
We chose a commonly used terminator, namely BBa B0015 (located on the pSB1AK3 kanamycin resistant plasmid). The replication origin is a pUC19-derived pMB1 (copy number of 100-300 per cell). The final plasmid pSB1AK3 is ampicillin and kanamycin resistant. Seeing the importance of hfsG ans hfsH in our project, they were optimized and synthesized MrGene ). Their sequences have been optimized for two reasons:
First they are compatible with all assembly standards
Secondly the use of codon is not the same in Caulobacter crescentus and in E. coli. This could limit the rate of translation of our genes.
The hfsG and hsfH sequences show the restriction sites and the optimized codons ( Appendix ).
Transformation
To increase the amount of plasmidic material, we performed transformations with DG1 E. coli competent cells from Delphi Genetics . Its genotype is the following"
UNSW_Australia,2016,Team:UNSW Australia#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,", our first gel screening 10 g3p-in-Duet colonies got 10 hits! We miniprepped two of these, performed a PCR to sequence the insert, and at the end of week received sequencing data confirming that these were both successfully inserted.
During the week we also tried a simple assay for quantifying OMVs. Taking our solutions of harvested OMVs, we loaded them into a 96-well plate and added a dye that fluoresces strongly when embedded into lipid membranes. This was a simple first pass at comparing OMV production between delta-tolA, delta-degP, and a negative control, but the data pointed to a need for further testing when we get a different set of filters.
And on Wednesday we went back to the Airyscan microscope, this time to image our harvested OMVs at high resolution. Unfortunately, we saw nothing, and upon further digging realised that the microscope could never hit a good enough resolution to clearly resolve OMVs, which typically average around 15nm in diameter. It's tough to get this heartbreak so late in the project, but we had to look for alternatives and located a device called the NanoSight, which we will try next week.
Week 21: October 17 - October 23
Overexpression Team
The final week of iGEM saw us in a mad rush to finish parts. Here, we reattempted Gibson ligations and transformations to put missing parts into pSB1C3, and began the screening process by colony PCRs.
We also completed two runs of harvesting OMVs, using our latest protocol with a 100kDa filter. The first of these was given to the team at EnGeneIc to image using their Nanosight, while the rest were used for nanodropping, to test whether this could be adapted to measure OMV concentration
And in the few hours before Wiki freeze, we will be going to the Airyscan microsope for one last run. Let's hope it's good!"
British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#ConsortiaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," PCR purified a couple of other knockouts (ArgE Tet and TrpB Kan) and transformed them, reusing the electroshock cuvettes we borrowed from Rafael. A pack of 50 was ordered so we could do more than 4 transformations per day. They are currently growing in the 30°C room on the second floor.
We only had one chlor plate left, and 4 potential biobricks which were to be put on the chloramphenicol resistant pSB1C3 plasmid. Since there was only one plate (and one electroshock cuvette), only the MetA biobrick ligation product was transformed.
The pKD46 recombineering vector that we received from Dr. Ramey grew well overnight at 30°C, and was miniprepped, and then transformed into the Epi300 strain. The recovery period was done at 30°C as well. If the transformation is successful, Ting will make electrocompetent cells out of the Epi300+pKD46.

July 7
In the past couple of days, we have found candidate knockouts for all relevant genes but trpA, and attempted to confirm that they were all actual knockouts by PCR. Unfortunately, none of the PCR's worked. We suspect that it was because of a bad enzyme, so some of the reactions were repeated. Currently, the results are inconclusive as to whether or not the knockouts are actually knockouts. We also ordered the relevant knockouts from the Keio collection.
Colonies with potential biobricks of trpA, tyrA, argE, metA, and dszD were successfully grown. This time, chemically competent cells were used, and they were plated on 1/2 concentration chlor plates. We also transformed and grew out the previously characterized minC biobrick.
To physiologically characterize the knockouts, we made M9 plates, and plan to set up an amino acid gradient. Sadly, we ran out of M9 salts before we could make tet plates, so some knockouts can't be tested in this manner yet. We also made spec plates to grow some things from the registry, but a lawn grew on the negative control. Looking into the literature, it looks like the concentrated antibiotic we were using was not the correct strength.
PCR of the yddg gene failed yet again. It is possible that the primers are not correct.

The miniMos system contains 4 vectors——transposon with target gene, transposase, mcherry and peer-1 markers. Transposon needs transposase to cut and paste in the genome. mcherry and peer-1 are two negative selecter that can help to select the target strains.

The method has some advantages: 1)The insertion frequency and fidelity is high. 2)The exact insertion site can be determined. 3)Large transgenes can be inserted. 4)The miniMos element is active in C. elegans. 5)Transgenes are expressed in the germline at high frequency.
How to get the worms?
As a classic model organism, C. elegans has many advantages.It is one of the simplest organisms with a nervous system. Research has explored the neural and molecular mechanisms that control several behaviors of C. elegans, including chemotaxis, thermotaxis, mechanotransduction, learning, memory, and mating behaviour. Therefore, C. elegans is a suitable model organism which we can easily manipulate and observe. In our program, we aim to change the physical behaviour of C. elegans by using the two specific optogenetic traits. Through microinjection and selection, we are able to get two strains with two phenotypes of the preference to blue light and the aversion to red light, and the next step is to obtain the single worm with the combination of these 2 different traits.
To achive our objectives, we choose a mating method, because it is less time-consuming and easier to operate than microinjecting the other array to the existed strain.
In general, mating is the pairing of either opposite-sex or hermaphroditic organisms. However, for C. elegans, mating can hybridize two different traits on the next generation by the paring of the hermaphrodite and the male. Besides, one of the greatest advantages of C. elegans is that it can either autocopulation or hybridization, which means that after hybridization, the hermaphrodite can self-fertilize and guarantee to produce a large number of offsprings with identical genetic characteristics.
Here is the mating procedures: Mating procedures: 1.Heat shock to get males(30℃,8h). 2.Parents mating to get the first filial hybrid generation(female : male = 3 : 4"

\[ F_{d}=6\pi\eta R_{H} v \tag{1.5} \label{eq:1.5} \]
where vt is the terminal velocity and RH the hydrodynamic radius.
Solving for vt, we get
\[ v_{t}=\frac{Vg}{6\pi\eta R_H} (\rho-\rho_{gv}) \tag{1.6} \label{eq:1.6} \]
For a typical haloarchaeal gas vesicle, the terminal velocity is on the order of 10 nm/s, which is incredibly slow considering that a gas vesicle moving at this speed will take about thirty seconds to cover its own length!
Note that this is a very bare-bones approach to calculating the terminal velocity of a gas vesicle which is only an order of magnitude factor in our other calculations. A more detailed analysis was done by the UAlberta 2017 iGEM regarding the flotation of cells containing gas vesicles. The latter part of their model was borrowed from our own analysis on gas vesicles in a diffusive regime.
Knowing the hydrodynamic radius of the particle, we can modify the various parameters to determine its terminal velocity. Notice an interesting fact: while the viscous drag scales with radius, the buoyant force scales with volume! Even this preliminary modelling is sufficient to decide the direction of our project: to make gas vesicles float better, we need to pack them together in a small volume — we have to aggregate them!
Péclet number
The Péclet number is a dimensionless quantity that is used to determine the relative magnitudes of advective and diffusive transport phenomena. In the case of a particle undergoing flotation, it can be calculated by taking the following ratio:
\[ P_e=\frac{Lu}{D} \tag{2.1} \label{eq:2.1} \]
where L is the characteristic length scale of the system (~200 nm for a gas vesicle), u the local velocity of the fluid and D the mass diffusion coefficient.
The Einstein relation for a spherical particle gives the diffusion coefficient from the viscosity of the medium through the following relation
\[ D=\frac{k_{b}T}{6\pi \eta R_{H}} \tag{2.2} \label{eq:2.2} \]
Now, the terminal flow velocity from the last section can be used to calculate the Péclet number for this system. If the Péclet number is extremely small compared to 1, diffusion is dominant over advective"

Our setup was heavily inspired by Tabor Lab. In their experiments they exposed bacterial cultures to light using a Light Tube Array (LTA). The LTA consists of 64 individually controlled slots for tubes and it can be placed inside an incubator in order to gather big amounts of experiments with precise control.
Only very little technical information about the rig hardware was available, so we designed our own. They still work using the same principles.
Their rig is much better calibrated than ours. They precondition the cultures with a ""staggered start"", which assures similar starting conditions for each tube (Olson et al., 2014, Supplementary Note 1). We did not perform this kind of starting procedure, but all our cultures were grown in the dark in similar conditions and diluted to same OD600 to minimize the sample variability in the beginning.
When handling our data, we should take into account that the LED rig runs on batteries. The depletion of the battery charge results in lower power supply, although this should be covered to some extent by the on-board voltage regulator. Tabor Lab points out that newly produced fluorescent proteins do not exhibit the fluorescence signature until maturation has completed (Olson et al., 2014, Supplementary Note 2). This means that the actual measured fluorescence does not represent the exact protein concentration. Their approach was to do a ""post treatment"" for the grown cultures to ensure protein maturation. We entirely ignored this fact, mainly due to time restrictions and to the possible mis-exposure that could occur during such treatment.
In contrast to the previous research, our system attempts to regulate multiple targets with only one wavelength of light.The regulatory effect of this light depends on its intensity. In the paper by Tabor et al. (2011) they say: ""The development of multichromatic gene regulatory systems, where different light wavelengths regulate the expression of different genes, will allow more advanced control of synthetic and natural gene regulatory networks."" Whereas we completely agree with this, we also claim if we're able to use single wavelengths more efficiently, we could achieve even greater level of control of the synthetic gene regulatory networks.
In Search of the Perfect Light Sensing System
First of all, to be able to control gene expression with light, we needed a light receptor protein. It would react to a certain wavelength of light and mediate the signal to the DNA level and initiate the response. We found different alternatives in the iGEM Registry but most of them were not properly characterized. We could not find reliable experiences of the"

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium.

Figure 1 indicates that the respondents can accept either genetically modified foods or non-genetically modified foods. “Non- genetically modified” was 59%, “genetically modified” was 3%, and “do not care” was 38%. These results suggest that more than half of Japanese consumers tend to choose “non- genetically modified” foods.
Figure 2 shows that respondents who answered “non- genetically modified” in Question2 chose the same answer regardless of the price, meaning that they would buy “non- genetically modified” foods if those were more expensive than “genetically modified” foods. More than half of respondents (51%) answered ""yes"", and 47% said ""yes and no"", and 2% said ""no"". This result suggest that approximately half of consumers would not to buy genetically modified foods regardless of the price. We also concluded that approximately 30% of Japanese consumers absolutely reject genetically modified foods at present.
Figure 3 shows the impression of consumers on the words “genetically modifying”. As the result, 14% of respondents answered ""positive"", 48% ""it does not matter"", and 38% ""negative"", suggesting that more than one-third Japanese have a negative impression on the words “genetically modifying”.
We asked the reason of “negative impression” from six choices: ""1. many unknown parts are remained.”, “2. availability is not clear”, “3. effect on health is not clear.”, “4. its dangerousness has been reported by mass media”, “5. no reason”, “6. others.” Figure 4 demonstrates that reasons 1 and 3 account for the majority (about 80 %). It was considered that most Japanese distrust genetic engineering because of lack of correct information.
Through the survey, we are sure that it must be quite effective to announce the correct information about the genetic engineering for Japanese consumers in order to improve their negative imporession on it.

Newcastle,2018,Team:Newcastle#Results#Operon_-_-_TEXT.html,"7014 . The entire operon was synthesised in four separate parts referred to as gBlocks that were subsequently used for Gibson assembly, as this was how TU Darmstadt assembled their operon successfully. Moreover this assembly does not leave restriction site scars due to the overlapping fragments. Instead of using Pseudomonas sp. it was deemed logical to use E. coli DH5α during the cloning experiments as we had a greater understanding of its transformation ability. Using this as a proof of concept would allow us to carry out a preliminary screening for naringenin production before attempting to transform our endophyte.
Alongside this, in an attempt to optimise naringenin production, a new design of the naringenin operon was made in Benchling. This was guided by the pathway modelling results and was constructed to show how  BG28 and BG51 dual E. coli-Pseudomonas promoters with a 10-fold difference in strength could increase naringenin production (1).
Results
Operon and Plasmid Design
Plasmid Design
The initial plasmid design for naringenin biosynthesis was based on TU Darmstadt’s design but with a codon optimised  tyrosine ammonia lyase. We used pSB1C3 as a backbone, into which we would clone  each of the four necessary genes downstream  of  a strong RBS (BBa_B0034). This construct  was  under the control of a  strong  Anderson  promoter (J23100) to  allow for constitutive expression of the operon (Figure 2 and Figure 4). Once biosynthesis under the control of J23100 is achieved,  future experiments will test this under the strong inducible T7 promoter in  E. coli (Figure 3 and Figure 5). Parts for biosynthesis in root-colonising  Pseudomona  sp.,  will  be implemented into a plasmid backbone more suitable for its uptake.

Interview With Glow Diagnostics
GlowDx are a biotech startup that participated in the IndieBio EU accelerator in Cork this summer. They aim to deliver new diagnostic platforms to the developing world with their main target being tropical diseases like dengue.
Blaine Doyle (CEO), Aisling Finn (CSO), Yensi Flores (CMO)
Over the summer, we got to know the founders of GlowDx, Blaine Doyle, Yensi Flores and Aisling Finn as the IndieBio labs are based only minutes away from us. We were quite lucky to build such a fantastic relationship with a diagnostic company as they gave us a lot of insight into building Basehunter in a realistic and user-friendly way.
Shama and TImothy got a chance to interview CEO, Blaine Doyle and find out more about GlowDx and their thoughts on Basehunter.
How would you describe GlowDx? What is the goal of GlowDx?
GlowDx is a diagnostics company that employs novel molecular biology to provide developing countries with high quality diagnostic tests; focusing on neglected tropical diseases. We are creating a DNA-computer in a test-tube; which can diagnose human disease. Molecular logic gates allow us to provide increased sensitivity & specificity while reducing costs. Meaning our “appropriate technology” is accessible to those who need it most.
What motivated you and your fellow co-founders to start working on GlowDx?
It started out when Yensi, Aisling and I were sitting down and talking about infectious disease in developing countries like Honduras where Yensi is from. Dengue has affected Yensi personal life as well as her professional life.
Yensi got Dengue when she was 8 years of age and she also nearly lost her dad who was travelling between Honduras and Geneva at the time. He had been infected with Dengue earlier that week, recovered and decided it was safe to travel. It turned out that it wasn't and during the flight experienced a hemorrhagic fever and the airport had an ambulance waiting for him in Geneva. That was a horrible experience for him.

RBS Composite Parts
The BioBricks we submitted to the Registry were composite parts composed of a constitutive pTet promoter part BBa_R0040; individual RBSs designed for use in our minimal nif plasmids; mRFP part BBa_E1010; and two terminators, parts BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012. They were derived from the BBa_I13521 plasmid. We replaced the RBS BBa_B0034 on that plasmid using PCR primers attached to our desired RBSs.
After constructing our plasmids, we ran PCR of the regions on the plasmids that were to be sequenced and obtained the proper lengths (approximately 1200 base pairs). We then sequenced-verified the regions on our plasmids. Finally, we ran a fluorescence experiment in which we examined the relative amount of mRFP fluorescence with our artificial RBSs as compared to the original RBS present in part BBa_I13521. Our RBSs did not express the mRFP as highly as the original RBS, which was expected. The data we obtained fit our translation initiation rate predictions fairly well. We obtained an R²-value of .9061.
Promoter Characterization
The 2015 WashU iGEM conducted a series of induction experiments to determine the validity of part K314100. The results obtained suggest that the part isn’t subject to inducer concentrations. The part either fluoresced at a constant, high level or didn’t fluoresce at all when tested.
The team transformed the part into DH10B twice. The colonies of the first transformation looked like this:
The cells largely appeared red. The WashU iGEM team then conducted an induction experiment to test how the cells fluoresced at different concentrations of aTc. The team pipetted cell culture into different aTc concentrations serially diluted across 8 wells. Results from this induction experiment are shown below.
While the part had a 1.3x increase between the lowest and highest inducer concentrations, the fluorescence increase was not uniform across all concentrations; fluorescence decreased at certain concentrations when it should’ve been increased.
The team proceeded with a second transformation to test the part even further. Colonies from that transformation are shown below.
Cells were largely colorless, with few red colored colonies to be found. Using the same procedure from the first experiment, the team ran a second induction experiment on these colonies to observe whether red fluorescence"

Reporter genes
Image source : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reporter_gene.png
Reporter genes are used as a toolbox in molecular biology to do gene expression, promoter or transformation/transfection assays. A reporter gene, to be introduced into an organism, is placed with the gene of interest in the same DNA construct. A good reporter confers easily identifiable characteristics as selectable markers.
Our interest was to perform promoter’s assays to visualize where our promoters allow the gene expression in the tadpoles with fluorescent proteins.
From : Proeteines-fluo.pdf
For our experiments, we used several fluorescent proteins (FPs) such mCitrine, CFP (cyan fluorescent protein), mCherry and sfGFP (superfolded green fluorescent protein) which are showed in the picture.

FPs derived from Aequorea victoria GFP
sfGFP, CFP and Citrine are 3 FPs derived from the jellyfish Aequovera victoria GFP. This GFP is composed of 238 amino acid residues. The picture presents the formation of the Aequorea victoria GFP chromophore. The chromophore of GFP consists of S65, Y66, and G67. [Donal S. Anson, Reporter genes, A practical guide, Methods in molecular biology 411]
Image source : Donal S. Anson, Reporter genes, A practical guide, Methods in molecular biology 411
Because green fluorescent protein (GFP) from Aequorea jellyfish is inefficiently folded when expressed, superfolding derivative of GFP have been created. Expression of sfGFP is accompanied by a two-fold increase in cellular fluorescence.

Yale,2015,Team:Yale#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," as it is a small community with members who come from various backgrounds. The results of the survey show a large distribution in how members perceived their work environment. While the number of respondents (n = 13) is not enough for the data analysis to be significant, the responses still point to a general desire to improve the iGEM community in terms of its treatment of LGBTQ members.
The questions asked where the following:
1. I consider my sexual orientation or gender identity to be an important aspect of who I am.
2. I would prefer to be open about my sexual orientation or gender identity to my team.
3. I have felt uncomfortable disclosing my sexual orientation or gender identity to members of my team.
4. I feel like my team is supportive and welcoming to LGBTQ+ members.
5. iGEM provides a safe environment for LGBTQ+ identified participants.
6. iGEM adequately addresses the needs of LGBTQ+ identified participants.
7. iGEM can improve its dialogue on marginalized identities, including race, gender, sexuality and socioeconomic status.
In a recent New York Times article titled “Why Is Science So Straight?” Manil Suri points to some cultural standards which lead people in STEM to avoid or ignore issues concerning LGBTQ and other identities.
He writes: “L.G.B.T. workers in STEM-related fields report significantly lower job satisfaction, both when compared to other STEM workers and to L.G.B.T. workers in other fields. Such discontent — and invisibility — can contribute to a field’s reputation for being unwelcoming. As a result, young lesbians and gays might sell themselves short, aiming for occupations with little use for their talents, but in which they see more people like themselves.”
The results of the survey support his statement. From the graph, more than 50% of respondents feel their sexual orientation is an important part of their identity, and likewise more than half of respondents also want iGEM to improve its discussion on how identity impacts one’s scientific career.
When asked what would foster a more accepting community, one respondent answered, “General community support is one of the best things to foster inclusion (but maybe is the hardest to achieve)…For iGEM specifically, I think talking about these issues and bringing it out in the open will help make a supportive environment overall and at the Jamboree.”

Tech moral scenario 1:
Chris is a 23-year-old student from Munich. She enjoys the lovely, warm Saturday afternoon riding her motorbike through the wonderful landscape of the Bavarian Alps. Following the curves around the mountains, she is fascinated by the great view of snow-covered mountains and turquoise lakes. She pulls the brake a little for the next curve…

Media:T--LMU-TUM Munich--MUC16 IntensiveCare.jpg
...to anyone
“Peep-peep-peep-peep”
What an awful sound. Chris feels terrible pain all over her body. She opens her eyes and is blinded by the white bed and the bright wall paint. After her eyes gradually adjust to the brightness, she recognizes that she is in a hospital. Suddenly, she feels a soft, warm touch on her right hand and the trembling voice of her mother:
“Oh darling, I’m so happy that you’re finally awake.” Chris tries to answer but she can only mumble something incomprehensible.
“Don’t worry,” her dad, sitting on the other side of the bed, replies, “you will soon get well again. “A car hit you when you were out on your bike.”
Her mother interrupts him: “Luckily the following car saw you lying at the side of the road and called the ambulance.”
“I don’t know how many of your bones are broken. But the worst thing is that your kidney is irreparably damaged,” Chris’ father discloses the terrible news.
Immediately, Chris has a horror scenario in her head. Her, sitting in the hospital every second day for dialysis while waiting for a suitable donor organ and taking medication for the rest of her life.
Again, she hears the calm voice of her father, “Modern medicine is unbelievable. After the emergency operation, the doctor came in and took a DNA sample. First"

Week 2: May 12th - May 16th
This week we focused more on getting familiar with Arduino Uno microcontroller.  One of our team members wrote several programs for Arduino to make the light blink in different patterns. In order to program the microcontroller, a programming language very similar to C++ is used; all of the members of the modelling team have C++ knowledge. We also found out that if we have to measure the input current, we would not need a sensor as analog in on the Arduino Uno can measure the input voltage so we would be able to calculate the current. We also looked at the prices for different sensors and where we can buy them, most of the sensors can be purchased for under 5-7 dollars (solarbotics) . The Arduino Uno microcontroller costs 35 dollars (solarbotics) . We also checked resources left by last year’s engineering and modelling team and found resistors, capacitors, op-amps, instruments and additional resourceful items that we can use this year as well.  We did an inventory of these items, so when we are coding and creating circuits we are aware of what components are available.  Part of our mission is to produce an economically feasible and low cost device for developing countries, and therefore we plan on researching how to adjust our design to reduce cost in the following weeks.  It is important to consider the economics of the device if it is to be considered for practical use in multiple areas of the world, not all of which have access to the same resources.  As a team we determined that we want to have the end goal of potentially producing a working prototype.  Although this is an ambitious goal, planning and research on how this is possible will help us achieve this.
Week 3: May 19th -May 23rd
This week we started looking into what kind of software we can use to visually model our biological system and genetic circuit. We decided to use Autodesk Maya to model the processes that are occurring within the device. We have access to Autodesk software and connections with knowledgeable advisors who would be able to help us we have any issues that arise. There are also plugins for Maya that can be used for modelling biological parts such as proteins or enzymes. This week we also continued exploring and researching the Arduino Uno's"

II. WHAT IS SB UTP 1.0?
The UTP-Panama team developed a plan for introducing of the concepts of synthetic biology to the people who are not acquainted with the field of synthetic biology to the theoretical foundations, applications, and finally the social implications of this science. The program also introduces the iGEM competition. The great contribution of the program is to introduce  users to the recommendations and ethical principles discussed in the PCSBI (Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues), Human Practice Trust, and other reports as a reference to the ethical, legal and social issues.

Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

UCSD_Software,2014,Team:UCSD Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," code for simulation is written in ’demo python.py’ which contains calculating function for growing curve, integrating function for ODE and a plotting part. Here we use an instance for illustration how to use this software.
First, there is a default growing curve provided by demo. The initial cell density(OD) is 0.2 while growing rate is
0.3 per 6 mins. You can change the maximum value of density by change the parameter k1 in the function grow. Second, function ’Calculate’ is an integral function that calculating the output value while reading the network from network ﬁle from top to bottom and then loop this process until the end of simulation time. In this case, the demo network is invested by David L. Shis and Matthew R. Bennett.6
Final, ’Calculate’ will return a matrix of time scalar, optical density and output to our plotting script.
Demonstration
It is reasonable to assume that our host is incubated in ideal environment that the curve of optical density (OD) perfectly matches the ’S’ shape model. In other word, the growing curve is integrated by logistic model
where kgrow is producing rate of cells and kmax is maximun value of density of cells, i.e. 1=(ODmax).
The AND gate with two devices achieved by Shis, David L., and Matthew R. Bennett6 has been modeled for two separated parts that each one could be recalled as an individual function to represent the corresponding device. The ODEs for these 2 devices are demonstrated below.
When pTara is induced by arabinose, this circuit produces LacI then stimulates its downstream device pET28. As result, the output of pTara is consumable inducer for circuit pET28. Therefore, we have 2 equations for pTara, which are
and
where OD is optical density and x1 is the input of device pTara, i.e., arabinose. Meanwhile, y is the output of device p- Tara and input of device pTara. The ﬁrst equation represents the consumption of inducer that will give us an exponatial decay of the value of its input. The second equation is modeled for the output of pTara. The positive term corresponds to the producing rate of LacI whereas the negative term is of consuming rate.
As principle employed on modeling pTara, we also provide a differential equation for pET28 which is
where z is the output of device pET28, i.e., the value of GFP. Again the positive term is the producing rate"

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#testtest_-_-_TEXT.html," of the bacterial community in the body constantly releasing pathogen-killing enzymes.
Of course, altering the microbiome comes with its own set of hazards, and we hope to mitigate it at least in part by doubling up the pathogen-killing mechanism as a population control mechanism for the engineered bacteria as well:
How our 3-part engineered microbe works:
1. Constant secretion of biofilm-degrading enzyme
2. Production and accumulation of antibacterial Art-175
3. Detection of pathogenic bacteria via quorum sensing
4. Permeabilization of inner membrane by T4 Holin
5. Access and lysis of host cell wall by Art-175
6. Release of Art-175 and lysis of target cell
Art-175 is normally prevented from reaching the cell wall of the expression host by the inner membrane. When a large amount of pathogenic bacteria is present, the quorum sensing signals trigger the production of T4 Holin, which permeabilizes the inner membrane, allowing Art-175 to reach the cell wall and degrade it. This causes lysis of the host cell and releases the accumulated Art-175 in a single high-concentration pulse, killing the pathogenic bacteria and achieving population control of the expression host at the same time.
Results
Through our experimental work we were able to obtain preliminary evidence suggesting the validity of these points:
DsbA-DNase and DsbA-DspB can be secreted in a fully folded and functional state
Both DNase and DspB are able to degrade biofilms
Art-175 is able to exert cell lytic activity on planktonic E. coli and P. putida
Art-175 is able to kill a portion of biofilm-encased P. putida cells

Meeting of Young Minds
The establishment of Rathenau Institute was to promote the formation of political and public opinion on science and technology. This has lead the Institute to study the organization and development of science systems, publish about social impact of new technologies, and organize debates on issues and dilemmas in science and technology.
To stimulate interaction between youth departments of political parties (PYO) and the iGEM participants, Rathenau Institute and the European iGEM committee are organizing a Meeting of Young Minds (MYM) between PYOs and the participants of iGEM 2011. The aim of this Meeting is to introduce the general public to synthetic biology and its possible implications for society. Due to the pace of developments in this field, now is the time to start informing political organizations and the public about synthetic biology.
As one of the Dutch iGEM teams, we participated in this event. The entire organization was spread over several meetings:
Kick-off meeting MYM
The kick-off Meeting took place on the 30th of September in the NEMO museum. During this meeting, members of Dutch iGEM teams and PYOs were challenged in a debate on synthetic biology and the political, societal and ethical issues this rapidly developing techno science might raise. Before the debate started off, an introductory on synthetic biology and iGEM was offered by the Rathenau Institute and previous iGEM members of TU Delft. Thaks to this presentation members of the PYOs and iGEM had enough knowledge to proceed with the discussion.
Jump-start event MYM
On September first 2011, the iGEM team of TU Delft together with the Rathenau Institute organized the follow-up of the Kick-off Meeting of Young Minds: Jump-start Event Meeting of Young Minds. The aim of this Jump-start was to deepen the discussion of the political, societal and ethical issues of SynBio. During this event, the iGEM teams of TU Delft, Wageningen and Amsterdam gave  a presentation about their"

Actually, most of the scripts are cited from a newly published paper on Cell : Defining Network Topologies that Can Achieve Biochemical Adaptation . It 's quite by accident that issues discussed in this paper share some similarities with our project. To test our ABCD is powerful or not, the only thing we need to do is to search the two topologies found in this paper. By running nearly two days, we prove the solution.
Mathematical Formulation
We assume that each node (labeled as <math>A</math>, <math>B</math>, <math>C</math>) has a fixed concentration (normalized to <math>1</math>) but has two forms: active and inactive (here <math>A</math> represents the concentration of active state, and <math>1-A</math> is the concentration of the inactive state). The enzymatic regulation converts its target node between the two forms. For example, a positive regulation of node <math>B</math> by node <math>A</math> as denoted by a link
<math>A\longrightarrow B</math>
would mean that the active <math>A</math> convertsBfrom its inactive to its active form and would be modeled by the rate
<math>R(B_{inactive}\longrightarrow B_{active})=k_{AB}A(1-B)/\left[ (1-B)+K_{AB}\right] </math>,
where <math>A</math> is the normalized concentration of the active form of node <math>A</math> and <math>1-B</math> the normalized concentrations of the inactive form of node B. Likewise, <math>A-|B</math> implies that the active A catalyzes the reverse transition of node B from its active to its inactive form, with a rate
<math>R(B_{active}\longrightarrow B_{inactive})=k_{AB}^{^{\prime }}/(B+K_{AB}^{^{\prime }}).</math>
When there are multiple regulations of the same sign on a node, the effect is additive. For example, if node C is positively regulated by node A and node B,
<math> R(C_{inactive}\longrightarrow C_{active})= k_{AC}A(1-C)/\left[ (1-C)+K_{AC}\right]</math> + <math>k_{BC}B(1-C)/\left[ (1-C)+K_{BC}\right] </math> .

Do you think there’s a limit in how far we should go with synthetic biology?
""Well yeah, I think there’s a point that we shouldn’t cross, but it’s hard to define because it’s such a broad term. You can use it for literally anything in our world, anything can be in that scope. So I think as long as it’s something that doesn’t impact our society or our environment, not necessarily just the environment in the sense like the ozone layer, I mean environment like our surroundings; as long as it doesn’t alter that. I think it’s a slippery slope because we’re doing these things to essentially make things more convenient and easier for us to do tasks. That’s what it boils down to. So by doing that, I think eventually there will come a point where it will kind of bite us in the butt a bit. And so I think by keeping that to a minimum, how much it affects everything around us, it’ll be optimal. But it’s hard to define that point so I can’t say for sure.""

How do you feel about humans purposely modifying organisms or species so that they will be more useful to us?
""I’m sure that there are benefits that do go along with that type of research, but I am a firm believer in the earth is where it is for a reason and we are where we are for a reason and life has evolved over millions of years without us having to make it better. We’ve made a lot of mistakes along the way so I don’t know if I trust research and peoples’ judgment. (I explained to her that domesticating animals is a way we’ve done this in the past, to which she responded…) I think all that would’ve naturally fallen into place anyways. Dogs really do love humans and they need to connect with a pack. Horses, if they really didn’t want to be trained, I don’t know if you could train them. Whereas, I believe they feel good when they’re serving a purpose as well. So I think those connections would’ve happened automatically. I don’t know if we can take complete credit for those modifications. I guess what I’m thinking is more that horses were the size of a dog and they evolved into the size they are today. I don’t know. I’m all for research certainly, but there’s also the question how far will it go"

ComR/ComS Approach
BactaSun
Overview
Still with the aim of creating a rapid UV-response system, we elaborated a second approach based on a regulation pathway, the ComR and ComS system, originally found in Streptococcus thermophilius. Our goal is to produce a UV inducible promoter.
ComR and ComS mechanism
The ComR and ComS system controls natural competence and allows quorum sensing in S. thermophilius.  In molecular biology, natural competence is a genetically specified ability of a bacteria to integrate “naked” extracellular DNA from its environment under natural conditions (no pre-treated cells). This specific feature observed by some bacteria is an interesting and convenient tool in bioengineering because it allows to modify the host genome without needing to perform any transformation.
The quorum sensing (QS) is a set of regulatory mechanisms of synchronization of the expression of particular genes within a bacterial population and according to its local density. ComS is a small peptide encoded in the genome. After synthesis, it is matured and extruded from the cell into the medium. The peptide’s import allows other cells to sense the signal. When a threshold level is reached it will trigger the competent state in the whole population.  Indeed, once reimported in the cell ComS will be able to bind the ComR protein. This will allow the formation of a ternary complex (peptide-protein-DNA) with a specific DNA motif (ComR-box) and trigger the downstream gene’s expression (See schema here below).
Our little trick
ComS mature sequence is LPYFAGCL. An aromatic substitution by an alanine would block the binding to ComR. Hence our objective is to synthetize this peptide while replacing the tyrosine by an ortho-nitrobenzyl tyrosine (ONB-Tyr). This should indeed prevent the binding unless there is some UV exposure and the ONB, or photocage, is released.

We implemented our new found knowledge on the high oxygen dependency of V. natriegens from our collaboration in Berlin to increase general cell density in our test samples with newly constructed plasmids back at home. Thereby, we could obtain more genetic material in a shorter time to enabling us to speed up distribution and characterization of our Marburg collection.
Aside from this small perk for everyday labwork, we gained know-how that in addition to our results in metabolic engineering group will lead to further steps towards the real-world applicability of V. natriegens in the industry.
Industry - Industrial application for Vibrigens
To expand on our knowledge from our collaboration with the TU Berlin we got into contact with Senior Fermentation Expert, Prof Dr. Oskar Zelder, from BASF to answer the question: What expectation a new organism has to fulfill to become a suitable industrial chassis.
We discussed in length how diverse the demands and challenges for such an organism can be and need to be highly specialized for the task at hand. There a major differences rather one is aiming for a small molecule production, like our 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HPA) platform chemical, or if the main purpose is protein expression and secretion. He informed us that there is no such thing as “all size fits all”.
Figure 1: Online Meeting with Prof. Dr. Oscar Zelder
We got invited to discuss our Vibrigens project with this BASF fermantation expert.
However, target-specific discussion for
3-HPA
led to general design question concerning bioreactor set-up since not only the production of a target molecule need to be considered but also its isolation and purification. In the case of an acidic molecule like
3-HPA
an acidic medium and in consequence a bacterium which is resistant against low pH-levels would be most suitable. This would unlock distillation as a cheap and efficient purification method.
More immediate for our project, however, is the following aspect:
In industrial biotechnology, everything is a little bigger. Fermenter can easily have a volume of over ten cubic meters. This is much bigger than the maximal volume that can be realized with glass, so stainless steel has become the most common material choice. Stainless steel is much more resistant to corrosion than ordinary steel, but it is not impervious. Chloride ions, for instance, can expedite deterioration. Our favorite microorganism, V. natriegens requires an almost three-fold"

Results
We gained a lot from this meeting.         First of all, they pointed out that our project was not safe to other insects except cockroaches. Although the spores would not do harm to human, our spores could also infect beneficial insects or some insect pets. Therefore, we need to come out a better solution to kill cockroaches but not to infect other insects. Thanks to them, we finally found a great way to just kill the cockroaches and the spores would die if they spread away from our system in the late July.
It was a great meeting that we could not only improve our project in time, but also make more friends that show great interest in synthetic biology the same as us. There were still many problems of our meeting this year, for example, the activities we arranged were so few that some of the attendees may get bored of it. We did an introspection and received their opinions after the meeting, and we are hoping that the meeting held next year would be more attractive and more teams would like to join us.
CCiC
On August 27, 2018, the iGEM team of Shenzhen University came to Shanghai University of Science and Technology in Shanghai to participate in the 5th CCIC Conference (The Fifth Conference of China IGEMER Community).We learn that we need to put more attention on our safey part and we also share our app to the other school.
CCIC is currently the largest regional iGEMer exchange activity in the world. It is a non-profit academic exchange meeting initiated by iGEM students in China. It aims to build a platform for mutual learning and learning for the iGEM students in the Chinese competition area. In the past few sessions, the iGEM team of Shenzhen University has gained a lot of experience and cooperation opportunities from CCIC. This year our team also benefited a lot from CCIC meetings.
The CCIC meeting ended on the 31st. The fifth CCIC just came to a close at the Shanghai University of Science and Technology. The CCIC Executive Committee said to Jamboree to all the teachers and students. I wish you all the best and enjoy an unforgettable iGEM. The end of CCIC indicates that this year's iGEM competition has entered the temporary time. Our team still needs a lot of content to improve and perfect. I hope that when you see Jamboree in October, you can show the world the perfect project of your team!

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#build#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," and passage of fumaric acid from the rumen, which are in vivo factors that do not occur in vitro. In vivo, cattle were fed about twice the amount of fumaric acid (20 g/kg DMI) to cattle as that used in the more recent study (12 g/kg DMI) and, surprisingly, methane production decreased by 23%. However, in that study, only two animals per treatment were used, and methane measurements were made using ventilated hoods, which are known to be problematic. Also note there were differences between basal diets in the studies. This influences the microbiomes and may affect the outcome of the study. The figure below shows the theoretical framework made by iGEM UNL, that demonstrates the diversion of hydrogen away from the methanogens and to the process of fumarate production which in turn produces succinate and propionate. It is known that the higher the propionate to acetate ratio, the less methane the cow produces (Mcginn et al. , 2004).
Figure 3. The theoretical framework of  the effect of fumarate on methane synthesis in the ruminants. The synthesis of succinate out of fumarate competes for H 2 with the synthesis of methane. With a reduced concentration of substrate H 2 for methane synthesis reaction, less methane will be formed. (Adapted from Morgavi et al. (2010))
Strategies to overcome the problem of anaerobic production
Another way to get fumarate into in the microbiome of cattle would be to have bacteria produce fumarate in a bioreactor, and then dry and directly mix them with cattle feed. This way, there is no need to extract fumarate from the cell mixture and we also overcome the problem of anaerobic production. We could try to test different types of microorganisms and see which would be the most efficient and cost-effective at producing fumarate. Once the cells have produced enough fumarate, we, dry them and feed them to the cattle. We could compare the proposed E. Coli mutants, that produce fumaric acid and cyanobacterial cells from iGEM team Amsterdam that produce fumarate and see which one is more efficient at producing and delivering fumarate. As we aim to reduce greenhouse gasses in both our projects, we think it would be sensible to define the most efficient producer as the one that is the most carbon efficient. As calculated by team Amsterdam, this will most likely be the Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria convert CO 2 directly into fumarate,"

The picture in the middle was taken with light red in front of the camera and dark yellow green in front of the flash. The bottom photo was taken with the optimal filter combination twickenham green in front of the flash and light red in front of the camera.
As you can see in the pictures above it is really important to choose the right filters to get a high fluorescence signal and a low background signal. But is it only possible to photograph sfGFP and GFP? To find out, we took photos of the  monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) lysate as well. We tested the combination of 4 different filters for extinction with 8 filters for emission. All in all we tested 32 filter combinations to find the optimal filter combination. After this we analyzed again the fluorescence of the different reaction tubes in the pictures with the image processing software Fiji. The best filter combination for imaging mRFP with a smartphone are Twickenham green (736) in front of the flash and light red (182) in front of the camera.

Due to the problems with LB medium we considered the possibility of measuring the amount of silicic acid in polysilicate by hydrolysing it with NaOH ( Müller et al., 2003 ) ( Cha et al., 1999 ).
To do so we made a calibration curve of silicic acid diluted in NaOH and another diluted in equal concentrations of NaOH and HCl in to neutralize the pH in case it might suppose a problem. Both of them yielded successful results.
Since the silicic acid test worked in both calibration curves we decided that we would be using NaOH to hydrolyse the polysilicate layer in silicatein expressing cells to test silicatein kinetics. Thus, we prepared overnight cultures to do the test the following day.

Methods
At first, the RNAT A1 was constructed under the control of constitutive promoter J23119. The first 25 bp of RNAT A1 forming the secondary structure with the SD sequence (AAGAG) was deleted for positive control. In order to optimize the performance of RNAT A1, constructing a mutation library is the first choice. Yet, the sequence of RNAT A1 is only 42bp, it is difficult to mutate such a short sequence and construct it onto plasmid through error prone PCR. To combat this problem, instead, degenerative PCR, which using degenerative primers to amplify DNA, was employed for the plasmid construction. Degenerative primers are mixture of oligonucleotide sequences in which some positions contain any type of nucleotides (ATGC), giving a population of primers with similar sequences that cover all possible nucleotide combinations at certain sequence (Iserte 2013).
Table 1. The abbreviations for degenerate bases
Two strategies were recruited when design the degenerative primers. The first is to mutate the anti-SD sequence (CTCTT) to lower the energy of the hairpin structure, and the second is to change the poly A sequence of the RNAT, which may form complex structures to interfere with the SD, anti-SD structure in long distance. (Table 2.) The second strategy may also increase the robust of the RNAT, which may result in a RNAT structure that is suitable to a wide range of proteins.
To construct the mutant RNAT, the J23119A1MRFP in pEt28a plasmid was first built. Then, the whole J23119 RFP sequence was amplified using degenerative primers. The amplified sequence was recombined with the PCR linearized plasmid using Gibson assembly. The recombined plasmid was then transformed into Top 10 competent cell.
To find out the best performed colonies, 288 colonies were picked out from the library constructed by degenerative primer 1 and 2. The colonies were inoculated in 96 well plate and shake at 37 鈩?and 30 鈩?for 18 h. The fluorescence of MRFP (excitation: 580, emission: 607) were tested triplicate. However,"

Results and Discussion:
While many assumptions were made, the graphs would serve as an approximation of the trend of fluorescence level over time. The mRNA molecules, produced by transcription of the DNA, would lead to the production of GFP. The mRNA molecules and GFP would also decay at the same time while the cell growth due to division would also decrease their concentration. An equilibrium of production and decay could then be reached. While the mRNA form hairpins and bind with vitamin B9/B12, the production rate of GFP would be reduced (Beisel and Smolke, 2009), shifting the equilibrium and lowering the concentration of GFP. The different intervals served to model the different phases of cell growth. In each phase the production rate of mRNA and GFP, the growth rate, and the rate of decay of several items should all differ in various degrees due to changes in the cell and the environment, causing the fluorescence to change in different phases. This model captured parts of these differences.

Several constants for specific riboswitches can only be found experimentally but the number of experiments conducted was very limited, so only one set of graphs for each of the vitamin B9 and B12 riboswitches were made.
The model predicts that the fluorescence would fall in the second interval (after the cells were transferred into the M9 minimal media, growth phase: lag1). The fluorescence would then experience a continuous increase in the subsequent interval"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#Synergy_-_-_TEXT.html," our transposon directly in our electrochemical reporter system without actually knowing the identity of the sensory element.  Although we do plan to BioBrick this in the future, for now, we grew up cultures of our transposon and tested the ability of our FRED system to sense toxins.  We didn't just want to sense toxins however, we wanted to be able to sense toxins in tailings ponds.  To do this,  we grew up our transposon clone in media, aspirated the media and then placed it in tailings pond water samples.  Upon addition of our sugar-reporter conjugate, CPRG, we monitored the formation of CPR electrochemically, which would be indicative of LacZ production, indicating activity of our toxin sensory element.  The results of this assay can be shown below.
Figure 3. Current change over time illustrating lacZ induction by our identified transposon sensory element in a tailings pond water sample.  The blue curve represents the tailings water test while the red curves shows the basal expression of the sensory element without tailings pond water present.  This shows that our transposon clone has the ability to sense something within tailings pond water samples.
This result was extremely exciting for us, as we see clear induction of the system in the presence of tailings, as compared to the control.  Although we don't know exactly what we are sensing, (remember that our transposon is sensitive to 3 different toxins: DBT, Carbazole and NAs),we are definitely sensing something! This shows that FRED is functional and more than that, FRED is functional in the application for which he was designed! The next step will be to quantify toxins present in tailings pond water samples in order to calibrate our reporter.
Taking FRED out to the field!
Once we knew that we had a promoter/reporter system that could actually detect toxins found in tailings ponds within the laboratory, the next challenge was to detect tailings pond toxins with our FRED prototype on site.  Unfortunately, there are very strict regulations surrounding tailings ponds, and the publication of information pertaining to their contents.  As such, obtaining permissions for a tailing pond field test was not possible within the time frame of our project.  Because we did want to perform a kind of field test with FRED to show that the prototype that we built is feasible and easy to use, we investigated whether it would be permissable or advisable to try FRED outside of the lab.  We performed a literature search to look for any regulations that might exist."

CIEI-BJ,2017,Team:CIEI-BJ#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," The staff showed us the specimens of various kinds of mosquitoes and the mosquito capturing devices. From the conversation, we realized that the mainstream way of mosquito treatment is still toxic chemical or low dose of pesticides. The disadvantage is quite obvious: despite the mosquitoes could grow endurance through time, the chemicals would cause a devastation of the ecosystem while killing other species other than mosquito. Furthermore, the substances get metabolized in human body in most of the cases, especially for young children and the pregnant women, the harm of toxic like DEET could increase exponentially due to their special body condition. What’s more, there are several kinds of diseases spread by the mosquitoes, such as Malaria, Zika Virus and Yellow Fever. This experience gave us at a different horizon to look at our problem. Other than information that are directly related to our product, we learnt much about the side knowledge about mosquitoes. To prevent the fatal mosquito-borne diseases from people’s life and keep people healthy, it is really important to produce a kind of mosquito repellent which is toxic free and effective.
Concluding from the questionnaire and our field trip to CDC, we knew that it is critical for a successful mosquito repellents to be nontoxic and effective. After elaborated research, we decided to design a genetic circuit to produce citronellol, which has totally zero toxin and can repel mosquito effectively.
CGEM Summit
We, CIEI-BJ, together with our sister team CIEI-China, set up CGEM Summit and invited another iGEM teams (HFLS-H2Z-HangZhou,RDFZ-China, BIT-China), predecessors iGEMers from Qinghua university , and four professors to our forum, aiming to share our research.
In the beginning, the four iGEM team shared their own research one by one and elaborated their idea and experiments. Then our instructor Mrs. Wang expressed her congratulations and expectations to our new generation who are highly possible to make great contributions to synthetic biology in the future. After this, Professor Chengqi from HangZhou ZC Bio-Sci/Tech Co. LTD shared his own experience when doing research as a biosynthesis scientist. In addition, Professor Lichun from Beijing Institute of Technology made a speech explaining the great significance to study synthetic biology and use it to solve global problems like famine. Moreover, Yinjin, one of the founders of Bluepha, shared his own experience as an iGEM team member with us. At last, Professor Zhang Hongxiang from Chinese Society of Biotechnology provided us with some suggestions on research and made a speech at the closing ceremony.

Several wide range scans show that the behavior of metabolites concentrations is determined by the ratio k4.1/k-4.1 and not their specific values; the bigger this ratio the bigger the final dimer concentration, which turns into a greater repression of RcnA and nickel internalization; the time that takes the system to reach a new equilibrium after being perturbed by AHL also increases with this ratio.
We tested the effect of AHL on CI and its dimer. The graph shows that [AHL] only defines the strength of the response without affecting the equilibrium of the CI molecules.
A constant repression of rcnA would be toxic for bacteria, for this reason k4.1/k-4.1 cannot be too big. We chose the values k4.1=0.0001 molecules-1s-1 and k-4.1=0.01s-1 because of their similarity with other dimerization parameters ( reaction 2.1 ) and the fact that they show the desired behavior. However, it must be made clear that there is a wide range of values that would work for our purposes.
These values are comparable to others typical biochemical parameters. It has been shown that kinetic parameters can be modified by changing amino acid sequences (for example, CI half life is reduced by adding a LVA tail in the C-terminal), and it’s proposed that it’s possible to engineer the protein to reach an acceptable dissociation constant .
 
Nickel internalization and efflux
We performed several scans on the rates of nickel internalization and efflux to define the range of values that show the desired response.
Just like in the previous case, our results indicate that the behavior is determined by the the ratio k7/k9 and not to their specific values. The smaller the ratio greater the internal nickel concentration.
[Unk] is also an unknown parameter, but as we assume it constant through time it can be completely arbitrary, as long as the reaction rate k9 is well defined. For convenience we define [Unk] as one tenth of initial [RcnA] due the fact that in the real system we will have 10 more copies of rcnA than in wildtype cells.
We define k7=500 molecules-1s-1 which is a known1 extrusion rate, and k9=500 molecules-1s-1 which show the desired behavior. Nonetheless the"

October 4th.. time is passing way to fast!!!  We had a nice working weekend, we got things done in the lab and for the poster and presentation. The poster and presentation needs to be finished since we will be presenting it this saturday for the SDU team at our pre-Boston conference here at DTU.
What I found out this morning is that my group, the repressor group have some serious problems with verification PCRs of our transformations. Maybe we should get the other group to do the PCR for us, since they don’t have any problems in verifying their constructs..?? We are trying other alternatives now, such as biological assays.  And it actually seems that some of our ligations/transformations are working. Still need to redo a bunch, but I’m optimistic!

A bunch of the iGEM team met up today on a Sunday to do some lab work and work on our poster. It's been a while since I've been in the lab as I have been working on some of the more practical and non-wet lab side of iGEM. But you know what? It was fun to put on a lab coat again. We ran a gel of the PCR restrictions. Thomas and I then did some ligations. We then amplified our inserts using PCR. It was good with a refresher course in the lab! All in all it was a productive day!

Synthetic Biology Club
Last year was the first time for Zhejiang University to participate in iGEM competition. After coming back to school with our first Gold Medal, we decided to promote synthetic biology and attract more students fond of synthetic biology in school. Then we established the Synthetic Biology Club (SBC).
The Synthetic Biology Club aims to promote the development of synthetic biology in our school and encourage more students to have a basic understanding of iGEM as well as synthetic biology. We held several lectures for not only the club members but also students from different colleges. One of the ex-participant of ZJU-China 2010, WANG Shaohua, introduced synthetic biology and the aims of iGEM. In May, instructor of Peking_R, ZHANG Haoqian came to our university and had a close talk with new members of ZJU-China 2011. Furthermore, he held a lecture concerning the projects of Peking2010 and the significance of quantification of biology.
In winter vacation, we organized club members to form groups freely and to design one or more detailed projects of their interests concerning synthetic biology. In the beginning of March, each group gave a presentation to all other club members to introduce their project plan, and most importantly their original ideas. Most of the club members became more interested in synthetic biology and iGEM. Some of them even remarked that it's one of the best academic experiences they ever had in college.
Thanks for all the activities held by Synthetic Biology Club, iGEM and synthetic biology have attracted more and more attention in our campus. It's an amazement that so many students have expressed their wills to participate in iGEM2012.

NYMU-Taipei,2016,Team:NYMU-Taipei#pttest_-_-_TEXT.html,", there need to be sufficient safety considerations in place. Whereas for the physically contained options, ensuring that if the bacteria escape, they die is important, it is especially important to make sure that molecular containment is in place for the free-living delivery option.
We have created theoretical kill switches for each of the situations that our engineered bacteria might find themselves in, to allow us complete control over when they die. Since the kill switches are based on the lac operon, if there are any concerns about the action of the bacteria, we can kill the whole population immediately, by introducing IPTG through the catheter. Furthermore, the kill switch is also sensitive to other elements which could be present (AI2 for free-living bacteria, valine for bacteria in media) to allow extra degrees of control. The kill switch options were another aspect we surveyed the public on. The results were that they were happy to use them, provided their healthcare professional ensured that it was safe. For more details, check out our safety and questionnaire pages.
Outreach
In an attempt to improve the general public's understanding of Synthetic Biology, we used a variety of approaches. We thought we could help certain members of audience, who represent the 6% of pessimists we found in an earlier survey, to fully understand the concepts of genetic engineering, and realise the incredible gains that can be made from projects like ours in the field of synthetic biology.
We asked the public: Which of these do you think is the most common infection acquired in hospitals?
Most of the public (45.5%) thought that MRSA is the most commonly acquired infection in hospitals, showing that they think that antibiotic resistance is a problem. However, with UTIs coming in quite far behind this (19.5%), it seems that the public are not aware of the risk of getting UTIs in hospital due to urinary catheterisation. This could be due to the fact that UTIs are advertised less than MRSA, but since this is an important issue, we looked into educating the public through sessions with summer schools and school students, as well as getting in touch with local media, such as BBC Radio Oxford, and promoting our project across social media. We believe that this has helped raise awareness of problems associated with catheter-based infections, not only in the urinary tract, but also with infections in other catheterised parts of the body.
BBC Radio Oxford
We were invited to talk about antibiotic resistance on BBC Radio Oxford. We went on the Kat Orman's morning show, alongside Monty Python's Michael Palin, and spoke about the increasing threat that antibiotic resistance poses, and what we"
SEU_A,2012,Team:SEU A#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," The lag period is the transient process the bacteria adapt to the new environment after being inoculated to the medium. In this period, the curve is flat and stable because of slow bacterial multiplication. The number of viable bacteria will soar when it reaches the logarithmic period. The bacteria will grow at stable geometric series, and can last sustainably hours and days (depending on the conditions and bacterial generation). Moreover, bacteria’s form, dyeing and biological activity in this period are all very typical which is sensitive to environmental factors, so it’s the best period to research the bacterial traits. When it reaches the stable period, however, the total number of flora is in the flat stages due to the relative relationship of nutrition and the number of bacteria, but bacterial viability changes greatly. Finally, bacterial growth will get slower in the decline period, and the number of the dead bacteria will apparently increase. In addition, the number of viable cells and the incubation time are in inversely proportional relationship. Mastering the bacterial growth’s law, we can study the method of controlling the growth of pathogenic bacteria, discovering and developing bacteria useful to human.    1.2 Assumptions and simplifications 1. Imagine that plaque is dense, that is to say, it’s always a simply connected area in surface of the two-dimensional dish. 2. Imagine that the plane occupied by the plaque in the culture dish is proportional to the number of bacteria in it. 3. Under the experimental conditions, imagine that E. coli is the only food of Bdellovibrio, and nutrients of E. coli are provided by the medium sufficiently. 4. The occasional small amount of bacteria in the edge of dish is ignored, and dripping or splashing a small amount of bacteria into the location of the error place in the initial state is considered to have no impact on the normal experimental bacteria. 5. After appropriate image processing, the light and its changes’ effects to the photos are ignored. 6. As to the fuzzy edge of the plaque, the area is considered to be the largest and smooth edges simply connected region.    1.3 Assumptions 3.1 Photos’ preprocessing 1. Select photos artificially. Remove the ones whose light effects apparently different from most of the photos, as well as the ones which appear the situation that two plaque overlap and stick together and the overlapping area is large in the later observations, so as not to increase the difficulties of unified image processing. 2. Rename all the photos by unified format. The format is ‘experimental group + days + hours + minutes xxx’, ("

Meeting Doctor Chang,Hsing-Chih
The ultimate goal of BioWatcher is to apply this system on human to prevent late-stage cancers by early diagnosis. Therefore, we turned to Mr. Chung, a doctor who has PhD degree in molecular and cellular oncology in MD Anderson Cancer Center and currently works in Mackay Memorial Hospital for his experiences in clinical/cancer cases. What we discussed includes the potential and limitation of diagnostic biomarkers, the accuracy of diagnosis using biomarkers, and most importantly the design of BioWatcher.
1. What kind of cell is a suitable reporter cell candidate for modification?
ANS: Mesenchymal stem cells
A suitable candidate should possess properties listed:
1.Compatible with targeted human immune system
2.Can be easily modified
Prior to the meeting, white blood cell was on our list of choice. Yet, it was taken off list due to its inevitable interference with blood composition as the modified ones are introduced into humans’ circulating system. Dr. Chang suggested Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and Dendritic cells (DCs). Maturing of BioWatcher with time will give us more insight for the choice.
Known downside of MSCs-- its life span is not as long as we preferred—have us hesitate. However, regarding the immunoregulatory capacity of Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the fact that it has been widely used in many cell therapies, MSCs, in this case, become top choice for us. DCs are considered because of its antitumor immunity and the cases of Dendritic cell-based immunotherapy.
2. Mechanism for erasing all reporter cells in users is necessary.
Dr. Chang strongly recommended that"

Interview Record With Dr. Wang From PUMCH
Q: Is taxol a common medicine in cancer treatment?
A: The ratio of taxol is relatively high, generally. It has a wide range of application including treating cancer in head, esophageal, stomach, bone, prostate and pancreas. It can almost cover all kinds of cancer except intestinal cancer. However, this kind of treatment is a common chemical therapy, which may cause many side effects including nausea, hair loss, and low leukocyte level because taxol is a cell-cycle-specific medicine and it can also hurt other normally active cells besides cancer cells. Now we sometimes lean to use targeted drug to treat cancer and this therapy is more effective with less side effects.
Q: How is the application of traditional therapy and modern therapy? Will traditional therapy be replaced?
A: The development of a new drug needs a series of clinical experiments. Many united institutes are working on it. And after the results of experiments examined by each countries repeatedly, the new drug will be recorded into guideline and the old one would be set aside if the new drug has better function with less side effects. But for cancer in head and neck, the process of developing new drug is relatively slow, so its treatment is mainly traditional.
Q: What’s the superiority of taxol compared with former medicines?
A: There is no medicine always a better choice. For different cancer there are different treatment plans and different medicines. We need to choose appropriate medicines based on guideline, clinical statistics and experience in cancer cases. The most important matter in cancer treatment is curative effect, and then side effects. But as for side effects, we can take some measurement to reduce it. Of course, drugs which are effective with less effect is ideal.
Q: Is taxol therapy expensive?
A: The cost is continuously decreasing. Now there is competition between domestic and imported taxol and there is no intrinsic difference between these taxols. They worked both well. But imported taxol is much more expensive. Generally, for a course of treatment, it takes 3000 or so CNY using domestic"

USTC-Software
UTSC-Software has been one of our traditional collabrators. Focusing on the establishment and improvement of a online synthetic biology community this year, we, as potential users of their bio-hub, provided our opinions and needs in application design and homepage design. For example, we suggested adding an online forum named ""iGEMers' Notebook"" in which iGEMers can exchange important information and ideas concerning this competition. We also helped them with biological problems they came across, such as the biological background of comparative sequence analysis. UTSC-Software shared with us some useful tricks and their experience in website making and modeling, which helped speed up our work.
ShanghaiTech
Last year, team ShanghaiTech used CdS nanoparticles to utilize light energy. This year, coincidently, we also need to use CdS nanoparticles to generate electrons for photosynthesis. To have a positive control in our experiments, we use this CdS quantum dots to play the role of light catalyzer, proving that our concept can function as we expected. In addition, we also help them to make a further validation of the CdS quantum dots’s  function and improve the characterization of the CdS quantum dots. Link in ShanghaiTech University's Wiki
NPU-China
For team NPU-China this year, they have a complex metabolism pathway to realize their goal—— synthesize as much DHAP as possible. To optimize the system, they want to adjust the ratio of two enzymes they use for DHAP synthesis. But to find out the best ratio of these two enzymes’ expression and the proper promotor or RBS we need to use, we need to model this metabolism pathway. This is where our team USTC put our efforts into. We help them to model this complex pathway and valid their project’s feasibility.
The 5th iGEM Asia-Parcific Conference
This year has seen the third time Team USTC attending Asia-Parcific iGEM Conference held in National Chiao Tung University,Taiwan. The 5th iGEM Asia-Parcific conference lasted 4 days from July 31th,2016. More than 20 teams from Taiwan, mainland China, Japan and the United States got together to share our projects and culture. The conference included official presentations along with Q&A and a poster session, which not only serves as a drill for the coming jamboree, but also inspires us with new ideas and valuable advice we can make good use of.Taking an active part"

Today we had an awesome day!!!! We made digestion using XbaI and EcoRI on biobricks E0840 K346004 unmethylated from the Parts Kit 2014 with the following system:
The digestion lasted 2 hours at 37°C.  The amount of gel used for each sample was 10ul and 40 ul was kept in the fridge at -20°C  to be used for purification later.
Eletrophoretical profile of the digestions:
1. E0840 not digested
2. E0840 digested with XbaI and EcoRI
3. K346004 not digested
4. K346004 digested with XbaI and EcoRI
After we saw that the digestion worked, we ran the rest of the microliters from the digestion (40ul) in another gel just to get the Dna purified through the new  gel.
A picture of the cut gel from the electrophoresis used for purification:
We had lots of fun working on the purification with the help of prof. Spartaco!!!! =)
Afterwards, we ran the gel with the purified fragments to analyze the results:
1. E0840 linearized – digested with EcoRI and XbaI
2. K346004 linearized –  digested EcoRI and XbaI
Biobricks linearized!!!HURRAY!!! \0/
Today, we had great news: our laboratory is now ready for Mercury manipulation!!!!! A huge step for our institution, because it’s not just  the first laboratory for Synthetic Biology in Brazil, it’s also the first lab that allows manipulation of Mercury for the production of culture medium at the Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM)!
Such a bliss!!!!

We have designed a biobrick compatible version of the α1G gene, by removing the illegal restriction sites and lowering the GC content. However, the large size of this gene is not compatible with the standard registry vector, pSB1C3. Therefore, we were not able to provide a sample of this biobrick to the registry. However, it is possible to order this gene as several gBlock fragments, and assemble them by for example Gibson assembly.

Background Information about Interplanetary Transport
Financial Jaw-Droppers
A rough estimate of bringing a kilogram to low-Earth orbit is 10,000 dollars 1 . Estimated costs of a manned Mars mission ranges from 20 billion to 450 billion dollars, an uneasy sum to contemplate in the U.S.’s current economy. Why does it cost so much? For one, getting to Mars is no easy feat...
Going the Distance
It’s a long way to the top if you want to go to Mars…
Because Mars’ elliptical orbit is off-kilter to Earth’s, the distance between the two planets is constantly changing. At the closest grouping of the two, Mars and Earth are 56 million kilometers apart (at their farthest, it can be up to 401 million km). Sending vehicles to the Red Planet doesn’t follow the shortest path, however—instead, navigators launch it in the opposite direction, whipping it around the Sun as a the pebble of a “gravitational slingshot” to reduce the amount of propulsion spent. This favorable arrangement of Mars and Earth on opposing sides of the sun occurs once 26 months, and at its fastest still takes 214 days to complete. Compounded, a round trip to and from Mars will take a minimum of nine hundred plus days,  Traveling that long, there is also what you have to"
MIT,2012,Team:MIT#ResultsTest_-_-_TEXT.html," without phenol red pH indicator. The negative control well did not receive any RNA. As a transfection reagent, each well received 1 uL of Lipofectamine 2000. The positive control well received 5 pmol of a gate strand tagged with a ROX fluorophore annealed to an input strand, to act as a product of a strand displacement reaction. The scrambled input well received 5 pmol annealed double stranded reporter with quenched ROX along with a 5 pmol of an input strand containing the correct toehold domain but the incorrect binding domain. Therefore, when both constructs are inside the cell, a strand displacement reaction should not occur, and the fluorophore remains quenched. In the final well, correct input, the cells received 5 pmol of double stranded reporter as well as 5 pmol of an input strand with the correct toehold domain and hybridization domain. Accordingly, we should expect that the toehold of the input strand binds to the complementary exposed toehold on the double stranded reporter, and will branch migrate and effectively kick off the output strand of the reporter that is tagged with a quencher. Therefore, the fluorophore will no longer be quenched, yielding red fluorescence.
Refer to this diagram to identify labeled strands
In the negative control well, 200,000 HEK293+eYFP cells are healthy and adherent. In the positive control well, we see localized red fluorescence in the form of vesicles as well as distributed, whole cell red fluorescence. In the scrambled input well, we see red vesicles as well as red whole cell fluorescence. In the correct input well, we see only whole cell red fluorescence.
Strategy 2: Switch Transfection reagent to RNAiMAX
From the first foundational experiment, we observed localized red fluorescence in vesicles as well as whole cell fluorescence. This indicates that our reporter complex is either melting, being degraded, being recognized by a specific enzyme etc as well as the reporter is coming apart inside of the lipofectamine vesicles. We researched better transfection reagents for double stranded RNA, and found that Lipofectamine RNAiMAX is designed specifically for the delivery of double stranded RNA, whereas Lipofectamine 200 is specifically designed for the delivery of plasmids.
Once we received the new transfection reagent, we set up experiments similar to the initial experiment but with an optimized protocol for RNAiMAX (See Materials and Methods).

Overview
Our team used mathematical model to solve two problems in total.
A. Predicting the efficiency of integrase in vivo. It confirmed the feasibility of our circuit when we designed it.
B. Simulating the diffusion process of the repressor and trying to get a reasonable solution of the differential equations to interpret the leakage of integrases when our wet lab experiment went wrong.
All the results is calculated on MATLAB or Mathemetica.
First part [ Details ]
In this part, we set up an original model of DNA recombination by integrase, the reaction function goes as follows:
Figure 1.1 | “PB” is the attP and attB sites of DNA, and “LR” is the recombination product, attL and attR sites, which are direction-changed, of the DNA. PBI is the complex of DNA and 4 integrase molecule. LRI1 and LRI2 are two kinds of complex which are conformationally distinct from PBI. The “single arrow” represents the reaction which can reach rapid equilibrium with the equilibrium constant over it. The “double arrow” represents the slow reaction with the reaction rate constant over and below it. “K(bI)” is the equilibrium constant. “k(+r), “k(-r)”, “k(+syn)”, “k(-syn)” is the reaction rate constant. The site direction change occur in the second reaction: “PBI” to “LRI(1)”.
We use “PB” and “LR” to represent the sites of DNA being recombined or not separately and “Int” to represent the integrase. The others represent the intermediates.(figure.1)
Regulating all the reaction process by appropriate mathematical functions, we figure out the efficiency of the integrase recombination in vitro, where there is no substrate production, dilution and degradation.
Then, we get the figure1.2 to interpret how the recombination rate changes over time. And as the graph shows, the transformation rate can reach almost 80 percent within 0.5 hour approximately. It confirms the possibility that our circuit based on the serine integrase possesses the capacity to make regular response to the"
Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Biocontainment_-_-_TEXT.html,"igen 14 . This introduced a C-terminal His-tag, for purification by Ni-NTA chromatography. A vector (pEVOL-BipA) containing the aaRS/tRNACUA pair for translating the TAG stop codon to incorporate BipA was already available from the biocontainment strain 1 . For translating the TAG stop codon to aspartate, we constructed an alternative vector (pEVOL-Asp) containing the aaRS/tRNACUA pair.
To test translation of the TAG stop codon and incorporation of BipA and aspartate in Cas9, we cultured bacteria transformed with Cas9-expresso constructs and pEVOL-vectors and extracted and purified the Cas9 variants. SDS-PAGE of the purified samples showed clear expression of both Cas9 and dCas9, and lower expression of dCas9-Ala10BipA(TAG). A faint band could be seen for nCas9-Ala10Asp(TAG), but since a control sample without any synthetic amino acid also displayed a faint band, this result is not conclusive (Figure 4).

In vitro Cas9 Cleavage Assay
To assess the functionality of our Cas9 variants we performed in vitro Cas9 cleavage assays. As a substrate, we used a PCR product of 4140 bp that included the gene encoding RFP. After cleavage, this will generate two fragments: one ~3100 bp fragment and one ~1040 bp fragment. All targets were chosen in close proximity on the DNA. As a result, all cleavage products would be roughly the same length, and targets on opposite DNA strands should result in a double strand break when incubated with nCas9-Ala10Asp(TAG).
From the assays (Figure 5) we concluded that our purified Cas9 is functional using several gRNAs targeting RFP, as the linear substrate was at least partially cleaved in all cases. As expected, dCas9 did not cleave DNA. When two gRNAs"

Therefore, we also communicated with many other iGEM teams, including BNU-China, FAFU, TJU and BIT. Besides, we took an active part in two iGEMers Meetups held by NCTU and Peking University respectively. Our project becomes more complete during these activities. We made constant improvement day by day and solved many knotty problems with the help of other iGEMers. The united survey offered significant messages concerning other respected application fields more than industrial fermentation of pH Controller. We realized that our system has the potential to solve problems like the soil acidification which is one of the main issues the public concerns. Above all, through the communication with other teams, the companies and the public, we had a better understanding of the potential application of our project in the theoretical context, the business context and the social context. The relatively complete research in Human Practice improved our project a lot. Besides, the united questionnaire spreads the concept of synthetic biology throughout the world and provides a new idea about how we can do such a valid research in China particularly. We are really grateful for all people involved in our Human Practice who have offered us so much useful information. There is no doubt that the united form of Human Practice will benefit us more for next year’s plan."
