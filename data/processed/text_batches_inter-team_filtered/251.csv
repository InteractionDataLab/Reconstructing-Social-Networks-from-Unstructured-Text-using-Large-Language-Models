Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Notebook#Weeks14_-_-_TEXT.html," Laurel Thioesterase with RBS and Terminator into pSB1C3, and is ready for submission to iGEM.
Cyano
Procedure: GLF and INV were ligated into the iGEM vector PSB1C3. Promoters and integration vector for Synechocystis from iGEM Utah State received. Promoter (petBD, integration vector, GLF, and INV in pSB1C3 were transformed in DH5α cells. Cultures streaked and grown overnight. Colonies selected from streaked plates, liquid cultures grown overnight. Liquid cultures miniprepped to isolate plasmids. Digestion using EcoR1 and PstI performed on each of isolated plasmids including INV and GLF, gels run and imaged. LB with 30% glycerol stock prepared for freezing of E. Coli.
Results/Discussion: The EcoRI and PstI digests did not confirm the successful transformation and isolation of pSB1C3 containing petBD, integration vector, GLF, or INV. Either the digestion was incorrectly performed, or the transformations were unsuccessful. The isolated plasmid DNA needs to be submitted for sequencing to confirm that all genes necessary for PCR and gibson assembly are correctly ligated in the pSB1C3 vector.
Procedure:  An apparatus for growing Synechocystis was prepared using a flask and glass tubing connected to an aquarium pump to aerate the culture. Synechocystis was grown in a photobioreactor for four days, and the OD730 was measured once a day to determine growth. Synechocystis was grown in BG-11 medium with either 0% glucose or 50 mM glucose.
Results/Discussion: Over four days, the OD730 did not change for either type of culture. This indicates that the Synechocystis did not grow, and that modifications to the growth apparatus are necessary. A larger volume of culture is necessary, as well as a humidifying device.

CL: The week we continued to prep for our first ethanol test assay. Prep work consisted of preparing an ADH stock solution and making buffers, specifically a pyrophosphate buffer which will be used as the assay buffer, and two separate phosphate buffers, one containing Bovine Serum Albumin, used to store and dilute the ADH enzyme.  Also prepped were ethanol standards of known concentration, which will be used to “test"

2.2 CFDA
      In order to learn more about the supervision standards of health-care products                                         as well as safety and potential market value of melatonin, we sent emails to                                         consult a staff member of China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA).
      From this online interview, we have learnt that there are specific criterions                                         for different health products. The test always includes pesticide effect,                                         physicochemical properties and bacteria levels. Generally, products without high                                         purity have difficulties in passing the test, and melatonin in the market was                                         produced by chemical synthesis, whose major problem is that by-products produced                                         in chemical production and those catalysts are toxic. Thus, biosynthesis of                                         melatonin in our project will be of great practical application value. However,                                         the existing drugs made from bacteria are used to improve digest ability merely.                                         So it is uncertain whether our final products can appear on the market or not.                                         But we are inspired to consider a safer bacteria strain used in our project in                                         terms of present microbial products in the future.
      In addition, the staff member of CFDA mentioned that melatonin has a high pass                                         rate in the test, which convinced us of the potential usage of our expected                                         products. Also, we have learnt that people having special work often take                                         melatonin health products regularly. Hence, it is necessary to research and                                         develop a more efficient melatonin health product.

The bound proteins were eluted by an increasing Ni-NTA-elutionbuffer gradient from 0 % to 100 % with a total volume of 100 mL and the elution was collected in 10 mL fractions. In Figure 2 only the UV-detection signal of the wash step and the elution are shown, this is because of the high UV-detection signal of the loaded samples and to simplify the illustration of the detected product peak.A typical chromatogram of purified laccases is illustrated here . The chromatogram of the BPUL-elution is shown in Figure 2:
Figure 2: Chromatogram of wash and elution from FLPC Ni-NTA-His tag purification of BPUL produced by 3 L fermentation of E. coli KRX with <partinfo>BBa_K863000</partinfo>. BPUL was eluted between a process volume of 460 mL to 480 mL with a maximal UV-detection signal of 69 mAU
The chromatogram shows a remarkable widespread peak between the process volume of 460 mL to 480 mL with the highest UV-detection signal of 69 mAU, which can be explained by the elution of bound proteins. The corresponding fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE analysis. During the elution, a steady increase of the UV-signal caused by the increasing imidazol concentration during the elution gradient. Between the process volume of 550 and 580 mL there are several peaks (up to a UV-detection-signal of 980 mAU) detectable. These results are caused by an accidental detachment in front of the UV-detector. Just to be on the safe side, the corresponding fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The corresponding SDS-PAGE is shown in Figure 3.

Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#ProjectTest KillingTest_-_-_TEXT.html," Fy. The sRNA will stick to Hfq and bind to the mRNA of USP45-Colicin Fy gene and that will block the translation of colicin Fy. When our bacteria is in proximity of Y. entercolitica we want it to express the colicin Fy. Therefore, the Sensing group have been working on a Yen system which will inactivate the promoter that regulates the spot42 when it is close to Y. enterocolitica.
Figure 1. The spot42 system
System design
The aim for the killing group was to design two different constructs - one with a secretion tag and the bacteriocin, colicin Fy, and the other with an sRNA system for inhibition of the toxin when not in proximity of Y. enterocolitica. However, at first we wanted to insert our final construct into Lactobacillus via a shuttle vector. Since Lactobacillus is a probiotic we could use our system in a real scenario if one gets a Y. enterocolitica infection in the gut. The final construct would consist of J23106-B0034-USP45-CFY and a construct for the sRNA spot42. The sRNA spot42 already includes a promoter.
Two different secretion tags were used. PelB for E. coli and USP45 for both Lactobacillus and E. coli. Two Anderson promoters were chosen, J23106 (strong) and J23116 (weak) for the colicin Fy because we wanted to find a balance, where E. coli would not die from stress (due to too high expression) or its self-produced toxin. In order to characterize our colicin Fy we wanted to purify our sample so we could see the protein on an SDS-page. To do this, a His-Tag was required for an IMAC column purification. Therefore we also built the constructs with a 6x His-Tag.
We designed the colicin Fy according to the Freiburg assembly standard, biobrick 25. This would allow us to fuse our protein with the secretion tag without having to consider the stop codon from the scar of SpeI and XbaI from the biobrick 10 standard.
Silencing RNA system design
The silencing RNA system or sRNA system was also one of the primary aims for the killing group. We designed and modified the sRNA system from Team Uppsala iGEM 2012, called spot42. The spot42 was redesigned to sense our USP45"

Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#project#hprac#CEA_-_-_TEXT.html," Biology Project recommended that CEA be applied to more developed projects that were approaching field deployment in order to evaluate it as a risk-assessment approach for synthetic biology at large. This is where we come in: can CEA be successfully used to evaluate the risks of our field-deployable device? What are its limitations?
We began by attempting to apply the Synthetic Biology Project’s modified guidelines for prioritizing research questions to our own project as it currently stands.
Above is a simplified schematic of our risk assessment approach, as adapted from the Woodrow Wilson Center. We hope that this framework will prove useful to other environmental iGEM teams in the future.
Altered Physiology
The current versions of our genetically modified strains have a membrane protein in the Mtr pathway for anaerobic respiration knocked out and complemented on a plasmid. They differ from wild-type Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 in that their capacity for anaerobic respiration is upregulated in the presence of analyte (arsenic or naphthalene). This plasmid appears to be producing mtrB in a fully functional form that successfully completes the anaerobic respiration pathway when induced. One important difference is that when uninduced, the bacteria loses much of its anaerobic respiratory activity, and must rely significantly more on aerobic respiration; this is further discussed below.
In addition, our salicylate reporter strain contains the nah operon, which allows the cells to constitutively degrade naphthalene into salicylate. Salicylate, a metabolic intermediate in the Pseudomonas strain from which the nah operon was taken, is less toxic to the environment than naphthalene. P. putida G7 can further degrade salicylate into a catechol, an edible carbon source using the sal operon; this second operon is not present in our cells, so our Shewanella strains are unable to actively degrade salicylate. This means that our cells cannot use naphthalene as a carbon source, a conclusion that is supported by our naphthalene growth assays. The effects of salicylate production on the cells appear to be negligible, but this should be further explored in future characterization work.
One of our future plans is to integrate our constructs into the chromosomes of our strains, in order to ensure that mtrB is not saturating at its uninduced, basal expression levels. This poses new questions: will chromosomal integration alter the expression patterns of this engineered pathway? Will it interfere with other functions of the cells? Functionality can be altered depending on the"

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html," Furthermore, it can be seen in Figure 29 that for TDP concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL only SAHS 33020 could maintain a significant amount of activity after a day.
Although both proteins successfully maintained LDH activity at higher TDP concentrations, the activity decrease over time was substantially lower for a concentration of 1 mg/mL compared to that observed for 0.5 mg/mL. Moreover, for a concentration of 1 mg/mL, it can be concluded that the variations in activity over time for SAHS 33020 are lower than those for CAHS 94205, suggesting that the mechanism by which the SAHS proteins confer their protection is more effective for long periods of time. Our assays reveal that LDH in combination with SAHS 33020 is still active after being stored dried for 18 days at room temperature.
Nevertheless, the activity drops in the data discussed above could also be due to other factors than just the limitations of the proteins. It should be noted that after drying the samples no additional measures to ensure the dryness of the samples were taken, as these were kept in a drawer instead of in a desiccator. Moreover, interactions with any air components should not be neglected either, as the samples were not purged with an inert gas prior to their storage.
In future experiments the long-term evolution of the Cas13a activity should be assessed for SAHS 33020 and other tardigrade-specific SAHS proteins as, in view of the long-term results for the TDPs with LDH, these proteins hold great potential in simplifying the storage, usage, and shipment of the many fragile chemicals and biological materials.
Preserving whole cells with TDPs
As described by ( Boothby et al. 2017 ), the production of tardigrade-specific proteins by heterologous organisms increases their desiccation tolerance significantly. Therefore, to the end of further characterizing our BioBricks, iGEM Wageningen UR was asked to carry out experiments with our plasmids to test the increase in bacterial desiccation tolerance by CAHS94205, CAHS106094 and SAHS33020. Furthermore, for the sake of gaining a better understanding of the proteins’ function, Wageningen performed additional experiments by washing with PBS buffer. This was a procedure that had not been done before. The results are displayed in Figure 30.

During such interactions, we noticed that even at the university level, synthetic biology curriculum was discrete and thus more awareness and knowledge-sharing was required. So we initiated plenary talks at the club meetings to give overviews on several topics to the community, such as gene-machines, CRISPR, Recombinant Technology, Omics and Biomathematics.
Apart from the talks, we also conducted a couple of fun activities and competitions at the club in order to promote SynBio in the community.
Biotechnology Quizzes
During the course of our project, we have conducted Biology Quizzes in the community to promote Synthetic Biology. Quizzes on different topics were held and we got a huge response for them from our community.
Then we took a step further and created synbio and iGEM quiz at the “QUIZ UP” platform (an android application for hosting quizzes). The quiz was open to all and we received an overwhelming response for the same.

Today was an exciting day!  We went down to Stanford for a meetup with iGEM teams from UCSF, UC Berkeley, and Standford/Brown. With the little time we had before our road trip, we were able to miniprep C0080 and digest the mutant LacI promoter. Once at Stanford, we discussed our projects and our strategies for approaching them and talked with each other to share information that could be valuable to each other's projects.  The UCSF team is very impressive being mostly comprised of high school students who seem very sharp.  After a bit of mingling, we all headed to a different part of campus where SB5.0 was happening.  We were lucky enough to be able to attend the poster session which was great!  There were so many posters which all presented interesting things that were similar to things we have worked on or were interested in working on.  A few notable posters showed mutating one domain in an efflux pump that were aimed at pumping out biofuel.  One poster which we were interested in was one that raised the idea that DNA could be made with a different backbone which could possibly introduce another mode of isolating synthetic systems in a complex cell.  No doubt there would be a boatload of work involved with building artificial machinery to do the basic functions which have evolved for millions of years in nature.  Perusing the posters gave us some ideas and really motivated us to do work on our project.

Today we did some transformations of Bba_E0240 ligated to our magic screening plasmid.  Those plates will be taken out on Saturday morning and cultured Sunday evening.

Created a ""Plan B"" for cloning that details fallback plans and options that we will pursue if cloning is not successful. Simplified Outline: Ligate one GFP into pFTV, ligate in the dRBS. Transform cells, plasmid prep and sequence to determine which RBS was taken by each. Swap out GFPs, then sequence again to ensure that variant GFPs were successfully introduced.

Constructed dCas9 gene cassette and plasmid backbone with replication origin ColE1 via PCR Rescue. Gel purified dCas9 and ColE1 cassettes. 1 out of 4 dCas9 PCR's were successful, and 2 out of 4 colE1's were successful, all of which were Ashlee's. We attributed this to Emily's lack of cloning experience.
Sam prepared electrocompetent cells for use later on, and began process of primer design. Clay designed the synthetic leader sequence and finalized the program in MATLAB that optimizes GFPs at codon level.Met with Dr. Salis and decided to also optimize a GFP for slow insertion time, based on a model created by Iman Farasat.

Conducted Colony PCR using P. putida KT2440 strain as DNA template to construct two ~1 kb genome overlaps. Plasmid prepared the Lambda Red Recombinase plasmid, DH10B-PKD46, FTV-ptac-LacI-CmR plasmid, and NoHP_15A_Plmra_CmR plasmid containing RFP with a strong, unique promoter.  Stock of NoHP_15A_Pkmra_CmR and FTV_ptac_LacI_CmR for cryogenic storage was also made. Lambda Red Recombinase cassette was amplified using PCR Rescue and gel purified.
All constructs (variant GFPs in vector pFTV checked for enzyme restriction sites, enzymes picked to be used in the cloning process. gblocks designed using format: junk DNA- restriction site- CDS- restriction site- junk DNA. Sam designed rescue primers to be used for amplifying the gblocks. They will be expensive and we don't want to leave any chance of running out of stock once we have them. Primers for rescue PCR redesigned when it was realized that Clay accidentally truncated the GFPs by incorrectly copying the coding sequence of original superfolder GFP from its Ape file.

We selected different reporter proteins from the registry to run simple screening assays for inteins. Therefore we chose to split GFP, mRFP, mCherry, Renilla Luciferase and Firefly Luciferase at diverse positions.
GFP at positions 64/65 and 157/158, mRFP at positions 154/155, and 168/169, mCherry at position 168/169, RenLuc at position 229/230, FireLuc at position 437/438
Upon splicing reaction of the inteins the protein halves should reassemble again and restore their functionality. The reporters were bisected using a PCR reaction which simultaneously inserted overhangs including BsaI sides that are compatible with our fusion standard.
The backup strategy worked and Assembly Constructs were finished.
We developed a fast track cloning strategy to achieve a working split FP assay system required for screening the LOV variants earlier and more certainly. Therefore we designed and ordered new CPEC primers.
Primers arrived. We conducted PCRs and CPEC-assemblies for the fast track split GFP constructs including positive and negative control constructs.
N-terminal sfGFP half  (split 1-64) was cloned in front of the NpuDnaE-N split intein and the C-terminal sfGFP half (split 65-225) after the NpuDnaE-C intein. Also a non-splicing control was obtained by inserting a C->G mutation in NpuDnaE-N and a SN-> AG mutation in NpuDnaE-C, which prevents the inteins from splicing.
The C-terminal version was cloned behind the N-terminal construct using normal biobrick cloning (insertion in S and P restriction sides). The constructs were transformed in BL21 to for expression. The cultures (N-half, N-half with mutation, C-half, C-half with mutation, coexpressing construct) were lysed and prepared for a readout in the plate reader to measure the reconstitution of fluorescence.
The split sfGFP assay was run on the plate-reader. Results look good.
The sfGFP experiment was repeated on the FACS and with the right positive control This includes a T to C mutation on position 65 which will T65C mutation will be introduced by the splicing reaction of the inteins.
Since very small inteins are required for caging in the alpha helix of the LOV domain, we cloned SspDnaX, GyrB and SspDnaE3"

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on"

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," spinning disk microscope instead of the usual agar plates (See hardware). We used plasma-cleaned coverslips, since the normal coverslips are very hydrophobic and cause liquids to form a bubble on top of the surface. Plasma cleaning removes the impurities and contaminants on the coverslip and negatively charges the surface, thereby rendering it hydrophilic. This way contact between the coverslip and the bio-ink is improved.
For printing the layers of bio-ink, we first made a line of the alginate with RFP cells on the coverslip (Figure 3). This was done in the first experiment (Layer formation) by extruding the bio-ink at a flow rate of 100 uL/min with the syringe pump. In the second experiment (3D-stack), we used a 1-10 μL pipet. After printing of the first layer, CaCl2 was added on top of the alginate to start the formation of the hydrogel. We discarded the excess of CaCl2 by tilting the coverslip and removing the liquid with a tissue. This makes the layers of alginate a bit thinner, which is beneficial for the image quality with the spinning disk microscope. The image quality improves because the shorter distance to the objective leads to a lower background signal.  The layers on top of this first layer we applied in the same manner.
Figure 26. Plasma-cleaned coverslip containing three lines of bio-ink. Each bio-ink line consists of a layer of cells producing RFP and a layer of cell producing GFP on top. The irregular formation of the lines is due to the incomplete removal of CaCl2 after formation of the hydrogel of the first layer. As a result, the second layer partly diffuses away from the printed line before hydrogel formation.
Normally, the bio-ink is printed on an agar plate containing CaCl2. When the bio-ink gets into contact with the agar, the CaCl2 reacts with the alginate to form the hydrogel. To be able to better represent the printing with the DIY printer, we also tried to first apply a layer of CaCl2 on the coverslip and print the layers of bio-ink on top of this. However, the results was that the alginate would float around in the CaCl2, and it was not possible to make several layers of bio-ink on top of each other in a structured way.
Results
Layer formation
We used the syringe pump to make four layers of the bio-ink, with cells containing RFP on the bottom and layers of cells containing GFP,"

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#24 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html,". Some of these would be taught on the starting island, and others will be taught in the Synthetic Kingdom (for practice). For example, you click on a jellyfish to receive GFP and then open the inventory of a bacteria, put it in, and then the bacteria glows. Speaking of that wacky place, we brainstormed some rough ways to structure it. I think it is still a good idea to have all the bacteria floating around to give it a sense of awe, however, it could benefit from a path. This would make it very similar to a zoo exhibition.  The path would preferably be lighted for maximum awesomeness and each ""station"" would hold a different engineered bacteria. There would also be signs pointing the way and a little notecard giver that would give you more information.
This weekend will spent on the paper. Emily and Fahd were working on it today and I'll complete it on Sunday.

Bringing credibility to my introduction
I found 4 papers that would be really useful: 2 that describe the AI-2 signalling pathway (Chen et al, 2008; Bassler et al, 1994); 1 that describes the AHL signalling pathway in depth (Cao et al, 1989); and some justification for why we’d bring in AI-2 in addition to AHL in that AI-2 is much more prevalent in nature, which should make it more versatile in its potential applications (Rasmussen, 2006).

L'équipe TU Delft travaille aussi sur une part qui peut fournir de l'adhérence à E. coli. Ainsi, nous avons décidé de collaborer afin d'améliorer les résultats et la caractérisation de nos parts respectives. Ils se sont intéressés sur la colle des moules et des protèines formant cette colle. Les importantes capacités d'adhésion de ces protèines, une fois introduit dans des bactéries peut être une méthode efficace pour fixer les bactérie sur un support, pour par exemple la production de biocarburants.
Après un échange de mails et une visioconférence, nous avons pu trouver différents moyens de nous entraider. Nous avons proposé de reproduire chacun les expériences de l'autre équipe pour valider la répétabilité de nos tests. Mais aussi...
Ce que nous avons fait pour eux
Nos deux équipes avions des soucis avec un promoteur constitutifprésent dans la registry, nous avons synthétisé un promoteur fort constitutif (promoteur trc) et nous l'avons envoyé à l'équipe de TU Delft
Nous avons partagé les protocoles de test d'ahdérence en plaque 24 puits et par cristal violet.
Ce qu'ils ont fait pour nous
Grâce à ces protocoles l'équipe de TU Delft a pu aussi répéter nos expériences pour confirmer nos résultats.
Ils nous ont proposé de prendre des images de nos souches avec leur microscope confocal.
Ils nous ont proposé d'utiliser leur modèle pour l'adhérence, mais après étudié, nous avons réalisé qu'il n'était pas adapté à notre projet.

Human Practice
This year we did some great thought experiments to imagine what we want to achieve and discuss. As we know, synthetic biology aims to create new life systems never exist in nature. So, we came up with an idea why not design a new life form. Nowadays, artificial intelligence develops so fast. We are curious about what if computers and organisms become the same system. Therefore, we thought and described why our project mix-realty cell was a new form. And we considered the possibility of evolution of mix-realty cell. In the meanwhile, we also considered what mix-realty cell could be applied for and what mix-realty cell could influence our lives. Moreover, we did other work to help our project. We think deeply about the current situation of popularization of life science in China. We try to figure out if there is a way to change this circumstance. And we also do some outreach activities to raise public understanding of our project.
Public outreach
1.Volunteered in science & technology museum
At the time of Children's Day, we helped volunteer in Wuhan science&technology museum. We have a great day with kids~
2.Help local primary school completed lab courses
Many primary school in China don’t has lab. We decide to help a school in our community by offering our lab to them to complete their experimental education.
3.IGEM TalkX: Synthetic biology training club
Our university is a comprehensive university based on agriculture and life science. So the public has a good foundation and open attitude on synthetic biology. We set up a club to communicate with everyone concern about synthetic biology. The communication began at every weekend. We are happy to see it's really make great sense to all participant. Most of our team member were elected from the club member.

Due to the clotting, which damages the white blood cells, the serum has a higher concentration of cfDNA than plasma, as shown in table 1 ( Lee et al, 2001 ). The protocol for processing blood into plasma can be found here . Plasma and serum containing cfDNA can be stored frozen and stable for longer periods of time, up to years, without significantly lowering the concentration of the cfDNA ( Ginkel et al, 2017 ).
Table 1. cfDNA concentrations in human serum and plasma. Values obtained from Zinkova et al, 2017 .

Plasma

Due to extra safety measurements and permits required for working with blood, we performed background cfDNA extraction on adult bovine serum as a proof of concept, instead of using whole blood and processing that into plasma. Extraction was done using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit, as recommended by Aïcha Ait Soussan of the Dutch blood bank Sanquin, who are experts in the extraction of cfDNA for prenatal screening and provided us with their optimized protocol for the low cfDNA extraction using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini (QIAGEN). Since the concentration of cfDNA is so low in plasma, the extraction columns were loaded with more sample than recommended in standard protocol, building up the DNA on the column before eluting.
Multiple extractions were performed after which they were quantified and verified. Also spiking of samples with artificial gene doping DNA was performed before extraction using the values obtained by the Gene Doping Model .
1.2 Gene Doping Model: Understanding Gene Doping
Aim: Model the process of infection and degradation of gene doping DNA in blood and predict the time dependent concentration of cell-free gene-doping DNA.
Approach: We considered the entire process of gene doping to fully understand the underlying mechanisms of gene doping and its effect on the athlete in our Gene Doping Model. We started with the process of DNA delivery using viral vectors, including both intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) injection methods, followed by the process of infection of kidney cells with the viral vectors, and finally the origination and degradation of cell free gene doping DNA in the blood. We used the human erythropoietin (EPO) gene as"

On June 19, 2018, five members of the MSU iGEM team visited the Monsanto Learning Center (MLC) in Monmouth, Illinois. We know that Monsanto has recently had a negative public image, but their learning center is open to the public and does general education on agrobiological topics such as genetics and crop growth. We were taken on a tour of their agricultural test fields by Troy Coziahr, the manager of the MLC. He talked to us about hybrid breeding methods, the evolution of corn and soybean plants over time, and field trials of genetically modified crops. Mr. Coziahr was very knowledgeable about the most efficient ways to get those crops federally approved and then planted. This is useful to our own research because we hope to eventually have our own genetically modified crops."

Devora made more LB media.
6/12/14
Took photos of the pACYC184 plates that didn't grow then threw them out.
Took some of the pACYC184+UV and put it in 5 mL of LB media + 30μL of 25 mg/mL chloramphenicol and let it incubate in the shaker starting at about 11:45 AM. Took it out at 5:00 PM.
We set up the PCR of the pACYC184 and pBR322 by adding 20 mL of pACYC184+UV and pBR322+GFP mixed with 200 μL of water along with 2.5 μL of each of our forward and backward primers. We put it on #130 and will leave it overnight because it's late and we won't be here to take it out.
Then we inoculated our pACYC184 and pBR322 with constructs by doing a 1 in 10 dilution of the already inoculated cultures. Basically, we split up the 2 cultures into two different 50 mL conical tubes each. Each conical tube got 25 mL of LB media with the required antibiotic concentration (150 μL of chloramphenicol for pACYC184 and 25 μL of ampicilin for pBR322) and added 250 μL of the already inoculated plasmid into each. We put them in the shaker-incubater at 37 C overnight atarting at 5:00 PM.
We made a stock concentration of LB ampicilin media using 250 μL of amp into 250 mL of LB media.
Re-suspended the primers that came by adding 10X the amount of TE buffer in μL as there was ng of primers in the container.
Then a working concentration was made by making a 1 in 10 dilution the re-suspended primers in water.

attTn7 target site
A portable attTn7 target site
Single-target transposition to the bacterial genome is dependent on the presence of a conserved sequence, encompasing the 3' end of the glmS gene, encoding glucosamine synthetase, and part the intergenic region immediately downstream, designated the attTn7 site. This region is highly conserved ( Milewski, 2002 ), and Tn7 transposition has been demonstrated in over 20 bacterial species ( Craig, 1996 ). However, the lack of a suitable target may be the limiting factor in some of the organisms in which Tn7 transposition does not occur, including a variety of bacteria, but also archea and eukaryotes. The possibility of inserting a functional attTn7 in the genomes of these organisms may enable site-specific Tn7 transposition for at least some of them, thus expanding the host range of this transposon and its derived tools, such as the miniTn7 BioBrick toolkit.
Construction of a ""portable"" attTn7
As a first step toward this goal, we undertook the cloning of the functional E. coli attTn7 ( BBa_K510022 ) into a plasmid vector, and the demonstration that this ""portable"" plasmid-borne attTn7 can be recognized as a Tn7 transposition target by our miniTn7BB minitransposons. The attTn7 was PCR-amplified from the chromosome of the E. coli K12 strain MC4100 with primers bearing prefix and suffix restriction sites, cleaved and ligated into pSB1C3. The construct was verified by sequencing.

We also planned on testing various inducible promoters ( pBad , pLac , pRha ) with our reengineered CRISPR/Cas9 system.
One problem encountered by previous iGEM teams (eg: Paris Bettencourt 2012 ) was leaky expression. We will be expressed our CRISPR/Cas9 system in a low-copy plasmid ( modified pTRC99A ) to reduce the effect of leaky expression. As an extension to our project, we also planned on testing tet-off ( BBa_K1061012 , BBa_K1061013 ) as a low leaky expression alternative for the inducible control of the CRISPR/Cas9 system.
Assembly Strategy
We planned on using Gibson assembly to assemble our complete plasmids, including the rearrangement of pCas9 described above, all in one reaction. The four fragments of our assembly are as follows:
biobrick prefix, promoter, and rbs (synthesized as gblock, overlaps with C and B)
Cas9 and crRNA array (PCR from BBa_K1218011 )
tracrRNA and biobrick suffix (synthesized as gblock, overlaps with B and D)
the low-copy origin of replication and ampicillin resistance marker from pTRC99A (PCR from pTRC99A )
CRISPR activity assay
We designed a CRISPR activity assay order to measure the activity of our CRISPR/Cas9 system under the control of various constitutive and inducible promoters.
This assay involves two plasmids, a ""target"" plasmid, containing a protospacer and PAM, as well as the CRISPR plasmid itself (promoter, cas9, crRNA array, tracrRNA), with the corresponding spacer sequence inserted into the spacer insertion site of the crRNA array. The two plasmids must have different antibiotic selectable markers.
In our case, we chose to use RFP in pSB1C3 as our target plasmid because it has an easily recognizable phenotype (red colonies), as well as a different antibiotic resistance marker (Chloramphenicol resistance) than our CRISPR plasmids (which are Ampicillin resistant). To make our CRISPR plasmids target the RFP plasmid, we found a suitable protospacer within the sequence of RFP to insert into the spacer insertion site of our CRISPR plasmids.

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.
Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe,      exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life.      Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.       An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question ""What is the meaning of my life?""      The value of the question pertaining to the purpose of life may coincide with the achievement of ultimate reality, or a feeling of oneness,      or even a feeling of sacredness.

We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.

By using the Tristable Switch, the chemical which has the highest concentration out of three different target substances can be detected. When used as the tree biosensor, the switch will be used to detect tree wounds as well as two different kinds of fungi which live on the roots of trees. After detecting the presence of a fungus or a wound, the device will release chemicals that can either kill the parasite or heal the tree wounds. We plan to use Liana plants as a potential host for easier delivery of the device to the trees. We hope that this biosensor design would be able to help the Hong Kong Government in reducing accidents caused by falling trees. In the future, the circuit can  also be used to detect pests in plants grown in commercial farms.
The product is in the form of genetically engineered Liana plant. It will be planted near the target tree, enabling it to grow and climb up the tree without much care needed.
Normal Liana leaves are green-colored. However, when a wound is detected, the Liana sap close to it will turn orange.
When there is a presence of brown rot fungi, the sap turns red.
When the tree has white rot, the sap turns blue.
Liana will be removed if it covers most of the surface area of the tree leaves.
Opportunities
POLITICAL
Governmental support is likely as Hong Kong is increasing its investments in the Biotechnology sector.
ECONOMICAL
The parts are reusable, hence reducing the average cost.
Parts are interchangeable. A library can be set for multiple biosensor types.
Protection of public property and human life through prevention of trees located in public areas from falling.
Reduce the cost of maintenance and human resources needed to monitor tree-related accidents.
Reduce fungicide usage. Regular spray is not needed - only sprayed when sensor detects the presence of fungi.
TECHNOLOGICAL
The existence of HK Science Park as an equipment and research hub for biotechnology.
Tailor-made sensors for consumer as the parts can be changed to detect other types of fungi and wounds.
ENVIRONMENTAL
Protect old and valuable trees as heritage.
Reduction of fungicide use:
Promoting biodiversity.
Maintaining natural biological equilibrium.
Prevent contamination of other non-target areas.
Challenges
LEGAL
Environmental safety protocols that regulate the release of biotechnology devices into nature are mostly against constructs made through synthetic biology.
Must seek approval from Convention of Biological Diversity in order to proceed with product development (UNEP, 2012).

Intergrow
Intergrow has been producing hydroponically grown tomatoes year round since 1998. We talked to them to learn about alternative methods of growing hydroponically. They specialize in drip irrigation to water their plants since tomatoes don't grow well in NFT or deep water systems.  The drip technique involves individual pumps pouring nutrient solution onto the base of each plant and collecting the solution in a bottom tray.  Intergrow grows plants in rockwool and uses drop moisture techniques. They're extremely tech-oriented in their approach, with two giant mixing tanks on top of the facility to handle nutrient mixing. With already implemented technology, Intergrow seemed not too worried about certain variables.

Red Acres
Red Acres is a 6th generation family farm in Maryland that primarily grows lettuce hydroponically. We hoped to learn about the problems that plagued hydroponics in earlier days. Red Acres faced several issues with their lettuce growth: they were unaware that the lettuce would be smaller and take longer to grow during the winter. On the other spectrum, very hot days cause bolting in the lettuce, which makes it bitter. Tip burn, where the leaves of a plant decay due to calcium deficiency or rapid growth, can also happen year-round. In order to combat these issues, they use automated systems and computers to regulate their plants.

Aerofarms
Aerofarms is an aeroponics farm located in Newark, NJ.  Aerofarms is one of the few farms that grows their plants by constantly misting the crops’ roots. This technique, known as aeroponics, is done with a large number of machines that allow for a tremendous density of produce.  We hoped to discover any differences between aeroponic techniques and deep water hydroponic techniques.  A big problem for them is employee discipline since mental rigor is required to repeat similar tasks, maintain conditions, and watch everything carefully. They also lack the equipment necessary to spot disease early on.

Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse the nickel affinty chromatography of the dxCas9 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 12% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol.The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt.

NUS_Singapore-A,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-A#Hardware#Pump_-_-_TEXT.html," a housing to hold a silicone tube inside a circular path. We noticed that Aachen 2015’s silicone tubes had a smaller outer and inner diameter than the tubes we planned to use, as the working volume of their bioreactor is less than ours. After analyzing their design, we conjectured that we only needed to modify the thickness of the pumping layer (Figure 5) to accommodate our own silicone tubing.
Figure 5. Original shape of pumping layer.
However, our silicone tube exerted forces on the walls of the pumping layer and caused the walls to deflect (Figure 6).
Figure 6. Diagram showing the direction of normal forces exerted by our silicone tubing on the pumping layer. The direction of deflection is the same as the force here.
Because of this, the silicone tube could not be pinched closed (occluded), and the pump was unable to force the fluid to move through the tube.
We thus repositioned the inlet and outlet, combining them into one opening (Figure 7).
Figure 7. New shape of pumping layer.
Now, when the silicone tube attempts to regain its original, non-deformed shape, the lines of action of the forces it exerts at the opening will be much closer to the metal fasteners (Figure 8), causing a much smaller bending moment. Additionally, the force exerted by the silicone tube is now shared by 4 fasteners instead of 2 as the shape is now continuous.
Figure 8. Diagram showing the direction of normal forces exerted by our silicone tubing on the new pumping layer.
After this modification, the pumping layer no longer deflected visibly, and operation was smooth.
CLOSE
Testing
We validated the functionality of this component and characterized it by plotting the mass flow rate as a function of RPM.
PROCEDURE
Place a length of silicone tubing in the peristaltic pump. Put one end into a water reservoir. Place another end into a clean, empty beaker. Put the empty beaker on an electronic balance.
Use the code to set the RPM.
Turn the peristaltic pump on.
Wait approximately 5 seconds for the flow to stabilize. When the flow has stabilized, start the stopwatch while simultaneously taring the electronic balance.

22th May 2014, iGEMers can handle a variety of bricks!
Between lab work and team meetings there is also a little spare time for gaming nights and more!
24th May 2014, Teamwork on the Road
We work with the smallest machines but sometimes we have to deal with problems caused by larger ones.
24th May 2014, iGEM Meetup in Munich
The first German Meetup at LMU Munich was a blast! Interesting talks, productive workshops and of course: Networking at its finest!
25th May 2014, Oktoberfest!
When you are in Munich (Bavaria) there is definetely no way around a traditional Biergarten.
28th June 2014, TU Day, the OpenDay of our University
At the TU Day we had a booth in the Biocenter of our university where we presented iGEM and our project to future students and other interested visitors. The children could even do experiments with milk and had an insight into a scientist's work.
28th June 2014, Oliver won a plush E.coli!
At the TU-DAY we had our booth opposite of the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research - not without consequences: Some (plush-)bacteria found their way into our hands!
11th August 2014, Our intern Benjamin
For two weeks we had an intern in our lab: Benjamin. As many of us had had bad internships during their school time, we offered him the complete opposite: He did almost every task as we did in our daily lab routine - and he liked it very much.
11th August 2014, A few days in and already a Pro at the pipette!
With a little practice even the pipetting of 96 PCR samples was no problem for Benjamin.
17th August 2014, Breakfast at Oliver's
Okay, it was actually lunch, but as we needed a working weekend to catch up with some work we thought it would be good to get out of the lab once and so we met at Oliver's to be productive.
17th August 2014, A canteen alternative
As we had a fully equipped kitchen just a few meters away we prepared our own lunch - Spoiler Alert: It was better than canteen food.

In constructing the sequence of a single chain insulin we had to ensure that our sequence was not under any existing patents so that we could submit our sequence into the Open Source iGEM registry. With a bit of help from Maxwell Lawyers we went through several single chain insulin patents, method patents and existing patents for current insulin dispensing devices/therapeutics using the FDA orange book. The goal was to make sure our work did not come under any existing patents so we would not infringe any ownership rights.
Importantly, we recognise the difficulty of being thorough with all existing patents and the content provided is not intended to be legal advice and should not be used as such. To determine whether you are infringing a patent; the best course of action is to seek a qualified patent lawyer.
To examine the way we approached patents - please click on the links below for easy navigation to each section.
How to read a patent
After our chat with Uppsala (check it out in collaborations ), our team realised that patents are a very poorly understood area, particularly for young aspiring scientists with new and challenging ideas.
With a resident legal student in our team - we created a quick checklist on How to read a patent
KEY CONSIDERATIONS
1. Patents give an exclusive commercial right to the invention aka. a monopoly
2. The ""claims"" of a patent, detail what is covered by the patent.
3. If it is NOT in the patent; it is NOT patentable.
And it is with this checklist that we approached the analysis of a wide range of patents below.
1. Single Chain Insulin Patents
Although our team attempted to be thorough, we recognise that not all patents can be checked. However, we targeted patents with the greatest relevance to avoid legal suits that may arise. Our primary concern was single chain insulin patents since they have only been recently explored in greater depth and quoted to have benefits like enhanced thermostability. As these single chain insulins are likely to be the next insulin product in the market, we wanted to create one, outside the scope of existing patents, to character"
SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," Yi Xue Za Zhi, 18, 215-8. . PHB will therefore be able to create a secluded space, where it is possible to avoid infection and the formation of fibrous connective tissue.
Coating of implants in combination with antimicrobial compounds ( Top )
Today’s implants could also be improved by a bactericidal coating of PHB. Implants used today are often made of titanium, which have no bactericidal effect. When inserted into the body, a bacterial contamination could create a biofilm, which could resolve in an infection and a necessity to remove the implant again Connaughton, A., et al. (2014). ""Biofilm disrupting technology for orthopedic Implants: What’s on the horizon?"" Frontiers in Medicine, 22. . PHB could be loaded on the surface of the implant as spherical micro- or nano particles loaded with antibiotics or bacteriocins, as suggested by Morten Østergaard Andersen . The bacteriocins will be released continuously and thereby prevent infections and biofilms.
Intracellular drug delivery ( Top )
One of today’s issues among drug delivery systems in the human body, is when a drug has to be transported intracellularly. PHB nanoparticles can cross the plasmalemma, thereby solving one of our treatment limitations Kapoor, S., et al. (2016). "" Intracellular delivery of peptide cargos using polyhydroxybutyrate based biodegradable nanoparticles: Studies on antitumor efficacy of BCL-2 converting peptide, NuBCP-9."" FInt J Pharm, 511, 876-89. .
There is, likewise, an increasing wish to create a personalized treatment to each patient. To avoid side effects and fulfill today’s wish, an in vivo drug delivery gel based on PHB could provide a non-invasive, local and steady release of medicine. In the example of cancer, the degradability of PHB is taken in advantage by incorporating the chemotherapeutic into the gel. As the gel is degraded, the medicine is released. Adding or changing components of the gel, changes the rate of which the medicine is released, thus allowing customization Wu, L. Y., et al. (2016). "" PHB-Based Gels as Delivery Agents of Chemotherapeutics for the Effective Shrinkage of Tumors."" Adv Healthc Mater. .

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," fluorescence of individual wells were inconsistent compared to the general trend. This can be attributed to GFP not diluted properly or spread evenly within the well. For further verification we require a test that directly measures the sample volume in wells on a plate.
Cost and DIY Approach
Our goal from the beginning has been to make TERRA accessible and therefore we took a DIY approach to our design. This would keep costs low, but would require more assembly of the system. For that reason we have made all the CAD, STL, and additionally all the code available on the wiki and also our GitHub. This is a bill of materials and the cost breakdown of our entire system.

Chlorophyll
Chlorophyll is a photosynthetic pigment differentiated from other tetrapyrroles by the presence of a magnesium ion in its structure [4]. Currently, four types of chlorophyll pigments have been identified including   chlorophyll a, b, c and d. Recently a fifth type, chlorophyll f, has been discovered as an accessory pigment in a cyanobacterium [5]. Before the discovery that the cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina used chlorophyll d as its primary photosynthetic pigment, it was thought that only chlorophyll a was utilised by the photosynthetic reaction centres of all photosynthetic organisms [6]. In this study we are interested in chlorophyll a, as this is one of the main photosynthetic pigments produced in Chlmaydomonas reinhardtii, the organism from which the genes necessary for out project have been sourced [1].
Gibson Assembly
Gibson cloning is a powerful and innovative method of DNA polymer synthesis, devised by DG Gibson et al. in 2009 (Gibson et al., 2009). The technique comprises an isothermal, single-reaction experiment involving the concerted action of a 5’-exonuclease, a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase. An overview of the Gibson assembly method is provided in Figure 1 below and involves the ligation of DNA oligos, or ‘gBlocks’, of varying size (up to 500 BP each). As can be seen in the figure, gBlocks contain overlapping DNA regions of at least 30 BP which are exposed upon the action of the exonuclease. This facilitates complimentary base pairing between gBlocks.  The simultaneous action of a DNA polymerase (preferably with proof-reading activity) and Taq polymerase, respectively, then complete and seal the newly formed conjugate (Gibson et al., 2010, Gibson et al., 2009).
The technique has obvious advantages in terms of time efficiency and simplicity. It involves considerably less labour and steps to complete compared to traditional methods. In particular there are no polymerase cycling assembly; PCR, gel purification; restriction digestion and DNA ligation steps are necessary (Gibson et al., 2010). For these reasons we have chosen to apply this technique to the assembly our BioBricks.

Gene expression levels detection：
To examine gene expression of the key players in the cGMP metabolism pathway, we designed primers for hGUY1A3, hGUY1B3 and PDE5A. The house keeping gene GAPDH was used as an internal control. Results of RT-PCR and Real-time PCR were shown below. After transfection of the α and β subunits of sGC, the expression levels of α and β subunits were up-regulated. But the expression of PDE5A did not change significantly.

Mesurement of sGC activity and cGMP concentration:
We next examined whether the overexpressed α and β subunits of sGC are functional. We used Elisa Kit to measure the sGC activity and cellular cGMP levels. Compared to empty vectors, transfection of the α and β subunits of sGC significantly increased sGC activity and cGMP level in HEK293 cells. Our sGC overexpressing devices worked successfully.

The result in Fig 8 indicated that sGC overexpression was successful! And we we used cGMP Elisa Kit to detect whether cGMP concentrantion increase at the same time.

Lentivirus vectors carrying three different PDE5A shRNA designs were created using the scarless golden gate assembly. The sequence to encode a EGFP fluorescent reporter was inserted after the Puro antibiotics-resistance gene， rather than directly after the shRNA gene, to avoid any potential influences on the function of the part.

Additionally, the complete upstream and downstream process for Tn5 transposase (BBa_K2643002), dxCas9 (BBa_K2643001) and dxCas9-Tn5 fusion (BBa_K2643002) is documented in detail on the biobrick registry.
3.3 Fusion Protein In Vivo Functionality Test
Design: To visualize in vivo whether a donor DNA sequence can be integrated close to a target sequence, we built a strain that harbors the dxCas9-Tn5 fusion protein (BBa_K2643000), as well as a lacZ gRNA expression cassette (BBa_K2643010). The cell is electroporated with a kanamycin resistance cassette flanked by MEs (BBa_K2643011), which can be recognized by the Tn5 transposase domain for cut and paste integration near the gRNA target. This disrupts the lacZ gene and renders beta-galactosidase catalytically inactive, which can be visualized by blue/white screening with X-gal. In parallel, we have electroporated an E. coli strain that only harbors the Tn5 transposase for comparison with untargeted integration.
Results and interpretation: Prior to doing any actual genomic integration, we performed a broad scala of control experiments. Table 1 gives an overview of the results obtained for these controls. The obtained data confirmed that, based on their blue colony phenotype, the parental BL21DE3 strain indeed contained intact and functional lacZ. Furthermore, the parental strain was not found to be resistant to chloramphenicol nor to kanamycin. Harboring the fusion construct and the gRNA that targets lacZ, while not provided with donor DNA, did not influence the functionality of the lacZ, resulting in"
Cambridge,2010,Team:Cambridge#Notebook#13_-_-_TEXT.html,"28 went to get a coffee...
Right, like any season finale this gave more questions than answers. My take on all of that would be that H-NS does indeed repress, but is still affected by physiological changes connected with cell density, despite the absence of the Vibrio quorum sensing system. Therefore, expression is reduced after a while and falls off rapidly. In R28, the lux operon is not repressed and keeps glowing away as the cells are growing and slowly changing into stationary phase. The initially lower brightness might be due to greater availability of secondary substrates, like ATP, as Top10 is generally more viable. Another explanation could be that G28 burns out all its resources at the start, while R28 lives at a much slower pace (although the OD values do not show this), but uses a greater proportion of its resources to make light. K28 just sucks.
We left the plate reader running. It will be interesting to see how long R28 is able to maintain its light output. Either way, there definitely is a significant influence of H-NS on LuxCDABEG without the original promoter regions, and we can definitely present that as evidence for our codon-usage-change approach.
Peter bumped into Jim Ajioka today and he asked me to let him know when we are going to do the LRE/spinning down experiment. Are we still going to do that? It would help us a fair bit in showing the efficacy of LRE and how much of the effect depends on liberation of luciferase and how much is actual recycling.

Basically, the sequencing didn't work. There was something wrong with the sample concentrations or something, so even though they say they've repeated the readings they can't get any meaningful results. So we don't yet know if we have successful colour changes yet I'm afraid. BUT, all we need to do is send some more samples off. I'm afraid I'm busy today so can't. Any volunteers?
Duncan has also asked to remind us all about trying to organise that lab meeting with the supervisors next week.

Will and Peter had a long day in an attempt to do a number of Gibson Assembly operations.  The most crucial was to place Edinburgh's luxAB under pBAD and then add our codon optimised CD and EG to it.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#PoliciesAndPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," is unsuccessful, patients waste their personal resources. Dr. Allen also looked into rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) what clinicians think of them. Many seems to criticize them because RDT can’t quantify infections which might be important in determining the most effective type of treatment. The cultural mind set also plays a role. Microscopy slides come back positive, so malaria is diagnosed. A lot of RDTs come back negative and clinicians do not trust it. However, RDTs were only created to target malaria, so a multidiagnostic test might solve the problem in terms of mistrust because the big question asked when malaria tests come back negative is “If it is not malaria, then what is it?” Dr. Allen felt that an important aspect of success of the project would be to analyze the limitations that are presented in the developing world setting.  We need to consider mind for our design include storage space (no freezers), shelf life, price (ideally the device needs to be under $1; microscopy only costs about 34), diagnosis time. Overnight tests were classified as an option that is not ideal as many patients have to work several hours to arrive at the hospital, and to commute again the next day would be discouraging for use of such testing.  Dr. Allen recommended that we check the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) and other organizations that are working on similar ideas for hopes of potential collaboration.  We also discussed the potential for quantification of infection, and will look into this option however the PCR of DNA might affect this aspect.
We have also introduced weekly policy and practice meetings to further discuss this subject with the Policy and Practices team.  This week we are also planning on contacting Kirsten Jacobsen of Public Health Canada that was interested in this years iGEM team doing a video conference with a committee dedicated to looking at emerging technologies through Public Health Agency of Canada.  This relationship could be a valuable resource to learning and impacting policy through our project and our policy and practices team.  Additionally we are looking into contacting additional perspectives from experts in the field of malaria misdiagnosis to gather a broad view of perspectives from various individuals, occupations and respective regions of work.  The team also broke up the weekly tasks into contacting additional experts and research on diseases in different regions as well as policy in Canada and developing countries.

UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," from NADH transferred to C3, which formed an enolate anion on the carbonyl oxygen. A proton transfer from tyrosine then leads to a keto-enol tautomerization [25][26]. In vivo, crotonyl is covalently bonded to acyl carrier protein, but coenzyme A is used as an analog. The purpose of these two molecules is to carry acyl chains through the cytoplasm (Acyl refers to CH3-C=O groups) [27].
We therefore designed a chemical biology screening based on two parameters: functional group similarity to the crotonyl moiety and to mimic CoA’s role as an acyl carrier. We wanted to explore a large chemical space to increase our chances of finding a hit. We weren’t completely sure if FabI only reduced carbon-carbon double bonds, so we tested valeraldehyde to see if FabI could reduce the aldehyde to an alcohol. To see if FabI could reduce the C-C double bond of an unsaturated carboxylic acid, we tested crotonic acid. We then tested three unsaturated aldehydes, just like crotonyl-CoA, but without the CoA moiety. And finally, to try and find potential acyl carriers, we tested bulky substrates with rings (phenyl acetaldehyde, p-anisaldehyde, and 3-(5-methyl-2-furyl)butanal).
We discovered enzyme activity on the three unsaturated aldehydes (trans-2-pentenal, 2-ethyl-2-butenal, and trans,trans-2,4-heptadienal), but had no activity on any of the other substrates!
We found the enzymes were most active on trans-2-pentenal. There was no measurable enzyme activity using the other 5 substrates. This is highly consistent with the enzyme mechanism in which an allylic double bond is reduced when adjacent to an activating group, such as an electrophilic carbonyl (e.g. an aldehyde or thioester).  Furthermore, crotonic acid has a less electrophilic group adjacent to the allylic double bond, highlighting the high selectivity of FabI for the electronic structure of its substrates.
While significant activity is observed on these alternative substrates, there was a decrease in overall enzyme activity relative to the near-native Crotonyl CoA substrate of ~100-fold. This made it so >500nM enzyme is needed to see enzyme activity in assays.  In order to be used to detect relevant levels of"

To make the downstream recovery easier, a thermo-stable variant of the lectin can be engineered to ensure that it will not denature if the lysate of cells is heated. This makes the overall process much more simple, which means that the production of GRFT becomes more cost effective.
As for Zika, it is a disease that is mostly spread via mosquito but it causes microcephaly and Guillain-Barre Syndrome in infants when in uteri of infected mothers. Both of these neurological diseases are severe and mothers are in a unique situation when pregnant in regions or when recently returned from a trip to a Zika infected country. Zika is a unique case as many of the antibodies individuals produce in response to the infection are cross reactive with tests we have for Dengue and Chikungunya, two very prevalent diseases in the same region as Zika. This is an issue because if a person has ever been infected with either of these diseases, current rapid tests for Zika would be positive, even if the individual has never had Zika. The tests that indisputably determine whether or not a person has Zika are expensive and require very specialized equipment. In the US, there are currently only three labs that are approved to run this test.
The lateral flow assay that we designed is modular so it will not only help one of these diseases but both of them.

By combining two senders at a time, sometimes with senders that have shown to induce a high GFP expression and sometimes with senders that have shown a weak induction, our team wanted to see if it could increase or decrease the GFP expression on demand as needed. The controls used for the experiment were testing single sender inductions on the same plate as the combinations, the use of blank wells (LB AMP 100%), a positive GFP control, and a negative control with negative receiver cells and negative sender supernatant.
Alternate Synthetic Dimension: Robot Quest for GFP Domination
Last year’s ASU 2016 iGEM team only used the synthetic AHLs of Rhl, Lux, Tra, Las, and Rpa. These AHLs were tested on the receiver F2620, that last year’s team characterized using 2 concentrations of 1E-6M and 1E-7M (Davis et al). This year, the 2017 iGEM team decided to expand this type of characterization on the improved receivers of Lux, Las, and Tra. This was done by increasing the range of AHL concentrations to 1E-14M to 1E-4M (Scott et al). The number of synthetic AHLs was also expanded to 6 and included the Rhl, Rpa, Tra, Lux, Las, and Sin. These tests are important to characterize the newly improved receivers and to determine how varying the AHL concentration affects GFP expression. In summary, testing of these multiple AHLs is being taken a step further by looking at how the concentration of these AHL chemicals in the cells affect the gene expression of the receiver.
AHL Disposal and Human Practices
Our motivation for modeling LasR, TraR, and LuxR through quantifying induction rates over time was to inform our various “quests” by crafting an understanding of the dynamics between each Sender and Receiver combo. The imaging process allowed for a 3D representation of induction rates and strength of GFP production giving a visual representation of the AHL's (sender/receiver combos) and if they were inducible or did not respond at all. This information simulated expected behavior in our media induction tests which allowed for more precise system design when evaluating sender/receiver behavior.
The 3D analysis methods allowed for highly precise measurement of GFP induction rate and overall strength. This method has not been used with agar induction plates before and with the use of negative and positive controls it allowed for our modeling portion of our project to be highly effective at informing our project design. Previously with 2D induction modeling only coarse grain measurements and rough"

Extracellular Polymeric Substance Matrix
Overview
Without the hard work of bees, the difficulty of planning dinner would increase significantly. Taking time out of our daily routine to consider all that bees have done for us would take quite a while. We would not have some of the grains, fabrics, fruits, and vegetables that we enjoy. Alfalfa, cotton, almonds, oranges, cherries, and livestock that feed on bee pollinated crops would all decline significantly, if not completely perish. We would not have the flowers and trees that make our world beautifully diverse. Bees pollinate 70 out of the top 100 food crops, which supply 90% of the world’s nutrition. It is apparent that bees are an integral part of the ecosystem and human life.
Unfortunately, bees have been in decline for about 30 years and the death rate has gone up in the past decade. This phenomenon is caused by a number of factors, including the use of neonicotinoid insecticides, climate change, and parasites. One of  the most notable parasitic mites that infects bees is the Varroa destructor mite. This particular mite feeds off of the bee’s hemolymph, the blood-like substance, transmitting viruses like Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) in the process. DWV disrupts the bee’s development, causing them to have stubby wings and short bodies that prevent flight.
A few methods to deal with V. destructor are ineffective as they do not target the mite at a crucial phase when the bee is most susceptible. The larvae are sealed into combs with the mites, a place that some treatments simply can not reach.Other treatments rely on chemicals that increase bee mortality rate. For example, formic acid has a harmful effect on capped and uncapped honey bee brood1. In addition, resistance against various methods are developing in certain Varroa mite populations.
Currents techniques used to deal with V. destructor mites include using bio-pesticides, alcohol washes, synthetic chemical pesticides and the sugar shake method.
Our modus operandi: protect all the bees and larvae from the inside out. Using synthetic biology, we designed E.coli that produces the miticide oxalic acid in the"

First off, we decided to develop a project solely for the purpose of enriching our outreach to high schools. This project involved demonstrating synthetic biology's usefulness via the implementation of simple metal detection genetic circuits into our lessons. These circuits served well for our purposes in multiple ways. They were simple and easy to explain in terms of the genetics, they could produce a visible result via fluorescent reporter genes, and they had the potential to solve real world problems. Specifically, these metal detection circuits could be easily related back to the Flint, Michigan water crisis. Being able to underscore the ways in which synthetic biology could be used to solve actual issues was a must for us, so the metal detection project was ideal for incorporation into our high school lessons.
Along with developing a project that would garner the attention of students and act as the focal point of our in class presentation, we also worked hard to revise the way in which we teach our lessons. Since students were struggling to retain information from our lectures, we did some research and decided to make lesson plans based on the principles of active learning. This meant doing things such as clearly stating learning objectives prior to and after the lesson, having class wide and small group discussion, and engaging students with thought provoking questions. All of this culminated in a lesson that encouraged participation and effectively showcased the need for synthetic biology as well as some of the underlying scientific principles. Utilizing this lesson plan, the high school lectures that we led were very successful and can be read about further in the outreach section of the website.
Design
In order to use these metal detection circuits in our lessons, we first had to design, construct, and characterize them. We decided to do this for the detection of three different types of metal: copper, lead, and zinc. Planning out the genetic circuits was relatively simple as they only required a few components. First was a constitutively expressed metal sensitive repressor, second was a promoter regulated by said repressor, and third was a fluorescent reporter gene under the control of the metal regulated promoter. In the case of our copper biosensor, the genes/elements involved include the CueR repressor, the pCopA promoter, and an RFP reporter gene. Similar systems were designed for the lead and zinc biosensors using the PbrR and ZntR systems. The fluorescent proteins used for these circuits were YFP and GFP respectively.
Copper detection circuit A: Copper biosensor in the presence of copper ions Copper ions inhibit the binding of CueR to the pCopA promoter, allowing for expression of RFP. B: Copper biosensor in the absence of copper ions"

After confirming that droplet formation in yeast cells is possible with Ddx4, the genes responsible for auxin synthesis were cloned into the vector. Ddx4-IaaM and Ddx4-IaaH were synthesized by IDT and cloned into the vector via a Gibson Assembly and then transformed into yeast. The resulting vector is shown in figure 4.
Figure 4: pYES2 vector with Ddx4-IaaH and Ddx4-IaaM inserted via Gibson Assembly.
GC-MS measurements to analyze the auxin production were then conducted on yeast cells expressing the Ddx4-IaaM and Ddx4-IaaH. These measurements are currently being evaluated and results will not be ready before the wiki freeze. Those results will however be discussed in the upcoming talk at the Giant Jamboree in Boston.
As control, experiments with just IaaM and IaaH without Ddx4 were done. For this, the coding DNA sequences of IaaM and IaaH were first amplified out of the synthesized Ddx4-IaaM and Ddx4-IaaH constructs used before. After that, IaaM and IaaH were separately cloned into the vector using Gibson Assembly. In a next step, the full IaaH cassette was amplified and inserted into the vector with IaaM via Gibson Assembly. The resulting vector is depicted in figure 5.
Figure 5: pYES2 vector with both IAA- cassettes inserted via Gibson Assembly.
On these yeast cells, GC-MS measurements are being done to determine the amount of auxin being produced by the cells. Again, results will not be ready before the wiki freeze, but are to be discussed in the upcoming talk.

Molecular Biological Methods
We used different molecular biological methods in our project. All used methods are listed below.
Cloning
Plasmid Preparation
Plasmid preparation is a method for isolating plasmids from bacterial cell cultures. In this work the illustra™ plasmidPrep MIni Spin Kit (GE Healthcare) was used. After the cells are lysed, the lysate is applied to a mini column binding plasmid DNA to a silica membrane in the presence of chaotropic salts. Following a washing step, the DNA is eluted with bidest. water. Unless stated otherwise the plasmid preparation was performed following the manufacturer’s manual.
DNA-Purification
Some molecular biological methods require a purification of DNA after amplification or modification. In this work, the illustra™ GFX™ PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare) was used. In the presence of chaotropic salts the nucleic acids are bound the glass fiber fleece in the Filter Tube while other substances are removed by the washing steps. Afterwards purified DNA fragments are be eluted with bidest. water. Unless stated otherwise the DNA purification was performed following the manufacturer’s manual.
Restriction Digest
Restriction endonucleases are used to cut double stranded DNA molecules at specific, usually palindromic base sequences. Unless stated otherwise the restriction digest was performed for 1 h at 37°C. To prevent religation of digested plasmids the DNA was dephosphorylated by addition of alkaline phosphatase and another incubation for 30 min at 37°C"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#CFPS_-_-_TEXT.html," the reaction is lowered due to the interaction with RraA-protein, therefore mRNA-levels are stabilized.
RraA – Experimental Setup
To characterize RraA in vivo, we created two E. coli strains. One carried the rne gene that codes for RNase E under control of the inducible T7-promoter (PT7-rne-plasmid), whereas a second strain carried an additional second plasmid with the RraA coding sequence (PT7-rraA-plasmid; BBa_K1758122 ). For in vitro characterization, purified RraA that contained an N-terminal 6xHis-Tag was added to our CFPS reaction to see if RraA had the same positive effect in our cell-free setup.
RraA – Results
In the in vivo experiment there was no observable growth drop when T7 polymerase was induced in the strain carrying both plasmids, PT7-rne and PT7-rraA. However, induction of T7 polymerase in the strain carrying PT7-rne-plasmid only lead to a clear growth inhibition. This difference was apparent although the strain carrying rne-plasmid altogether grew slower than the double transformed strain. Therefore we conclude RraA overexpression rescues E. coli by decreasing activity of RNase E.
Growth curves of E. coli expressing RNase E (rne) and RraA. Two cultures were induced to express T7 polymerase at 1.25 h.
To verify the effect in vitro, RraA in 50 mM HEPES buffer at pH = 7.2 was added to CFPS reactions to a final concentration of 0.3 mg/mL. To exclude that an observed effect resulted from the buffer alone, two control reactions were additionally performed. In these reactions RraA was omitted and the missing volume was filled up with water and buffer only, respectively.
RraA improves final fluorescence signal when added to the reaction. Final concentration of RraA in the reaction was 0.3 mg/mL.
Purified RraA after SDS-PAGE. Protein identity was proven via mass spectrometry.
We could verify Airens observation that RraA is a positive effector in cell-free protein synthesis. More precisely, the results of Airens and our experiment are similar: In our reaction the final signal raised about 33.8 ± 4.5 %, and in Airens experiment the signal raised 28.6 ± 3.1 % respectively when compared to a reaction were RraA is"
William_and_Mary,2018,Team:William and Mary#Human Practices#A Statewide Standard_-_-_TEXT.html," a year to update, many students are not being exposed to the most recent findings and research. To address this, our team is working with Dr. Petersen to create a resource for teachers which will provide information on the most relevant biotechnology advancements and applications. This living document will be managed by a team of vetted educators and education partners who will ensure the information presented is up to date and accurate. This document will also provide guidance for teachers hoping to integrate the new material into their classes. This novel program is currently in the developmental stages and will be implemented alongside the new Curriculum Framework following its approval.
Together, our new Standards of Learning, Curriculum Framework, and Advancements Tool will help prepare Virginia students with up to date lessons in synthetic biology and bioengineering, inspire the next generation of iGEMers, and prepare them to be informed members of the community.
To assist teachers in implementing these new standards and framework we have also created an education course for Virginia teachers. Details can be found in the NASA section.
What are Standards of Learning (SOLs)?
The Standards of Learning outline the expected learning outcomes for all 1,293,049 students in the Virginia Commonwealth. The standards are divided by subject once students reach secondary programs. All Virginia teaching professionals utilize the standards as the infrastructure for lesson planning, and subjects covered in the Standards of Learning are expected knowledge as evaluated on state examinations. The Standards of Learning apply both to specific knowledge and skill development. By integrating synthetic biology into the Standards of Learning, all Virginia students will be required to learn about this important field.
What is a Curriculum Framework?
The Curriculum Framework provides additional guidance for educators. The framework correlates to the standards of learning but provides more specific learning objectives for each standard. The framework is intended to amplify, clarify, and define the components of each Standard of Learning.
NASA
As a part of our Statewide outreach initiatives we wanted to connect with teachers and introduce them to new ways of teaching synthetic biology. With the support of a NASA Mini-Proposal we created a 10 subject course taught through William & Mary which will engage teachers by relating topics in synthetic biology to long term space travel and NASA.

B) Lanes 3-5 contain commercial Cas9 (with nuclease activity). The gel shifts indicate the binding of gRNA to commercial Cas9 (lane 3), specific binding of Cas9/gRNA complex to PCR product (lane 4) and nuclease activity of Cas9 causing cleavage of the PCR product (~800 and ~200bp lane 5). Lane 7 contains WT pre-incubated gRNA, the gRNA gel shift, similar to lane 3, suggests binding of gRNA to protein. Lane 8 contains WT incubated with gRNA and PCR product, a protein shift suggests specific dCas9 binding. Lane 9 contains denatured WT and no gRNA complex can be observed suggesting strong binding of dCas9 to protein and no cleavage of the PCR product. D) and E) The coomassie stain (E) displays the band weights of the purified truncated proteins (highest intensity). The smears in pre-incubated samples (lanes 3, 6 and 9) indicate gRNA binding to protein. The disappearance of higher protein bands in incubated enzyme and PCR samples (lanes 4, 7 and 10) suggests dCas9 binding the target sequence. The high intensity bands of ~1000bp show excess PCR product not being bound by dCas9 and in denatured samples (lanes 5, 8 and 11) no cleavage of the PCR product is observed. All samples contain faint lower bands indicative of gRNA, suggesting binding is not as strong as in WT but still occurring.
Manchester Collaboration
H2ydroGEM collaborated with iGEM teams from nine other countries (EU, USA, Brazil, Japan, Chile, Indonesia, Korea, Canada and India) to create a comprehensive document on GMM (Genetically Modified Materials) legislation around the world. Each team conducted extensive research into the laws surrounding GMM inclusion and labelling in commercial products. This research was then collected and summarised to produce integrated responses to the following six questions:
1. What institutional body enforces the laws regarding the use of GMMs?
2. Who regulates the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis?
3. What legal requirements do I have to fulfil in order to be able to use GMMs in my business?

How does our Lactadora system work?
Our first system Lactadora consists of E.coli lab strain with a synthetic gene circuit presented at the rigth.  We construct the ppH-TetR module to synthetize the TetR protein which is able to repress the pTetR promoter. This synthesis is up-regulated by a pH promoter which is induced when pH is lower than 5.5, otherwise (pH>5.5) there is no TetR protein production. In this last case, the second module (pTetR-DLDH-LuxI) will express the DLDH enzyme to synthetize lactate from pyruvate produced from a glucose molecule and diffuse to medium.
Also, will be expressed the LuxI protein to generate homoserine lactone (HSL), a quorum sensing molecule that can diffuse outside the cell. While concentration of lactate outside the cell increases, medium will turn it an acidic environment; the higher lactate concentration, the lower pH.
When pH>5.5, lactate production is ON.
When pH<5.5, lactate production is OFF.
This way, when pH reaches a 5.5 value or lower, ppH-TetR module will be activated and TetR protein will repress the second module and synthesis of lactate will stop until pH increases again.
PLAdora: PLA production and exportation system
Develop a system that can polymerize lactic acid to polylactic acid (PLA) and it can be able to export PLA outside the bacteria.
What parts did we use? And why?
pC (BBa_J23119): This is a constitutive promoter which is part of the constitutive promoter family serie J23100 through J23119; this last is the ""consensus"" promoter sequence and the strongest member of the family.
pLux (BBa_R0062): This is an up-regulated promoter by the action of the LuxR protein in concert with AHL (3OC6HSL). Two molecules of LuxR protein form a complex with two molecules of the signalling compound AHL, increasing the rate of transcription. This promoter is a part of the LuxI/LuxR quorum sensing system from V. fischeri.
To all of our constructions we use the Ribosome Binding Site based on Elowitz repressilator BBa_B0034. It is considers with efficiency 1.0, it means has the best translation velocity (what’s translation?), so is used to"

Who: Benno
Aim The goal of repeating the GC-FID runs with a different sample preparation was to investigate the negative results of the previous run and to obtain reliable styrene quantification
The GC runs were repeated with an improved sample preparation involving mechanical cell lysis through glass beads. The results were analysed on the HPLC by Owen and Jeroen Nijland and by Benno on the GC-FID.
For cell lysis 200 µl worth of glass beads were added to 900 µl worth of liquid culture in a 1,5 ml Eppendorf cup. The Eppendorf was vortexed for 10 minutes and subsequently spun down at 13.000 rpm for 1 minute. 800 µl of the supernatant were used for the described GC sample preparation.
Liquid cultures of two promising PAL2 positive colonies were grown to OD , a negative control sample was also included.
Due to a miscommunication these supposedly superior samples originated from cells that were not supported with Phenylalanine in their grow medium.

Tianjin,2014,Team:Tianjin#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," biology has not yet entered their lives. 52.17% said  they have their own?? comprehension;  synthetic biology has been involved in many areas in life. We can see that only  3.73% people understand synthetic biology very well; synthetic biology has got  great achievements in pharmaceutical, bio-energy, medical and many other fields.  Faced with safety issues of synthetic biology, 40.37% people indicate that they  would follow scientific principles to support the development of synthetic  biology. While 55.28% people support precautionary principle, emphasizing the  necessity to improve the supervision mechanism. 4.35% showed an attitude that  they do not care the safety problem, they will use as long as they can be  applied to life.
78.88%  people think people should be involved in the supervision and management of  biotechnology. 21.12% people disagree; they hold that people are so lack of  relevant biological knowledge that they cannot have a comprehensive  understanding of science.
If you have the opportunity to learn  synthetic biology-related courses and take part in IGEM, would you like to have  a try? 57.14% people answered yes, they expressed an willingness to have a try,  but do not attempt to spend too much time or energy. However, 24.84% people are  very glad to join IGEM. There are also 18.01% people that are not very  interested in it. If people have taken part in an IGEM team, 36.02% of them want  to study the environment and energy direction. 50.31% people are interested in  medical and pharmaceutical direction. 9.94% people suggest to study  agriculture, and green manufacturing direction. Whereas, 3.73% people prefer to  study other directions.
If you can assemble the gene sequences of  different modules to customize an e. coli with special features are various,  what functions do you want to realize most? The answers are various, to treat  diseases, prevent cancer, lose weight, generate electricity, etc.
What  is the most urgent problem that synthetic biology should solve? We designed four answers: treatment and prevention of human  diseases, command of environment pollution, efficient energy production,  construction of appropriate ethical system. The results are as follows:
It is obvious that  the great majority people support “treatment and prevention of human diseases”  as the most urgent problem. “command of environment pollution” are in the  second place, followed by “efficient energy production”. “Construction of"
