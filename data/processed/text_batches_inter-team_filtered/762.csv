Special Awards
☑ Best Education and Public Engagement
We have built an iGEM ecosphere, which includes universities, experts, iGEMers and teenagers. To achieve our iGEM ecosphere, we went to several schools first. We exchanged little handmade plant printing bags with pupils, made micro landscapes of domestic waste with middle school students, and held a brainstorming about synthetic biology in middle school. We guided young people to understand synthetic biology, so that they would become the industry's reserve talent. Meanwhile, we organized an exhibition with Southwest Union and mobilized college students to help us dig up soil samples. Even more, we helped SiCAU build their team. Under our influence, more and more students have joined iGEM. We communicated with many professionals who are in our ecosphere. They referred to a common problem, laboratory safety, which lacks a uniform safety standard in basic biology labs in China. So we made China's first iGEM laboratory safety video and comics. We hope the ecosphere can develop with a medium. Even if the competition is over, it will continue to output influence, and continue to promote synthetic biology. So we designed an easy-to-understand turn-based board game based on synthetic biology, Gene Card. It becomes popular in China during a short time and turn it into a lot of people's biological enlightenment game teaching aid.
☑ Best Integrated Human Practices
More than engagement, we integrated supporting research in our human practice. To know common pesticide contamination and public biosecurity awareness, we sent three kinds of customized questionnaires to different people. The questionnaires made us know the TCP， which is harmful. Subsequently, we learned about the presence of a large number of TCP by detecting soil from soil survey. We know that we cannot solve the problems well which related to human development only by research. With the help of experts’ power, we can make it more professional and more in-depth. Therefore, we have built a ‘Global League of Professors’ to guide our projects. So we contacted with experts from several countries and universities all over the world about plants or environment by emails, videos and face to face interview, More importantly, our project has been widely concerned in the academic community with the help of their contacts and resources.

In figure 3, tube 1 is blank control without bacteria, and tube 2-7 are parallel test groups in which 100uM rhl was added. Obvious green florescence can be seen in each tube of test group. So we got the conclusion that promoter pRhl can work well under this condition.
2. Cas9 Protein
We obtained the plasmid Psuzm3a-Cas9 and primer pair 1 for Cas9 gene from Prof. Yizheng Zhang of college of life science, Sichuan University. Restriction sites Hind III, Xba I are added to forward primer and Spe I, Pst I are added to reverse primer. We didn’t add EcoR I site since there is such a site in the middle of sequence of Cas9. The primer sequence and PCR results (Fig. 4) are shown as below:

3.sgRNA
Since purchasing plasmids containing sgRNA is time consuming, we designed it by ourselves. The new biobricks(K1796203) is shown as below:
Fig. 5. Gene circuit of biobrick(K1796203)
The sequences of crRNA and tracrRNA came from the biobrick uniCAS RNAimer (BBa_K1150034), submitted by 2013 iGEM team Freiburg.
(1) Modifications on Promoter and Terminator
The constitutive promoter and the terminator are based on biobricks BBa_J23100 and BBa_B0012, respectively. To make these two parts more compatible with our sgRNA, we made some modifications on them. For the promoter, we changed -10 box into TATAAT, aiming at higher efficiency of transcription. What’s more, only the core domain of terminator B0012 which can form hairpin structure and oligo U were chosen. We have to make the part a short one to avoid undesired situations, for example, the sgRNA is too long to combine with Cas9 protein.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria"

For conditions where inflamed sites are not directly exposed to the bandage, such as swollen joints in rheumatoid arthritis, microneedles may help delivery of ACT3m through the skin. Microneedles can create tiny channels in the epidermis (Prausnitz, 2004) so that our GzmB inhibitor can be delivered to deeper areas pass the skin (Figure 21).
General Application: Cream
In cases where chronically inflamed sites are not localized (such as in psoriasis, Figure 22), we envision a second prototype for general topical use. Our GzmB inhibitor protein (ACT3m) would be extracted from bacteria, purified, and put into a cream (Figure 23). One of the following methods might be used to deliver our protein through the skin.
Figure 22: Pictures of psoriasis, a condition where treatment via cream may be useful. (psoriasis.vital101.com)
Figure 23: Cream Treatment
Microneedles
Microneedles can create tiny channels in the epidermis (Prausnitz, 2004) to deliver our ACT3m protein in the cream through the skin. A microneedle roller can be used before applying the cream.
TD1
TD1 is a patented peptide (PP, et al. 2014) with the sequence ACSSSPHKHCG. When mixed with proteins, this peptide can carry proteins through the skin. To help transdermal ACT3m delivery, TD1 will be added into the cream.
Transfersomes
Transfersomes are specialized liposomes (made by a certain procedure) that can carry the encapsulated materials through the skin (Jain et al., 2003). ACT3m would be put into transfersomes, so that when the cream is applied, these transfersomes will bring our GzmB inhibitor through the skin.
Tocopheryl Phosphate Mixture (TPM)
Tocopheryl phosphate is a natural form of vitamin E, which, when mixed with proteins, increases their transdermal delivery (Cottrell, 2014). TPM was developed by Phosphagenics, an Australian biotechnology company. Using this technology, Phosphagenics developed an insulin cream, which is currently going through the FDA approval process (Segal & Michelson, 2015). If successful, this could also be used in our cream prototype to deliver ACT3m.

Human Practices Summary
Our project encompassed three areas within human practices: research, impact, and outreach. Each allowed us to better understand our project as well as help the community become a part of our experiments. We met with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Michigan Department of Agriculture (MDA), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), lawyers, conventional farmers, professors, environmental scientists, global agriculture specialists, bioethicists, organic farmers, biotechnology companies, and entrepreneurs to change our project based on regulations and professional opinions. We then gathered the thoughts, opinions, and concerns of community members, raised awareness of GMO foods, and invited the community to engage in conversation on a hot topic.

Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"rate quantity we can expect,  we tested different glucose concentrations between 0.4 and 15  mmol.gDW-1.h-1 using FVA method (Flux Variability Analysis). 0.4 mmol.gDW-1.h-1 corresponds to the glucose flux obtained with the Biosilta Kit for a culture time of 14 days, while 15 mmol.gDW-1.h-1 is the flux needed to reach maximum growth rate (same rates are applicable to formate, data not shown. FBA, objective function = biomass production, Result = 0.03).
As expected, the higher the initial glucose concentration, the higher the level of produced metabolites will be.

The maximal production implies no growth and is equal to ~ 0.006 mmol.L-1, Fig. 4 (~ flux value of 2,917 mmol.gDW-1.h-1).

As with butyrate, formate biosynthesis   is unfavorably altered when a high level    of constraint is applied to the minimal     growth rate (Fig. 5). And formate production      will be more important when glucose availability is higher (Fig. 6).

DIFFUSION - By KU LEUVEN Team
Our device was designed based on our reflection on practical considerations: how would it integrate with the hive? How to prevent trapped varroas from getting out?...
The true important question is the diffusion of our molecules in this trap. It is particularly critical when referring to butyric acid since we need to have a defined concentration of it at the top of the trap to attract the varroas in.
To model this, we collaborated with KU Leuven Team. Below are the results of their work, for which we are very thankful.
To know the effect our molecules (butyric and formic acid), will have on the bees, we need to calculate their concentration in the environment.
The molecules will be transported in the air by diffusion and convection.
Diffusion is always present, whereas convection depends on the presence of an external source (for example wind). To make a realistic model, we need the following parameters: diffusion coefficients and wind velocity (when we want"

ATHENAEUM, A SHORT HISTORY
Year 825: a rhetoric institution wanted by Lotario was already rooted in Pavia.
Year 1361, 650 years ago: a Studium Generale was founded thanks to Charles IV. Later on it was promoted to University.
XVI century: due to the 1525 siege its activity was heavily crippled. Further on, the Spaniards occupation lead it to stagnation.
XVIII century: the athenaeum was reborn thanks to Habsburg rulers Mary Theresa of Austria and Joseph II. They also restored the central palace shaping it as you can see it nowadays.
Pavia University can boast many famous alumni and professors like: Girolamo Cardano, Alessandro Volta and Luigi Cavalli Sforza along with Nobel Prize recipients such as Camillo Golgi, Carlo Rubbia and Giulio Natta.

THE TOWN
The town was founded as a Roman colony in the first century B.C. in a land populated by Ligurians and Celts. At the beginning it was called Ticinum, by the name of its river. What is left of the Roman town is the chess‑board street plan and the brick vaulted sewerage system.
Here, in 476, Odoacer defeated Flavius Orestes after a long siege. To punish the city for helping the rival, Odoacer destroyed it completely. However, Orestes was able to escape to Piacenza, where Odoacer followed and killed him, deposing his son Romulus Augustus. This was commonly considered the end of the Western Roman Empire. The town became the head of the Gothic war against the Byzantine Empire and maybe this is why in this period it was being called Papia or “the city of the palace” or maybe the city of the Popes. The current name derives from that one. From 553 to 568 Pavia remained under the Byzantine rule and its fortifications were renewed. In 572, after three"

Fudan-CHINA,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," admitted that the lack of effective communication between doctors and patients is what to blame for. Clinical trials should never be permitted without informed consent, concerning its high risk. After all, patients are living people, just like us, but not a simple data in the research. With the help of Li, we successfully produce a video which explained our STEP system in plain language for more potential users.
Dr. Litao Xu Oncologist, Expert in Liver Cancer Fudan University Cancer Hospital
How does the cellular immunotherapy perform in clinical trials? Half of our team members are from medical school, and we were lucky enough to have an appointment with Dr. Xu, who is also from Shanghai medical college. He greeted us kindly and gave hearty laughes from time to time. He has rich experience in the treatment of liver cancer. He led the trials of immunotherapy in tumor hospital and handled nearly 60 patients. He showed us the procedures and specifications of clinical trials, and introduced two cases with excellent results. Previously, we were concerned about the clinical possibilities of the free molecules chosen for the project. In the interview, he affirmed the clinical application value of VEGF as a target in our project, and indicated that in clinical diagnosis, small and medium molecules in blood were often used as diagnostic indicators.
Shanghai Center iDrug Discovery & Development
On Oct.9, 2018, we arrived at the Shanghai Drug Research and Development Collaborative Innovation Center where a open day for advisory services on new drug research and development is held here on Tuesdays on the first week every month. On the open day, diagnosis and consultation on projects are provided freely, which are promoted to develop in the pattern people expected, and it will also bring contacts with the projects’ transformation. The professors from the center and the college of pharmacy gave us professional instructions scientifically and reasonably, as well as reference opinions from the industrialized angle. He commended the integrity of our project and the meaningful directions to wet lab from dry lab. Also, he pointed that the problems of the high prime cost and low safety of the current cell therapy, and wish us to make considerations on the choice of the cell type for transformation.  In iDurg, we gained a more solid understanding of the current situation of Chinese Pharmaceutical Industry. We deeply appreciate this platform , which integrated the resources of high institution, government and enterprises effectively, can bring contacts for our project from lab into the transformation to industry. During the visit, we found that, as for 2016, Anticancer and immune-related drugs took 7 places among the top 10 drugs in the world by retail sales."

Edinburgh,2012,Team:Edinburgh#Project#Non-antibiotic-Markers#Nitroreductase_-_-_TEXT.html,"reductase activity. In addition, this activity is similar to the nitroreductase in the BlueScript vector(diagram above).
Plates
The following characterization results are produced from the pre-BioBrick form of nitroreductase (nitroreductase in BlueScript vector with lac promoter). Due to the similarity of the vectror, the identical regulation and very similar specific activity (previous section), we believe that the BioBricked Plac-lacZ'-nitroreductase will behave very similarly.
To determine the relative toxicity of different compounds, 5 ul of DMSO, MTZ and DNBA were added at three distinct spots on a freshly spread plate and the amount of clearing was measured (in centimeters).
DMSO was determined to be non-toxic, DNBA showed small difference between the different strains while MTZ distinctively more toxic to BS-nitred and BS-contol.
Numerous plate experiments with MTZ concentration ranging from 0 ug/ml to 300 ug/ml and various concentrations of DNBA and NFT were made to determine concentrations at which BS-control was growing but where BS-nitred’s growth is inhibited. Similar growth patterns were observed in DNBA and NFT plates. All metronidazole experiments showed inhibited growth of BS-nitred in comparison to BS-control however the inhibition was never 100 %, which is required for nitroreductase to be used as a counterselectable marker.
Figure 10: Overnight plates with 100 ug/ml MTZ concentration with and without IPTG with different nitroreductase strains and control. BS-nitred’s growth was inhibited in comparison with BS-control however there are still some BS-nitred colonies growing.
Figure 11: Comparison of growth of BS-contol and BS-nitred at 90 ug/ml metronidazole. BS-nitred’s growth is clearly inhibited in comparison to BS-control however growth inhibition is not absolute.  We could not find a concentration of metronidazole at which nitroreductase containing cells’ growth was inhibited while control cells were growing. We determined that this gene is not suitable as a counter-selectable marker on plates.
Liquid cultures
The growth of nitroreductase-containing and control strains was assessed in liquid medium as well. The cells were grown in aerobic or anaerobic conditions with and without MTZ, in triplicate.

Production of azurin in a controlable manner (via AHL induction).
Production of an azurin rich bacterial lysate.
Quantification of azurin in our lysate (corresponding to a 140 µM intracellular concentration of azurin).
Quantitative assessment of cytotoxic effect of azurin on p53 positive and negative cancer cell lines.
Introduction
Once a tumor environment has been recognized and colonized by our bacteria, the production of an anti-cancer toxin, together with an MRI Contrast Agent agent will be triggered. The module that we engineered to achieve this purpose includes an AND-logic synthetic promoter that recognizes the presence of high lactate and high bacterial density in the tumor environment and allows the expression of the anti-cancer toxin, azurin, and the MRI Contrast Agent , bacterioferritin, from the same operon (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Accumulation of anti-cancer toxin, azurin, into bacterial cells. As long as, the bacteria have colonized the tumor, the synthetic promoter will allow the expression of the operon containing bacterioferritin (bfr) and azurin (azu) genes. The intracellular accumulation, of bacterioferritin as an MRI contrast agent will allow the doctor to decide and give the bacteria the permission to lyse and release the accumulated cytotoxic therapeutic protein, azurin.
Once the Tumor Sensing has been activated, both the Anti-Cancer Toxin azurin and the MRI Contrast Agent bacterioferritin are produced. Azurin will accumulate inside of the bacteria until it is ready for release.  Once the doctor verifies the bacterial colonization of the tumor bacteria via MRI, focused ultrasounds will activate Cell Lysis releasing an effective dosage of azurin to the"

Figure 4. HEK293 cells with or without mGMK:TK30 after 5 days of incubation with ganciclovir (GCV). Cells were stained with Hoechst (blue) and SytoxGreen514 dye (dead/pink). (A-C) Untransfected cells: without GCV (A) or with 10 µg/ml (B) or 100 µg/ml (C) GCV show a high survival rate. (D) Cells transfected with 200ng pPCMV_mGMK:TK30 and without GCV show high cell viability. (E-F) Cells transfected with 200 ng pPCMV_mGMK:TK30 and incubated with 10 µg/ml (E) or 100 µg/ml (F) GCV exhibit dramatically lower viability.
Cells were stained with Hoechst and SytoxGreen514 dye that differentially stain live and dead cells (Figure 4) and were imaged with a confocal microscope. Cell permeable Hoechst (depicted blue) binds to nucleic acids and therefore stains all cells in a culture. On the other hand cell impermeable SytoxGreen (depicted pink) cannot cross the membrane of live cells and therefore stains only dead cells. The cytotoxic effect of ganciclovir is evident at concentrations as low as 10 µg/ml and only a few viable cells were present upon addition of 100 µg/ml ganciclovir. On the other hand untransfected cells are not affected by ganciclovir. Moreover, cells expressing mGMK:TK30 (under the control of the CMV promoter) had no effect on cell survival if no ganciclovir was added.
The bystander effect for mGMK:TK30 was demonstrated by Ardiani et al. (2010) who showed substantial ganciclovir-induced cell death although only a fraction of cells were transfected. There are several different mechanisms of a bystander effect: the transfer of toxic metabolite ganciclovir-triphosphate through gap junctions (Elshami et al., 1996), endocytosis of apoptotic bodies generated from HSV-TK expressing cells by neighbouring untransfected cells (Freeman et al., 1993) and release of soluble factors (Drake et al., 2000). We also demonstrated that even if some cells do not express mGMK:TK30 (GFP was used as a control of transfection), g"

8.15(B)
After 15 days of holiday, we returned to our experiments full of spirit and energy.  In the next period, we divided our team into two parts: one in charge of extracting plasmids from bacteria strains delivered from iGEM and the following enzyme digestion and ligation with target reporting genes; the other in charge of getting anaerobic promoters we searched out from documents using PCR of bacteria strains and the following ligation with target genes.
Apart from the tasks above, we started learning the method of electric transformation, which we never got in touch with before and therefore is challenging for us.
Our team leader further emphasized some notes needed attention:
1. Mixing the agents before using them
Make sure all the agents are mixed before used.  Especially for those needed to be preserved frozen, mix them up after melting.  It's essential to build this awareness.
2. Operation at low temperature
Operating at low temperature can avoid non-specific annealing, therefore can avoid non-specific amplification in PCR.  Apart from PCR, when operating other experiments concerning any elements that can be easily inactivated, we should have the awareness of operating at low temperature.
3. Holding the tubes in a correct way
Make sure the posture is correct when holding the tubes so that the fingers would not block the line of sight and we can watch the process of adding the liquid better.
4. Avoiding of pollution when covering the lid of PCR or centrifuge tubes
We should build an awareness of no enzyme when doing molecular experiments.  Prevent contact with the inner side of the lids when covering them.
5. Keeping experiment records
We should keep the habit of recording each experiment we did.
8.21(all)
The main point of this meeting is the construction of our wiki website.  After browsing the wiki websites of the teams of past iGEM competitions, we put forward different ideas about our own wiki.  It came to all of us that, as the first team of Nanjing University to take part in the competition, our wiki should reflect the characteristic of our university.  Meanwhile, some teammates proposed the suggestion of Chinese style.  Finally, we drew the conclusion that our wiki will use Chinese painting as the background. "

The Video
This year, for the human practices portion of the iGEM competition, the Penn State team developed a video that explains synthetic biology in an understandable way for any general audience. This video is titled “(Re)designing Life” and addresses many topics surrounding the implementation and execution of synthetic biology. These topics include misconceptions generated by misinformation from the general public, the techniques used to perform synthetic biology, ethical issues surrounding genetic engineering research and the future applications of synthetic biology. Through this video, the Penn State team aimed to bridge the gap from the technical jargon used by today’s scientists and the general public understands of common biology. As a result, the misconceptions surrounding these technologies will be eliminated, opening a new relationship between synthetic biologists and the population they wish to improve through research.
Why This Video is Unique
While previous teams have made synthetic biology informational videos for their human practices project, this video differs not in content, but in audience. Most of the previous videos and workshops submitted to iGEM have been directed towards elementary and secondary schools, as well as college students. The Penn State team developed their video with the elderly in mind as the primary audience. The residents of Foxdale Village, a retirement community in State College, PA, were given the opportunity to view the video submitted by the Penn State team. The age range of these residents spanned about 40 years, from 65-104, a demographic previously ignored by the iGEM competition. From this viewing and a short discussion following the video, the residents were able to gain a better understanding of genetically modified organisms and their relation to synthetic biology.
Why the elderly?
In addition to their role as an untapped demographic, the elderly provide an open audience available to give feedback and opinions regarding the synthetic biology video. While the elderly population will have difficulty adding to the ever expanding technology that allows genetic engineering and synthetic biology, this demographic can still have a lasting impact on the scope of the scientific world. The elderly remain active in the political landscape through voting. According to the report summarizing the 2008 presidential election voting patterns, about 20% of all voters were above the age of 65, while only 10% were between 18-24. The latter age group has been well represented in previous iGEM human practices projects, but the former has yet to be reached. Until now…  GMOs are defined as any organism whose genetic"

II Do the orthogonality test for gene circuit design
    It helps us construct warriors that can just be killed by warriors from the other group but not from its own group.
     Because of the similarities between AHLs and between their receptors, warriors may be not only killed by the AHL secreted by the warriors from the other side, but also by itself, if the circuits are not well designed. This is a serious problem we faced when choosing the AHL-receptor-promoter pairs. This problem has been discussed by many groups in iGEM, like ETH_Zurich 2014 . However, all previous results are obtained by adding AHL artificially to test the respond of specific receptor-promoter combination. In our project, we let E.coli to secrete AHL itself, so different concentrations of AHL in our system may make the previous studies unsuitable for our system here.
    Therefore, we did Orthogonality test to fit our own needs to help us design gene circuits of warriors. Results are shown below.
Fig.3 Results of Orthogonality test
    However, we failed to choose an orthogonal gene circuit from our results. We can just determine the circuit of warrior II and what AHL warrior I should secrete, as is shown below:
Fig.4 Gene circuit designed from the results
    We cannot design a warrior I that can be killed by warrior II but not killed by itself regardless of whatever receptor-promoter we put inside warrior I.
(More details can be seen at Orthogonality test )
III Verify the orthogonality test
    We constructed our warriors and beggars and used the series of tests listed below to test the creditability of our results from the orthogonality test.
    Because we use RFP to indicate the level of LacI inside the cell during Orthogonality test, we are not sure if the results will be the same when we use a complete circuit. Therefore, we designed two warriors and beggars as below to verify results got from Orthogonality test.
Fig.5 Gene circuit designed for killing test to verify Orthogonality test.
    According to results of Orthogonality test, the warrior I will be killed by itself when it is cultivated without warrior II. Furthermore, warrior II doesn’t kill itself but can kill E.coli from another side successfully. All results we got here are consistent with our"

Preliminary Experiments
Week 19
In our design  , we wanted form a well-proportionedbiofilm to communicate with each other and  we also hoped signal reagent can spread properly . So we test different LB Medium  concentration. We make gel of different concentration from 0.2 % to 2%. We found  that 0.25% is proper .We use 0.25% Agar to make semi-solid LB medium in a dish. Then we plant  the bacteria which has grown overnight onto the medium. We have a gradient of  volume which is 100µl, 200 µl,  300 µl, 500 µl, 800 µl, 1ml, 1.2ml, and 1.5ml. Because the medium is semisolid,  we can’t invert the dish. Consequently, water remains in the dish.
24hr  later, we find that the medium has been covered with a layer of bacteria. 100 µl  is enough and 800 µl is the most volume we can use.

Experiment Recap
Two agar plates containing the 10 original cultures of transformed E.coli. Today's procedure will see the cultures in divisions labelled '2' and '3' cultured for a large plasmid prep
In the previous experiment, we had carried out DNA gel electrophoresis on six plasmids from our transformed E.coli cells - the six plasmids were each divided into two sets with the first set of six being treated with EcoRI alone and the second set being treated with EcoRI and PstI:
First set - treated with EcoRI
Culture 2 (GFP) - Lane 3
Culture 3 (RFP) - Lane 4
Culture 4 (RFP) - Lane 5
Culture 5 (RFP) - Lane 6
Culture 6 (RFP) - Lane 7
Culture 7 (RFP) - Lane 8
Second set - treated with EcoRI and PstI
Culture 2 (GFP) - Lane 9
Culture 3 (RFP) - Lane 10
Culture 4 (RFP) - Lane 11
Culture 5 (RFP) - Lane 12
Culture 6 (RFP) - Lane 13
Culture 7 (RFP) - Lane 14
After analysis of the gel photographs and comparison with the expected band sizes for the plasmids, plasmid backbones and BioBricks, we decided that cultures 2(GFP) and 3(RFP) were to be used for a larger scale plasmid prep.

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus"

Abstract
Recombinases can be used to create responsive genetic elements in biological systems.  Further, one can build complex control circuits using combinations of invertible DNA sequences. We utilized the unidirectional recombinase HbiF to augment an existing recombinase system in Escherichia coli that relied on the unidirectional recombinase FimE. A burst of low level expression of one recombinase is expected to invert the promoter flanked by the recombinase binding sites IRR and IRL, triggering a switch from strong expression of one to another set of proteins made downstream. Expression of the second recombinase is expected to revert the promoter to its original orientation, triggering the original set of protein expression.  The inversion will be sustained across cell divisions with little leaky protein expression and negligible performance degradation after repeated inversions. This is a heritable, binary memory system and can be used as a component in more complex systems.
Background
fimS or synthetic “flip” sequence
The process of fimbriation in Escherichia coli is regulated by the enzyme-catalyzed inversion of a segment of DNA, often labeled fimS, by a series of tyrosine recombinases of which FimE and FimB are the most known. In the absence of ATP or external prosthetic groups, the fim recombinases introduce strand breaks in repeating regions flanking the fimS regulatory sequence and physically reverse the sequence, activating or repressing the expression of fimbriation proteins based on the orientation of a contained promoter (McClain et al., 1991).
Inversion catalyzed by FimE was shown to be primarily unidirectional, inverting fimS from the “on” to “off” orientation in regards to fimbriae production. This stands in contrast to FimB, which is capable of inverting fimS bidirectionally, forming an equilibrium between “off” and “on” states.# An inducible genetic circuit was engineered by Ham et al., 2006 utilizing this property to produce tightly controllable, strong protein expression with relatively low basal expression and a unique mode of activation, requiring only “pulses” of inducer rather"

Results: oligos may not be good.
Run test using Taq enzymes
Tubes 1-8 of PCR screen performed on 8/18/10 were run with 4:30 extension time at ~27 cycles. Today taken out and placed back into PCR machine.  Ran another PCR screen program with 4:30 extension time for another 18 cycles.  Then ran on a 2% agarose gel with 100bp ladder and 2 log ladder.
Results: order new Taq?
Conclusion: no conclusion can be drawn.  The test gives very contradictory information.
Meanwhile, I746352-B0034, E1010-PSP, C0051-PSP, B0034-C0052 were ligated in attempts to investigate the leaky expression phenomena.
Initiator/las receiver progress: Successfully ligated R0082 with RBS-C0051-B0015 and I14015 with RBS-C0051-B0015.  We may have two complete parts because there were practically no colonies on the control plates.  Of course, it also depends on how our sequencing results go because we can’t PCR screen this until we figure out what’s wrong.

Modelling
Overview
The goal of the modelling component of our project was to find optimal pathway for maximizing production of PHB in E. coli. Furthermore, the model will be used to simulate the reactions that occur in the bacteria after it is transformed with our Constructs . After a detailed analysis and discussion with experts , the team decided to pursue flux balance analysis (FBA) and kinetic modelling.
Analysis of various modelling methods
The modelling subgroup carefully considered a number of possible modelling topics for our project. We looked into the pros and cons of each model. We also analyzed the usage of the models by previous iGEM teams and in literature. In order to decide a topic, we graded each of the models based on their impact on our project, integration with lab experiments, risks, and availability of resources. The following is a list of our analysis of each of the modelling topics considered:
Modelling Method: Flux balance analysis (FBA)
Questions addressed by model
Can use maximization of PHB production as an objective function and determine the optimal steady-state flux distribution, then compare to what we observe in the lab.
Can potentially compare PHB production between unmodified E. coli and E. coli after genetic modifications
Explore the capabilities and limitations of biochemical networks
Analysis of metabolic network robustness (Raman et al., 2009)
Analysis of Genome-scale metabolic models
Pros
Does not require kinetic parameters and can be computed fairly quickly for large networks (Orth et al., 2009).
Proof of concept that our genetic modifications maximize PHB production from human feces
Can compare model predictions (maximum theoretical yield) to experimental data and potentially troubleshoot the system.
Cons
The accuracy of the FBA prediction largely depends on the accurate definition of the metabolic network, the various constraints and definition of biologically relevant objective functions.
May not always be accurate because does not account for regulatory effects (activation of enzymes by protein kinases or regulation of gene expression)  (Orth et al"

Not Detectable
According to measurement with Qubit RNA HS, all samples regardless of treatment show all RNA being degraded including sample, where treatment is identical to the one used in the actual experiment.
2. The gel below in Figure 2 shows results of the digestion of RNA ladder with the available RNases, RNase H (line 5 and 6) and RNase Cocktail (line 7 and 8) or both (line 8 and 9).
From this experiment we can conclude that the buffer has no effect on digestion since sample in water and in reaction buffer appear the same. It can further be said that RNase Cocktail efficiently degrades the ladder, which is composed of ssRNA. RNase H seems to not digest the ladder at all.
This corresponds with described ability of RNase H to preferentially digest RNA:DNA hybrids.
Figure 2. Results after digestion with RNases.
3. The gel showed very significant carry over of RNA during the purification with AMPure beads (image not shown), which corresponds to manufacturer's information. If RNA was not properly digested, it would therefore be carried together with the cDNA during the entire library prep process.
Conclusion
Overall, the results of this troubleshooting procedure present results conflicting with result of the actual experiment. Here the RNases are shown to work very efficiently. Most likely, RNA used in troubleshooting has different properties that the RNA template in the cDNA synthesis (could be in a form of hybrid or some other unusual form) which leads to different digestion results.
Discussion
During the cDNA synthesis it was possible to achieve sufficiently high yields, usually exceeding double of the input mRNA amount. This cDNA was used to prepare sequencing libraries. As was shown later, it unfortunately contained undigested RNA, which significantly decrease the quality of sequencing results. We have therefore spend significant amount of time searching for the source of RNA contamination as reported in this section.
The experiments above show very contradicting results. In section i) it can be seen that treatment of cDNA with RNase Cocktail after synthesis resulted in complete clearance of RNA from the sample. RNase Cocktail has also been shown to digest RNA ladder as visualized on the gel in Figure 1.  The same enzyme has always been used during the cDNA synthesis procedure and it remains unclear why does it efficiently digest RNA after synthesis or RNA ladder and would not work during the actual synthesis.
One hypothesis that we considered was the presence of RNA:DNA hybrids, which would decrease efficiency of RNase Cocktail, which is more efficient in digesting ssDNA. RNase H was therefore added to address"

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Project-content_-_-_TEXT.html,"ative example for this might be a cow grazing on a meadow. For the vegetable components to be properly utilized, however, the cow needs a stomach completely different from the kind you find in other mammals like, for example, humans. Indeed, the stomach of ruminants consists of four components: rumen, reticulum and omasum are succeeded by the abomasum, and those four compartments work closely together in the digesting process. Thanks to this, the grazing cow is able to utilize cellulose to gain energy, which is not possible for most other mammals.
When a cow ingests food, it is swallowed without being chewed at first, passes through the reticulum and enters the rumen. Here, fermentation is carried out by microorganisms, which can take 20 to 50 hours. Next, small balls are formed from the processed food in the reticulum by muscle contractions, and these balls are regurgitated, chewed and mixed with saliva. The resulting food mush is then swallowed once again; this time, though, it does not enter the rumen after passing the reticulum, but is channelled into the omasum. Thus, the reticulum works as a kind of filter separating the unprocessed food of the first swallowing  from the processed mush of the second.
The importance of the rumen in digestion arises from the numerous microorganisms living in it. In fact, each gram of rumen contents contains about 1010 to 1011 bacteria belonging to 300-400 different species, resulting in a great variety of metabolic profiles. Most of these organisms are obligate anaerobes, meaning that they can only survive and grow in the absence of oxygen. However, a certain amount of oxygen entering the rumen with every swallow can hardly be prevented; thus, there are also a few facultative anaerobes present capable of consuming oxygen.
Among the billions of microorganisms in the rumen there are different groups specialized on degrading compounds like cellulose, starch, or lactate. The sugars set free by breaking down these substances are subsequently fermented. The size and structure of the rumen ensure that the food is properly mixed and that the microorganisms can work on it for a sufficiently long time. During this process different kinds of gases originate. The so-called volatile fatty acids (VFAs) like acetic, propionic, and butyric acid are particularly important for the animal, as they pass through the rumen wall into the bloodstream, serving as a main source of energy. Unfortunately, alongside the VFAs greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane"

Violacein Pigments
Background Design Characterisation
Background
Violacein Biosynthesis
The Violacein pigment is produced from L-tryptophan via a pathway involving five enzymes, VioA-E. This forms a purple colour which remains within the individual cell colonies. This synthesis pathway is shown below:
From P.R. August, T.H. Grossman, C. Minor, M.P. Draper, I.A. MacNeil, J.M. Pemberton, K.M. Call, d. Holt, and M. S. Osbourne, Sequence Analysis and Functional Characterization of the Violacein Biosynthetic Pathway from Chromobacterium violaceum, J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. (2000) 2(4): 513-519. [1]
The vioE is used in the step just after the vioB for the 1-2 shift of the indole ring. César Sánchez, Dr., Alfredo F. Braña, Prof. Dr., Carmen Méndez, Prof. Dr., José A. Salas, Prof. Dr. Reevaluation of the Violacein Biosynthetic Pathway and its Relationship to Indolocarbazole Biosynthesis [ [2] ]
Further, as module 5 is Aqua, expressing the genes under different promoters will allow us to produce at least two different colours. The Sanchez paper suggests that removing vioD can produce a dark blue, while removing vio C produces a dark green. Our actual results showed that the ABDE construct produced a dark green pigment while the ABCE produced light green.

MnP is used by this fungus to degrade lignin, a complex polymer found in woody plant tissue composed of aromatic rings with large quantities of alcohol and ether bonds.  The amide bonds broken in nylon degradation require a different mechanism than MnP lignin degradation, but purification and characterization of the nylon-degrading enzyme in tests by Deguchi et al. positively identified the enzyme as MnP, showing that MnP has a broad range of catalytic activity and may be able to degrade a variety of substances.14
Manganese Peroxidase enzyme with heme group and Mn2+ bound15
Nylon Hydrolase enzyme three dimensional structure17
The second enzyme used was Nylon Hydrolase (NylC), an enzyme from Arthrobacter sp. that has been shown to degrade oligomers of 6-aminohexanoate, the monomer for nylon-6.16  The enzyme was originally discovered in bacteria living in the wastewater from a nylon-6 factory and apparently directly evolved to break down nylon.  Both the Manganese Peroxidase and Nylon Hydrolase genes were paired with a secretion tag so that, when added to the PGA overproducing strain of E. coli, the cells will be ready to be tested in the bio-filter.  If effective, additional strains using existing BioBricks to degrade other plastic types could be created and added to the filter to make it chimera of cell lines enabling a wide range of microplastics to be degraded before entering the ecosystem.

Crystal Violet Assay
Overview:
A BioBrick of the nhaR gene in E.coli bacteria is   supposed to increase their biofilm formation. When   expressed, the nhaR gene acts as a transcriptional   regulator of the pga operon. The pga operon increases   cell-cell adhesion when expressed. This increased cell-cell   adhesion will increase the biofilm formation in the   bacteria. Therefore, the aim of the crystal violet assay   is to quantify the amount of biofilm produced by these   bacteria.
Mechanism of the assay: Crystal violet binds to   polysaccharides of the biofilm matrix. By measuring the   binding to adhering biofilm, the amount of biofilm produced   can be quantified. A stock solution of crystal violet is   incubated with the culture, the supernatant is removed,   bound crystal violet is mobilised with an acetic acid   solution and the absorption is determined. The absorption   values determine the amount of biofilm present in"
Imperial_College,2016,Team:Imperial College#GRO_-_-_TEXT.html," classification standard to demonstrate the diversity and full extent of the applications of our system. One of these sectors was financials and hence we ran a simulation to model a financial system of 3 separate banks. In this circuit we modelled 3 banks which all rely on one another either with the implementation of our circuit (figure 16) or via an auxotrophic system as a control (figure 17) to stabilise the populations. Within this auxotrophic system population A produces the required protein for population B which produces the required protein for population C which produces the required population for population A.
We programmed an event to occur at 180 minutes to simulate a single bank going bankrupt in both models. As can be seen from the graphs due to the orthogonality of the quorum sensing systems within our circuit the two surviving banks can still feed off of one another’s quorum output and they begin to stabilise into a one to one ratio. In the control circuit however without the third population or bank, population A can no longer survive and hence neither can population B and the system collapses.

Kyoto,2016,Team:Kyoto#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," handle can aid in swift removal of our biodevice by linking them to cellulose, as cellulose passes human intestine undigested.
To express these two handles in the outer membrane of E. coli, we enhanced a surface expression protein domain called INPNC, and used it as the anchor. By scanning electron microscopy, we observed the binding of E. coli expressing INPNC-His-scFv bound to NoV-like particles, which is the capsid proteins of NoV. By fluorescent microscopy, we have also observed the binding of cellulose and E. coli, which expressed INPNC-His-CBDcex to cellulose.
We demonstrated each of the Noro-catcher handles' functionality by physically binding them to NoVLP and cellulose. As shown by our project, creating a recombinant bacteria expressing combination of target-binding modules dramatically enhances each modules' potentials. This mechanism can be applied to removal system of other harmful agents, such as other pathogens, organic toxins, and heavy metals.
2 Introduction
2-1 Global burdens of NoV infection and progress of its countermeasures
Norovirus (NoV) causes inflammation of the stomach and/or intestines, which is called gastroenteritis. When infected with NoV, a person usually develops symptoms in 12 to 48 hours, and most will get better within 3 days [2][3]. However, when its symptoms worsen, it can lead to death. Its common symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and severe stomach pain. Fig1, 2 show the recent prevalence of NoV infection among the world.
The data for U.S. and U.K. seem relatively low (Fig1), but NoV cannot be ignored in those developed countries. As shown in Fig2, NoV remains a significant issue to overcome in both developed and developing countries.
Fig1 The yearly number of NoV patients per population of 100,000.
The data indicates more than 10 in 1 people of Africa are infected by NoV annually [4][5][6].
Fig2 The percentage of food poisoning caused by NoV amongst all food poisoning cases in U.S. and U.K.
Almost half of all food poisonings are caused by NoV in the two countries [5][6].
There already exist treatments and drugs to alleviate individual symptoms like vomiting and nausea. However, there are none to target NoV itself. As NoV's infection mechanisms and its cultivation condition was not known until recently, research on such methods has been significantly hindered [*1]. We therein resolved to devote our knowledge and skills"

After their comprehensive                                     consideration, they adopted our suggestion. Nevertheless, when team “SCU-WestChina” showed that they would measure the absolute strength of the constitutive promoter                                     family (including BBa_J23100, etc.) to meet the need for their modeling, we                                     suggested that they can try to measure it with RiboJ, a ribozyme which self cleaves,                                     removing the upstream region, most importantly the 5’ untranslated region. Because                                     according to 2016 William and Mary’s results, RiboJ can eliminate the effect of                                     different coding sequence on the gene expression dynamics, we thought it may                                     effectively improve the reliability of “SCU-WestChina”’s measurement and modeling.                                     And then, our advice was integrated with SCU-WestChina’s measurement. What’s more,                                     we were inspired by their modeling of constitutive promoter family to make our                                     modeling of enzyme kinetics by ourselves, in order to achieve more efficient                                     production of melatonin with reasonable formula of enzymes.

       At that time, we still had                                     3 alternative projects, one of which is about oral vaccine of rabies. After our                                     presentation of our three candidate projects, instructor of Team “TMMU-China”, a                                     professor with vast experience in immunology research, reminded us that such                                     immunology experiments are extremely time-consuming and the results of such                                     experiments usually are non-predictable, which may be exceedingly hard to finish the                                     project of oral vaccine rabies in no more than 3 months. Comparing this project to                                     our other two projects and considering his advice carefully, we gave up this project                                     and chose the project, “Rhythmic Production of Melatonin in E.coli”, ultimately.
      On the other hand, communication and                                     collaboration of iSWU was not only at the                                     meet-up, but also before and after the meeting.
      Before the iSWU meet-up, team “SiCAU-China”, a                                     new iGEM team, contacted with us for                                     some parts in 2016 DNA distribution to prepare for their preliminary experiments.                                     And we took those plasmids to them at the meetup. Caused by our carelessness, we put                                     the LUDOX in the -20 degrees centigrade as we did last year, leading to all of LUDOX                                     in 2017 kit precipitating. However, we wanted to participate in this year’s InterLab                                     study"

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Project#dsf_-_-_TEXT.html," production of each of the HA-tagged proteins. We transformed our plasmid series (encoding RpfC-HA, RpfC-HA + Clp-HA and RpfC-HA +Clp-HA + RpfG-HA) into E. coli strain MC1061 and blotted for recombinant protein production.
As shown in Fig 3, successful production of RpfC-HA (expected mass 81kDa), RpfG-HA (expected mass of 43kDa) and Clp-HA (expected mass 27kDa) was observed. We then went on to test our DSF detector by incubating E. coli producing the three HA-tagged proteins with increasing concentrations of pure DSF (obtained from Sigma) and monitoring for production of GFP from the manA promoter by Western blotting. As shown in Fig 4A, we were able to specifically detect GFP production in E. coli cells harbouring our DSF-detection plasmid. However we noted that GFP was being produced in the absence of exogenous DSF addition. We reasoned that this could be due to either: (i) the endogenous activation of the manA by an E. coli transcriptional regulator or (ii) the presence of DSF or a DSF-like compound in the cells and/or growth medium. To distinguish between these two possibilities we introduced pUniprom carrying the PmanA-gfp fusion alone (i.e. in the absence of the rpfC, rpfG and clp genes) into E. coli and blotted for GFP production. As shown in Fig 4B, GFP was produced by E. coli in the absence of the X. campestris DSF sensing proteins. We therefore conclude that the manA promoter is recognised by an E. coli transcription factor.
For the DSF sensing system to work we need to eliminate the background activation of PmanA-gfp. Since the X. campestris Clp protein is very similar to the E. coli cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) transcription factor (46% identity, 71% similarity over the whole length of the protein), we next tested whether the production of GFP was dependent upon CRP. To this end we used a cep deletion strain from the E. coli Keio mutant collection6 and compared GFP production in this strain background with the cognate wild type strain (Fig 5). However GFP was still produced (although possibly at a lower level) than in the cep+ background.

Objective Project Proposal Parts
OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this research project is to develop a novel mechanism of detecting and eradicating the carcinogenic pathogen, Helicobacter pylori, from its stomach dwelling microbiota. Escherichia coli will be engineered with a specific ArsR regulated promoter in order to detect a low pH environment, similar to the physiology of the human stomach. In response to low pH detection, the strain will produce the phenotypic response, production of yellow fluorescent protein. Once the promoter activity at different pH levels is quantified, the E. coli will be further engineered to produce an inhibitory 6mer peptide, identified previously in phage display studies to inhibit urease activity, a necessary extracellular enzyme produced by H. pylori in order to colonize the human stomach. The results of this project will provide the scientific community with a new potential approach of H. pylori bacteria therapy. This concept could further be extended as a possible treatment option for any pathogenic infection via engineered probiotics.
Back to Top
PROJECT PROPOSAL:
Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative bacterium, is classified as a class I carcinogen. An H. pylori infection causes gastric duodenal ulcers, gastric lymphoma, and chronic gastritis, which is a precursor to gastric carcinoma. H. pylori infects about half of the human population, with high prevalence in developing countries. H. pylori-induced gastric inflammation usually does not cause symptoms in the infected person, meaning the prevention of gastric ulcers is virtually impossible. The current method of treating an infection of H. pylori is with the use of antibiotics, including Protein Pump Inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole2. The rising complication with using antibiotics, however, is the propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria, as well as the eradication of predominantly beneficial gut bacteria. In the absence of antibiotic therapy, H. pylori can live in the stomach for decades, or even an entire lifetime. What is most notable about H. pylori is its ability to secrete products that are linked with its ability to evade the host's innate immune system1. There is a great need for a new approach of eliminating H. pylori from the body.
Urease is an extracellular enzyme, produced by H. pylori, which allows the microenvironment surrounding H. pylori"

Domain Shuffling - Indigoidine Conversions
This week we assemble 28 plasmids pRB23-ds1112 to pRB23-ds3132 , which are variants of indC, in which single domains are exchanged by the corresponding domains of plu2642 , a single module NRPS of unknown function from P. luminescens and tycC2 from the tyrocidine cluster. The A-domains of both modules were predicted to be specific for glutamine binding and activation using the NRPS Designer. We will assemble all the domain combinations listed below. The plasmid code consissts of pRB23-ds and a code with four numbers. Each number defines the origin of the domain at the respective positions: indC is ""1"", plu2642 is ""2"" and tycC2 is ""3"". ds1122 for example means that in the general sequence of A-OxA-T-TE the A and OxA domain come from indC, whereas the T and TE domain are the ones of plu2642.
The following table shows the fragments the pRB23-dsxxxx plasmids consist of:

LacticinQ does not inhibit P. aeruginosa in the tested range of concentrations. The hybrid LacticinQ-LacticinZ inhibits growth of all the tested strains with a MIC of 7.6 µg/mL against the S. aureus strains and a MIC corresponding to 15.2 µg/mL for P. aeruginosa (Figure 4). Moreover, LacticinQ-LacticinZ MIC values are lower compared to the MIC estimated for LacticinQ alone (22.2 µg/mL). This could be due to the presence of LacticinZ. However, LacticinZ is not tested as a single bacteriocin and a direct comparison cannot state a decrease in MIC for LacticinZ but only a decrease in MIC for LacticinQ. Two bacteriocins working in concert (a hybrid) seem to contribute to a decrease in MIC and thus a stronger effect, indicating synergy. It should thus be noted that the hybrid Laterosporulin-ThuricinS “looses” its effect towards P. aeruginosa, compared to their effect as single proteins.
In conclusion, we cloned and purified the bacteriocins. We tested the bacteriocins and showed that in some cases the hybrid bacteriocins are more effective then as single proteins. Most importantly we showed the bacteriocins inhibit growth of multi resistant strains most often present in open wounds.
Replicating MIC
The MIC plates were incubated for 28 hours with equal OD values for each bacterial strain i.e. equal amount of bacteria were added. For replicating the MIC test, the respective generation times of the bacterial strains tested should be considered. The generation times can diverge between the bacterial strains thus representing diverse conditions, which is reflected in the OD measured. Therefore, the OD values between the strains cannot be compared directly, but the MIC values can. Furthermore, instead of using duplicates, multiple replications could have been made for specification of the OD value. Thereby we could determine the OD value due to calculating a median, instead of calculating a mean value and thereby be able compare more OD values. In addition, by using duplicates, pipette errors cannot be neglected. A new MIC test could therefore be performed with multiplicates thus eliminating some of the stated"

⇒ The 3 of us from the Printing group underwent our protocol to test the blank slides sent to us from Mycroarray. (see  protocols for more details). We tested 3 different blank slides: one with DH5alpha cells, one blank, and one with cells and a dried milk ""blocking"" solution meant to keep the cells from sticking to the slide. After completing our protocol (adding a rinse with Tween 20 and multiple rinses of PBS), we studied the 3 different slides under a microscope and compared their similarities and differences.
⇒ The blank slide featured some spots that we think were dirt, as there were no cells in contact with this slide. The cell slide obviously had E Coli cells stuck to it of different shapes and sizes. The shapes were circular, like the dirt on the blank slide, but were definitely larger. The slide with the ""blocking"" solution was interesting in that it had very little attached to it; it succeeded in preventing cells from sticking to the glass. However, we did notice what must have been a piece of dried milk stuck to the slide. It looked different than anything else we saw underneath the microscope and seemed similar to a piece of muscle or the blood vessels in the lungs. We will remember that for the future if we use the blocking solution.

Short summary
The Human Ferritin Heavy Chain (HUHF) BBa_K2638999 was successfully cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli DH5 alpha. After protein purification HUHF was used to produce gold and silver nanoparticles which was ensured by examinations with the Transmission Electron  Microscope and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Thus, we improved BBa_K1189019 which is not able to form gold and silver nanoparticles.
The Calgary 2013 iGEM team used the human ferritin wildtype ( BBa_K1189019 ) as reporter protein for a test strip. They expressed the human ferritin heavy and light chain heterologous using Escherichia coli.  In the cells, the ferritin produced its characteristic iron core, which was colored with the help of fenton chemistry to produce the prussian blue iron complex. Beside the function as reporter, the team mentioned the capability of ferritin to produce nanoparticles from other metal ions.
Figure 1: Ferritin is suitable for metal recycling, since it can form e.g. iron, silver and gold nanoparticles in its cavity.
The capability of human ferritin to bind different metal ions and form nanoparticles makes it suitable for the recycling of different valuable metal ions (Ensign et al., 2004; Domínguez-Vera et al., 2007).  In addition, nanoparticles formed inside/by ferritin have advantages over nanoparticles produced by conventional methods. On the one hand the ferritin encapsulated nanoparticles are water soluble due to the protein shell. On the other hand the maximal inner diameter of ferritin of 8 nm causes a upper size restriction of the nanoparticles inside the ferritin (Butts et al., 2008). This restriction is desirable for various applications (Castro et al., 2014).

InterLab Study
Standardization and reproducibility are two integral parts of synthetic biology. The InterLab study aims to reduce the variability of measurements made between laboratories by providing standardized protocols and data analysis procedures. Our team participated in the 4th International InterLab Study and submitted our results for further analysis. A summary of our results is described below.
Experimental Design
The teams participating in the 2017 InterLab study was provided a range of different GFP expressing devices to test. The devices along with their constituent parts are shown in table 1.

Results
We successfully transformed cells with all the test devices shown in table 1, except test device 1 (BBa_J364000). The transformed cells were inoculated in liquid LB-CAM media overnight prior to testing. The plates were all analysed using a Cytation 5 plate reader (BioTek Instruments Inc.), and the plates used were all clear bottomed, white sided 96 well plates.
Calibration
The instrument used in the InterLab study was calibrated to adjust for measurement differences between plate readers from different laboratories. Furthermore, the calibration served to compensate for the light path not being 1 cm when measuring absorbance through a well plate. The calibration was done by loading the plate reader with a clear bottom 96 well plate containing wells with 100 uL LUDOX-S40 solution. The absorbance of the LUDOX-S40 was measured at 600 nm (A_600), and compared to the absorbance of a similar volume of dH2O. Based on the readings, a conversion factor of "

A proposal of the German iGEM Teams concerning Intellectual Property
During the meetup of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May also workshops took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where only upon a closer look it becomes clear that the rights are company–owned. The issue that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature ( Bryn Nelson ‘Synthetic Biology: Cultural Divide ’, Nature 509, 152–154, 08 May 2014 ) :
""[N]o one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify"
IISER_Pune,2015,Team:IISER Pune#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"asmids The QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA, USA) was used to extract genomic RNA of H7N9 virus from allantoic fluid of infected chicken eggs. The extracted RNA was subjected to reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) using Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche,Penzberg, Germany) to generate cDNA. The specific information about HA,NA,M1 genes are provided below:
The PCR segments were digested with specific enzymes and ligated with linearized pcDNA5/FRT vector. The nucleotide sequences of the HA-pcDNA5, NA-pcDNA5, and M1-pcDNA5 genes were confirmed by sequencing. 2.Transient Transfection of 293T Cells with H7N9 VLP Expression Plasmids 293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates with a density of 3×10^5 per well one day before transfection.Recombinant plasmids containing HA-pcDNA5, NA-pcDNA5, and M1-pcDNA5 were co-transfected to cells by X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche) following manufacturer’s instruction.48 h post-transfection, cells and supernatants were harvested for future use. 10 cm cell culture dishes were used for large-scale production of VLPs. 3.Western Blot Analysis Culture supernatants were harvested without concentration, then electrophoresed in NuPAGE 4%–12% Bis-Tris gradient gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare, Piscataway,NJ, USA). Membranes were blocked by 10% skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature (RT), and incubated with diluted H7N9 virus-specific mouse or human sera for another hour at RT. After intensive washing, the membranes were incubated with HRP- conjugated second antibodies, respectively. Protein bands were visualized by ECL plus Western blotting detection system kit (GE Healthcare). Radiographs were exposed, developed, and fixed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
As shown in Figure A, three bands with sizes of 75 kD, 68 kD, and 28 kD were confirmed by Western blot. It demonstrated that HA, NA, and M1 of VLPs were successfully expressed as expected. 4.Electron Microscope To further confirm the formation of self-assembled VLPs, the supernatant of transfected 293T cells was characterized"
ShanghaitechChina,2016,Team:ShanghaitechChina#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," The public questionnaire was implemented to be familiar with the general public attitudes. We carefully analyzed the data collected, and according to the main concerns and opinions we found through the data analysis, we then invited several experts from different walks of life to participate in the following theme interviews. Our interviewees included scientists working at the cutting-edge in the field, industrial representatives dedicating to the energy conservation, as well as from the administrative government. With their generous engagements, our team was able to further explore the project in a social context.
Click here to know more about our social research.
Questionnaire
A questionnaire about the energy issue was designed and then distributed online. In all, 37 questions were asked, and here, we performed the core analysis on the data we collected. We had eventually collected 231 samples, 15 of which were cancelled as invalid samples due to their short answering time (less than 180 seconds). The rest of 216 samples were regarded as valid responds that qualified for further analysis.

Interview
To deeply understand the energy issue from various aspects as well as further develop our system in the real social context, our team conducted a series of interviews with experts from all walks of life. Besides the general voices heard from the public, we discovered the opinions from the relevant industrial communit, the academic researchers and the administrative authority.
Our interviewees include the following:
Professor Qixi Mi from School of physical science and technology at ShanghaiTech University;
Researcher Fei Yu from CAS Key Laboratory of Low-Carbon Conversion Science and Engineering;

Team Collaboration
This year, our team actively collaborated with two iGEM teams in China, which are the team Tsinghua-A from Tsinghua University and the JSNU-China from Jiangsu Normal University. The team Tsinghua-A focused on constructing a synthetic biology circuit to seek insights into noise propagation as well as measuring the capacity of parallel information channels. Our team members, Lechen Qian and Haolong Zhu, helped them to gain access to a better home-built computation platform, applied their knowledge to modify and operate the algorithm, and scanned two key parameters, Ka (dimer association rate) and Kd (dimer dissociation rate constant) relevant to their modeling project in use of Gillespie Algorithm."

21/08/18 Freshers’ week @ TU/e
During the introduction week for new students, we got the opportunity to promote iGEM at a fair. We talked to new students from all kinds of disciplines about synthetic biology and the iGEM competition. The students were very curious to hear why we decided to spend our summer in the lab! We also introduced the new generation of scientists to our iGEM project and asked them whether they would wear a patch with bacteria on their skin. Interestingly, after sharing some information on the role of the bacteria in our design, they seemed to agree that they would wear the patch if we could ensure the safety of the patch.

When exposed to green light continuously on a shaker in liquid culture over 24 hours, GFP levels in the system increased. In the red light repressed GFP system, the red light repressed some GFP production after a few hours. However, the fluorescence increased dramatically in both dark and light systems after 12 hours, which implies that the red repressor may be leaky.  (Figure 2)
Figure 3: Normalized Mean Fluorescence as a Function of Light Intensity.
Figure 4: Normalized Mean Fluorescence as a function of amount of green light per minute (ms).
(Figure 3) In addition, we measured the effect of light intensity on induction levels. Above 20% intensity the resulting GFP fluorescence was consistent, but it dropped at or below 20%. 40% and above gave the maximum level of induction.
Figure 5: Native versus Biobrick systems over time.
(Figure 4) We tested different lengths of stopping the light between longer periods of light, with up to a second in darkness. Most of our tests in flashing light seemed to be inconclusive.
(Figure 5) We cloned CcaS, CcaR and sfGFP from pJT119b, and pPLPCB which contains the chromophore producing genes ho1 and pycA. These parts were then tested using the standard GFP output protocol against the verified light system plasmids. Green light induced expression of GFP over the dark control, confirming the functionality of these BioBrick plasmids. However, the growth rate was relatively slower than that of the control plasmids. We hypothesize that this difference is due to the use of different antibiotic resistance genes between plasmids.

Future Plans
The potential for the use of mobile devices to facilitate light-induced expression of proteins could have far reaching impacts for synthetic biologists, iGEM teams, for those hoping to conduct biological research with limited resources. Complex spatial patterning and even simple gradients of light intensity and color would likely be of great use to the synthetic biology community. Spatial control allows the induction of cellular patterns to simulate signalling gradients in tissue development and are useful in lithography and other pattern related technology.
E.Colight: Google Play
Expanding the development of our light-inducing app will give iGEM researchers the ability to express gene products and initiate circuits simply with light in varying intensities for a range of expression levels. The 96-well format allows for the testing of many different constructs at the same time, greatly"

Future plans
In this place we want to present you how we want to improve our BacInVader system in the future. We've spent hours working on the idea of the project and we've realized that it's impossible to make everything we wanted to include in the project. During the wet lab work we have found out that it is even really hard to finish all steps we wanted to include in the the core of the project (described in the Project part of this website). We know that to make our system fully functional we should ensure that it will target only defective (for example tumor) cells. For safety purposes we should also take full control of bacteria action inside the cell, in particular we should include some ""kill-switch"" device for error-proofing.  We also remember about our second idea of BacInvader functionality: conjugation with mitochondria. Further plan is also to move whole system to chassis better than popular E. coli - we think thatBacillus subtilis will be better for operating of BacInVader system.
Below we discuss some of our future plans in more details

Targeting the tumor cells via recognition the specific receptors on the cell surface
The specific delivery of drug molecule or larger particles like artificial liposomes, dendrimers or even whole bacterial cells  to tumor cells mainly relies on the potential of the associated vector to specifically head for the malignant center. This implies the identification of tumor markers which are appropriate target. One of the major strategy consists in targeting proteins that are highly specific or directly over-expressed on tumor cells. Nowadays,  the set of potentially interested ligands for the specifically targeted anticancer agents is"
Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#Light system_-_-_TEXT.html," the blue       light system, we tested  CHO cells and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T).       As reporter the gene seap was transfected together with the genes required for      the implementation of the blue and red light inducible systems.       A SEAP-assay was performed after illumination. Measuring SEAP concentrations in the       supernatant lead us two two important conclusions: First, the blue light system works       more efficient than the red light system; second, the blue light system works better       with HEK-293T cells than with CHO cells (Fig. 1).
The plasmids required for the implementation of the light inducible SEAP expression are:
Red light system:
pKM022: SV40_PhyB-VP16_IRES_TetR-PIF16
constitutive expression of PhyB-VP16 and TetR-PIF6
pKM006: tetO-CMVmin_SEAP

Figure 1: Comparison of the blue light system in CHO cells and in HEK-293T cells and            comparison to the red light system in CHO cells.
To test the efficiency of the light system, SEAP expression after illumination was determined.           The SEAP assay was performed 24 hours after light exposure. Labjournal
Figure 2: Efficiency of the blue light system using different time intervals of illumination.
To test the efficiency of the light system, SEAP expression after illumination was determined.           The SEAP assay was performed 24 hours after light exposure. Cells were incubated with           blue light for 1 hour, 2.5 hours and 5 hours. Labjournal
The blue light system is effective in activating the reporter SEAP which was introduced        into the cells before illumination by transfections. As we know       that the duration of illuminating the system with blue light (452 nm) is critical       for its efficiency, we tested various time intervals for illumination. Our results       indicate that five hours of illumination lead to the highest level of SEAP expression (Fig. 2).

New LegoRoboBrick, called MU (Movement Utility)
We will introduce another new LegoRoboBrick called MU which stands for Movement Utility. MU will be used to move 96 well plates and Petri Dishes to different pre-specified locations.
Single-Master-Multiple-Slave synchronization
We will need to extend our Master and Slave Synchronization Model to allow for 2 or 3 Slaves. We can define more messages, and will need to figure out a smart way to allow 2-way messaging between a Master and multiple Slaves
Support User Defined LegoRoboBricks
Version 2.0 is designed with User Collaboration in mind. With the single-master-multiple-slave synchronization, we will support user defined LegoRoboBricks. Users are encouraged to extend the functionality of their ‘bots’ by creating and sharing new LegoRoboBricks.
Support pipetting between individual tubes and 96-well plates
It is tedious to pipette restriction enzymes, ligase, DNA, water, and  buffer from individual tubes into a 96-well plate, so V2.0 would allow  for this possibility by allowing for specific tube holders in the chassis.
Support pipetting between two 96-well plates
Ideally an experimenter will be able to transfer DNA, etc. between  96-well plates.  If Plate A has Restriction Enzyme A, Plate B has  Restriction Enzyme B, Plate C has restriction enzyme buffer, Plate D has  water, and Plate E has DNA, all five components could be easily  transfered to a new plate to perform a high throughput restriction digest.
Support pipetting of 12 tips simultaneously
Currently there are only 4 pipette tips used in V1.0, so adding more  tips to make 12 total would allow for pipetting entire rows between  96-well plates and speed up the entire pipetting process.

About us
For the 2018 edition, it will be the third time when the UCLouvain participates, representing the only Belgian university to the competition! To meet the challenge, we decided to establish a great team compound of medical students, civil         engineers, bioengineers, biologists and IT specialists. Although we come from diverse faculties, we consider the differences of skills as a real added value and we have all something to say around the table. The responsibilities were         attributed according to our expertise and to our preferences.
During this adventure, we realized various enriching collaborations in particular a conference to the European Parliament including several other teams. Furthermore, to reach a bigger impact with our project, we were brought to meet various         leading players in particular in the field of resistance in antibiotics.
In a few words : “It is a great experience with great people”.

Community Brick (Communications Plan Plus Example)
This event we are planning will be more than just a lecture series, but it is meant to be so much more. It is an experience, a place of discussion and intellectual exchange and of learning. Those are some of the visions we have for this event.
By having key industry speakers do brief 20 minute lectures on topics such as: Clinical Trial Drug Development, Commercialization of Biomass and Energy Products and Entrepreneurial Barriers for Biotechnological Companies, we are hoping to bridge the level of discomfort scientists have when it comes to business. We want to encourage innovation amongst the highly technical individuals within our university and provide an open forum of educational resources for them to gain knowledge.
Currently, UW iGEM has a core team of members working on this initiative and we are hoping to implement the BioTalks event in March 2013. We have completed our communications plan, gathered 3 speakers from the Pharmaceutical, Agricultural and Renewable Energy sectors and have separated the organizational team into three components: Director and Lead of Social Media Marketing (Ekta Bibra), Internal Communications and Logistics Lead (Anjali Arya) and Vision and Strategy  Lead (Angela Biskupovic). Now we are working on meeting the appropriate potential sponsors and advisors.
The creation of a communications plan is very helpful in creating clear-cut objectives and values, giving your team an over-arching mission and have stakeholders who you are proposing this event to understand exactly what you are trying to do. We have created a Community Brick that demonstrates a template for writing a Communications Plan as well as our BioTalks example that we are currently proposing to"
