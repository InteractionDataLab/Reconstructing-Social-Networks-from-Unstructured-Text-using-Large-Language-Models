SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html,"igation method is the most efficient way of constructing library.
(1). 62ng, 4906bp plasmid → 1.232x1010 copies
(2). Efficiency= \frac{(1772-330)\times 20 \div 5}{1.232 \times 10^10 \times \frac{1}{14586}}\times 100\% = 0.68\%
We needed to consider their effect on CHO-k1 cell if being directly transfected without transformation and plasmid construction. Since the ligation efficiency was 0.68%, we did an experiment comparing the survival rate of CHO-k1 cells after being transfected with linear DNA and circular DNA. After antibiotic screening, we luckily found that the former one were almost dead, while the latter one were good. Thus we could directly transfect the ligation products into cell without transformation, preventing the mutation library from decreasing.

7. Cell screening for audiogenetics test
1. Transfect the cells with loxp gene, pNFAT+GFP gene, R-GECO gene (calcium indicator) by PiggyBac system and sort them into single colonies by FACS (BD FACSAria)
Fig.16 The R-GECO and GFP fluorescence of wild type cells and cells transfecd with loxp site, pNFAT+GFP gene and R-GECO gene
The data was collected in the process of sorting by FACS, total cells count is 10000. Cells transfected with R-GECO gene will continually express R-GECO, because CAG promoter is a constitutive promoter. Thus, most cells have red fluorescence (Fig16. b) compare with wild type control (Fig16. a). Cells transfected with pNFAT+GFP should not express GFP because promoter NFAT need to be activated by calcium signal indirectly. However, most cells still can express GFP (Fig.16 d) compare with wild type control (Fig.16 c), which mean there is some leaky expression of promoter NFAT or background calcium activity.
2. Select the single cell colony only with one copy number of loxp by qPCR
To evaluate the efficiency of each mutated channels, single cell colony with only one copy number is required when testing, so we designed the following experiments to achieve it.

FAU_Erlangen,2016,Team:FAU Erlangen#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the concentrated yet fascinated happy faces! During our next visit to the CJT high school in October, we invited students and their families to a public discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of the diverse applications of genetic engineering.
Science Day
Genetic engineering suffers from a bad reputation these days. Almost everyone has certain worries about this issue. Many negative critiques concerning genetic engineering are based on envisioned devastating effects in the future, such as environmental destruction due to a) monocultural farming and dubious actions by corporations like Monsanto and b) genomic impairment of genetically modified plants. Thinking about cloning techniques – especially since the first cloned animal, the sheep Dolly - and especially so-called designer babies tends to give people goose bumps.
Then why is it still a topic if even thinking about it is reprehensible? Why don’t we just shut down any and all research on it?  The answer is: Genetic engineering actually is not as scary as it is made out to be. If you want to search for positive effects, you may have to rummage through a ton of negative media and pseudo-scientific articles. However, your persistence will pay off, because there is indeed a lot of promising research out there that both humanity as a whole and the environment can benefit from.
Dolly the Clone Sheep and GM Vegetables
LAUF - Within the scope of the project “Science meets School”, the Christoph-Jacob-Treu high school invites everyone to a public discourse at the school cafeteria today, October 6th, at 7.30 p.m. The iGEM Team of the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg is giving a talk about genetic engineering. The students deliver an infotainment lecture about the advantages and risks of genetic engineering. The sheep Dolly combined with genetically modified vegetables results in an exciting mix with an indeterminate outcome, as the speakers promise. Everyone interested is welcome, admission is free.
To overcome some of the worries regarding this topic, we wanted to highlight the positive aspects to a public audience. Hence, we gave a lecture in a high school after inviting everyone affiliated with the school and the people living nearby by printing an article in the local newspaper. To make it especially appealing, we combined the two most extreme and commonly known aspects of genetic engineering in the lecture’s title: “Genetic Engineering – Between saving the world and Jurassic Park”.
Starting the evening with the most exaggerated fear concerning genetic engineering – dinosaurs being revived and reconquering the world – we first showed a few scenes from the “Jurassic World” movie trailer. To give this frightening side a counterpart, we presented the real methods and applications"

After reading and analyzing the two replies, we listed three questions below :
 
1. Why not just ingest sugar directly instead of complexing the solution by creating Genetically Modified bacteria? 
 
2. What if people won’t absorb any sugar they eat? Does that mean we can have sugar as much as we want? 
 
3. if the quantity of consuming sugar is uncontrollably rising, won’t it cause any sugarcane-farmer exploitations?

Visit to Chung Mei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
Introduction
Chung Mei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has a long history in medical production and marketing. Established in 1926, Chung Mei provides several medical drugs for patients or sub-healthy people. Ｍore specifically, its services includes a wide range of over-the-counter medicines and consumer healthcare products.
Motivation
During our last time’s meet-up with Doctor Zhu in (FIRDI), we discussed our design of modeling with him . However, the main research in FIRDI is about upstream technology and he is not proficient in the design of products, so he suggested that we may get what we need from medicine producers. With contacts and preparations, we successfully paid a visit to the CEO Lin and the manager in Chung Mei.
Highlights
We should choose the lactobacillus which is low colonization rate, thus we do not need to add suicide circuit to our lactobacillus. 
It is important that choosing the good food additions for lactobacillus.
We need to make sure that our product is acid proof but will melt in our  intestine.
Conclusion
After having discussion with the CHUNG  MEI’s CEO Mr. Lin, we thought that is too hard to model our product. Therefore, we will not temporally take modeling into consideration. Furthermore, they also gave us some useful ideas. we can choose the low colonization rate lactobacillus and every kind of bacterium likes different parts of intestine, so we have to focus on whether our lactobacillus grow up at the front part of the intestine. To sum up, we can sure that our lactobacillus can absorb the maximum amount of sugar.
Market Analysis

Voting on ethical scenarios
We introduced topical synthetic biology ethical issues in the form of for or against statements for the public to vote on.
These included:
Synthetic biology should be used in medicine even when existing treatment already exists
There should not be a distinct line between artificial intelligence and life
It is never justifiable to release synthetic genetically modified organisms be released into the environment
Everyone should have access to the tools to genetically modify organisms
Synthetic biology companies are justified in creating patents for their discoveries
Cell free systems should be classified as living systems
All synthetic biology systems should be designed with a real world problem in mind
All products involving or containing genetically modified organisms should be extensively labelled
Synthetic biology is accurately portrayed by the media
Some people were initially reluctant to vote, or undecided on a vote, facilitating debate around the issues. Our most successful question garnered over 200 responses. This strengthened our opinion that education is necessary for developing opinions on synthetic biology, and having reasoned discussions around the subject.

Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in pur"

Results
The resulting time-history of the concentration of Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP), the target protein in this case, when sRNA gene-silencing is introduced is displayed in the figure below. As can be seen from the graph, the target protein exhibits an exponential decay until it reaches an almost negligible steady state. The approximate time it takes to do this is on the order of 18 hours, which is an artefact of the half life of the protein. The small RNA and Hfq in the cell effectively destroy YFP’s mRNA, turning off expression, forcing the protein concentration dynamics to be mostly governed by the decay.
The response of YFP concentration when sRNA is activated at time 0. After approximately 18hours, there is a 99.8% silencing of protein.
In using Equation 6 to construct a surface relating sRNA and Hfq transcription to the steady state concentration of target mRNA, we generate the surface pictured in the figure below.
The figure above seems to indicate, qualitatively, that the steady state concentration of target mRNA is much more sensitive to changes in Hfq expression than sRNA expression. To explore this relationship, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the model to each of the parameters.
Metabolic Control Analysis
Since a major purpose of this model was to elucidate potential avenues for silencing a target protein, our Metabolic Control Analysis focused primarily on how the parameters of the model and affect the steady state concentration of the target protein (in"

DNA-Based System Models
Introduction
We created a kinetic model to simulate the dynamics of our cell free DNA-based system and to inform the design process. Using this model, we made changes to our original design, most notably the addition of an amplification step to increase anticoagulant production. We modelled the system mechanistically to make it as accurate as possible, using mass action kinetics and Michaelis-Menten kinetics to model the reactions. The goal of this model was to answer the following questions:
How fast is hirudin produced?
Difference between producing hirudin directly and producing TEV protease to cleave inactivated hirudin?
How does the promoter and RBS affect the rate of hirudin production?
How does stochasticity affect our kit?
Methodology
To model the biochemical reactions, we formulated a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are solved in MATLAB.
The Cell-free DNA system is modelled mechanistically by using dissociation constants found in literature for TetR-TetO binding and RNAP-pTet binding. TetR dimerisation is modelled to introduce TetR monomers that may act to competitively inhibit Cruzipain in cleaving the TetR dimer. Furthermore, ribosomes are modelled to decay over time in the cell-free extract to saturate protein expression at around 2-3h. Because only dissociation constants are obtained, certain rate constants are estimated from the equilibrium constants.
The following parameters were used:

Team IISc-Bangalore: A Machine Learning Algorithm for Cell Counting
Team IISc worked towards developing a machine learning algorithm to count cells in a hemocytometer.
The objective of the collaboration was to provide the IISc Team with  sufficient data on the growth curve characteristics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to enable them to train their machine learning algorithm. Optical Density(OD) measurements to monitor the growth curve becomes unreliable due to the large sizes of yeast cells (which distorts the linear correlation between OD and biomass), it was necessary to measure the cell count of yeast cultures. Haemocytometry is the most common method used to monitor the growth rate and biomass of yeast cultures. This process is very time-consuming and involves tedious labour in counting cells for each measurement. Our team performed two growth curves each spanning 16 hours and the images were generated which were to be used by their algorithm to analyze. Using Haemocytometry, a manual cell count of the yeast cell samples at each timepoint was performed and this data along with their corresponding images were submitted.

Fudan_China,2017,Team:Fudan China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," contains three parts: logic gates, sequential memory structures and basic orthogonal memory modules. The logic gates sense two signals. One is the signal we want to record, called Target. The other is the signal used to provide the circuit with information about time, called Clock. Actually, Clock signal can be any signal, such as sunlight and other commonly-used inducers, as long as it can oscillate automatically or artificially.The logic gates process the given signal and transform it into one of the three basic output patterns listed in the table above, making the signal ‘sensible’.The sequential memory structures sense these output patterns to determine whether to trigger recording and in which order the recording action happens. In each time period determined by the Clock signal, different orthogonal integrases are adopted to write the information directly on DNA at specific sites. We can investigate these sites on DNA to get the information of the inducer in various past time periods.
Thus, by arranging the results in the right time order, we can finally know how the signal changes with time.

Public Engagement & Education
Synthetic biology and the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition is incredible. We seize every opportunity to promote synthetic biology and our projects. In the two years since our team was founded (our team was established in 2016), we have hosted so many events such as open days, talks and booth display to engage the public in our work, iGEM and synthetic biology.
Next we will divide into two parts: Public Engagement and Education to showcase our work.
Public Engagement
Laboratory Open days
The Lab Open Day is a traditional activity of our school. In the lab open days of 2017 and 2018, we opened our iGEM-specific laboratory. There we talked with high school students, college students, teachers, parents (...) who explained what iGEM is and what is synthetic biology. In addition, we also show what our project is trying to achieve, and its practical application and show our work in the lab. Many of the people we have contacted are very interested in our projects, iGEM, and synthetic biology. We have also left our contact information and some of them have a deeper discussion. We like to raise and answer questions with the public. Sharing our projects in this way is a very rewarding experience.
Graffiti Wall
In order to promote our project, we have drawn our graffiti wall in the culvert of a person coming and going. Dedicated to our wonderful vision of our project, this art work creates an oasis in the desert with the words “Painting the Desert”.In order to better publicize our project and let people who come and go know us better, we also attached our social media - the QR code of the public number.
Our PI Professor Wang also participated in our drawing activities. Although it took two days to adjust the patterns and colors, we all liked it. I hope that we can let more and more people pay attention to us and understand us in this wonderful way.

Alexia Vidal (INSA)
Undergraduate student in Biochemistry and Biotechnology at INSA Lyon, I provided support for the 2013 European Jamboree organization. This experience has really motivated me to participate at the 2014 iGEM adventure! I’ve loved working this summer with our bacteria but especially with all the INSA Lyon team members. Moreover, I’ve been in charge of the project budget management. Outside the school, I enjoy scuba-diving, playing the flute in a harmony orchestra, running, playing golf, going out with friends and travelling. I look forward to meeting you all in Boston!
Romain Tching Chi Yen (INSA)
Now fourth year student in modelisation and bio-computing, I'm the waffle master of the team. Though not the most efficient, I'm dedicated to my work and spent and incredible summer with everyone working on this project. My contribution to the team was mainly with the mathematical model (no, I swear I'm nice, don't run away!) and human practice work, but I also helped in the wetlab for the clonig period, as well as whenever help was needed, be it for an experiment, making solutions, washing instruments, filling pipette tips boxes, etc. I could do everything. Kind of like a super hero... Yes, you may refer to me as WaffleMan!

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Project#Physcomitrella_-_-_TEXT.html," Comparing work flow for E. coli, S. cerevisiae and P. patens
In conclusion, it naturally takes a bit more time to work with a plant in comparison to bacteria or yeast (see figure 6), but the advantages definitely outweigh the time factor and if teams start early enough, it is perfectly possible to work with P. patens as a chassis in an iGEM project!
This is a brief summary of the most important techniques in working with P. patens. For a full description of these methods please see our methods page .
BioBricks for protein expression in Physcomitrella
Figure 7: Our transformation vector
To transform the moss, we created an all-purpose backbone into which all our constructs could be integrated easily. Therefore we modified the common iGEM pSB1C3 plasmid with the following plant-specific components:
pAct5 (Actin 5 promoter from Physcomitrella patens): for strong protein expression.
miniMCS: This miniature multiple cloning site contains restriction sites for the enzymes MfeI and SbfI which allows you to insert BioBrick between two other Biobricks (in our case: pAct5 and t35S_npt-cassette) as a result of the compability of MfeI with EcoRI and SbfI with PstI.
t35S (35S terminator): This terminator originates from the 35S transcript of the cauliflower mosaic virus.
nptII-cassette: This selection cassette contains the neomycon phosphotransferase II gene, encoding the enzyme aminoglycoside-3'-phosphotransferase (NPTII), which inactivates a range of aminoglycoside antibiotics such as Kanamycin, Neomycin and Geneticin (G418) by phosphorylation. The latter antibiotic is used as selective agent for transformed P. patens plants, inhibiting the growth of untransformed plants very effectively. The neomycon phosphotransferase II gene is under control of the NOS promoter and terminator.

Why this project?
Escherichia coli, which is by far the greatest model for iGEM projects, is a gram-negative bacterium. Because of that, the expression of some proteins, which came from gram-positive bacteria, is sometimes hard to achieve in E. coli. Even if we managed to express proteins from gram-positive bacteria in a gram-negative model, the proteins could for example have different localization in the cell and behave differently from how they did in the original cell they came from.
Bacillus subtilis is a great model of gram-positive bacteria; it was also used by some iGEM teams in previous years. We were curious, why only a few teams used that model. When we began searching partsregistry for some BioBricks especially for Bacillus subtilis, we realized that there is only a very limited number of them. It could be the reason why this model isn't so popular, but it is also the reason why we found working with Bacillus subtilis so interesting and at the same time so daring and challenging.
Of course, we wanted to make a functional project, but we also thought that it is a great challenge to work with another model than E. coli. We truly believed, that making some new BioBricks for Bacillus subtilis, even such basic ones like promoters and rbs, is important because it would help the iGEM community to work with this great model of gram-positive bacteria in the future.
Our goal this year was to create a bacteria strain which could carry certain genes into eucaryotic cells. For safety reasons, and also to keep the work more coherent, we divided our task into two separate steps:
The first one was creating an 'invasive' Bacillus subtilis strain. B. subtilis is a non-pathogenic bacteria living peacefully in the soil. However, there are many bacteria species that have the ability to invade animal as well as human cells. We had an idea to create a plasmid for B. subtilis carrying listerolysin gene as to enable the bacteria to enter the eucaryotic cells just as Listeria monocytogenes from which the"

From pictures taken under the electron microscope(Fig.18), we could see tublin (treated with 1 μM                     taxol) in aggregated form obviously, indicating we have achieved the aggregation process in                         vitro. However, due to the high concentration of our extracted sample, it was hard to tell                     the aggregated length and the quantity of microtubules. Thus we tried to use spectrophotometer to                     measure OD350 of our experimental samples.

From the results shown in table 2, we found that there was no obvious relationship between OD                     statistics and taxol concentration. The reason may be the machine issue. Due to the wave length for                     measuring OD is 350nm, which is between the ultraviolet light and"

Slovenia,2016,Team:Slovenia#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," want cells to respond to our commands as fast as possible, because sometimes we can’t                             wait an hour before the cells produce the medicine and release it. That is why we gave cells                             a novel mechanism of processing information.                             We achieved this by combining several enzymes that recognize very specific parts of proteins                             and cut them, which changes their function. This allowed us to combine different signals,                             like sound, touch, light or chemicals, to obtain the desired cell response. The new enzymes                             can also cut the anchor with which medicines are attached to cells after the cells make                             them. Among many possible uses of our inventions, we can imagine activating cells in the                             brain by ultrasound, which means that we don’t need to use                             surgery to help people with Parkinson’s disease, or can trigger fast production of insulin                             in the body, to help people with diabetes.

A set of four different orthogonal site-specific proteases was designed and tested                                     as split proteins with induced reconstitution in mammalian cells
New orthogonal protease-based signaling pathways were designed as an information      processing platform                                    and several logic functions based on the combination of multiple input                                     signals were tested experimentally
Proteolysis of ER retention signal was introduced as the trigger for the fast                                     release of proteins from cells aimed to enable fast therapeutic responses such as                                     required for the release of peptide hormones, neuroactive peptides etc.

Stability analysis
Although we have done sensitivity analyses on some predominant parameters and acquired fabulous results, these analyses were all based on unary composites, holding only a single subject. We are not content with only doing sensitivity analyses, which merely care about single-in-single-out outcomes but not considering binary relation in systematic concept. So we made a bifurcation analysis on binary parameter (u,m) adopting the same method as what we have done in part 2.
Table 3 critical points (u,m) for oscillation
Depicting those points into an axis, we got the bifurcation line, which indicates the parameters’ value range when our system can oscillate stably is in the area marked by ‘bistable’ as follows.
Figure 14 Bifurcation analysis on (u,m)
Feedback analysis
By changing parameters a and b, which is equivalent to varying types of feedback introduced, we got simulation results as follows (In order to manifest more clearly, the parameter v was set larger, thus each cell’s feedback effect would put greater influence on the whole system).
Figure 15 System with feedback
The analysis shows that only with a negative feedback mechanism could the overall system be working as an oscillator. When a=b=0, the system contains no artificial negative feedback, but there may be some inherent negative feedback within the system.

The left three columns represent strains that were not inducted by IPTG, and from left to right is protein expression in whole cell, cytosol, or inclusive body. The fourth column is the protein marker. The right three columns represent strains that were induced by 10^-3 M IPTG for 30 hours under 18℃. Note that there is a significant band in columns representing the induced strains as indicated by arrows, and the result shows that the T3 polymerase was mainly expressed in the cytosol.
Figure 4: The strength of different T3 promoters under the same expression level of T3 polymerase. BBa_E0240 was combined with 11 T3 promoters from the genome of T3 phage. The x axis denotes strains that only differ in the T3 promoter strength, in accordance with the order from strong to weak. The Y axis denotes the GFP intensity normalized by OD600. We can see that these T3 promoters can be divided into 3 subgroups: weak, medium and strong. (You can find more details about the promoter intensity characterization on the Experience Page)
Following is the key to the partsregistry number of each T3 promoter we characterized and their primary names in T3 phage genome.

Notice:  phi13 has the same sequence with phi6.5.
It should be also noticed that as T3 RNA polymerase has dramatically high template affinity, even a little leakage expression of T3 polymerase might cause a significant basal level at T3 promoter. Therefore, when T3 polymerase is exploited in genetic circuit, its expression must be tightly controlled to reduce the basal level.

Part STAR
STAR is the product of input node, and will activate the expression of output node. Then equation (2') and (3) can be rewritten.
$$ \frac{dSTAR}{dt}=C_{LuxAHL}\cdot \frac{LuxAHL}{k_{LuxAHL}+LuxAHL}-d_{STAR}\cdot STAR \ \ \ (2'') $$

Hi, I'm Zhen Wang, I mainly work on MoDeL and Database of iGAME. As a member of Lixin He's research group, I focus mainly on calculation of quantum information, quantum correlation and entanglement.
You might have noticed that my address is same as Liao's. Yes, we are from the same Research Group, and the same department, too. It will be boring if I repeat all the information again, so I am going to write some experience of myself participating iGEM2010.
As a student majoring physics, it is hard for me to believe that I can participate in a biology project. Luckily, to my great surprise, these two areas are not so far apart. Modeling and analyzing skills of physics can also be used in biology, and dry project always means a lot of coding task, I can handle that, too. Of course, there is plenty of biology I need to learn, but with the help of our instructor and wet team members, I learn it fast. So I want to tell everyone that there's no limit in iGEM, join in and unleash your power!

Email: jkdirac@mail.ustc.edu.cn
I am Kun Jiang, the cheif software developer in iGem 2010 USTC_Software team, responsible for designing the global architecture of our software and  developing the ODE Solver module, Berkley database interface module and several simple tools for teammates.
It is my second year of studying in computer applied technology lab of Institute of Plasma Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences as a master candidate. I am interesting in software engineering and Computer Sicence.  Last year I noticed the recruit advertisement of iGem 2010 USTC_Software team in school BBS website. I make the decision to apply immediately. It's really happy for me during those past server months working with our team.
I play Ping Pong most during my spare time, because Ping Pong is a sport emphasizes on speed, skill and acting harmony ability rather than brute force. And I go jogging every day, which i think is a good way to relieve  pressure and keep me in health!
I want to be a brilliant software engineer developing some brilliant works. I gain strong knowledge in software engineering and computer algorithms. IGEM 2010 is one step to my ambitions, it is a important project but not the last project of my engineering life"

Specifically, the 9th, 10th, and 20th strains had plaques on their lawns and no plaques on the non-H2O2 control.  Numbers 9 and 10 are bacterial progeny of TT9901, and number 20 descends from TT9907.  Since we’ve frozen these down, we now can return to source strains that reliably contain bacteriophage lambda that is inducible to lysis!

We continued the purification of our phage.  We centrifuged both lysates at 5500 rpm (5,000 g) for 10 min at 4C We next added an equal volume of chloroform to both tubes and let them sit for about a minute. Again we centrifuged the lysates at 5500 rpm for 15 min at 4C and removed the supernatant.
5/20/13
Today we tested to see if our phage that we purified were viable.  To do this we ran a titer.  We took 2x top agar and added LB to create a 1x top agar solution.  We then added 4.5 mL top agar to .5 mL bacteria (W3110 and BL21) and spread that on the plate.  We also performed a dilution series on our phage.  We added 90 microL LB to 6 different tubes for each phage.  Then we added 10 microL of each phage to the first tube and diluted it down to -5.  We then spotted 2 microL of each tube on the plates (T4 on the W3110 and T7 on the BL21) and left them in the 37C incubator overnight.
Results:
Our W3310 plate showed no phage plaques at all and showed signs of possible contamination.
Our BL21 plate showed phage plaques, but they smeared so it was not possible to differentiate between the concentrations

Stationary Shewanella MR-1 in LB was washed and transferred to M9 aerobic medium at time zero. At time t = 30h, M9 medium was renewed. The drop of OD600 is likely due to the loss of cell during medium replacement. Similar to figure 2, the OD600 stayed at 1.79-1.84 with slight fluctuation. While no significant cell growth was observed again, the OD600 sustained for 24 hours after shifting to anaerobic condition when 20mM lactate was added.

The MFC was constructed as described in Notebook. As a fast and convenient method, we scaled down the microbial fuel cell in the experimental set-up as shown in figure 4. We constructed it with eppendorfs, which are easily obtained from the laboratory while less reagents and materials are required. It was sealed with epoxy and paraffin to prevent liquid leakage and provide anaerobic condition.
Inspired by Bielefeld 2013 iGEM Team, we also attempted to use 3D-printing to make our MFC prototype as our product. For convenient, our prototypes as shown in figure 5 and 6 are designed to print as a whole such that no assembly of individual component is required.

The control has the same construction as the sample except no cells were added. 20mM lactate was added as carbon source. Despite the fluctuation shown from time 20 to 35 minutes of three individual trials, the MFC potential increases over time and reach the similar plateau. Besides, the curves of three trials are significantly higher than the control curve, while the control is staying at the low voltage over the whole experimental period. We could conclude that the difference between the control and MFC curves is most likely due to the exogenic properties of the Shewanella and the increase of voltage could be attributed to the growth of the Shewanella in the MFC.

Groningen,2017,Team:Groningen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the samples without the pBad vector. For dCas9VRER we showed CRISPR interference in combination with gRNA's 1,2, and 4.
From the data we cannot conclude that the VRER mutations had any effect on the PAM preference since dCas9VRER shows the strongest repression for gRNA 1 and 4 of which one has a NGG flanked target. Also, gRNA 3 whose target is flanked by NGCG seems to be repressed by dCas9 and not by dCas9 VRER. If these results are correct this would suggest that the PAM preference has not changed for dCas9VRER, however, it is quite odd that the differences between dCas9 and dCas9VRER are so big for especially gRNA 1 and gRNA4. Another explanation could be that we mixed up gRNA1 and gRNA3 in one of the steps from gBlock to double transformants. If we would switch around these data (so gRNA1-> gRNA3 and gRNA3-> gRNA1) the data would show that only dCas9VRER can be directed towards NGCG flanked targets. Unfortunately, we could not analyze the sequences of the pSB3C5 plasmids of the cultures used in this experiment before the WIKI-freeze.
Considerations for replicating the experiments
Besides sequencing the cultures used in the experiment, performing more experiments with biological replicates would increase the fidelity of the data. Also, it would be nice to design more efficient gRNA's that bind between the -35 and -10 region of the promoter. This way we can compare the efficiency of dCas9 and dCas9VRER, since this is the optimal place to target a gRNA.
CRISPR arrays
Construction
The construction of these parts all succeeded in terms of biobrick formation. As planned, the array itself was implemented into the backbone, after which the individual spacers were implemented to create the different derivatives of the array. The 20 and 21 derivatives were to be found correct after the first sequencing analysis. However, a second round of cloning was required to obtain the empty derivative of the CRISPR array.
Future plans for the project
These different derivatives create a situation in which this system can be used to detect the specific spacers but also re-instate the ""normal"" system by having the empty array. This allows for using the system to obtain new spacers. However, without pre-programming the reporter with complementary spacers, there won't be a change in"

NAWI_Graz,2018,Team:NAWI Graz#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," pay would result in less productivity per worker (because currently they have to work so many unpaid overtime hours or get help by their families in order to meet the targets) [29].  Hence, more workers would have to be employed. A campaign against pesticides would also result in more jobs, as the alternative is manual labour (grass cutting, weeding, mulching). The more environmentally friendly solution is therefore also better for the workers.
Based on the conclusion of the University of Manchester iGEM Team 2013 , the purpose for our project as we envision, is not to completely replace natural palm kernel oil (as this would threaten the existence of millions of people) but rather supplement it and make further deforestation obsolete. In this scenario, people who are currently working in the palm (kernel) oil industry wouldn’t lose their existing jobs. With measures taken as suggested in “Workers of the Palm Oil Industry”, the working conditions of these people could improve and at the same time even more people could be employed at the already available plantations. This way, the negative consequences of the development of a synthetic palm kernel oil alternative can be minimized.
CONCLUSION
This essay gives an insight into the current economic, environmental and ethical situation in the palm oil industry and the possible impact of a biosynthetic palm kernel oil alternative. It is important for us to consider as much consequences as possible to know the full impact, because we take responsibility for our project.
As previously stated, our project is able to have positive and negative impacts on the economy of palm oil producing countries. On the one hand a biosynthetic product may have positive effects on the price, but on the other hand some countries like Indonesia and Malaysia are dependent on their large palm oil industry.
Nature suffers enormously under the current palm (kernel) oil industry as it leads to deforestation, release of greenhouse gases, water pollution and habitat loss for endangered species. A palm kernel oil alternative could make further deforestation obsolete and therefore save tropical rainforests and therefore be more environmentally friendly.
As this industry is such a big factor in these countries’ economy, the launch of a palm kernel oil alternative might threaten the existence of millions of people who are currently working there. However, there also exists a big problem regarding labour exploitation. The best way to tackle these issues is to support local resistance/activist groups, because in this case, working conditions could improve and even more jobs could be created and the negative impact of our project could be minimized.
We support the suggestion of the University of Manchester iGEM Team 2013 , to supplement natural palm (kernel) oil rather than to substitute"

NJU-China,2016,Team:NJU-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," three aspects: RNA-loading, targeting and safety.
Moreover, exosomes can be endowed with the ability of targeting specific disease site through genetic modification of donor cells. In order to obtain exosomes with tumor-targeting ability, we redesigned natural exosomes by installing a tumor-targeting short peptide onto their surface. We chose iRGD, a tumor-penetrating peptide. Some studies have shown that iRGD homes to tumors by strictly binding to αν integrins which are specifically expressed on tumor cells and the endothelium of tumor vessels [6]. Meanwhile, iRGD peptide also own the ability of penetrating tumor tissue against interstitial pressure [7]. When combined with a drug, iRGD peptide can carry the drug deep into the extravascular tumor tissue.
We engineered our chassis, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, to express a fusion protein composed of the exosomal membrane protein Lamp2b and the tumor-targeting short peptide iRGD. Lamp2b (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2b) is a protein found specifically abundant on the surface of exosomes. By genetically engineering the iRGD peptide to the outer membrane portion of Lamp2b, Lamp2b can bring the iRGD peptide to the surface of exosomes. Then the iRGD peptide can guide exosomes to the specific tumor tissue. Through these modifications, exosomes will be conferred on tumor-targeting ability.
Fig 2. We connected iRGD to Lamp2b using a glycine-linker to construct our fusion protein and promoted its expression by the promoter Pcmv. Then, our site-specific exosomes could deliver siRNA to tumor tissue.
Assembly of the RNAi module and targeting module
During experiment, we transfected siRNA plasmid and target plasmid (coding our engineered fusion protein) into HEK293 cells to obtain exosomes with KRAS siRNA inside and iRGD peptide on their surface membranes. When the modified exosomes are injected into the bloodstream, the iRGD peptide will guide exosomes deep into tumor tissue and the exosomes will specifically recognize tumor cells. Once fused into tumor cells, KRAS siRNA will be released, targeting and destroying KRAS mRNA. In this way, the expression of KRAS will be potently shut down. In theory, the delivery of KRAS siRNA to tumor cells will be achieved, whereas non-specific uptake of KRAS siRNA in other tissues will be avoided. As a consequence, the inhibited expression of KRAS oncogene will repress the proliferation of tumor cells, ultimately presenting therapeutic effects on lung"

iGEM is not only a competition, but also a grand event. We hope to create different colors in this carnival, contributing to the development of synthetic biology.
Summary
Our human practice mainly included three phases. The first phase was the original intention of our project. The second stage was the problem we found during the completion of our project. The last phase was how to use our own methods to influence people's thinking and let more people know and understand iGEM and synthetic biology.
Our original intention was to create a new biosynthetic system by redesigning existing natural biological systems and rerouting their metabolic systems. In turn, the existing high-pollution chemical plants all can be transformed into non-polluting, low-energy, high-output biological cell factories. In the process of researching chemical companies, we found a essential problem: most of the chemical industries today are highly polluting industries. Wastewater, waste gas, and waste disposal are complicated and difficult to disposed, and the disposal of these wastes adds extra expense to enterprises, reducing corporate profits. So, we see a future like that:
The biochemical plant will replace the current high-contamination and high-energy chemical plants.
Based on this phenomenon, we have sensitively noticed that synthetic biology will certainly come to the historical stage and have increasingly voices in the entire scientific community. Under such a development, an urgent problem appears unavoidably: What do people think about synthetic biology, which is gaining more and more attention in the scientific community? Is our society environment ready for the biological?
To find out the answer, we first distributed questionnaires to the public for social research, and we got amazing results:
Click here to see the full survey.
It can be seen from the data that the public has given high hopes to the bio-industry, but at the same time, there is an unknown fear of the bio-industry. With such contradictory and interesting results, we can obviously get some convincing conclusions. After discussion with professors and experts, we found that the public's fear mainly comes from the unknown of synthetic biology and even biology.
Humans are interested in the unknown and meanwhile, have a fear of it.
In order to eliminate the public's fear, our team decided to proceed from two aspects. The first thing to do is to give the public an"

NYC_Wetware,2011,Team:NYC Wetware#Food Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," vitro cell growth, a process totally divorced from the original animal. Unlike rennet, the final product resembles the meat of animal, and, furthermore, it is started with whole cells from the animal, not just genetic material. In order for in vitro meat from non-kosher animals to be successfully compared to rennet, a method for starting the cell line with kosher materials must be devised. One possible option would be the genetic manipulation of kosher cells to resemble pig cells. Using pig DNA or synthetic pig genes within a cow cell might be one way to overcome this obstacle.
The Moral Approach: The Underlying Issues
The above discussion considers only the legal aspects of the kosher question, but kashrut also contains moral teachings that bear consideration when we ask about the permissibility of such a radically novel food item. First, we examine the issue of avoiding the need for ritual slaughter. The requirement to slaughter animals with a highly specific procedure serves to remind one of his own mortality and that all life lives and dies in respect to God. In committing the egotistic act of consuming an animal, the ritual brings to mind the humility of humanity. Losing this moral teaching will not affect the straightforward kashrut of the product, but it is important in considering whether such an advance would be a good or a bad idea.
The second moral teaching that might be lost is that of the distinction between kosher and non-kosher species. The Bible declares that distinguishing between the kosher and non-kosher species is fundamental to the notion of Jewish holiness and holy behaviors.
""I am the Lord your God, who have separated you from the peoples. You shall therefore separate between the clean beasts and the unclean and between the unclean fowl and the clean; and you shall not make your souls detestable by beast or fowl or by anything wherewith the ground teemeth, which I separated for you to hold unclean. And you shall be holy unto Me; for I the Lord am holy, and have separated you from the peoples.""
This portion from Leviticus 20 explains that a key component to the Jewish notion of holiness and godliness is the separation between acceptable and unacceptable species. The extent to which this notion continues to be symbolized when a Jew can purchase meat of any species, provided it was grown in a petri dish, is questionable and ought to be questioned.
Past research within the academic Jewish community has dealt with a wide array of issues in biotechnology, but the area of in vitro meat growth is budding in every respect. Two leaders in the field, Rabbi Moshe Tendler, PhD"

The gel revealed some confusing results. It was difficult to tell exactly what size things were because too much ladder was loaded, but it looked like maybe two pieces of the vector could have ligated together? It appeared as though there was a band at the 4000 bp mark.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," samples. Based on the advice and expertise of Aïcha Ait Soussan and Dr. Ellen van der Schoot of the Dutch blood bank Sanquin, we developed a specific extraction and verification protocol to handle the relative low concentrations of gene doping DNA expected to be present in the blood ( Lee et al, 2001 , Ershova et al, 2017 , Zinkova et al, 2017 ). These concentrations were predicted by modeling the process that the administered gene doping DNA goes through in the body. The model also determined the detection window of our method. By applying the modeling results in the wetlab we optimized the sample preparation for the detection of gene doping. The main steps of the sample preparation are shown in figure 2.
This resulted in an approach in which cell free DNA was extracted from blood derivatives using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit , a kit containing silica-membrane-based spin columns (QIAGEN). Extractions were verified by nested PCR for the abundant natural albumin gene as internal control after DNA quantification using Qubit. Lastly, samples were spiked with artificial gene-doping DNA, based on the values obtained from the gene doping model and successful extraction of the gene doping DNA was verified by PCR.
Figure 2. Sample preparation workflow. The final process involves a two step PCR to verify the presence of the internal standard albumin gene.
1.1 Background Information
Cell free DNA (cfDNA) is fragmented genomic DNA present in the blood originated mainly from apoptotic cells and other DNA leakage processes described in our model ( Devonshire et. al, 2014 , Zinkova et al, 2017 ). This model also predicted that cfDNA in plasma will be a suitable source for detecting gene-doping DNA. The cfDNA contains fragmented genomic DNA and fragmented gene doping DNA. The gene doping DNA and endogenous DNA produce indistinguishable proteins, however they are distinctive on a nucleic acid level. The most striking differences between the two is the promoter and the absence of introns. Gene doping DNA commonly requires a constitutive promoter for higher levels of expression. Second, due to size limits of the gene doping vectors and the unknown regulation of transcription or translation the introns will be taken out, resulting in exon-exon junctions which are unique for the gene doping DNA. Extraction of cfDNA from plasma is challenging due to low concentrations and high fragmentation, but possible.
Since cfDNA in the blood is highly fragmented and quickly  degraded in the blood it is important to as quickly as possible after blood withdrawal process the blood into plasma or serum ( Wong et al"

In an annealing reaction with 0.5 µmol L-1 DNA in a total reaction volume of 50 µL, we have 3.011 ∙ 108 molecules per µL, each contain one or two restriction site. Theoretically, more than 1 mL of the annealing DNA should be digested by 1 unit of restriction enzyme per hour. After 1 hour of incubation and following heat inactivation, all samples were resolves by electrophoresis using a 12 % bisacrlyamid Native DNA PAGE .

Figures 2 - 5 show the expected band pattern, although the digest of the M.A.X targets is not complete. Later experiments revealed that a longer incubation time is necessary.         The M.A.X targets are digested after 40 bp, while the UBP_target which contains the unnatuarl bases is still of full length because the recognition site of the restriction enzyme is interrupted by the UBP.

HUMAN PRACTICES
The human practices team is integrated by: Valery Díaz, José Ng, Arturo Nieves, Naicolette Agudo, Lucia Palma (as advisor) and Grimaldo E. Ureña and other members of the iGEM team interested in the  Human Practices area.
From the earliest stages of human evolution when homo sapiens hominids apart from the others hominids, the ability to create progresively better tools and most importantly, the capability of transfer information between individuals has led the advancement of society. Since the tribes and clans, their ability to frame and transmit knowledge as science is one of the basic human capacities that have decided many scientific discoveries and social changes through  human history. Every new revolution has to embrace the critic eye of the people. Similarly, our team thinks we should treat the introduction of synthetic biology to the society as a factor in the equation that helps our country develop and evolution.
Human Practices Project
Introduction
At the beginning of this journey, the members of the UTP-Panama iGEM team confronted a fundamental question, the same one that all who are involved in the field of Synthetic Biology find: What is Synthetic Biology? This aspect is emphasized more in our team, being a team of members studying engineering careers, not related to biological or ""life sciences"".
In our own attempt to understand what is synthetic biology, for which we got a lot of  help with the good information in all the sites of iGEM.org, syntheticbiology.org, SYNBERC, etc and multiple videos on youtube about what is synthetic biology, and finally the introductory lectures given by our instructor. Although we must admit that there are so broad and diverse views that converge under the term ""synthetic biology"", which is always a challenge to define.
Once this stage was finished, we still felt that there would not be an easy task to explain to others about what is synthetic biology. That was the point when we turn to the future applications and benefits of synthetic biology as a the right way to introduce the topic.
At the same time we began to structure and make our own project of SynBio as part of the iGEM Competition, work that led us to ask ourselves how to bring it on the best"

Information about BioBricks is found in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, which is operated by iGEM organization and opened to the whole scientific community.
iGEM has shown a new collaborative approach on developing synthetic biology, it has developed an open community where anyone can have access to information and has also involved students around the synthetic biology field.
Synthetic Biology
Synthetic Biology is an emerging field that aims to modify organisms for performing new tasks by either building new biological parts, devices and systems or by re-designing an already existing system. The goal is to manipulate living organism for useful purpose like sustainable production of fuels and pharmaceuticals, as well as, for helping on environmental problems.
The difference to classical molecular biology is the use of engineering concepts, as complexity abstraction and standardization of parts, for designing molecular circuits. This approach allows to produce more reliable systems build from bottom to top (from genetic circuits to complex metabolic pathways), allowing to create more complex systems that the already known in classical molecular biology. This field requires easy access to standardized biological parts and devices, well-known cells where DNA programs can be assembled and powered, as well as, computational tools to analyze the developed systems.

Cloning and Expression
We ordered the nodB gene via IDT sequencing and inserted this gene into the pSB1C3 vector through a  BioBrick system and verified this via sequencing. The nodB was fused to an Anderson-promoter with defined cleavage sites  (BBa_K2380025) . The vector includes the RBS  BBa_K2380024 .

Figure 4. Plasmid card of NodB with Anderson promoter.The nodB gene (in green) is located on the pSB1C3 vector with an Anderson promoter (red) and a RBS (grey). This part is used for expression studies without the necessity of an induction. Biobrick (BB) prefix and suffix are shown in light blue.  [BBa_K2380042]
Before cloning the nodB gene on pSB1C3, the gene was cloned in a pUPD-vector containing a T7-promoter. nodB gene was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21 after induction with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and analysed via SDS-Page. NodB is known to aggregate inclusion bodies within E. coli cells  [7] . Inclusion bodies are non-functional, insoluble aggregates that occur during overexpression  [7] .
There are many advantages with the occurrence of inclusion bodies. On one hand they yield a very high protein expression level, on the other, they are easy to isolate from cells because of their difference in size and density in comparison to cellular organelles. Inclusion body proteins also"

Gender Equity in Synthetic Biology
Waterloo iGEM and Waterloo WiSTEM (Women in STEM) teamed up to host a two-part event to address issues concerning gender equity in synthetic biology. Part one consisted of a panel discussion on how gender equity impacts synthetic biology and related fields. Part two was an accompanying laboratory component with two overarching goals: one, to provide a synthetic biology-centered environment in which individuals of all genders could feel welcome and two, to use a hands-on approach to familiarize students with synthetic biology.
Why talk about gender equity?
Gender inequity has long been an issue in the STEM fields. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce (Beede et al., 2011), women make up less than 25% of individuals working in STEM fields. Why is this the case? What can we do to resolve this glaring imbalance in STEM?
When women and non-binary individuals are left out of the picture, everyone loses. We lose half of humanity’s brightest ideas, we lose diversity of thought and opinion, we lose valuable and relevant experience. So why is there still such an enormous disproportion between men and women in STEM?
The Waterloo iGEM strongly believes these questions must be asked and discussed in order to start solving the overarching issue. To do this, we decided to team up with the University of Waterloo Women in STEM club (WiSTEM) to host a panel discussion on gender equality.
Why a Synthetic Biology Laboratory workshop?
In addition to a discussion panel regarding gender equity, we included a hands-on synthetic biology aspect to this event. We wanted to set an example by opening a workshop for students, and by students to provide an open and comfortable environment for everyone to learn more about synthetic biology.
During the SHAD Valley workshop, students were seen to be actively engaged in conversation with supervising iGEM members during the process of experiments. We felt that this type of interaction encourages dialogue and is beneficial to both participants and the iGEM team; we thus kept the same format for our WiSTEM workshop.
Gender Equity Panel Discussion with WiSTEM
A little bit about WiSTEM...
Although they focus on the issue of gender imbalance, WiSTEM encourage both males and females, and anyone with a connection to STEM, to participate. Their activities are a mix of skills workshops, topical discussions, social events, speakers, and special trips. They connect young women"
Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Project#Cyano_-_-_TEXT.html," backbone for Gibson Assembly.
Assembly of Parts: The above parts will be assembled into the following construct
Primers developed for PCR and Gibson Assembly for INV operon. Overlapping DNA sequences can be created through PCR by adding twenty base-pairs of the end of your first genetic sequence to the beginning of your second genetic sequence. A blunt-end 40 base-pair sequence is then created that is ideal for Gibson Assembly.
Transformation: Synechocystis will be naturally transformed via homologous recombination.
Engineer Synechocystis to secrete hexose sugars to the medium
Synechocystis lacks the ability to secrete hexose sugars. Therefore it was necessary to introduce a sugar transporter through genetic engineering. Previous studies (Nedierholtmeyer et al (2010) Applied and Environmental Microbiology (2010) 76: 3462) showed that by expressing the Zymonomas mobilis glucose facilitative transporter (GLF) gene in Synechococcus, glucose and fructose were detected in the culture medium at levels as high as 30 uM and 150 uM respectively. Based on these results we decided to express GLF in Synechocystis. Our hope is that by expressing GLF in the AGP KO/INV overexpressing line, we will be able to produce enough glucose to the surrounding medium to support the E. coli biofuel production.
ThiE K.O./GLF Construct Design
To integrate the GLF gene into the Synechocystis genome, we have decided to use an alternative insertion site. In this case we will insert the GLF overexpression gene cassette along with a chloramphenicol resistance cassette (CamR) into the coding region of the thiamin monophosphate pyrophosphorylase (ThiE) gene. The rationale for creating a ThiE knockout mutant is that it will lead to the creation of an auxotophic mutant that will only survive when the grown in the presence of thiamin (Vitamin B1). Therefore, the transgenic Synechocystis will not be able to survive outside laboratory and the chances of environmental contamination will be decreased. We will simultaneously create the ThiE mutant and the GLF overexpressing line by creating an ThiE gene replacement construct in which the GLF overexpression gene cassette and a chloramphenicol resistance gene cassette are inserted into the coding region of a subcloned ThiE gene. This dysfunctional ThiE construct will then be transformed into Synechocystis and"

We have characterised two synthetic devices: the Secretion of RNA Device (S.O.R.D.) and its partner RNA silencing agent, spiRNA.
S.O.R.D. is a fusion protein consisting of Hfq and OsmY. Hfq is an RNA binding protein found in many pathogenic bacteria. OsmY is a protein readily secreted by E. coli. By fusing these proteins we can theoretically create a device that secretes RNA from the cell. Our spiRNA is made from the expression systems, Ec-sRNA using an Hfq binding site from E. coli and Sma-sRNA using one from Serratia marcesens. Once the spiRNA is outside of the E. coli we want the target bacterium to take up the sRNA so that it can block a vital DNA sequence from being translated. In our proof of concept experiments detailed here we have targetted the flagellar subunit gene fliC. So in order to see if RNA interference would work in the treatment of bacterial infections, we ran some experiments on our BioBricks. First of all we ran numerous western blots to characterise SORD and see if they can be secreted. We then performed motility assays to see if our spiRNA works as we expect it to.
Western Blots
Figure 1: Western blots of our whole cell (A) and supernatant (B) samples of rhamnose induced OsmY-HA (C) expressing cultures.
We ran a western blot on our rhamnose induced OsmY-HA expressing cultures. We used OsmY-HA as a positive control to make sure OsmY is being secreted. First we added 500 ul overnight cultures into 50 ml of LB, we incubated the cultures at 37oC until we reached an OD600nm of 0.4. We followed this by adding different concentrations of rhamnose; 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4% and 0.5% (v/v). We took a 1ml sample from the"

Digital Logic in Synthetic Biology
A large chunk of effort in synthetic biology has been aimed at attempting to view genes as parts of a circuit. Thus, a lot of focus has been directed toward creating biological analogues of digital logic gates, such as an AND or a NOT gate, which give a digital 1 or 0 response, depending on the truth table of the gate.
Figure – A typical example of a biological NOT Gate, considered to be ON when the concentration of inducer is below 10-6, and OFF when it is greater than 10-4. Such a response gives a corresponding gene expression level (au) of ~1 in the ON state, and ~0.4 in the OFF state (Source: “Generation of Pulse of a Bacterial Species in E.coli”, Kshitij Rai, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology IIT Delhi, Master’s Thesis, 2017)
However, there is a serious issue in the scale up of these circuits. While that can be attributed to several reasons, one of the major reasons is this simplification under which the systems work. We can see that the output response from the gate is not close to the actual digital “1 or 0” kind that one would ideally want from a logic gate, and in the range that is neither in the ON nor the OFF regime, the response is really graded.
Thus, when a combination of gates is used in conjunction, one could not expect them to remain digital. Just imagine using a 10 input AND gate as shown below, that could possibly be used as an environmental biosensor. If the concentration of a few inputs is in the ON range, while the others are in the middle range,"
BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," The samples are investigated by SDS-PAGE after crushing the bacteria of three groups by high temperature. As it is shown in Figure 4 , after dyed by coomassie brilliant blue, there is a large number of proteins around expected 56-57kD from largely expression group, a small number of proteins from slightly expression group, and almost no significant expression from control group. The result of SDS-PAGE shows that the improved honeybee silk protein can be observed by naked eyes, and the different color shades of blue can reflect the expression level of the protein.
(Figure 3  the bacteria of different groups after centrifugation)
(Figure 4  the result of SDS-PAGE)
By infusing chromoprotein with different colors after the honeybee silk protein, we can produce silk protein with different colors, which will allow us to obtain the expression time, expression level and expression efficiency of the silk protein, therefore control the production of the honeybee silk protein efficiently. Not only can we make the silk protein more aesthetic, but also we can apply the silk protein into more areas widely, such as health and medicine, textile industry and biomaterial.
In improvement module, we provide the part named honeybee-blue protein (part number: BBa_K2220028 ).

SCU-China is founded in 2012,with the support of the College of Life Science of Sichuan University.The team exists as a scholar club in the university and it really provides a platform for all students to show their passions and potentials.Some guys have been working in the team for a few years,making the whole team really a big family.
This year,we get students from ten different colleges and it gives us the chances to know different majors and work together.We really enjoy the time and it leaves such a deep impression on everyone who contributes here.We design all our projects independently by ourselves.
Though we haven't got any gold medal as far,we gained a lot from the process.We really enjoy the iGEM competition.
This year, we shot a video in our campus called “Ordinary E. coli” to show our team spirit and attract others’ attention to our project. And we got the copyrights from the original song writer “iLem” on Sina Weibo to cover the original song “Ordinary Disco”, which is quite famous in China. Check this out!

This is the third year for me to be an iGEMer. Honestly, iGEM plays a critical role during my college years. From a team member for last two years, to the team leader (the group leader of CecropinXJ expression group as well) for this year, I have learnt too much from iGEM. Personally speaking, iGEM is a fantastic platform for college students to learn what is real research, and how to collaborate with others in lab"

The solution is by engineering the bacteria that can convert the PAH to acetylCoA using the mechanism below. The bacteria can sense the breakdown of catechol which will acts as a transcription activator for the expression of AHL, allows the aggregation of the bacteria to promote PAH breakdown into acetyl CoA and sucinyl CoA. Another module that is incorporated into the bacteria are the genes responsible for PHA production as well as the gas vesicle protein and RFP. Therefore after collecting the plastics (density = 1.48 g/ml > water density) The bacteria can float up and will be easily detected. Eventually the plastic producing bacteria could be collected for plastics extraction and the region contaminated by PAH could be identified where more bacteria could be applied for more breakdown.

Henriksdal wastewater treatment plant, Sofia Andersson
×
Description: Development engineer at Henriksdal wastewater treatment plant in Stockholm
Input:
The meeting gave us a better picture of how the cleaning process works today as well as the large scale needed to clean wastewater from a whole city.
We discussed possible implementations of our product, for example taking the beads out in the first sand filter and separating them from the sand.
The most effective and cost-saving method is used to improve the cleaning process.
Adjustment:
We looked more into where in the wastewater treatment plants our product could be implemented.
Development of a system where the beads can be reused.
To retrieve the beads we got the idea to use a magnetic material.
Åland wastewater treatment plant
×
Description: After visiting the Henriksdal, the biggest wastewater treatment plant in Sweden, we  wanted to investigate the visibility of our approach in a smaller wastewater treatment plant with a different infrastructure.
Input:
Since the treatment plant is smaller our enzyme might have not enough time to detoxify sulfamethoxazole.
The infrastructure should be as minimal as possible since space is limited.
Adjustment:
We confirmed that we have to improve our laccase to work faster.
We investigated the implementation of our beads in pumping stations and the retrieval at the inflow of the wastewater treatment plant.
We considered keeping the infrastructure needed for our solution as low as possible.
Third Stage: The laccase on magnetic nanospheres
×
Since producing enzymes immobilized on beads for one-time use would be too expensive, not sustainable, and therefore not feasible, we had the idea to use magnetic particles as a carrier for our laccase. We imagined the carrier to be recycled from the wastewater with a strong magnet.

Description: Senior advisor at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), at the Department of Energy and Technology in Sweden. Expert in recycling technology.
Input:
If the bead is used in very polluted wastewater it can form a biofilm very fast, which would decrease the impact of the enzyme and the magnetic properties of the bead.
In the future there will be a more extensive monitoring of pharmaceuticals in wastewater.
Adjustment:
We investigated the introduction of a recovery system for our beads where they can be cleaned before they are brought back in the wastewater.
We confirmed the rising need of our solution.

NRP-UEA-Norwich,2015,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"gB and GlgX had different structures. We wanted to see if there was a difference in the branch length distributions when GlgB or GlgX were overexpressed.
METHOD:
Approximately 1 mg glycogen that had been extracted from induced and non-induced bacterial cultures containing GlgB or GlgX constructs was dissolved in 100 uL 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4 and then treated with Pseudomonas Isoamylase (1 Unit) at 37 °C for 3 hours. Isoamylase removes α-1,6 linkages and therefore this treatment completely debranched the glycogen samples. A control sample of commercial glycogen was also debranched by this method. An aliquot of the debranched glycogen was then diluted 100 fold in matrix solution (1mg/mL Dihydroxybenzoic acid in 30% aq. Acetonitrile) and analysed by MALDI mass spectrometry. The remaining debranched glycogen was analysed by addition of Lugol’s solution as previously (Figure 1)
RESULTS:
Figure 1 shows that the cultures clearly stained darkly, which is expected as non-branched chains stain a darker colour with Lugol’s solution. However the colour was not as dark as the control sample of debranched commercial glycogen. This might be explained by our samples being less pure or having a different branch length distribution.
Figure 2 shows the chain length distribution in glycogen from induced GlgB and GlgX cultures. When GlgX is overexpressed the glycogen is less branched, hence there is a shift toward longer chain lengths. Conversely when GlgB is overexpressed there is a higher proportion of shorter chain lengths and a lower maximum chain length can be observed.
Therefore, in conclusion, this suggests that the branching and debranching enzymes have had the desired effect upon glycogen structure. This is because debranching enzyme shows longer, less branched, more linear glycogen chains whilst branching enzyme shows more shorter chain lengths and a lower amount of maximum chain lengths indicating branching.

Arizona_State,2012,Team:Arizona State#FieldApplications_-_-_TEXT.html,", such as food, water, and plants. It has been shown that before an outbreak takes place in water, there are usually signs of E.coli being present (Olsen). Before an outbreak can occur the cells must be able to survive in their environment. In recent case studies it has been found that although E.coli was found to be present in the water supply, although the amount of E.coli was insufficient. It was not until after an outbreak occurred and patients began having symptoms did the amount of E.coli becomes a problem. Once the E.coli outbreak has occurred, it will usually take a few weeks to run tests. These experiments can be determining the phenotype of E.coli or just to determine how many people could potentially be affected by the outbreak. It is quite common during E.coli water outbreaks for the cohort case studies to take place. These studies determine a statistical analysis of the outbreak, where the statisticians where able to see how the outbreak progressed with how many people it infected (Olsen). When E.coli is present in other sources such as food and plants, it is usually not known that this is the source until after the outbreak has already occurred. The biosensor developed by the ASU team, eliminated many of these issues. By engineering the biosensor to already be pathogen specific, it decreases the amount of time to determine what the pathogen. The efficiency of our biosensor allows for the efforts the community to then be focused on water purification, instead of waiting for lab results.
How does the biosensor improve sanitation?
Why is there a need for a real time/faster response for the biosensor needed?
Improving sanitation and hygiene of water has been one of the primary goals for Arizona State’s iGEM team. As a result of producing a biosensor to detect pathogens, it has the ability to not only prevent outbreaks from occurring but also to minimize them. Our biosensor has the ability to be used to detect different kinds of pathogens. This is very useful because if an outbreak were to occur, the amount of time in spending on determining the phenotype of the pathogen can then be spent on eliminating it from water sources. This is another reason why our biosensor can be so effective by being able to detect specific pathogens, but it is also able to give you the answers in real time. This eliminates even more time in the process of determining the pathogen. By being able to prevent an outbreak from occurring, we would be able to improve the sanitation of water, especially in developing countries. It is in developing nations where the outbreaks are the most prevalent. Our biosensor was"

OUC-China,2012,Team:OUC-China#Project#Sensor#ResultandDiscussion_-_-_TEXT.html," in need of modification to enhance TCS robustness and reduce stochastic noise. Besides as expected, our experiment has proved that original nitrate-sensitive promoter needs to be increased the responding sensitivity to match our requirement. Our experiment is still in progress and we have confidence to complete this arduous but exciting task.
For the construction of Phosphate accumulated device. We will link the two parts with promoter and terminator to test the ability of recombination strain to accumulate inorganic phosphate (Pi).We would like to monitor the change of Pi in the medium by a nation standardized method provided by Algology and algae culture laboratory.
Here we introduce the other potential methods we conceived to fine-tune our sensors
Construct chimeric chemoreceptor
It is interesting that chimeric chemoreceptor (HK protein fusion) coupled with non-cognate RR would give TCS some new characterizations like rewiring bacteria behaviors or change of responding sensitivity. And it dawns on me that we could construct a chimeric protein that joins the ligand-binding, trans-membrane and linker domains of the NarX sensor kinase to the signaling and adaptation domains of another chemoreceptor of Escherichia coli to change the sensitivity to nitrate. A number of functional chimeric chemoreceptors have been constructed and we found Scott M. Ward[6] has successfully constructed a NarX-Tar chemoreceptor that could respond with thresholds of 10-5 M for nitrate which enhanced the sensitivity more than 100 times. That seems more feasible to accurately predict the red tide.
RBS selection for appropriate expression rate
The last approach we have considered is to exchange RBS for fine-tuning of the translation rate of the downstream genes. In our case, exchanging of RBS could directly influence the concentrations of sRNA in cell. The corresponding translation rates of RBS library interpreted with RBS calculator (introduced by Peking iGEM team) would be integrated to our model and be screened for several candidate RBSs. Next we would verify those RBSs by experiments.

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

Quantification of the pure indigoidine pigment can be easily achieved by optical density (OD) measurements at its maximum wavelength of about 590 nm.  In cellular culture, indigoidine quantification by OD measurements is impaired. Cellular density of liquid cultures is standardly measured as the optical density (OD) at a wave length of 600 nm, i. e.  the absorption peak of indigoidine interferes with the measurement of cell density at the preferred wave length (compare to Figure 3, grey dashed line).   Thus, for measurement of NRP expression without time consuming a priori purification of the tagged-protein, a method to separate the cellular and pigment-derived contributions to the OD is required (compare to Figure 3, brown and blue lines, respectively).  The method of choice, as described by Myers et al.[2013], requires the OD measurement of  cell culture at two distinct wavelengths: the robust wave length ODR and the sensitive wave length ODS.  The concentration of indigoidine will have to be deducted from measurements at ODS = 590 nm: <math> OD_{S,+P} </math> [Indigoidine]= 〖〖OD〗_(S,+P)-OD〗_(S,-P) with 〖OD〗_(S,+P) being the overall OD measurement and 〖OD〗_(S,-P) being the scattering contribution of the cellular components at the sensitive OD.  The scattering contribution of the cellular compenents at ODS  (ODS,-P ) can be calculated from the scattering contribution measured at the robust wave length according to the following formula:  [[File:  The correction factor δ is be determined by measuring the OD of pure cellular culture without indigoidine at both the wavelength  〖OD〗_(S,-P) and 〖OD〗_R and calculating their ratio.  Finally, the indigoidine production can be determined as [[File:Heidelberg_5.png]]  For the calculation of the cellular component when measuring indigoidine producing liquid cell cultures, OD measurement at 800 nm as robust wavelength is recommended. By the approach described above, quantitative observation of the indigoidine production in a liquid culture over time as"
