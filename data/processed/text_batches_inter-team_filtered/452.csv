What is directed evolution?
In protein engineering, the method of directed evolution is used to harness the power of natural selection.  It is used to evolve certain proteins or RNA with desirable properties not found in nature.  Rather than swapping out different components of the structure, directed evolution can be used to manipulate the behaviour of these components.  Then, by screening or selection, we can obtain the desired phenotype.
There are three typical steps involved that include:
 
1. Diversification: The gene that encodes the desired protein is mutated and recombined at random to create a large library of gene mutants.  Techniques commonly used in this step involve PCR and DNA shuffling.
 
2. Selection: The library is tested for the existence of mutants possessing the property of interest using screening or selection.
       a. Selections automatically remove all mutants that do not function.
       b. Screening enables the researcher to manually detect and isolate the high-performing mutants.
 
3. Amplifications: The mutations identified int he selection or screening process are replicated several times so it allows the researchers to sequence their DNA and recognize what mutations have occurred.
For optimizing efficiency, altering more than one parameter would be preferable in order to obtain the desired protein.  Therefore, we accululate mutations over multiple generations.
In order to examine how changes in the parameters were affecting the stability of the steady states, we could do uniform bifurcation analysis e.g. determining th regions of stability.
In the experiments, we were able to use the FACS (fluorescence activated cells sorting) machine to separate the proteins with the brightest colours and thus use the strongest ones. Once we had this, we could put the proteins through the system again as initial conditions and then we"

DIYBio: Introduction to synthetic biology
 
On the october the 24th, the iGEM-team of Groningen hosts a night for all interested Do-It-Yourself biologists. It is a night in which we shortly explain synthetic biology and its (possible) uses in everyday life. To start from scratch we will make some agar plates and see what bacteria live on various parts of your room/phone/body. A first essential step used everyday in synthetic biology!

High school visit
 
On the 24th of September, students of the CSG Wessel Gansfortcollege who were in their final year of high school, paid the iGEM-team Groningen a visit. The meeting was arranged via ScienceLinx, an organization within the University of Groningen, which is supporting high schools and their students. They like to promote science among high school students, and this year they asked us whether we would like to help them to organize a practical in the synthetic biology. At nine in the morning the students arrived, and after an introduction talk we brought them to the lab. The group was divided in two: one group was able to transform pSB1C3 (the most commonly used plasmid within the iGEM competition) to E. coli DH5α. The other group was working hard to do exactly the opposite. Their task was to isolate pSB1C3 out of E. coli DH5α. Once the practical work was done, the students were told about iGEM, and the bandage we (the Groningen team) are making for the competition this year. The students were very enthusiastic, and interesting questions were asked. In the end the students made a comic about the practical work. A nice result of one of the comics is shown here on our wiki. The day was closed in a proper way by having a drink and discussing the day.

A Genetic Limiter Circuit in S. cerevisiae
We have designed a modular genetic circuit to limit the expression level of a gene of interest to a user-defined, tunable threshold.  The limiter network reacts to the transcription of an endogenous gene within each cell, entering a regulatory state only where and when the rate of transcription lies beyond an acceptable range of activity.  Along with its potential therapeutic utility, we offer our device as a foundational tool for researching gene expression in a eukaryotic model.

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,". We also talked about its importance in genome wide studies for human disease and major projects such as the Human Genome Project.
Finally, we produced a list of titles for the students to choose from in order to research and present the rest of the class. We critiqued their research quality, information on slides and how they presented. We used titles from coursework given to us as part of our course from the previous academic year and showed them the quality of work expected at university. We hoped that they would come away from the workshop knowing what to expect from their A-levels and subsequent university courses.
At the end of the session, the students completed a feedback questionnaire which yielded useful information about how much students already know about synthetic biology. Most students enjoyed the workshop and said that they learnt about new subject topics. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to hold full day workshops which would have helped the students better grasp some complex topics. This comes directly from the students who told us that the concepts were a little complicated and perhaps they would have like more time to learn more about synthetic biology and bacteriophages.
We found it interesting (but not surprising) that the majority of students had not heard of Clostridium difficile or Clostridium difficile infection before the workshop. As we explained in the workshop, it mostly affects elderly people, those who are staying in hospitals for long periods of times or those who are immunocompromised. Therefore, it was unsurprising that the students hadn’t heard of a disease that doesn’t affect their demographic.
Most students across the 3 schools also had not heard much about bacteriophage or phage therapy except for the few who were personally interested in genetic modification. So when asked whether they would consider receiving phage therapy, more than half of the students responded ‘maybe’. The students didn’t elaborate on their answer so can only speculate but we think that the idea of using a virus (something that we are taught at school as being bad for us) as a therapy is a little daunting. Some students wrote that they would consider it if it was being used to treat a major illness or if it was a last choice treatment. This ties in with their opinions on antibiotic resistance- most students responded that they were aware of antibiotic resistance problem but most said that they were ‘a little’ worried about resistance compared to those who responded ‘a lot’. We explained that our treatment was to be provided as an alternative to antibiotics so if the students weren’t too worried about antibiotics, there would be no need to consider alternative treatment.
Another possible reason as to the apprehension on receiving phage therapy could be again due to"

This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B.

Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

Sporage and Distribution Design Process
Sporulation of 'Bacillus subtilis' cells happens naturally when the organism is stressed. In the lab sporulation can be artificially triggered by growing on a defined medium. The cells are first transformed with all the necessary parts for sensing and output and then sporulated. The dormant spores can be stored by simply dropping a solution of them onto sterile filter paper disks and air drying them. These disks are attached to the inside of the cuvette thereby immobilising the bacteria. A silica based dessicant is also kept in the cuvette to contribute to the longevity. The cuvette can then be kept until the kit is required. When the kit is required, a provided germination medium is added to the cuvette. After a short incubation time the cuvette can be loaded into the arduino device, test solution added, and used for biosensing"

Tianjin,2015,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"Our Goal
1. Stimulate PET hydrolysis by FsC, LC and Thc_Cut1 with addition of four kinds of Janus.
2. Enhance enzyme activity by making fusion proteins with Janus.
3. Compare the differences between four kinds of Janus for stimulating cutinase activity.
4. Study the mechanism behind Janus's acceleration.
Our Design
In 2005, Toru Takahashi etc. found that growth of the mold fungus Aspergillus oryzae on the biodegradable polyester polybutylene succinate-coadipate (PBSA) induced not only the cutinase (CutL1) but also a hydrophobin (RolA), which adsorbed to the hydrophobic surface of PBSA, recruited CutL1, and stimulated its hydrolysis of PBSA [4]. This gives us the inspiration that Janus may stimulate enzymatic plastic degradation. As well, in 2013, Liliana Espino-Rammer etc. added two kinds of Class II hydrophobins HFB4 and HFB7 of Trichoderma into the process of PET hydrolysis by Humicola insolens cutinase, and they turned out to stimulate the enzyme activity [4].
Figure 10. Two hypotheses of the mechanism of behind Janus's stimulation of enzymatic reaction hydrolysis:(a) Janus make the PET more approachable applicable to the cutinase. (b) Janus could change the cutinase's structure.
In our project, we would try two new hydrophobins, inJanus and sJanus, and their respective mutants, to test if they have the ability to increase the activity of above-mentioned three cutinases- FsC, LC and Thc_Cut1. It is the first time to study two classes of Janus in the process of plastic degradation, and it could reveal the differences between them and provide a better hydrophobin partner. Meanwhile, will our brand new inJanus-m and sJanus-m behave well in the process? We would like to explore.
Because the mechanism behind Janus' acceleration is still unknown, we would try different ways to add Janus into plastics, and various ways could lead to huge difference of Janus's effect. The first way is simple mixing, which means mixing cutinase, Janus and PET at the same time. The second way is PET pre-incubation with Janus, which means adding Janus into plastics primarily, and then putting cutinase in the container after "

For C. violaceum, all experiments involving this strain will be performed in a P2 facility and under the supervision of a member of the permanent staff who is the manager of the P2 facility.
There is no environmental risks.
C. violaceum is used only for parts characterisation and is not part of the original project. For the project itself, only the E. coli K12 is used and the potential risks of converting the project into a commercial product are already assessed for industrial purposes.
In the potential case where some parts should be used for other purposes than research, precautions shoud be taken to assess the safety of these microorganisms. No parts will be introduced into C. violaceum, avoiding possible antibiotic resistance of the strain.
All students receive a 2 hours safety course provided by the biosafety commitee executive. All of them were required to take a test at the end, and all of them passed.
There is an institutional biosafety commitee. The project was approved by several teachers of the institute.
The Biosafety level of our lab is 2. The institute has a P2 room fully equiped for manipulating level 2 risk group organisms.
The chassis organism risk group is 1. However, we also use a level 2 test chassis that is only manipulated in the P2 facility.

NCTU_Formosa,2013,Team:NCTU Formosa#project_-_-_TEXT.html," gene expression. The expression of heat-shock, cold-shock and some virulence genes are coordinated in response to temperature changes. There are several systems suggested in references that are based on RNA secondary structure. This structural transition can then expose or occlude important regions of RNA such as a ribosome binding site, which then affects the translation rate of a nearby protein-coding gene, so we can say that the RNA thermometers are just like riboswitches.
Apart from protein-mediated transcriptional control mechanisms, translational control by RNA thermometers is also a widely used regulatory strategy.

RNA thermometers are identified in the 5' UTR of messenger RNA, upstream of a protein-coding gene.
Unlike normal RBS, the 37 °C RBS has a unique or rather stable hairpin structure which shaped like a lock. If the temperature drops below 37 °C, the base-pairing neucleotides on the RNA will form a stable secondary hairpin structure, occluding the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (SD sequence) thus disabling the ribosome to bind. The base-pairing of this RNA region will block the expression of the protein encoded within. Since the structure is sustained by base pairing, heat can be employed to break the hydrogen bonds. So when it reaches 37 °C, the bonds would be broken and the hairpin would be unfolded, causing the SD sequence to be exposed and permitting the binding of the ribosome, which then starts the translation. This means that by raising temperature to a certain threshold, the 37 °C RBS can function as a normal RBS. In this way, gene expression can be regulated on the RNA level by temperature.
Design
The specific ribosome binding site (RBS) BBa_ K115002 is a great RNA thermometer. It has high translation activity at high temperature (> 37 °C) and low translation activity at room temperature. It was designed for the temperature-dependent genetic circuit in E. coli, with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) used as the reporter protein.
Originally, it is in the 5'-UTR of the Salmonella agsA gene, which codes for a small heat shock protein that can be used for temperature sensitive post-transcriptional regulation, initiating translation at 37 °C. Transcription of the agsA gene is controlled by the alternative sigma factor σ32. Additional translational control depends on a stretch of four uridines that pair with the SD sequence, so they are named ""FourU"". They repress translation of this protein by base-pairing with"
Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," CB bottom plasmid that we cut with Bsa-HF and ran through a gel yesterday.  However, we got an extremely low yield of 3.4 ng/ul.
After talking with Dan about the not-so-ideal experiences with Bsa-HF, we decided to make a few changes to our protocols, and that we would try the following to see how they would work:
To troubleshoot the poor oligo cutting:
1.5 ul of enzyme (20 units/ul)
2 ul of NEB buffer 4
0.5 ul of BsaI-HF
16 ul of DNA
20 ul total
Incubute for 1.5 hour in a thermal cycler at 37 degrees.
Denature at 65 degrees for 20 minutes and then pcr purify.
For troubleshooting the poor plasmid cutting:
Do the same thing but do it for longer (2 hours) and also run an uncut plasmid to see which bands come up.
We checked to see if dcm methylation happens for bsaI at our cut sites, but there were no signs of the dcm recognition sequences (CCAGG or CCTGG) anywhere near them.
GFP reporter plasmid sequencing
Today we miniprepped the four GFP colonies that we picked yesterday in order to run a junction PCR on them and send them out for sequencing.  Our junction PCR used the previous protocol's annealing temperature of 55 degrees, but the extension time was lengthened to 1:15 to account for the extra length of the GFP insert (some additional 700-800 bp).  After the PCR, the samples were sent out for sequencing with both the forward junction primer and the reverse 100 bp primer (ZF116 by the primer index).
Glycerol stocks and final platings
We made glycerol stocks of the final four plasmids in Top 10 ChemComp bacteria, which were Pos Con 77 (85.2), OZ052 (52.1), OZ123 (123.4), and Zif268 (Zif268.1).  We also made final plates of these bacteria, using 1/1000 ul on spec plates.

New miniprep protocol
Today, we tried a new miniprep protocol in which the DNA is precipitated out of solution with EtOH, and no spin columns are used.  This is because we suspect that our low yields may be due in some part to DNA being washed out of the column prematurely, or DNA not being"

First, based on the results of the survey, we have fully considered the public's apprehension about the impact of geneticCom modification and microorganisms on the natural environment. We chose Escherichia coil BL21 strain which is low toxicity and low sensitivity to human and environment. Besides, we designed a self-suicide part target those abnormal conditions including overpopulation and low copper concentration. This assures the safe management over genetically modified organisms.
Additionally, from our initial idea, the design of our working parts and our prototype to the future applications of our project, the opinions of specialists have been vital in influencing our work. Details as follows.
Prof. Ruo He
Professor from Environmental Science department of Zhejiang University
Our initial plan was to clone the Mbns gene from the methanotrophs. However upon sequencing the amplified inserts, none of the sequences were what we expected to find. And we have learned the methanobactine's mechanism inside methanotroph but is not yet fully understood.
We asked Prof. Ruo He, an expert who mainly worked on methanotrophs, for advice. She told us as an anaerobic bacteria, methanotrophs are really hard to operate in normal conditions. So finding the corresponding sequence and synthesizing it and then transferring the Mbns gene into E.coli would be more efficient and helpful. Combined with the results of survey mentioned above, we chose Escherichia coli BL21 strain which is low toxicity and low sensitivity to human and environment. And we also successfully constructed the new basic part MbnABC which is submitted to Registry (BBa_2826000).
Prof. Jiyan Shi

Initially, we have a big plan about using biological methods to copper treatment basing on Mbn, but we were lack of recognition of exsiting sewage treatment methods.

British_Columbia,2014,Team:British Columbia#Teamtest_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM, I hope to become a more well-rounded scientist and researcher. My goal is to become more knowledgeable in the field of synthetic biology, whether that is through reading background content or applying lab techniques. That way, I can contribute more to the team in the future as well as apply what I have learned to other similar experiences down the road.
What inspires you:
What has really driven me throughout my life has been the dynamic between the natural curiosity humans have towards the unknown and the ability to share the discoveries stemmed from that interest to society. It is fascinating to see how driven humanity can be to venture into the unknown, risking everything for the sake of obtaining knowledge. What fascinates me further is how captivated these scientists are in explaining these findings to everyone else so that all can benefit from the newfound information. This process is one that I believe makes humanity very special and gifted and one that drives me to do my part to help.
Desired Impact on the World:
Humanitarian aid has always been a passion of mine, especially with it came to investigating the various public health concerns around the world. I would love to be an integral part of research pivotal in improving the health of communities currently lacking in accessible healthcare. Whether this is through drug discovery or disease control, it would be fantastic to contribute to work that leads to aiding others.
Hobbies:
When I am not working on iGEM, I am often outside playing sports or supporting my favorite sport teams. In particular, I am an avid soccer fan, passionately supporting the clubs Tottenham Hotspurs and San Jose Earthquakes. In exploration of my more artistic side, I frequently spend my time painting and learning new languages.

Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM because of a Terry Talk by a past iGEM member, who described the elegance of synthetic biology and the need to create standardized parts. That moment on, I was hooked into iGEM and its limitless potential.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I have been with iGEM for several years now and every year I love being able to take a concept and try to turn it into something tangible, useful, and meaningful; it truly is a unique undergraduate experience. The jamboree is one of my favourite parts of iGEM, its inspiring to see all the different projects and hear what inspired other teams.
What inspires you:
Nature, its incredible complexity juxtaposed with its elegant simplicity is just mind blowing. I see nature and its application as being as limitless as the imagination itself.

Anne Van Devender
Anne Van Devender is a 4th year undergraduate at Washington and Lee University (Lexington, VA).  She is a Computer Science major with a minor in Women's Studies.  After graduation she hopes to attend graduate school for either a master's degree or PhD in Human Computer Interaction.
Her main endeavor outside of academics is the Washington and Lee Women's Soccer team where she is captain and a three-year letter winner.  In 2007, she was named to the NSCAA All-America team.  When she is not on the field or in the classroom, she enjoys working with kids in the Lexington community including involvement in a literacy campaign and teaching middle school girls the basics of computer science.
This summer she is participating in the Summer Undergraduate Program in Engineering Research at Berkeley (SUPERB) and working with the iGEM 2008 UC Berkeley Computational Team. She is using Java to write an ""Algorithm Manager"" for the Clotho tool.  While she has used Java extensively in her coursework at W&L, the synthetic biology aspect of the project is completely new to her.  The last time she took biology was in 9th grade! She hopes this project will not only improve her research skills in computer science, but will also enlighten her to the emerging field of synthetic biology.

Step3
business model
Our team has already come up with a viable and understandable business model—a circle among ourselves, biology learners and the sponsors.
Firstly, our team can use the project and some online advertisement to attract investment and use the investment to arrange offline activities to inspire interest of synthetic biology among the public, which is of great educational and scientific significance. We also collaborate with the founder of one-kilogram-box and spend 40% of the investment on the product. So far, we have just delivered 550 boxes to many high schools and universities, helping more students to learn about iGEM and synthetic biology. In the business circle, our team plays a role as the connecting part between customers and sponsors.And we have two main sources of income.In one way,we sell our online lessons to earn money.In the other way,we help the education institutions in China to advertise.
Secondly, the sponsors will also benefit in the business model for they can attract more customers on the online advertisements and get their potential customers during the offline activities. Since a big proportion of the users of Synsketch are students who may have the plan to study abroad, most of the sponsors are education agencies and they can get their customers from those who often view the website. And they can also get more potential customers during some lectures and other public activities for biology learners.
Thirdly, the public will also take full advantage in the circle. They can get access to a more convenient standardized software for genetic circuits and can also learn more about synthetic biology through offline activities.
As mentioned above, there is a virtuous circle with lots of benefits for every part of the circle. And since every part can benefit from the business model, it will carry on and expand to a larger and larger range and pose more and more important influence to the whole iGEM community and even the whole society.

Assembly and expression
Investigation into bactericidal activity on E.coli
Proteins in the biofilm matrix have various functions and play an important role in all stages of the biofilm development. Cell wall anchored (CWA) proteins are vital in Staphylococcus aureus biofilms to mediate the primary attachment of cells to the surface of its host and also promote the intercellular adhesion, biofilm accumulation and maturation [17]
Staphylococcus epidermidis is a commensal species with S. aureus, and those two species competes with one another for nutrients. Epidemiology studies show that S. epidermidis inhibit the growth of S. aureus in the human nasal cavity and further studies indicated that this was due to the degradation of a variety of S.aureus CWA proteins. This degradation resulted in decreased biofilm formation and forced S.aureus back into a planktonyic form, presumably resulting in decreased survival chances. [18] [19] Heavily involved in this process was extracellular serine protease (esp); secreted by S. epidermidis, this protease degrades the proteins that maintain structural and chemical integrity of the biofilm. Purified esp inhibits biofilm formation at the preliminary stage and is able to detach a pre-existing one. Additionally, esp reduces the virulence of S. aureus through degrading other important proteins, e.g. quorum sensing molecule receptors, enzymatic proteins for biofilm dispersal. [20]
Figure 3: Esp cleaves off CWA proteins
Esp could be applicable for the prevention or treatment of infectious diseases caused by S. aureus.  It has also been proven to be effective for the biofilms formed by MRSA and vancomycin -intermediate S. aureus. [19]
We used the Biobricks BBaK531003 and BBaK531006, which were developed by team Grinnell 2011, as the basis for synthesising esp in E. coli.
It is a wild type gene with 833 bp in size, amplified from the genome of S. epidermidis.
Esp is produced as an inactive form of protein which is then secreted into the environment through Sec-mediated translocation. The propeptide at the N-terminal would be cleaved by signal"
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," one of the nurses on the ward. Jan explained to us the current treatment of UTIs. The protocol for treatment is to first take a urine sample to test for the presence of bacterial colonies. If the dip test comes back as positive, the patient is treated with a wide spectrum antibiotic, after which an antibiotic treatment specific to the type of bacteria identified may be given. Whether or not a catheter is fitted with prophylactic antibiotic treatment is the doctor’s decision.
Up to this point, we weren’t fully aware of the potential seriousness of UTIs. Jan told us about a case of a person getting septicaemia as a result of a UTI. The patient had received antibiotics for seven days and had come back for a check up. Their urine sample was clear and but, despite this, the patient rapidly went into septic shock. This life threatening infection is caused by the uropathogenic bacteria rising up the ureter to the kidney. If a patient becomes septic the catheter has to be removed or CAUTI can be fatal. This shocking example made our project feel very relevant and we took a lot from this initial conversation. We went on to investigate the pros and cons of the current methods of CAUTI treatment, and compare these to what our solution could offer. Following this meeting, the design of the catheter became an integral part of our project.
Laura Evans, from the Adams Ward (geriatric) in the John Radcliffe Hospital, also talked to us about the current treatment of UTIs, informing us that the use of antibiotics is often ineffective and therefore infections are recurrent. We asked Laura the following questions.
What happens when a catheterised patient tests positive for a UTI?
“Whether or not the catheter is removed if a patient tests positive for a UTI depends largely on the reason that the catheter has been fitted. In most cases, the catheter remains fitted and the patient is treated with a large dose of antibiotics.”
Is antibiotic resistance a problem?
“Yes, particularly on this ward. As we treat elderly patients with recurring infections, the uropathogens they succumb to are often resistant to antibiotic treatment. As a result, we have to try different combinations of antibiotics, but in many cases this does not stop recurrences of the infection.”
Conversation with academics
In collaboration with Oxford University Scientific Society, we organised a public talk “Biofilms: role in health and disease, recalcitrance and in vitro modelling” by Dr. Andrew McBain, Biofilm Research Group, Manchester Pharmacy School. This talk helped the team understand the role of biofilms in causing infection"

Fig4. Comprehensive data analysis
Data Analysis
Since there are several factors like different promoters,RBSs,and interactions of the two elements can infecting the expression of GFP while time also influence the result to some extent as difference appears in the weight of influence caused by promoters and RBSs as time went by.To get more useful information,we conduct a variance analysis to evaluate the effect of these factors.Sheets above are the results we get. Basically we have a closer look at these data by dividing them by hour and seeing how different growth status can influence the results.And as we can see in all the sheets, in general the main factors with significant difference are promoters,interaction effects and replicates,which causes us great interest. It’s obviously that at 0 h all cultures’ conditions are almost the same.From sheets describing the data of 2 h, we can see that there are significant difference among different promoters as well as interaction effects between promoters and RBSs(elements) while different elements didn’t show that significance.Analysing the results of 4 h, we can see that promoters and interaction effects are still the factors with significant difference,while the p-value of elements(RBSs) is much smaller than 2 h.It seems that the elements function later than promoters, however, more supporting information is needed.An interesting conclusion from 6 h’s result is the contribution of elements for significant difference are larger, which seems confirmed the suppose above.That’s a quite charming discovery, maybe this can help studying the temporal regulation of gene expression regulation.
Conclusion
All the forms we get from the analysis show that different promoters and different interaction effects between promoters and elements have significant difference.Also we find the tendency that as time goes by, different elements shows larger and larger difference.However, all these finding and problems are open questions and we welcome any innovation helps explaining all these findings and solving problems.We can be reached at nkuigem2017@163.com.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#18 September 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," the cotC BioBrick into pMUTIN4 and had attempted to transform DH5-alpha E. coli with this product. Several colonies were found on the LB + chloramphenicol plate the trasnformants had been plated onto which suggested both the ligations and the transformations had worked well. Mini-preps were then carried out for 12 colonies in the 16/09/09 Lab Session and digested. When ran on gel, the 2 bands created did not match the expected sizes but there was consistency for most of the samples. This led us to think that it was the restriction enzymes to blame and ruled out contamination.
Based on this decision, the Metal Sensing team conducted a midi-prep on colony 8 LB culture (seen as colony 8 had the clearest bands) and had digested the DNA (see the 17/09/09 Lab Session ). The team then attempted to run 10ul of the digest on agrose gel through DNA gel electrophoresis but the DNA ladder was faulty and the bands seemed faint. Today's midi-prep analysis is a second attempt of this procedure.
It can be seen that the gel photograph shows some erroneous results; there is only one band in sight when there should be two (pMUTIN4 and cotC-GFP-smtA bands) and the band formed lies just underneath the 4,361 band from the HindIII DNA ladder. This size neither matches pMUTIN4 or cotC-GFP-smtA indicating a huge error.
Conclusion
We will have to abandon the potential Bacillus subtilis transformations and consider carrying out a second attempt at ligating together pMUTIN4 and cotC-GFP-smtA.

Although we loaded the samples as the electrophoresis protocol suggests there was a change made to the preparation of the DNA samples; each of the nine samples consisted of:
10ul of distilled water
5ul of plasmid DNA (along with BioBrick)
2ul of loading buffer/dye
The DNA gel electrophoresis was allowed to commence for 40 minutes under 100volts. Once this time had elapsed a photograph was taken of the gel under UV light using the GelDoc system. This is the photograph:
Not a lot can be determined from this photograph because none of the mini-prep samples have been digested by any restriction enzymes yet. However one thing to note is the consistency in the three sets of wells - all of the BBa_C0056 mini-prep samples (samples 1-3) look similar in layout, the BBa_B1002 mini-prep samples (samples 4-6) also look similar and the BBa_R0077 DNA samples (samples 7-9) look very similar. Although this gel photograph is not enough to make conclusions as to whether the plasmids are actually there, there is enough evidence to suggest that there is no contamination and that DNA is certainly present.
Conclusion
Carry out restriction enzyme digests of the 9 mini-prepped DNA to ensure that the correct DNA has been transformed - the enzymes to be used are EcoRI and PstI.

Plasmid construction
We have successfully constructed 11 parts that have been described in detail in the previous design page. (Flagellar filament module)
In display module, we constructed and validated the following 6 parts. They are pYD1-FliC (BBa_K2220002) , pYD1-XynA (BBa_K2220004) , pYD1-PETase (BBa_K2220005) , pYD1-BG (BBa_K2220007) , pYD1-EG (BBa_K2220006) , and pYD1-CBH (BBa_K2220008) , which means to fuse the target gene sequences with AGA2 gene respectively. We also constructed pYD1-FilC(eGFP) (BBa_K2220003) as our positive control. The length and sequence of each parts have been validated by sequencing and electrophoresis. The length validation are presented on the part registry page.

After the auction we had a BBQ together. A local butcher       sponsored the meat for it (Thanks to De Groene Weg Slagerij       Groningen!). The income of the BBQ also partially funded our       project. The evening ended with an exciting tip-stacking       competition which peaked in a final between a 2016 iGEMer and an       ex-iGEMer.
UK
The university of Groningen publishes its own newspaper, the       university paper or UK for short. In order to spread awareness       regarding our project and synthetic biology, we approached them to       write a piece about us. They were very enthusiastic and curious       about our project. To learn more Simone came over to our office to       discuss the details of CryptoGErM. She even visited our auction to       get a better feeling for the team and witness our presentation. The       article can be read here .
Lifeline
Lifeline is a monthly magazine published by study association     Idun. This association has members from both the studies Biology     and Life Science & Technology. Because of their readers’     background, they were very interested in our project. The magazine     is send to Iduns 1700 members and is always very well received. The article in Lifeline will be published at the end of November.
Unifocus
Unifocus is a video magazine that publishes interesting       and educational videos concerning the university and its       students. We were really excited to have a professional       video made. At first we were a little giddy, but soon we       got used to the spotlight and continued our work while the       interview took place. The video can be viewed on their       website , or right here:
New Scientist
On September 15th we were excitedly waiting in front of the iGEM       office phone to be interviewed by a New Scientist reporter.

UrbanTundra_Edmonton,2017,Team:UrbanTundra Edmonton#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," contamination is a result of utilizing products containing perchlorate. Acting as a strong oxidizer, perchlorate is commonly used in solid propellants for rockets, missiles, fireworks, and other pyrotechnics (Backus et al. 334). Perchlorate deposits on soil surfaces are initially a result of utilizing pyrotechnics, such as fireworks during festivals. This particulate matter containing perchlorate consequently is dispersed into remote areas by wind (Ye et al. 2495). Furthermore, sufficient precipitation may transport the perchlorate contaminants away from the area through surface runoff (Kumarathilaka et al. 671). Although disruption of the thyroid gland’s functions require large doses of perchlorate, it remains a chemical that is found in various locations on Earth and can lead to adverse effects, all of which must be carefully considered.

BBa_K2077002: pSB416 GPD mls-yeGFP
Overview
According to 2015 Rose-Hulman iGEM team, the coding sequence of mitochondrial ribosomal protein mRPS12 starts with a mitochondrial localization signal (mls). From previous research, it is possible that this mls protein is able to transport and direct any attached protein into the mitochondria. To verify the hypothesis brought up in 2015, we constructed a hybrid system with the mls protein and a reporter protein. Instead of using the regular GFP, yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein (yeGFP) was used in this system as optimal gene expression can be achieved [1].
Methods & Design
The first step was to isolate mls fragment from pSBIC3 mRPS12 mls submitted last year. To do that, we digested the pSBIC3 mRPS12 mls plasmid with EarI and SpeI. After extracting DNA from the gel, we performed NEBuilder to insert yeGFP into the pSBIC3 vector, followed by transformation on LB-chloro plates. Then, we picked colonies from transformation plates and inoculated in LB-chloro broth overnight, followed by minipreping them. The diagnostic gel showed positive results on these minipreps, indicating that mls-yeGFP construct was successfully made. Next, we inserted the mRPS12 mls-yeGFP fragment into yeast vector pSB416 GPD vector and transformed the new plasmid into competent E. Coli cells. After picking colonies from LB-amp plate and inoculating them in LB-amp broth, we minipreped the culture and performed a diagnostic gel. The results of the diagnostic gel confirmed that the transformation of mls-yeGFP and pSB416 GPD was successful. Then we followed yeast transformation protocol to clone the new plasmid, pSB416 GPD mls-yeGFP, into S. cerevisiae cells and plate them on CSM-Ura for future fluorescence quantitative analysis. To prepare cells for microscopy, GFP fixation protocol was conducted. On the slide we prepared, the negative control was wild type yeast cells transformed with empty pSB416 GPD"

Statistic Model
Introduction
Statistic analysis can give us a clear and scientific understanding of our complex data, that was the reason why we construct a statistical model for our experimental data.
The data from simulating room were subjected to statistic analysis to determine whether there are significantly different in migration rate, mortality and gnawing rate using One-way ANOVA. Levene’s test to determine whether each group is homogeneity, then T-test for pooled data in pairwise gave us the value and finally to evaluate significant difference.
Levene’s test
Levene’s test is used to assess the equality of variances for a variable from two or more groups. In our model, we have four independent groups. Since in the following procedures for T-test, we assume that the variances of the populations from four samples are equal, so we need to test whether the following variances can be assume to be equal.
Assumptions:
1. Due to the advantage of Levene’s test, we do not need to assume the normal data
2. Null hypothesis that all populations from samples have the same variances $$ H_{0}:\sigma _{1}=\sigma _{2}=\cdots \sigma _{k}, \quad H_{A}:\sigma _{i}\neq \sigma _{j}, \quad \alpha =0.05 $$
The Levene Statistic (W) of each groups is calculated by: $$ W{=}\dfrac {\left( N-k\right) }{\left( k-1\right) } \dfrac {\sum ^{k}_{i=1}N_{i}\left( Z_{i\cdot}-Z_{i"

Two separate production phases were performed. The first involved our Cerberus protein in its water box, with no constraints  on any region of the system. It ran for 120ns. The second featured a distance constraint between the sulfur atom of the biotin molecule and the alpha carbon of the nearby glycine 14 residue, to keep it within range of its associated binding site. This one ran for 80ns.
Both simulations were performed at constant temperature (310K) and pressure (1 bar) and with an integration time step of 2fs.
NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation for large systems11. NAMD was developed by the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group in the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It is based on Charm++ parallel object, and scales well on up to thousands of cores for the largest simulations.  NAMD is compatible with the Amber force fields generated during the previous phases, it was therefore easy to reuse these parameters.
Simulations were performed on Amber16 for the minimisation, heating and equilibration phases of the dynamics workflow, and NAMD for the production phase due to its higher multiprocessor capacities. The first three steps were run on 80 processors in parallel, whereas production was performed on 1000.

UV image of strepavidin binding peptides
incubated with strepavidin and washed.
Fluorescence of strepavidin binding protein with GGSG linker and INP repeats. The INP repeats greatly improved display.
Conclusion
While at first it seems trivial to display a small peptide such as the strepavidin binding protein, from the results, it seems that this is not the case. Many of the displayed strepavidin binding proteins did not work. There seems to be a strong context effect between the linker sequence used and the function of the displayed protein. The use of a larger linkers such as an INP repeat seems to help the cell surface display.

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#HP rapport_-_-_TEXT.html," this chapter will be largely based on historians', philosophers', and psychologists' opinions of why society is prone to expanding and even colonizing.
First of all, imperialism is essentially extending national territory by impounding other countries' territory and can be compared to extending territory to other planets like Mars, as is being discussed in this report.
There has been presented several theories of the reasoning behind imperialism. It can be useful to divide the years around the height of imperialism into phases. To shed some light on the extent of imperialism, European possessions covered 55% of the Earth in 1800, 67% in 1878 and 84,4% in 1914 (Nielsen, 1979). There are many possible phase divisions so we're going to continue with the phases suggested by English historian D. K. Fieldhouse. The following sequence is cited from Nielsen, 1979.
The period leading up to 1882 was characterized mostly by local conquests of land. Generally, the interest in expansion wasn't part of a larger plan but happened because of immediate needs such as security, local trade and missionary affiliation. The government didn't directly take responsibility for this but could secured the responsible explorers, tradespeople etc. through treaties. This type of imperialism is referred to as informal.
In the period of 1883-1890 the way imperialism worked changed remarkably. European governments claimed almost all of Africa, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. This happened largely as a consequence of Prussian chancellor Bismarck's agenda of conquering both for domestic and foreign political purposes. Domestically, he wished for political support from nationalist liberals, foreignly he wanted to have lands to trade with other diplomats. This led to diplomats following his methods and dividing lands between them.
In the period of 1890-1914, mostly consisted of keeping the lands that was won in the previous year. Eagerness to conquer the remaining lands also defined these years.
In conclusion, imperialism was fuelled by many different intentions. In the earlier years they were more immediate and less planned out, but later they would be part of a strategic expansion of lands both for purposes such as power and trade. Lastly, diplomats became more desperate to conquer lands thus leading to great disputes between powers.
Connecting this to actual possession of Martian land is hard seeing as there are so many possible intentions for wanting to expand. The intentions defined by the earlier years of imperialism such as exploration and trade are possible contenders. In the later years, the reasons for colonizing and expanding were largely due to political manifestation of power. There are several different modern views on imperialism"

I have been always interested in biology, also I had great interest in synthetic biology which i couldn't quite improve until my juniour class at ITU. Now, I can gladly say that being iGEM member satisfy my curiosity about the subject. Moreover,preparing a project, and learning of it's entire steps are fullfilled by IGEM project and my teammates. Besides all the scientific addition that IGEM provides oneself, a person can learn to be a part of a team, to be confident with the things you create all together, and absolutely there is success you can experience by IGEM. Not even mentioning the fun we had! See you in the upcoming years fellows:)
Tuğçe Önür: I am a senior student in the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetic. iGEM is the great chance to get wet-lab and research experience for me. I have already interested in biotechnology/microbiology and now I am aware of I really want to engage in these types of research. I worked on kill-switch module in our project. In addition; travelling, camping, natural sports and taking photos are the other things that make me happy.
Seda Karabacak: Hi everyone, I am Seda  This is the last year for me at Mathematical Engineering department in ITU and first year at iGEM like all other friends. I am responsible for modelling and web site design. Let see “How I met iGEM?”.. One day after the lesson, one of my friend who is Recep (Our Godfather), suggested me to join the team. I’d never thought being a member of such a team but I said myself “Why not, it can be great opportunity” and than I accepted his suggestion. I never regretted even ones and always glad to be a part of iGEM. Because I learnt so many things thanks to iGEM competition. Many thanks to all team member and iGEM…
Mertcan Akyürek: Hello everyone! I am Can. I am studying Engineering Physics as a senior student.  Since I am interested in biology, genetics, neuroscience, biophysics, computers and programming, as well, I've taken part in this team to help my team mates for modelling and website designing. I am glad to be in iGEM so that I can improve my knowledge and skills.

Fig 6.All bands the size of the proteins of interest expressed from the induced magnesium chelatase plasmid were extracted from the SDS PAGE. MALDI TOF analysis of these proteins revealed that ChlH and ChlI2 were expressed successfully according to GPM.
Fig 7.Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra demonstrating the production of Mg-PPIX upon the addition of Mg-chelatase plasmid to ΔhemeH mutants. Mg-PPIX has an emission and excitation spectra of 418nm and 590nm respectively.
Fig 8.Emission and excitation spectra of the in vitro assay of Mg-chelatase from the Mg-P plasmid. Zero time control is the initial emission/excitation spectra when Mg-chelatase is added to 10mM PPIX, 10mM ATP and 15mM MgCl2. After incubating the assay under constant reagents as the control at room temperature, Mg-PPIX production increases. When additional 50mM MgCl2 is added to the assay in comparison to the control, Mg-PPIX is production increases further. However, upon addition of 50mM MgCl2 including 20nM of ChlID complex, the production of Mg-PPIX remains the same. Since adding additional ChlID enzyme to the last assay does not change Mg-PPIX production, the ChlID complex is not limiting.
Collaboration with NTU Singapore
NTU Singapore helped us Team Macquarie by completing a RT-PCR to test if our Mg-chelatase plasmid is being expressed under IPTG induction.

MIT 2006 (USA) – Mention of mutant LoxP sites to prevent inversion of sequences (Lox66 and Lox71)
Imperial College 2006 (London) – Biological oscillator by using the CRE/Lox system as a switch by incorporating DNA to prevent downstream transcription. In the end used Quorum Sensing to create a predator – pray system.
Paris 2007 (France) – (Synthetic Multicellular Bacterium) Use of CRE/Lox system to influence differentiation in germ line, because it was readily available, largely used and well described. Low concentrations of DAP triggered the transcription of Cre-recombinase (under the influence of DAP-sensitive promoter), which caused the removal of a gene required for bacterial reproduction by site-specific recombination (SSR), and resulted in"

Notebook – Protocol – 3. Electrophoresis and DNA visualization
1.50x TAE (Thermoscientific) was diluted to 1x TAE (1 ml 50x TAE + 49 ml distilled water).
2. 3 g of Agarose S (Nippongene) was added into 200 ml of 1x TAE to get 1.5 % agarose gel in a glass flask.
3. Agarose was melted by putting the glass flask in boiled water – we have no microwave – and sometimes stirred slowly to avoid bubble formation with stirrer bar on a stirrer.
4. Completely melted agarose solution was poured into the casting tray with comb.
5. Let the gel became solid by incubating at room temperature for 30 minutes.
6. Electrophoresis was done in 1x TAE buffer in an electrophoresis tank (Mupid)
7. The volume of samples used for electrophoresis was 7 ul for 1 kB DNA ladder and 10 ul (PCR product), or 15 ul (Restriction enzyme digestion product) for DNA samples for each well.
8. Electrophoresis was done for 20 minutes using 135V setting.
9. After electrophoresis, gel was put into 1x TAE solution containing Sybrsafe to stain the DNA for about 20 minutes.
10. Then gel was placed on trans illuminator for viewing and documentation using pocket digital camera.
11. The file was viewed with computer using Photoshop.

In order to reveal the yeast's influences on cadmium ions, we culture Cd Yeast, S1 and BY4741 in YPD liquid medium for 24 hours. After that the 16 mg/L cadmium ions solution is added to the media. The yeast cells are cultured in this solution for another 40 hours (30℃). The concentration of cadmium ions in the supernatant is measured every 5 hours.
5) Separation of Copper and Cadmium Ions
In the end, the accumulated S.C-Cu yeast strain is cultured in Sc medium with raffinose including copper ions and cadmium ions for 32 hours. Galactose is added after 12 hours of culture. Switch will be activated. The separation of Copper and Cadmium ions will be observed in heavy metal curve.

During the Fête de la Science in October, we did not only see kids but we also saw mothers and fathers, as amazed as their children by the experiments we made with them.
After a talk with Guillaume HUTZLER, an Assistant Professor in the University of Evry belonging to the IBISC laboratory (Informatics, Integrative Biology and Complex Systems), we decided to create an interactive rug to make the larger public understand how logic gates works in a biological system:
OUR INTERVENTION FOR PREPARATORY STUDENTS
The intervention for preparatory students was something we really cared about because we had found that high-schoolers, and even first year biology students, seem to share the larger public’s has lack of knowledge and misconceptions about biology’s large scope of applications.
We participated in the Journée Portes Ouvertes (or open day) at the University of Evry Paris-Saclay. Our intent was clear: showing to future biology students that biology is not just about observing the flora and fauna and showing them that synthetic biology is a very large and interesting discipline.
To do so, we presented the project idea of our team and the projects of past iGEM teams of Evry Paris-Saclay. As the Journée Portes Ouvertes was too early to present our own project, we presented the project of the 2017 team and their adventure in Boston thanks to a video they made of their trip and their presentation in the U.S.
We also tried to introduce synthetic biology to the students using a candy-DNA system where students made their own BioBricks and transformed cells with their candy-DNA. After this introduction, we asked people to think about a project only feasible using tools of synthetic biology. While some funny and aesthetic projects like “the rainbow carrot” were proposed, other proposals were more application-oriented: like bacteria able to cure trees sick from Cameraria ohridella, or a biological gyroscope for space rockets.
Our synthetic biology recruiters : Suzanne, Marine, Solène, Nada, Adèle and Esteban.
OUR INTERVENTION FOR EXPERIENCED STUDENTS
We also wanted to work with experimental biology students and be helpful to them. That’s why we invited two students for an internship in our lab, who worked with our team. It was a clear success and the intern students became team members in their own right.
For instance, Camille, a biology student, needed to finish her last school year with an internship. She was interested in working on our project and with students, and not teachers, because she wanted to have the possibility"

All the cost-effective primary prevention should have been implemented as far as practicable
Smoking cessation is the most effective primary prevention for NSCLC [6] , as smoking is responsible for 90% of cases. [7] In the UK, the government has implemented numerous policies to reduce rates of smoking. These include heavily taxing tobacco, banning TV advertising and requiring cigarette packets to have “smoking kills” branding.
Rates of smoking are declining [8] , although they are still sufficiently high for lung cancer to remain as prevalent it is. Primary prevention to secondhand smoke has also been implemented as far as impossible - with smoking banned in enclosed workplaces, public buildings and on public transport. [9] However, no further measures can be taken to avoid exposure by going outside.
The other risk factors for cancer are less well known - as there are a myriad of carcinogens in the world we live in - the food standards agency works to minimize carcinogens in food, drugs and cosmetics, [10] while NICE ensures that medical radiation exposure is minimized.
The screening test should be simple, safe, precise and validated
As we are using a cell free system, our test is safe. Our test would comprise a blood test, followed by miRNA purification and fluorescence measurements which are all relatively simple. These steps do not require the expertise of radiologists that are needed for CT scans. However, for our test to be shown to be precise and validated, further characterisation is required with the miRNA biomarkers and validation with a large data set of patients.
There should be evidence that intervention at a pre-symptomatic stage leads to better outcomes
NSCLC is far easier to treat in its earlier stages. The same is true for almost all cancers, as once a cancer has metastasized it can only be treated palliatively. Early stage tumors can be surgically excised and treated adjuvantly with curative intent.
The test should be acceptable to the target population
From a patient’s perspective, our sensor would just be a blood test. As such there should not be any issues with it. We are using a cell free systems which is sterile and abiotic - there are no bacteria involved which could potentially give rise to objections.
There should be a policy on further diagnostic investigation of those with a positive test result.
There should be agreed policies covering which individuals should be offered interventions and what the the appropriate intervention offered is assurance standards
We have investigated this in silver human practices - those with a positive result would go onto have a CT scan and move onto the standard NICE"

Research Limit
There are three main limit to our research:
1. The limit of transfer effectiveness access. Information sufficiency is highly related to the audience needs, thus it is challenging to define and     measure whether or not the information presented is sufficient. In addition, in our research, we are not going to do any experiment and survey testing     whether the 2 elements we investigating in would really affect the transfer effectiveness. All we could do is cite it from paper. Here are some cases we     consider it helpful for iGEMers who are also interested in social research.
u In 2015 iGEM Oxford , the problem they want to tackle with is presented as below:
• Antibiotics have negative side effects and their resistance is a growing problem
• UTIs are the most common hospital-acquired infection and the bacteria that cause them are frequently resistant to antibiotics
• Antibiotic resistance in UTIs is caused by biofilms
• Biofilms are currently estimated to be responsible for over 65% of all hospital-acquired infections
• Current UTI treatments are ineffective and fail to prevent recurrent infections
It could be hard to tell if the sentence “Antibiotic resistance in UTIs is caused by biofilms” be categorized into providing 1 attribution of     responsibility, since biofilm cannot be a cause if there is no antibiotic.
u We confront another situation in deciding how many attribution of responsibilities are provided, see 2013 igem TU-Munich :
Antibiotics, hormones and various noxious substances threaten environmental health and are not effectively removed by conventional waste water         treatment.
They provide three attributions to the issue in a sentence, we finally decided they fulfill the item of providing more than three attribution of     responsibility.
In more case, iGEM teams wrote down sentences in a straight-forward, affirmative voice,"

Aberdeen_Scotland,2014,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html,"Mathematical modelling proved to be extremely useful to the team, it flagged up that an ELISA assay would probably not work, and as such when this gave poor results it was immediately abandoned in favour of a magnetic pull-down assay.  It was also able to predict what the optimum ratio of “sender” to “receiver” cultures would be to give the best signal-to-noise ratio.  As the ultimate goal of our project was to deploy a HAT detection kit in Africa, a cheap GFP detector would be needed, the only ones on the market are highly precise and expensive.  A working DIY detector was created from off-the-shelf parts that cost less than £100 total and could be powered by a cheap solar-cell.
Parts and Quorum Testing
Team Member: James McAvoy carried out the following work;
This task can be split into three components.  1. Testing the individual expression of FLAG by Ag43 and INP use of anti-FLAG antibodies and fluorescence microscopy to see whether the plasmids worked.  2. Producing the composite cells (with Ag43 or INP plasmid, sender or receiver plasmid, and RFP identification plasmid all in the same cell).  3. Quorum-testing was a data-intensive task, these two cell cultures were tested with anti-GFP and anti-FLAG antibodies.  At first ELISA-type assays were used to achieve this but these produced very poor results and were upgraded to a magnetic bead pull-down assay which were much better and gave us a proof-of-concept.

Education and Public Engagement
Ethics
Education
Whatever the challenge, it is important to spread passion to the researchers of tomorrow. Unfortunately synthetic biology is barely introduced in Denmark at the high school level. Combined with that the public is starting to get “GMO scared”, this poses a great threat to what can be accomplished within the field of synthetic biology, we think that the correct solution to this is education both of students and of the general public. This is why we have decided to focus as much as we have on the Biosensor project, and education in general.
High school student
To spread word about iGEM and synthetic biology to future students within the field we invited a high school student, Minh Greulich, to be a part of the team.
Minh assisted on the interlab study, helped us test the protocol for the Biosensor project and did some creative work related to the wiki.
This is what Minh had to say about her experience being on the team: ""It was surprising for me,  to experience such a relaxed and playful environment, despite the very serious and difficult nature of the work. My takeaway from participating in the project was that biomedicine is a field of work, where you can be sure to contribute to improving the world, and still have a life whilst doing so.""
By helping us in the lab, Minh gained valuable skills and learned what it means to be a part of a team. She was eager to learn and enthusiastic about the project.
Biosensor
We aim to engage high school students at a broader scale, through the development and distribution of educational material and exercise material for assembling their first biosensor.
The need to develop this also stems from The Danish legislation is tough on synthetic biology, and it is not possible for high school students to make their own plasmid modifications . We have, together with the Danish organization Biotech Academy’s Biosensor project, made a free kit that will be distributed to high schools. This kit enables an average high school student to work with synthetic biology at his or her own school - while still taking the law into consideration.
The Biosensor project is an effort to expose Danish high school students to the world of experimental synthetic biology. The Biosensor kit makes it possible for high school students to work with biobricks.
The Biosensor project was created by DTU’s iGEM teams from 2015 and 2016 , Biotech Academy, and further developed by the BioBuilders’ "

Our Brand New Magazine""iGEM"" Has Come Out!
This summer，the innovation club collaborating with iGEM-SCUT publish a brand new synthetic biology column including introduce amazing projects，share touching stories，spread the seed of SB，experience meaningful vocation, have a taste of a different science adventure.
The Overview of Synthetic Biology
iGEM began in 2005 hosted by MIT occupying as the highest international academic competition specializing in Synthetic Biology（SB）. SB try to redesign the natural biology system or design and construct artificial biology part and system which aims to create new biology system via the understanding of running mechanism of natural biology system.
Unlike genetic engineering which utilize one species’ gene to replicate ,mutate and transfer into another species as their way, SB’s goal is to build an artificial biosystem which can operate as the circuit. To simplify, for a SBer any genetic information which achieve relevant biology function could be standardize as part and with the utilization of the parts SBer could assemble them into a certain function biosystem. To illustrate, these gene with standard interface play a similar role as the electronic bricks with standard electric interface，as long as it could construct a circuit, we could use any protocol to assemble it into different variety of either interesting or functional electric equipment.
The Overview of iGEM
In this competition, each team could design their project freely, and students make full use of their extra time to accomplish corresponding experiment. This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method as well as a way to cultivate students’ passion of science. Students who participate in the competition could submit their useful results to the MIT organizing committee while all the results will be shared to the scientists all over the world. Moreover, iGEM provide a platform for people in different majors and different countries have a great opportunity to communicate with each other. IGEM have three divisions before Asia, America, Europe included. In different areas competition, the most special or outstanding group would be chosen to the finals at MIT.
In China, Tsinghua, Peking, USTC, SJTU and Tianjin first participate in iGEM in 2009. But nowadays, Chinese university show an rapidly increasing trend in this competition, reached approximately 60 teams this year. Last year, iGEM-SCUT won silver medal in Asia division in their first participation with successfully build up a communication between eukary"

Now we see cell A successfully ‘grow’ into present grid and has its duplicate cell B. Note that when B is generated, placement rules mentioned above will be applied according to B’s type and position.

1 ml protogel
1.5 ml 4 x Upper Tris
3,5 ml H2O
36 μl ammonium persulphate (APS) (10%)
3 μl N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED)
All substances were mixed by inversion. 1 ml was applied on top of the already set resolving gel and a comb was put in. Once the gel was set, the comb was taken out and the wells were cleaned out with sterile water. The set gels were removed from the setting rig and placed in the running rig. 1x running buffer was poured into the rig ensuring the plates were covered. For protein preparation, 30 µg protein in 10 µl H20 and 2,5 µl 5 x Laemmli buffer were denatured for 5 minutes at 95 °C. Then 6 µl marker (unstained marker for coomassie-staining or prestained marker for Western Blot) was put into a well. The remaining wells were filled with 12,5 µl of the protein that was to be analyzed. The SDS-PAGE was performed at 120 V for about 1,5 h. For coomassie staining, the gel was incubated in coomassie staining dye for 20 minutes, then put into the first decolorizing solution for 20 minutes. Finally. the gel was put into a second decolorizing solution until the background color was gone. Another method that was used for protein staining was silver staining.

Tec-Chihuahua,2017,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#description_-_-_TEXT.html,"ora but this can be considered as an opportunity for better characterization of the aiiA gene
Concerning C-di-GMP there we found that it is a key component of the regulatory networks that govern the expression of virulence traits in E. amylovora. This secondary intracellular messenger molecule is involved in the regulation of many cellular processes in numerous bacterial species, including the transition from a motile to sessile lifestyle, virulence, biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides and adhesion structures. Thus it is demonstrated that at high concentration of c-di-GMP induces a positive regulation of biofilm formation and represses motility. The gene yhjH encodes for Cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase, which makes di-GMP linear. As consequence of this molecule disruption, the biofilm formation would be inhibited, but it will promote an increase in motility due to a low or nonexisting c-di-GMP concentration (Jonas,2009).
At this point it is necessary to inhibit the fourth and last virulence factor for this pathogen, motility. Here we include the third gene epsE which encodes to a Putative Glycosyltransferase, arresting flagellar rotation, by disengaging motor force-generating elements in cells embedded in the biofilm matrix. According to the bibliography, it is believed that the espE enzyme interacts with FliG interrupting the MotA-FliG interaction, stopping the flagellar spinning resembling a clutch. The specific reaction and region that interacts with FliG are still unknown (Jonas, 2009)
Applications and Implications
As described in the past section, the project will involve the synthesis and expression of four biobricks.

UFMG_Brazil,2014,Team:UFMG Brazil#Project#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," both TALE domains in the DNA, to perform our mathematical modeling.
Results
Two PDB proteins were selected as templates for model building. For the N-terminal part of our molecule, the crystal structure of TAL effector (3UGM) was selected and for the C-terminal part, mCherry (2H5Q) was used. Except for the linker region, the templates had 100% coverage and close to 100% identity against our sequences (99.4% to mCherry1, 100% to mCherry2 and 92.9% for both TALE parts). After modeling we selected the best Z-DOPE scores models for each protein (figure 1). Our model consists of six concatenated TALES self-associated shaped as a right-handed superhelix wrapped around the DNA major groove and connected by a linker to a hemicherry beta barrel structure.
Assessment of model quality for each protein through the QMEAN Server showed that our models have high quality, with |Z-scores| lesser than 1. QMEAN is a composite scoring function which is able to derive both global and local error estimates on the basis of one single model. The QMEAN Z-score indicates how many standard deviations the score differs from the expected values ​​of experimental structures. This is illustrated in the two graphs in figure 2, where being closer to black better reflects and low Z-score and low standard deviation.
To estimate if our models would be able to bind to DNA while maintaining the restituted mCherry conformation, we aligned both parts to the structure of the active form and kept their TALE domains spatially in a linear configuration. This showed that our models are compatible with DNA binding and mCherry restitution. We also calculated the inner distance between both linked TALES, which resulted in 35 Å, suggesting that there must be approximately 10 DNA base pairs between each (GT)6 binding region (Figure 3).
Probabilistic models
To estimate the chance of our protein binding to human DNA ...
... we built a repeat library using as  template the human chromosome 1, using RepeatScout v1.0.5 (Price et al., 2005) and RepeatMasker 3.0 (Smit et al., 2010) programs. The repeat library was initially composed by all possible repetition patterns. Then, we selected just the (GT)n and (CA)n repetitions, which are recognized by our TALE protein domains (Figure1). In both cases, the most frequent tandem repeats sizes were between 15 and 24"

This PCR reaction was done to amplify sgRNA template for EPO. There are two different sgRNA that will target slightly different position of EPO cDNA. The two templates will be addressed as sgRNA for EPO1 and sgRNA for EPO2. To amplify  sgRNA for EPO1 and EPO2 (125bp), high fidelity PCR was done using sgRNA for EPO gBlocks as template DNA and either 033 and 034 or 035 and 034 as forward and reverse primers respectively. 2 50µL PCR mixtures were prepared for each amplification of sgRNA for EPO, according to the High Fidelity PCR protocol. 1 50µl of PCR mixtures with no template and primer 035 and 034 were prepared in parallel for negative control.

More  importantly we talked about the importance of natural sciences and synthetic biology in particular to  the society, especially when dealing with issues like health, nutrition and the environment.  Our efforts proved fruitful, as we have managed to be featured and seen many times.  We had an interview for Radio Študent, where our team member talked about the iGEM competition  and importance of biofuel. You can hear the full recording (in Slovene) here.  We had two interviews for evening news programs, talking about engagement of youth in sciences,  biobutanol and going from idea to a publicly available functioning product in synthetic biology.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Mutation#Assembly_-_-_TEXT.html,"asmid mutagenesis system is a complex mechanism.     This means that changes in the expression levels of error-prone polymerase (e.g. overexpression) oftentimes yields no     additional mutagenesis effect. Because of this we decided to use the complete genetic construct provided by M. Camps as     device for mutagenesis with the polymerase I. The devices contains the error-prone polymerase I under control of the lac-promoter.
Figure 2: Schematic view of the error-prone polymerase I under control of a lac-promoter.
We made the error-prone polymerase I coding sequence aviable asexpression device available as basic part ( BBa_K2082106 ).     As negative controls we also added the wild type E. coli polymerase I coding sequence ( BBa_K2082107 )
We characterized BBa_K2082106 and BBa_K2082107 under    control of a lac-promoter.    We used the expression devices for the error-prone polymerase I and the wild type polymerase I in the plasmid pHSG, which resemebles the iGEM     backbone pSB4C5, because of its pSC101 origin of replication.
Genome wide mutator
We wanted to port the mutator plasmid described by Badran and coworkers (Badran and Liu 2015) to the iGEM standard.
This is a mutation device consisting of six genes which modulate the E. coli fidelity mechanism     (for a detailed explanation see here ).     Because of the potential hazardous effect of the potent mutator genes we decided to use the described, tightly regulated     arabinose promoter. In addition we thought that low level expression of the mutagenic protein is enough to achieve a mutator phenotype.     Furthermore the expression strength of our arabinose promoter under complete induction is high enough to obtain sufficient     amounts of proteins even when more is needed.
Therefore, we decided that it is more beneficial for the controllability of our mutator constrauct to use a very weak ribosome binding     site. We used BBa_B0031 as appropriately pretty weak RBS.
As for the genes for our mutator plasmid we build upon the work done by Badran and coworkers, who already tested several     combinations of mutator genes and found a combination with high mutagenesis rate and broad spectrum.
The six genes are dnaQ926, dam, seqA, emrR, ugi and P. marinus cda1. dnaQ926 ,"

Therefore we also wan to try RFP and see which will give us the best results or fluorescence.
Towards the end of the summer we had to abandon our project to do more fundraising for the upcoming Giant Jamboree. As soon as school started it was very difficult for us to meet and continue our work.
Another problem is the size of our parts OspA is 993bp, WSP is 885 and GFP is 870. This means that characterizing these proteins will also be difficult since they will have a similar molecular weight. There is no antibody for WSP so that means we'll have to have it made before we can characterize it.
Even though we had many difficulties and next year it will still be an uphill battle, although, not as big as the one this year. We are more excited than ever about our project, we think it holds true potential and we might be able to make a difference in peoples'lives.
Our goal is to make a company and develop more living vaccines for other insect born diseases such as: malaria, West Nile virus, Chagas etc."

Thanks to her female influence, all male modellers are doomed to follow a strict time schedule. When she’s not roaming the world of synthetic biology, she often goes swimming or is busy reading books. Interestingly, she has an incomprehensible affection for insects –even loves to eat them as well- and loves to go to metal festivals –completely dressed up.

He is a busy bird as he is part of the European students organisation BEST as well as iGEM. Tomas is also exploring the world of entomophagy, although aphids are still not in his every day diet. He is part of the modelling team, where he is busy trying to make a model of the ecology around the bacteria. He has developed a rather special bond with teammate Bert, of which the extent is still a mystery to us.

Post-Doc
Ingmar is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre of Microbial and Plant Genetics . After his studies of bio-engineering, he did a PhD on the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. In this PhD, he studied the factors determining the probiotic effect of the L. rhamnosus GG in experimental colitis. Interdisciplinary studies were performed combining bacterial genetics and immunology. He always had and still has a profound interest in scientific research, especially linking applied microbiology, mucosal immunology and health issues. The opportunity to guide the students on this iGEM project in a rather new field of synthetic biology looked very appealing and fascinating but also challenging.

Beta-Amyloid Degradation Model
Introduction
This is another degradation model we designed to help UCL 2013 iGEM team with their Beta-Amyloid Degradation Assays . Beta-Amyloid is known as the component of Amyloids Plaque in association with Alzheimer's disease (AD) , in which the target of UCL iGEM this year. Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) was discovered to be able to degrade Beta-Amyloid that can be potentially used to cure Alzheimer's disease. The model provides simulations about how efficient is MMP-9 enzyme to degrade Beta-Amyloids.
Description
Objective
The Mathematical model was built in MATLAB extension Simbiology, it will predict how long will take to degrade a certain concentration of Beta-Amyloid by a given amount of MMP-9 enzyme. The simulation results can help UCL iGEM team to modify their assays in order to achieve better experimental results. The model can also be used to provide a preliminary prediction of degrading Amyloid Plaque in vivo.

BBa_J23109: Constitutive promoter family. Parts J23100 through J23119 are a family of constitutive promoter parts isolated from a small combinatorial library. J23119 is the ""consensus"" promoter sequence and the strongest member of the family. All parts except J23119 are present in plasmid J61002. Part J23119 is present in pSB1A2. This places the RFP downstream of the promoter. Reported activities of the promoters are given as the relative fluorescence of these plasmids in strain TG1 grown in LB media to saturation. See part J61002 for details on their use. These promoter parts can be used to tune the expression level of constitutively expressed parts. The NheI and AvrII restriction sites present within these promoter parts make them a scaffold for further modification. Ampicillin resistant.

Imperial_College_London,2009,Team:Imperial College London#Wetlab#Protocols#ColanicAcid_-_-_TEXT.html," the protective effect of colanic acid:
This stage of the assay works on the principle that acid will lyse cells resulting the the denaturation of internal GFP marked by a fall in fluorescence over time. The better the protective effect of the colanic acid coat, the longer the fluorescence will last.
From a stock solution of concentrated HCl of pH 0.5 prepare the following 4ml dillutions by adding ddH20. This should be done using a pH meter. These dilutions should be prepared in 15ml Falcon tubes. Note, Conc HCl is dangerous and should be treated with great care.
pH = ddH20
pH = 1.0
pH = 1.5
pH = 2.0
pH = 2.5
pH = 3.0
pH = 3.5
pH = 4.5
Each of these eight dilutions correspond to a different row on the ninety six well plate as shown below:
PM:
Using a centrifuge, spin down 40mls of solution from each flask for ten minutes at 4 degrees centigrade and sixty thousand rpm.
Pour off the supernatent and resuspend each of the pellets in 5 mls of ddH20.
Transfer 100ul from the resuspended pellet of transformed cells into the first 6 columns and 100ul from the resuspended pellet of untransformed control cells into the second 6 columns of a ninety six well plate. See the above image for clarification.
Using a parallel pippette, transfer 100ul of acid solution to each well. This step should be done as quickly as possible. To facilitate this, it is advised that the acid solutions are first pippetted into eppindorfs.
Place the plate in the plate reader and collect data for a six hour period. Data of interest should be OD and GFP fluorescence.
Since colanic acid production takes a long time, the Day 2 protocol should be repeated for a total of three days to determine the optimum colanic acid profile. Note, this requres that the whole experiment be started on a Monday.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Fig.7 Process of liquid crystal molecules being disturbed
Fig.8 Immobilized antigen 500ng/m, nanobody 1500ng/ml
Design of self-assembled film
It has been investigated that the effective birefringence, which is relative to the color and                         brightness of LC ﬁlm, varied with alignment layers. Accordingly, the surface modification of                         substrate is critical for the detection of biomolecules by LC biosensor, in the current process                         of LC biosensor construction. The substrate sensitive membrane was constructed by APTES and                         DMOAP hybrid self-assembly method. The long-chain alkyl chain in DMOAP can induce liquid crystal                         molecules to be oriented in the long-chain direction and arranged vertically. At this time, the                         polarized light cannot pass through the liquid crystal cell, and the optical image is uniform.                         Black pattern. The amino group in APTES reacts with an aldehyde group in GA to immobilize                         biomolecules as functional molecules. Since APTES is a short-chain alkyl group, liquid crystal                         molecules cannot be effectively aligned vertically, and background interference can be caused by                         polarized microscope imaging. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the influence of the ratio                         of APTES and DMOAP on liquid crystal orientation, determine the optimal ratio, and on this                         basis, further determine the optimal content of GA.
Using immunocompetitive detection to detect β2-MG
Based on the principle of competitive immunity, the lower the concentration of β2-MG, the more                         β2-MG nano-antibody molecules bound to the substrate surface, the brighter the image; otherwise,                         the higher the concentration of β2-MG, the fewer β2-MG nano-antibody molecules bound to the                         substrate surface, the more black the image tends to be. When the concentration of β2-MG mixed                         with nano-antibody was 400 ng/mL, the optical imaging of liquid crystal was almost uniform black                         pattern (Fig. 9 (a)); when the concentration of β2-MG mixed with nano-antibody was 100 ng/mL,                         the optical imaging of liquid crystal had large area color (Fig. 9 (b)). Therefore, we need to                         design experiments to explore the maximum antigen concentration fixed to the surface of the base                         slide and the most suitable antibody concentration.

Modeling
TinkerCell is one of the most popular CAD (Computer-Aided-Design) that is used to design and simulate biological systems.1 Here, we built our theoretical final construct and investigated the effect of promoters, substrate concentrations and other factors that can affect the output of our system. Due to time limitations, we were not able to optimize the parameters that are used in the simulation, but we will be working on it to make our sensor more efficient and convenient.
Protocols
Preparation of chemically competent cells (E.coli)
We grow a 5mL overnight culture of cells in LB medium in the shaker at 37C.
Next day we dilute the culture 1:100 and grow them until it reaches an OD600 of 0.2-0.5.
The eppendorfs and falcons as well as the TSS buffer are pre-cooled before use.
We split the culture into two 50mL falcons and incubate on ice for 10 minutes.
They are centrifuged 3000g for 10 minutes at 4C.
We remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in the chilled TSS buffer 10% volume of the amount of cultured centrifuged.
100uL aliquots are taken.
These are stored in -80C.
Transformation
We take the competent cells out of -80C and incubate on ice for 15-20 minutes.
We add 100ng of DNA into the samples and nothing to the controls.
We incubate the cells on ice for another 30 minutes.
We heat-shock them at 42C for 30 seconds and incubate on ice for 2 more minutes.
We add 500mL LB to the cells and let them recover in the shaker at 37C for 45 minutes.
They are then centrifuged at 5800g for 6 minutes.
We pour off most of the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in the remainder.
We spread the remainder onto agar plates with the appropriate antibiotics and put them into the incubator at 37C overnight.

Streptavidin coated beads serve as a solid support for the elongating DNA chain during ICA. The biotinylated end of the initiator binds to streptavidin to anchor the nascent construct. The ability to physically separate the DNA from solution is needed due to repeated wash and ligation steps used during ICA.
The terminator is constructed similarly to the initiator, but lacks biotinylation. One end of the terminator is compatible to the reverse sticky end of the ‘C-type’ monomer unit. This end is 5’-phosphorylated to enable ligation. The terminator also contains a primer binding site that can be used for PCR amplification, as well as the biobrick suffix.
The capping oligos are comprised of a single 5’-phosphorylated ssDNA oligo that can form a stable stem loop structure with a unique sticky end. There are three distinct caps, each of which can bind to the A, B, or C sticky ends
Fig 2:Schematic of examples of  initiator (a), terminator (b), and capping oligos (c), used in our ICA project. The cap shown has the B-type sticky end. Image from Cloning Guide by 2015 TU Eindhoven iGEM team.
In each extension step, the next sequential monomer (A, B, or C) is added onto the growing chain. Chains that failed to extend during the previous extension step are capped using a hair-pin oligo that prevents subsequent extension. These capped chains are still present in the mixture for the duration of ICA, but do not participate in any ligation event, and are not amplified in the final PCR. Each final construct is flanked by a biotinylated initiator oligo which allows immobilization onto streptavidin beads, and a terminator oligo. These two oligos provide primer annealing sites which can be used to amplify the sequence using conventional PCR.
A generalized workflow is demonstrated below:
The initiator, terminator, and capping oligos are prepared ahead of time by mixing the relevant oligos and ramping down from 95 C to form the working oligos.
Monomers of each type (A, B, C) are digested from plasmid with BsaI and purified prior to ICA. These are termed working monomers.
The initiator is attached to the streptavidin coated beads.
An ‘A-type’ monomer is ligated to the end of the initiator. Afterwards, any"

PCR
Experiment:
27/09/16: The key was PCR amplified (see following protocol ) from the pDR111+key plasmid with the    primers key prefix and key suffix (see primer list) . The correct size 187 bp of the    product was checked by DNA electrophoresis. The PCR product was stored    at 4°C.
PCR mixture:
50 μl PCR assay was performed according to the following protocol .
DNA Electrophoresis:
For detailed information on how to prepare and run agarose gels see    following protocol .
Figure 1. DNA electrophoresis of amplified key sequence (187 bp in size).
Conclusion:
The key was successfully amplified with prefix and suffix from the    pDR111+key plasmid.
Procedure after gel validation:
PCR product was subsequently cleaned with (PCR Purification Kit – Jena Bioscience) .
Restriction digestion
Experiment:
28/09/16: The PCR product of the key sequence was cut with EcoRI and PstI. The backbone pSB1C3 (BBa_J04450) was digested with the same enzymes. This construct is carrying RFP reporter therefore it was used for easier screening after transformation. You could see self-ligations as red    colonies and the correct ones as white ones.
RD mixture:
30 μl RD assay was performed according to the following see    following protocol .
DNA Electrophoresis:
The digestion mixture of backbone pSB1C3 - BBa_J04450 was loaded on a    gel to extract the digested backbone.
For detailed information on how to prepare and run    agarose gels see following protocol .
Figure 2. DNA electrophoresis of EcoRI and PstI digested     pSB1C3 - BBa_J04450. The RFP insert is 1069 bp and the pSB1C3 backbone     is 2019 bp.
Conclusion:
The digestion was successful. We could see bands for both expected    fragments on the gel, namely RFP insert is 1069bp and the    pSB1C3 backbone is 2019 bp.
Procedure after gel validation:
The upper band of 2019 bp was cut out from the gel    and DNA was extracted by (Agarose Gel Extraction Kit – Jena Bioscience) . The PCR product of the key sequence was not checked on the gel after the digestion but immediately    cleaned up with (NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up) .

Tsinghua,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," However, we failed to choose an orthogonal gene circuit from our results. We can just determine the circuit of warrior II and what AHL warrior I should secrete, as is shown below:
Fig.4 Gene circuit designed from the results
    We cannot design a warrior I that can be killed by warrior II but not killed by itself regardless of whatever receptor-promoter we put inside warrior I.    (More details can be seen at Orthogonality test )
V Killing test
    Because we use RFP to indicate the level of LacI inside the cell during Orthogonality test, we are not sure if the results will be the same when we use a complete circuit. Therefore, we designed two warriors and beggars as below to verify results got from Orthogonality test.
Fig.5 Gene circuit designed for killing test to verify Orthogonality test.
    According to results of Orthogonality test, the warrior I will be killed by itself when it is cultivated without warrior II. Furthermore, warrior II doesn’t kill itself but can kill E.coli from the other side successfully. All results we got here are consistent with our Orthogonality test! They greatly enhance the reliability of our previous data. (Fig.6)
Fig.6 Killing test results
More details can be found at Killing test
VI Improved orthogonal gene circuit
    The problem now becomes how to block warrior I’s response to C4HSL secreted by himself. Our model tells us if we design the warrior I as below (Fig.7), we can make it only be killed by warrior II by just regulating the RBS of TetR to an appropriate intensity.
Fig.7 Improved gene circuit. The one on the top is warrior I while the one below is warrior II.
See more details at Design of characters
    Results are shown below:
Fig.8 Performance of improved gene circuit

VII Regulation of killing ability
    Sometimes, to mimic the situation we investigate in real world, it may be necessary to regulate killing ability to an appropriate level, like making two warriors have the same killing ability. What can we do to regulate the killing ability of warriors? Our model suggests that it is possible to regulate the killing ability of the two warriors by just changing the promoter intensity of some proteins! (Fig.9)

Running Tests on Purified Honeybee Protein
As per Michael's suggestion I am running a Dry Film Test in order to determine the weight by volume percent of silk protein in our samples.
Tristan is running a BCA assay with Jessica on the samples from 5/26 and 7/29.
Dry Film Test
Weighed out 100 ul of 5/26, 7/29 and a 3% SDS solution as a control.
3%SDS = 0.0991 g, 5/26 silk = 0.1001 g, 7/29 silk = 0.0940 g
Need to keep in mind that the 5/26 ad 7/29 silks are not directly comparable, because one was solubilized in 750 ul of 3% SDS and the 5/26 was solubilized in 2 ml of 3% SDS, and the 5/26 was from a 250 ml culture, and the 7/29 was from a 100 ml bacterial culture.
BCA
Using a Thermo Kit, Jessica prepared 9 standards.
I made a working reagent of 25ml reagent A mixed with 0.5ml reagent B by inverting.
100ul of each standard, sample, and blank was added to microcentrifuge tubes.
1ml of the working reagent was added to each tube, except the blank, and vortexed for 10s.
All tubes were incubated at 37C for 45min.
All samples were transferred to cuvets and run in a spectrophotometer."

Digestion of these last Minipreps with HindIII. Incubate 1 hour at 37ºC.
Run electrophoresis gel of digestion products. We cannot distinguish anything in the gel so we have decided to pick up more colonies from the plate.
Inoculate a starter culture of 5 ml of LB medium with 5 μL of kanamycin and rifampicin in a 50 ml tube with the colony and incubate it 48 hours at 28ºC with shaking must be necessary.
We have decided to repeat the performance of PCR to bind linker RSIAT+TEV with luciferase. We are going to try at 71ºC. Moreover this time, we are going to try it using DMSO at 65 and 67ºC.
