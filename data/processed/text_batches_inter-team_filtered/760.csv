The identification of positive yeast clones and determination of the phenotype (M+ or MS) was done by PCR with the primers 5AOX-Phenotype-FW and TT-Phenotype-RV. The result of the PCR was: no GFP integrated clones and three tvel5 integrated (1.9 kb and 2.2 kb) clones. The cassette, including tvel5 and his4, was recombinated by a single cross over, because the 2.2 kb PCR product of the aox1 gene has been formed. Minimal methanol medium was inoculated with these three positive clones with the M+ phenotype.
BBa_K863204 was used as a controll for PCR with the primer 5AOX-Phenotype-FW and TT-Phenotype-RV. Expected lane: 437 bp.

Team RHIT aimed to create a symbiotic relationship between S. cerevisae and E. coli. We transform E. coli with a system that utilizes a fusion gene of ice nucleation protein and alpha mating factor to express alpha mating factor on the surface of E. coli. E. coli will now have the ability to induce the mating pheromone response pathway (MPRP) within yeast. Yeast utilizes FUS1 as the final signaling molecule of the MPRP. Therefore, we use a FUS1 promoter to express histidine within yeast. This means that E. coli must have an interaction with the yeast to allow for yeast's survival. For this to be a true symbiotic relationship, yeast must provide E. coli with a means of survival. E. coli is able to survive in this system when yeast expels lactate because our E. coli system requires lactate to promote histidine expression. To test our E. coli for alpha mating factor, we developed another system for yeast. Again we use the FUS1 promoter, but in this case we promote the expression of blue fluorescent protein within yeast. This system allows us to again visually confirm that E. coli and yeast are able to interact using alpha mating factor and the mating pheromone response pathway.
Using the Ice Nucleation Protein-based surface display presented by the Penn iGEM team in 2012, Team RHIT displays a fusion of the Ice Nucleation Protein and alpha-mating factor. Alpha Yeast Mating Factor induces the MPRP and FUS1 signaling in a haploid a-type yeast strains. The synthetic induction of the MPRP by E. coli is the first vital step toward synthetic unity.
To establish the symbiosis, the expression of an essential amino acid, histidine, promotes upon the activation of the lactate inducible promoter. The lactate promoting
Yeast benefits from unity with E. coli because the final signaling molecule of the MPRP, FUS1, induces the vital promotion of histidine.

Safety
The Cambridge 2009 iGEM team took safety considerations seriously throughout our project.  One of our supervisors, Jim Ajioka, is a Safety Officer in the Department of Pathology, so we were able to discuss with him the potential impact of our ideas. Additionally, we followed Cambridge University safety regulations in the lab.
We assessed the risks involved with our work in the lab to ensure we adhered to the safety guidelines set by the Cambridge University School of Biological Sciences Biological Safety Committee.  We completed a “COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations) Risk Assessement of a Project involving Biological Agents” form, in which we assessed our work to consider both dangerous pathogens and genetically modified organisms.
Dangerous Pathogens
The biological agents we worked with are a derivative of E. coli K-12.  While E. coli can be a dangerous pathogen, E. coli K-12 is multiply disabled.  Because it maintains several genetic deletions for nutritional genes, it will not survive outside the lab and will not compete with normal human or other animal flora.  It is an ADCP Hazard Group 1 organism and can be used under UK designation containment level 1 regulations – in summary, use of good microbiological practice, disinfectants (70% ethanol, TriGene), and known disposal routes (autoclaving); suitable protection (lab coats and gloves); and limited lab access.
Genetically Modified Organisms
Our project came under the umbrella of a Genetic Manipulation Project for Cloning in E. coli in Dr. Jim Haseloff’s lab.  We worked with non-mobilizable plasmids, and the genes we worked with produce products with known properties.  We assessed that there is no significant hazard regarding the bioavailability of our pigment products.

To check whether or not Cas13a gets activated by our prepared sample, we used one of our purified RNA samples in the Cas13a activity assay. As can be seen in Figure 16, our Cas13a was activated by our target. This demonstrates that we successfully prepared the sample in such a way that the target became available for Cas13a to detect.

(yellow) Cas13a with crRNA and target isolated from milk without bacteria containing the tetracycline resistance gene. (red) Cas13a without crRNA and without target.
Applying the sample preparation to a biological sample
We wanted to test if our sample preparation could be applied on a biological sample, without knowing the sequence beforehand. We decided to validate our sample preparation on mastitis. While talking to veterinarian experts in our Integrated Human Practices , we discovered that detecting multi resistance genes such as blaZ and mecA would be most relevant. We used our ‘ motif finder ' to find all the conserved regions of blaZ. On these regions, we designed primers for RPA. We wanted to test if our motif finder would work in practice; ie. that the designed primers would bind to the unknown genome of any pathogen containing the blaZ-gene. We were happy to receive three isolates from the Wageningen Bioveterinary Research in Lelystad; one was confirmed to contain the blaZ-gene, the other two isolates most likely contained the blaZ-gene as well. The exact sequences of the strains were not provided.
First of all, we wanted to test if our primers would anneal to the unknown genome of the isolates, which most likely contained a variant of the blaZ-gene. Three different DNA isolation methods were used: the boiling method ( DNA isolation boiling ) and two commercial kits ( Plasmid Isolation (Promega PureYield™ Plasmid Miniprep Kit and Milk Bacterial DNA Isolation Kit ).
To test the sensitivity of our method, we decided to prepare a dilution range in milk of 10-3 up to and including 10-9 of S. aureus. Next, we used the boiling method to isolate the DNA. ( DNA isolation boiling ). After DNA isolation, the samples were amplified, transcribed into RNA, purified and then loaded on a gel"

Overall, the lecture was a great success. Both the teachers and the students expressed their gratitude and we had several students that expressed excitement over the prospects of pursuing degrees in bio-engineering.
Public seminar
We completed the goals that we had set out to achieve for public education by co-hosting a seminar with the iGEM Chalmers Gothenburg team. The seminar was held as part of a series of public talks held by faculty members of Lund University across all disciplines in celebration of its 350th anniversary. Our ambition was to provide the public with a greater perspective on the surge in interest in synthetic biology within the bio-engineering community and its potential ethical and societal implications. The lecture was constructed from a perspective of good science communications, based, by and large, on professional workshops and research exploring different aspects of effective rhetoric and its relation to public opinion on GMO [1] [2] [3]. To summarize our literature study, we found that knowledge and opinion of genetic modification varies with socioeconomic factors and that there exists some tendency of confirmation bias. Furthermore, some distrust in the integrity and honesty of scientists presenting the various safety aspects of GMO has been noted. To account for this, the material we introduced was kept at a popular scientific level to reach the widest audience possible. The ethical dilemmas that were brought up were scrutinized and discussed through different social lenses prior to the seminar in an attempt to present them in a perceived unbiased manner. As our intention was to inspire the public to discuss and delve further into synthetic biology and its implications rather than present them with a set of facts, this was a key component of our seminar design.
Lund University’s 350th anniversary.
To complement the open discussion in the best possible way, we offered traditional swedish “fika” consisting of sweets and coffee.
Synthetic biology rests on the shoulders of genetic engineering and, consequently, on molecular biology and genetics. In an attempt of minimizing the perceived abstraction of the subject area, we constructed the seminar to systematically work through the key moments in history that ultimately enabled it.
After briefly touching upon the classic breakthroughs in molecular biology, such as the discovery of Mendelian inheritance, the Central Dogma of molecular biology and the impact of the successful characterization of ligase and restriction enzymes. After this, we introduced the concept of synthetic biology as the engineering approach to biology through the application of standardization, automation and hierarchical abstraction. This was further elucidated by both teams elaborating on their chosen project and their respective design process.

Yes, we know which proteins dimerize. We understand how proteins dimerize as well, by interaction of domains like leucine zippers and so forth. But why? What is the point of dimerization?
Previous researches have underlined the important advantages of dimerization, including differential regulation, specificity, facilitated proximity and so on. [citation needed] The influence of dimerization in noise propagation is hardly touched due to the difficulty in controlling experiment variables. Synthetic biology provides powerful tools to carry out experiments otherwise impossible in designed systems. This is exactly what we do.
Traditionally, we evaluate the impacts of noise using variance-related statistics, such as coefficient of variance. These quantities can only describe how concentrated the output is around the mean value, but cannot tell us how well we can infer one of the correlated random variables from the other. Channel capacity makes a better criteria of noise because it more scientifically depicts the information dissemination process."

Since LB Miller normally contains 1% NaCl, higher salt plates were generated by adding either 10g of NaCl (for a total of 3% NaCl) or 20g of NaCl (for a total of 5% NaCl) to the 500mL LB-Agar mixture listed above.
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
To separate out different sized DNA fragments, we prepared 1% agarose gels using the 0.5g EZ Agarose tablets dissolved in 50mL of 10mM NaBO4 buffer. The same buffer was used to run the gel once loaded with samples, typically at a range of 120 - 150 volts. After sufficient run time, the gel was removed, mixed with approximately 50mL of distilled water and 5uL of Ethidium Bromide (at a 10mg/mL stock concentration) for 10 minutes, and then destained with fresh distilled water for about 5 minutes before visualizing on a UV lamp.
RFP and LacZ-Alpha quantification
How the color of bacterial growth on a petri dish is quantified:
1. Open a file in ImageJ (example file to try is given below)
2. Using the circle/oval or rectangle selection tool, select a small area of bacterial growth that is more or less uniform in color. (i.e. don't select a region that contains both bacteria and empty / blank plate.)
3. Under the Analyze menu, select Histogram (or hit CTRL+H). You should see a graph with one peak - if there are multiple large peaks, go back to step 2 and try to get a more uniform selection.
4. The default measurement is grayscale. Record the average grayscale (the mean) value for that selection, then click on RGB to cycle to a value that represents the amount of red in the selection. Record this mean as well, and cycle through green and blue, recording each value for that selection.
5. Repeat the process above for all other bacteria growth"

How we built upon previous iGEM projects.
The aim of our project was to make biosensors applicable in everyday life. Therefore, we developed two cell-free systems and tested several biosensors in vivo and in vitro.
A central aspect was the establishment of a cell-free protein synthesis system. An ideal reporter protein is superfolder GFP (sfGFP). Consequently, we used sfGFP as a reporter gene and as a positive control for all our experiments. We started with the BioBrick BBa_I746909 by team Cambridge 2008 and observed that it was expressed in our CFPS. However, the expression strength was not sufficient for our biosensors. Therefore, we inserted a translation enhancing untranslated region (UTR) between the T7 promoter and the coding sequence, creating Part:BBa_K1758102 . We observed a drastic increase in fluorescence when testing this modified construct and performed our further experiments with this optimized sfGFP. We also tested whether the optimized UTR has an effect in vivo as well. We observed that the fluorescence of E. coli expressing the optimized sfGFP was significantly higher than the fluorescence of cultures expressing BBa_I746909 . The difference could even be seen with the naked eye.
The next step was to test biosensors for their functionality in our cell-free systems. Therefore, we used the following biosensors by previous iGEM teams:

It has founded investigations and has given scholarships to help people continue their studies and ultimately help research in our country to continue its growth.  This organization has also carried out diverse efforts like the creation of a National System of Investigators in 1984, which allows scientific development in each state of the country and gives prestige to the scientists within this community. Mexico spent 0.43% of its PIB in science and development in 2009. In 2014 it grew to 0.54%, the highest amount in the history of our country, and has the promise to increase up to 2%.
Conclusion
Mexico is a developing country and right now is on the verge of breaking though the barrier that has been holding it back in biotechnology. The path has been carved by current and past scientists. Their efforts have created a platform for science so that we can build on it and ultimately become one of the leading countries in research. Our country has the talent and the desire to continue progressing, and the resources have become more and more available. Our team hopes to contribute to this progress by making the process of receiving something as fundamental as material, easier. With this we would break one more barrier in the hope of making science and biotechnology part of our culture and a core part of our society."
UESTC-Software,2018,Team:UESTC-Software#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," level of similarity is related to the evolutionary distance; hence, the similar sequence identified by BLAST may be the homologous gene in two different species, most of which are similar in function.
2. Allele:
Even for one given gene in the same species, there may be several variant forms, which is called allele. Different alleles are highly similar in sequence, but they can result in different observable phenotypic traits, such as different pigmentation.
Characteristics of the coding sequences in the iGEM database:
1. Most of them are artificially modified or cut from existing proteins, in this case, the BLAST result is pretty nice.
2. Synthetic sequences: artificially constructed sequences, almost have no similar protein coding sequences.
3. Combined with several protein coding sequences’  fragments. In this case, one query sequence may hit several different nonhomologous proteins, but the similarity of every hit is not high.
4. Redundant and mistakes in the biobricks’ sequences: As is mentioned by many papers, redundant and even mistakes are possibly appearing in the biobricks’ sequences, which is a big trouble for us to recognize the right sequence when integrating other databases with the iGEM database.
Solution
Preliminary screening
As the BLAST results are given in descending order of the similarity, we choose the first hit of every specific fragment in a gene as the probable match and abandon the others.
Fig.2.Preliminary screening
By doing this, the amount of the results has been reduced to 8000+ while the origin amount is 61000+
Logistic regression classifying
Linear regression is a basic regression algorithm. For a regression problem:
\(Y=X\cdot W+\varepsilon\)(1)
Where:
$$X=[x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3,\ ...,\ x_n]^T$$
\(W=[w_1,\ w_2,\ w_3,\ ...,\ w_n]^T\)(2)
$$\varepsilon=[\varepsilon_1,\ \varepsilon_2,\ \varepsilon_3,\ ...,\ \varepsilon_n]^T$$
The aim is to search for the best W that minimize the mean of e.
With the help of logistic function: \(Logistic(z)=\frac{1}{1+\mathbf{e}^{-z}}\),logistic regression is created to solve classification problem.

Transcription, translation and post-modifications are carried out in order to express the gene. cI protein and the β-galactosidase (hydrolytic enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of lactose) are produced. The lactose starts to get digested. The cI protein represses the promoter of suicide gene E, pL, which in turn suppresses the expression of the suicide gene.
The lactose in the cell culture is continuously digested. After all the lactose has been digested, the promoters for the cI gene and the lac operon are then suppressed. No β-galactozidase and the cI protein are produced. In the absence of cI protein, the suicide gene is turned on. The expression of gene E (production of E protein) leads to the formation of holes in the cell membrane which causes cell death. The mechanism for which can be referred to in the previous section.
During the culture of the bacteria, arabinose is added to the LB agar (the growth medium for the bacteria). The promoter for the cI and lac operon can also be activated by arabinose. Therefore, cI protein is produced continuously to suppress the expression of the suicide gene. This can prevent bacterial cell death under undesirable conditions.
Possible flaws
Leaky expression: It might lead to the production of cl proteins which inhibit the  expression of the suicide gene. This means that bacteria might still survive after they have finished their function (of digesting all the lactose).
The suicide genes do not work:  Even when there is no inhibition to the suicide gene, the killing mechanism might still not work due to a variety of reasons such as incorrect modifications to proteins, improper folding of the proteins or undesired mutations in the gene.
The efficacy of the killing mechanism (i.e. time needed for cell-lysis) If the efficacy  is too low the bacteria will not die as quickly as we want them to.

“Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: “What! You too? I thought I was the only one.” (C.S Lewis). It is the perfect quote to sum up our collaboration with the iGEM Bordeaux team. We first met at the Parisian meetup in Paris (7th July 2018). As we share the same conception of an iGEM project, our partnership was obvious.   We invited them to participate to the organization of the conference “What will synthetic biology bring to the future?”. They helped us a lot to contact experts.

Alternative Roots: Engineering Microbial Communities
Abtract
The demand for food, fuel and materials is placing unprecedented pressure on agricultural production. To secure higher productivity, the sector relies upon synthetic fertilisers derived from energy intensive manufacturing methods. Here, we propose an alternative approach to support plant productivity. The Alternative Roots project investigated Pseudomonas fluorescens as a chassis organism. Development of a plant-colonising chassis provides novel mechanisms for soil microbiome manipulation without genetically modified crops. As proof of concept, we focus on improving nitrogen supply via naringenin biosynthesis - a potential chemoattractant of free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Legal and social considerations of the project drove the development of NH-1, a low-cost, small-scale and programmable hydroponic system. Tailored to overcome experimental limitations faced by many plant scientists, NH-1 provides improved reproducibility, coupled with high-throughput experimentation. This system enabled exploration of future deployment techniques within contained environments that may result in enhanced, sustainable crop productivity at a local and accessible level.

Experimental Validation
Using this model, we have designed sgRNAs to target essential virulence regions in Agrobacterium. The guides obtained from running the model were shown to be effective in vitro, as demonstrated on the CRISPR/Cas9 page !
Collaboration with University of Toronto
The University of Toronto desired to choose guides to target the AraC gene with S. pyogenes CRISPR/dCas9 (catalytically inactive Cas9) in E.coli K12 MG1655. To regulate gene expression with CRISPR/dCas9, it is desirable to have guides near the beginning of a gene to block transcription activity. Determining guides for this problem was the perfect problem for our model to solve. A complete list of potential guide RNA in the AraC gene was produced, with their respect partition functions and location on the genome.
Model execution determined their original guides sequences, AAACGAGTATCCCGGCAGCA and AACGAGTATCCCGGCAGCAG had a relatively low partition functions of 47.276 and 35.326 respectively, indicating that there would be many off target CRISPR/dCas9 matches on the genome. We provided their team two guides from the complete list that would be appropriate choices for their project. We ranked the guides by genome location, searching for guides with a partition function above seventy within the first 100 base pairs of the gene. The guides our model suggested were: TGGGCGTTAAACGAGTATCC, appearing on the bottom strand (with a PAM site at the 33rd nucleotide from the start), which has a partition function of 75.957; and TTAACGCCGATTGAGGCCAA appearing on the top strand (with a PAM site at the 86th nucle"

Across both of the advanced modules, people did not seemed dismayed by the concept of using synthetic biology as long as it aligned with the initiatives (like cancer treatment) they felt most strongly about. For future Policies and Practices initiatives, Minnesota hopes to adopt this same conversational and collaborative approach to designing our project and communicating the very real benefits of applied synthetic biology to local communities.

Our team also visited two elementary school classrooms at local Minnewashta Elementary to teach second-graders about DNA and the genetic code. Using the ECORI Squad synthetic biology curriculum developed by the 2013 Minnesota iGEM team, we engaged kids in fun activities such as putting together base pair puzzles, beading bracelets using the genetic code, and extracting DNA from fresh strawberries. While students were only about ten years old, most of them had a good grasp on the basic idea of DNA structure and replication. We look forward to utilizing our curriculum again this coming year in Minnewashta and also developing some new educational modules for a couple local high schools, and an Advanced Placement Biology classroom in particular, who have reached out to the Minnesota iGEM team about hosting an introduction to genetic engineering and synthetic biology.
• Round Table Discussion with Industry
      This summer we also met with over twenty R&D professionals at Cargill biotechnology company and at Intrexon to discuss the motives and utility of our overall project. We hosted the meeting as a round table discussion in order to encourage open dialogue and collaboration around the central ideas of the project, and we found the conversations extremely valuable. As opposed to presenting information in a formal manner, we were able to talk openly about the viability of our 2A tag technology and how it would actually be structured in a professional R&D setting (assuming it had strong literature and characterization beforehand), such as the need to implement multiple approaches simultaneously to promote timely progress if one, or more, methods don’t come to fruition.
We also turned to critical conversations about how science is communicated to the public. Many professionals expressed the"

The above graphs clearly show that PUR Esterase EstCS2 is active and cleaving p-NP. The recorded concentrations of 4-NP, in the presence of this PUR Esterase, are much greater than with the Empty Vector or the Substrate alone. Is PUR Esterase EstCS2 active? Yes!
The enzyme activity of PUR Esterase PueB. The graph shows the concentration of the 4-Nitrophenol released during 10 minutes incubation of para-Nitrophenyl butyrate with PueB and Empty Vector, as well as the p-NP substrate by itself. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM

The enzymes expressed by both PueB and PulA do not appear to have esterase activity for this substrate. There is a tiny increase in 4-NP concentration for PueB, PulA, Empty Vector and Substrate alone. This probably indicates that the substrate is slowly degrading by itself. Other constituents of the cell lysates are likely to be causing a slight increase in p-NP degradation, as PueB, PulA and Empty Vector show higher concentrations of 4-NP than the Substrate alone.
Conclusion: PUR Esterase EstCS2 is active!

At 37°C, the concentrations of ethylene glycol used do not affect growth, however at 30°C, the increasing concentration results in halved growth. A two-tailed t-test addressing the null hypothesis, temperature does not affect growth with ethylene glycol shows that the null hypothesis must be rejected as p = 0.001.

Triggering the suicide circuit
In our case of sugar hijacking, ideally, the tiny, living “agents” are supposed to kill themselves in the story to make a happy ending. Therefore, we introduced a glucose responsive elements and a repressor circuit to be connected to suicide genes (lysis and NucA).
Promoter Pcar [ BBa_K861171 ] is a glucose responsive promoter created by WHU-China in 2012. Pcar promoter region was de novo  designed with overlapping of CRP and RNA polymerase binding site. The initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase may be hindered by the binding of CRP, which occurs at the formation of cAMP-CRP complex in the low concentration of glucose. In other words, when the amount of glucose is high enough, Pcar would be turned on after the leaving of CPR due to the low concentration of cAMP, and vice versa.
PhlF repressor system contains the repressor PhlF [ BBa_K1725041 ] and the PhlF repressible promoter [ BBa_K1725001 ] created by Glasgow in 2015. PhlF could repress GFP fluorescence intensity by 83-fold according to the study of Glasgow’s work.
Lysis gene [ BBa_K117000 ] created by NTU-Singapore in 2008 encodes Lysis protein which could not only lyse bacterial cell membrane but also activate the endonuclease of Colicin E7 (ColE7). The lysis-colicin is one class of bacteriocins which are produced to response to worsening environmental conditions and outcompete other bacteria.
NucA [ BBa_K1159105 ] created by TU-Munich in 2013 from Staphylococcus aureus produces a thermostable exo- and endo-nuclease that is able to degrade genomic DNAs2. NucA also has a role in the cleavage of extracellular DNAs and preventing biofilm formation.

Missouri_Rolla,2018,Team:Missouri Rolla#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," Cry8Da gene synthesized (UniProtKB - D5H3I7) from IDT after being codon optimized to remove internal restriction sites. Along with this, we had the Arabidopsis rbcS-1A promoter synthesized to be our model of tissue specific gene expression. We planned to utilize primer directed mutagenesis of suspected binding sites of Cry8Da for our targeting. The Cry8Da protein consists of three domains. Research suggests domain II alpha loop structures are responsible for host receptor binding in coleopteran insects. Further research has indicated that alpha loop 2 in domain II is likely associated with toxicity in adult beetles. Our group planned to target this region for mutagenesis. In the end, we were unable to assemble these parts into a functioning transcriptional unit following Golden Braid (GB) Assembly standard using iGEM supplied GB.2.0 plasmid backbones. Due to these issues, we were unable to conduct our mutagenesis experiments on our Cry8Da gene to attempt to screen for appropriate toxins. Our group was thankful to receive killed EAB’s from Robert C. Venette at the USDA Northern Research Station, but, due to handling issues in transit, the samples obtained were not able to be utilized for assembly of our BBMVs for future testing.
After meeting with Bayer scientists and discussing our project, our team has developed directions to advance our project in the future. We have connections to receive new EABs for assembly of BBMV for our testing. We are looking into RNAi gene silencing as a method of targeting EABs. Along with this, we are exploring the possibility of isolating BT spores from EABs to search for possible natural EAB specific Cry toxins. Lastly, our group plans to continue efforts to improve our gene construction ability to further develop our current method of treatment.

SynBio Intro
Synthetic Biology - is it another Name for Genetic Engineering ?
People must hear the term, 'genetic engineering', however, synthetic biology seems to be new. Somebody wonders if this is a new name referring to genetic engineering.
Synthetic biology which was a infant discipline emerged within this few years. It focused on devices assembling, system building and engineering methodology. Of course, it was similar to genetic engineering and advantaged most of the techniques of genetic engineering. But synthetic biology was a brand-new stuff which was the further development of genetic engineering.
In terms of scale, conventional genetic engineering tried to transfer one or a few genes from one organelle to another, maybe with tiny modification on genes. Synthetic biology wants more, the ultimate aim of synthetic biology is to synthesize new life to meet our need. This kind of new life is nothing but artificial life. So at this point synthetic biology intersects with system biology. Since synthetic biology is young, it need to enrich the available devices and modules to build the system.
Where do the devices and modules come from? This answer reveals other aspects of differences between synthetic biology and genetic engineering. Traditionally, if we wanted a fluorescence pig, we had to find the cDNA of fluorescence gene. If the genes we wanted were rare, maybe we needed to catch that creature by ourselves. The whole picture changed after the technology development of high-speed and cheap sequencing and inexpensive DNA synthesis. All we need to do is start computers and search for target genes in database, then make an order to let company to synthesize those genes for us. The name 'synthetic' came from this.
Suppose we get the genes, the next step comes to constructing. Here, we shall see the last differences. Conventional genetic engineering connected the parts and tested the functions differently from cases to cases. Thanks to standardization, assembling in synthetic biology is as easy as playing with LEGO toys, the interface is well-designed so that the construction is so simple. Besides"

GFP Expression Check
To verify the effectivity of the general schema for our DNA [ Promoters Long ( BBa_I712074 ) and Short ( BBa_I719005 ), 5’ UTR ( BBa_K1758100 ), Terminator ( BBa_B0012 ) ] we decided to test our system in a bacterial plasmid under T7 control via the IPTG inducible lac operon.
This experiment was conducted by first cloning plasmid components together. A G-block was synthesized by IDT containing 5’UTR, Superfolder GFP ( BBa_I746916 ), and Terminator ( BBa_B0012 ). These were then amplified with overhang PCR via primers containing promoter sequences for T7 polymerase, two separate promoters were tested: Long ( BBa_I712074 ) and Short ( BBa_I719005 ). The now full translational units were amplified again with gibson primers for insertion into pSB1C3 amplified with complimentary gibson primers. These linear amplicons were verified via gel electrophoresis, purified, and finally gibsoned together and transformed into NEB T7 express competent E. coli. The transformed colonies were exposed to broad spectrum UV radiation to excite GFP and phenotypically select for colonies with the correct construct. Colonies with correct expression were taken into liquid culture for larger scale verification of fluorescence and miniprep.
AMP Bacterial Killing by OD600 Broad Investigation
Functional killing of AMPs was tested in a broad format. Each of our Antimicrobial peptide candidates was constructed as a G-block which contained the 5'UTR, the AMP gene, and the Terminator. These were then amplified with tailed primers containing the promoter sequences for the short and long promoter respectively. These amplified constructs were verified via gel electrophoresis and purified and quantified via Nanodrop.
This experiment was designed to broadly test the bacteriostatic effect of each AMP under the control of each promoter and with or without the presence of the methionine aminopeptidase enzyme. Antimicrobial peptides were and no template controls were expressed over 4 hours at 37C using our"

Sequencing Results of Expression Plasmids
The good news is that we managed to get a perfect sequence for each of our plasmids.  The bad news is that we do not know which sequences are the matches, since the names are all scrambled for some reason (i.e. sample 78.x does not align with FH bottom like it should, but instead aligns perfectly with another plasmid sequence).  We will thus need to resend our samples for sequencing to be able to choose the correct plasmids that match.  Below is a summary of the scrambled data from the sequencing we sent in yesterday:

Remaining samples, expected size of 1.4 kb
From these PCRs, all the reactions look like they produced bands of the right size, a good indicator that the isothermal assemblies worked.  Only sequencing will tell whether they are truly the products that we are looking for.
We sent these samples out for sequencing, making sure that all the samples were in the appropriate tubes.

However, as our research progressed and we spoke to more experts working with the material, we learned there was so much more to mycelium than its self-growing properties.
Phil Ross, one of the founders of MycoWorks, a company working to produce a more humane and sustainable leather from mycelium, was one of our first points of contact. He showed us a material produced from mycelium that behaved and looked just like leather. It was so unlike any of the solid mycelium bricks we had produced. He emphasized to us the ways in which the mechanical properties of mycelium can be manipulated by how it is grown and what is grown on.
This sentiment was echoed by Rolando Perez, a Ph.D. student focused on mycelium at Stanford University in the Drew Endy Lab. He also added that the strain of the mushroom can affect its material properties, and for that reason he is currently working on creating a fungal database in order to make information about mycelium more accessible to the public and other researchers.
Eben Bayer, one of the co-founders of Ecovative, a company that got its start producing mycelium based styrofoam)emphasized in our interview with him how he first got interested in mycelium because of how it can act as a natural glue, binding together diverse substrates to create new material that is completely biodegradable. As a company they have conducted many material tests and found the material to be strong and flame retardant. Check out their materialspecs here.
Through these conversations it became clear to us that mycelium has the potential to revolutionize product manufacturing on earth, by introducing a completely biodegradable material that is also self-growing. These key characteristics will allow manufactures to cut back on the cost, time, energy, and environmental impact involved with traditional production methods. And the ability of manipulate the mechanical properties of the materials ensures that mycelium could be used as a substitute for a variety of products—from furniture to clothing to medical devices.
In response to this exciting realization we began exploring the ways mycelium could be used to create other products that might be necessary for our habitat--ranging from furniture, to scientific instruments, to a filtration system, to even a Rover chassis. We even generated some designs and prototypes for a few of these ideas, fully flushing out the idea of an entire living space created from one material.
One of first designs was a modular hexagonal stool that could be assembled into a larger surface through many units or separated into individual seating. We grew this stool by crating a hexagon mold from recycled"

Human Practices
We contextualised our Human Practices , within the Newcastle City Council plan to make Newcastle into a 'Smart City.' We have proposed an additional scenario to those already outlined, one concerning sustainable agriculture; an urban farm inside the Victoria Tunnel which runs underneath the city. This conceptual design project forced us to think carefully about the safety regarding GMOs when used in contained environments. Before designing the urban farm, we spoke to: local farmers, several commercial urban farms, a social food enterprise and a research director. We used this design exercise to bring together all that we learned from our comprehensive stakeholder engagement.

Integrated Human Practices
This design exercise outlined in the silver criteria integrates / was informed by all elements of our project: stakeholder engagement, wetware, hardware, and safety. Once we had consulted the relevant stakeholders and felt we had sufficient information we began to feed this in to the design and execution of the project. We have documented on our wiki how our project has been influenced by our Human Practices work.  See our integrated Human Practices journey here .

Model Your Project
We used two different mathematical modelling approaches to describe and simulate different aspects of our project. We built an agent-based model to understand the behaviour of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in response to the chemoattractant naringenin. We used Simbiotics to visualise stochastic simulations via real-time animations. These models guided experimental work and were then informed by data from our chemotaxis experiments and bacterial growth characterisation. Our model provided insight into the biofilm formation process, including biofilm thickness and number of cells of each nitrogen-fixing species present. We also built a kinetic model describing metabolic flux through the naringenin biosynthetic pathway. Our model employed mass action kinetics to describe the behaviour of reactants and products for each step in the pathway. By coupling this information with models describing the rates of production and turnover of the four naringenin biosynthetic enzymes we developed an improved genetic design for our biosynthetic devices.

As part of our summer experience, we went on plenty of adventures and met cool people!
EteRNA
EteRNA online computer game that allows the general public to ""solve puzzles to design molecular medicines"" by folding their own RNA.
A lot of the work for Biosensing went into the design of our functional oligonucleotides. We experimented with many secondary and tertiary folding softwares to predict their affinity for molecules in binding pockets, but after consulting experts like Christina Smolke, we eventually determined that was not enough. We sought out crowd-sourcing as a means to optimize our aptamer designs. eteRNA is an interactive platform created by Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University that essentially turns RNA folding into a game. Currently, this user-base is attempting to tackle the lingering world health problem of tuberculosis. The site's many features allow users and players to have an in silico lab experience. We participated in the eteRNA Convention on July 16th-17th at the Li Ka Shing Center at Stanford. Mike got quite into the game and is now ranked top 1000 in the world! Check out this example of the IRES-mediated translation biosensor and see if you can meet the thermodynamic constraints of -11.7 kcal/mol necessary for proper folding of the Theophylline aptamer!
BioCurious
We participated in weekly gatherings with a group of biologically-inclined hackers known as BioCurious . We aligned with their mission of creating an open space for biotechnology around Silicon Valley, much like iGEM strives to promote standardized synthetic biology. Not only did we help out with ideation and prototyping"

USTC-Software,2017,Team:USTC-Software#implementation_-_-_TEXT.html," To avoid it, we improved ABACUS and enable it to run in two ways: locally or distributedly. If no available executable file is detected, ABACUS will connect to remote slave servers and distribute the computation tasks. This design can largely save the expense of master server, and makes ABACUS infinitely scalable.
About Biocircuit
The Quine-McCluskey algorithm is a method used for minimizing of boolean functions that was developed by W.V.Quine and extended by Edward J.McCluskey.
Espresso heuristic logic minimizer is a computer program using heuristic and specific algorithms for efficiently reducing the complexity of digital electronic gate circuits.
Because Espresso is more efficient than Q-M algorithm, especially when inputs are more than 6, we choose Espresso for our software.
NetworkX is a Python language software package for the creation, manipulation and study of the structure, dynamics and functions of complex networks.
We use directed graph to characterize biocircuit, and NetworkX has make it more convenient to operate with graphs.
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
Pyeda is a Python library for electronic design automation. We once used pyeda to simplify Boolean formulas. However, we found bugs in the process, so we got in touch with its author Chris Drake and submitted the issue. Therefore, we didn't use pyeda directly but make some changes to his espresso model. We are very grateful to his excellent work.
Frontend Part
To improve the user experience, we build Biohub 2.0 as a single page application (or short for SPA), using the advanced MVVM framework Vue.js . Vue.js relies on webpack (not forcibly, but recommended) for pre-compiling, which encapsulating everything into a single file. This is inconvinient for a website with a plugin system, so we analyzed the code generated by webpack and developed an approach to load components dynamically. It is the theoretical basis of Biohub 2.0's plugin system. You can refer to Main.vue to see such mechanism.
About UI
We choose Bootstrap 3 as our basic framework. Bootstrap is a UI framework developed by Twitter team, with multiple elegant components and the ability to prototype quickly. Based on it, we added many customized styles and components to provides better experience.
To visualize the data, we use serveral data representing frameworks. For example, d3.js for DNA sequance displaying in Forum and ngl.js for protein structure illustration. Such frameworks transform certain data into graphics, and make it easier for users to learn the content.

This did give us some positive clones.
Procedure was repeated for gRNA 3 and 4. Results were later confirmed by sequencing (however, it turned out that gRNA 3 was not correct after all. It took another round of picking colonies/digestion/sequencing before we also got that one right).
Mutagenesis of dCas9-pET26B
The Ala10TAG and Ala840TAG mutations were introduced by mutagenesis PCR , using the following primers:
dCas9 Ala10TAG fwd 5'-ggcaaaaatggataagaaatactcaataggcttatagatcggcacaaatagcgtc-3'

First PCRs revealed that only the Ala840TAG PCR was successful, as was revealed by gel electrophoresis (expected band size for both: 9077 bp).
The Ala10TAG mutation worked after addition of GC enhancer to the PCR mixture.
Mutations were verified after sequencing of isolated plasmids.

Expression of Cas9-pET26B in C321ΔA
Cas9-pET26B constructs as well as iGEM-Cas9 and the original pdCas9 were transformed in E. coli C321ΔA as described in Lajoie et. al (2013) protocol 1 for electroporation, successfully.  Later, also, pEVOL-BipA, pEVOL-pAzF and pEVOL-pBpF were transformed into C321ΔA, both with and without Cas9-pET26B constructs.
A first expression experiment was done with 50 ml overnight cultures of C321ΔA + Cas9 construct, in LB with the appropriate antibiotic.

Contrarily, the number of Civilians does not become larger if the primitive quantity of Peasants is too big while the original number of Civilians is too small. And this is considered acceptable. Besides, as is revealed, Civilians grows fastest when the primitive ratio of Peasants and Civilians is 1.
The results in Figure 1 and Figure 3 are also in line with expectation. Figure 1 demonstrates that when the concentration of Arabinose is 40μM, Civilians cannot live without Peasants, which means the cells in the media mainly live on sucrose instead of arabinose.

This comparison tells that 40μM is an appropriate concentration which is able to ask cells to live on sucrose but not arabinose."

Our project
We, the iGEM team Aachen 2018, are addressing a medical issue that has gained tremendous importance in past decades:       the diagnosis of melatonin under- and overproduction. Melatonin is primarily known as a sleep hormone. However, as the endocrine research reveals,       melatonin regulates all aspects of human physiology: day-night cycle, immune function, hormone release, muscle growth,       and reproduction are some of the many physiological properties that melatonin regulates. Underproduction of melatonin is primarily associated with insomnia. However, melatonin also plays an essential role in       neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease), psychological disorders (depression and schizophrenia) and fibromyalgia.       Melatonin acts antiproliferative on inflammations, reduces reactive oxygen species and has oncostatic properties.
Our innovative approach solves the problems of the current melatonin measurements.       Providing a faster, cheaper and a more versatile method, is our core motivation.
For our project we got a Gold medal as well as a nomination for the Best Hardware for our Spectrometer and LSPR device.
Key achievements
✔ Developed a concept for a novel biological and cell-free melatonin biosensor
✔ Modified the DNA binding site of a melatonin sensitive transcription receptor
✔ Expressed the melatonin sensitive receptor in Escherichia coli
✔ Modeled our cell and cell-free approaches precisely
✔ Built first iGEM ever spectrometer with a resolution of 4 nm
✔ Successfully hosted a biotechnology conference in collaboration with iGME Utrecht
Human Practices
To bring our project forward, we integrated feedback from experts of different backgrounds in our project.  Therefore, we engaged in dialogues with medical and engineering professionals, as well as discussed the rights of melatonin deficiency treatments with the Medicines Evaluation Board.
Besides, involving youth with synthetic biology was a part of our human practice. We cooperated with Germany's greatest scientific student competition ""Jugend Forscht"", the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) and a school.
Collaborations and meetups enabled us to unite internationally.
We  also took part in the international March for Science to demonstrate for free accessibility of scientific research, met"

Method 1
Protein Building Blocks
Protein building Blocks (without additional Streptavidin) . The single building blocks contain N- and C-terminal catcher-tag elements to form a permanent lock-key system. The polymer is build of two different building blocks as one single building block cannot be handled without instant polymerization. Mixing of the two building blocks start the polymerization via condensation reaction leading to a biopolymer tissue.
Pilis/Carbon Nano Tubes
Geobacter-conductive pili. The bacteria geobacter is a strictly anaerobic stem, which can produce electrically conductive proteins (Pili). Originally, they are used for their own energy gain however, they can also be used as conductive layer in our dielectric elastomer actuator and replace the carbon nanotubes as ecologically friendly alternative.
Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) are tubular architectures made of pure carbon. Every single carbon atom is sp2 hybridized and arranged in a hexagonal pattern. One can distinguish between Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs) and Multi Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs). The fabrication of the tubes can either be achieved by laser ablation of graphite or with a catalyst in a carbon rich gas phase. As pure carbon material, they are light-weight and flexible and robust. Further their thermal and electric conductivity is highly remarkable.
Artificial Muscle
Dielectric Elastomer Actuators (DEAs) are made of alternating layers of elastic and conductive material e.g. CNTs forming a stacked capacitor. The top and bottom contacts are metallic electrodes. By application of a voltage the elastomer between the cathodes and anodes is compressed in z-dimension and expands in the x,y-plane. This leads to a muscle-like contraction of the whole system.

The Lung Ranger
What We Hope to Achieve
Current Detection Methods for CF Lung Infections
Aims of The Lung Ranger
Current Detection Methods for CF Lung Infections
Patients normally attend the CF clinic once every three months, sometimes more if they are undergoing an exacerbation (a period when lung disease worsens). At these visits they undergo lung function tests and submit sputum samples (mucus that is coughed up from the lower airways (Fig 1)) which are cultured on different types of agar plates to detect pathogens present in the sputum (Fig 2). Some of these plates have to be incubated for up to a week, and so patients often don’t get results from their sputum samples for up to two weeks. In Scotland, some clinics cover vast areas, and patients and nurses have to travel long distances and reorganize work just to deliver or give a sputum sample.  After discussing with patients and health care professionals, we wanted to give patients more control over their condition by designing a device which would help monitor for lung infections. This would complement the quarterly clinic visits and would not significantly increase the treatment burden already faced by patients. Importantly, we aimed for our device to detect the presence of pathogens much more rapidly than current methods (within 1 hour).
Some species of bacteria, such as Burkholderia cenocepacia, can be mistaken for others. This is a problem because, in clinical centres, patients infected with"

Thoughts of making it more organic and less industrial. So naturally the owner could be a farmer, with special interests. As the real shop would get more important this way, our webshop would transform into something else - more a representation, a platform, a guideline, an explanation to see the farm/shop , the whole experience. Less mass products - more individual, nicheproducts, small products.
August 6th
Morning meeting with Patrick, web-design. He showes us his first draft for the page. We find it´s a bit harsh to start with the products on the first page. A intruduction needs to be made- with a static image, some explaning words or another media -> VIDEO. Main part will be a slide-show allowing the user to go through the different products of a category quickly. The feature of the slide-show will enable us to put the products in an order that makes sense to us and leaves the static view on only one product but gives an impression of a sortiment, a line, a social construct. By clicking onto the product in the slide you will come to the detailed product site. Video may be working in the slide-show as well, maybe - will be checked… The brainstorming of the meeting with the Heidelbergians in July is finally packed in a textfile - a pool for future ideas or extensions of already existing ones.

Again, a user interface was designed that enables wet lab students to vary the input parameters (Fig. 6).  The video below shows a simulation with 1000 bacteria chemotaxing towards a capillary with a diameter of 1mm filled with 1mM of chemoattractant. And Fig. 7 shows the number of bacteria in the capillary at each time point. This model demonstrated that the maximum number of bacteria accumulated in the capillary is at 3600 seconds. Therefore our modelling suggests that the wet lab student should perform this experiment for 60mins and then collect the data.

3.3.2 Bacterial chemotaxis in soil
In real soil, malate is used as the chemoattractant. Malate is constantly secreted from the root tip at a concentration of 3 mM[9]. In this case, the malate source is always replenished due to continuous secretion from the root and the distribution pattern can be considered as steady (i.e. independent of time). The steady-state Keler-Segel model was used to demonstrate this distribution (Equation 5).
The distribution of malate in real soil is displayed in Fig.5. The paths of bacterial chemotaxis when placing bacteria at different positions in steady malate distribution is demonstrated in Fig.5.
Figure 8(a): Distribution of malate with distance (1D).Figure 8(b): Distribution of malate with radius (2D). Figure 8(b)shows the position of the threshold detection concentration (1e-8 M at radius = 0.028 m) and the saturation concentration (1e-5 M at radius = 0.012).

In addition to Syngenta Monsanto is the second company that profits from the benefits of the Golden Rice. Reactions from the Greenpeace opponents criticize Greenpeace as the lobbyist of Monsanto. Potrykus means that the regulations of Greenpeace lead to the monopole for the financial sound companies. Another aspect of Potrykus is that the Greenpeace founder is pro the Golden Rice but the Greenpeace can’t stand for that because of the financial agents and the donations from the biotechnology opponents. Greenpeace claims IRRI to stop field trials of GR, other GM rice and GE rice research programs, to change the research founding towards ecological rice farming to improve the rice production, to phase out pesticides,  to develop ecological state-of-the-art-solutions and to move from synthetic to organic fertilizers. ""another example of big business hustling in on one the world's most sacred things: our food supply"" this was the statement of Chinese scientists concerning to the incidents about Golden Rice.
Monsanto's reaction
Monsanto is a company which produces seed and herbicides. Since 1990 they use plant biotechnologies for production of genetically modified crops. The stepwise evaluation scheme which refined and endorsed by many organizations controls whether biotech crops are as safe as the conventional counterpart. The food and feed safety assessment of biotechnology-derived crops  continues the test about unintended or pleiotropic changes have occurred due to the genetic modification process, the potential effects of the introduced trait and  is there incidents of food allergy or toxicity.
""We want to minimize the time and expenditure that might be associated with obtaining licenses needed to bring golden rice to farmers and the people in dire need of this vitamin in developing countries,"" Monsanto Chief Executive Hendrik Vefaillie said 2009. Monsanto gives away free licenses to use the patented technology for GR and other GM rice varieties. The company didn’t exercise its patent rights if another researcher develops the rice. The rice genomic sequence database is unblocked on the website of Monsato.
""I am grateful for this offer, which I certainly will accept. I consider the Monsanto offer important because I can now use this case to tell other companies, 'Look, Monsanto is giving me a free license. Won't you do the same?' It's an important first example.""  This was the reaction from Potrykus to the aim of the free licenses idea of Monsanto. But few years later he saw the development in a further direction: Do you know why we probably have these strict time consuming"

Incorporating rubber synthesis into E. coli
Figure 3: Construct containing prenyltransferases HRT1, HRT2, and SRPP cofactor.  All components are driven by a T7 IPTG inducible constitutive promoter, with unique ribosome binding spots.
While DXS synthase optimization can increase the amount of IPP and DMAPP substrate needed for cis-1,4-polyisoprene formation, we also need to introduce the xenogeneic components of H. brasiliensis into E. coli to enable synthesis of isoprene polymers.  To do so, we introduced a second component into our system—the prenyltransferases and SRPP coenzyme needed for isoprene extension.  We identified well characterized and isolated cDNAs from H. Brasiliensis for prenyltransferases participating in natural rubber biosynthesis.  Two enzymes were selected, HRT1 and HRT2, which were two cis-prenyl chain elongating enzymes isolated from Hevea latex.[21] These proteins are responsible for the synthesis of new rubber molecules and are also found expressed predominantly in fresh Hevea latex.  Because either HRT1 or HRT2 could be used for rubber synthesis, we incorporated both genes into a plasmid construct under a IPTG inducible constitutive promoter to allow for maximum expression of enzyme.
Since prenyltransferase requires an SRPP and various chemical cofactors for functionality, we identified the most commonly expressed SRPP in Hevea latex as a possible cofactor for HRT1 or HRT2 (Accession No. AB061234.2 and AB064661.2).[11, 22] However, because SRPPs can play a variety of roles in Hevea latex production, we targeted SRPPs that had also been identified as rubber elongation factors.[23] Our criterion for SRPP selection were that it had to be (1) a rubber elongation factor, (2) highly expressed in Hevea latex, and (3) of the small variety, since large rubber particle proteins would be difficult to produce in E. coli due to their size.[24] The gene of our SRPP (AF051317) was subsequently incorporated into the prenyltransferase cassette.[16] Since prenyltransferase activity depends on SRPP presence and gene order in an operon can influence expression level, we inserted the SRPP gene before the two prenyltransferases to account for the"

Transeq
It is not difficult to make protein sequence from nucleotide sequence. With codon table, we can make protein sequence manually without any special ability. To translate long nucleotide sequence, however, is not easy. Therefore, we used Transeq to virtually translate given nucleotides sequence. Transeq also do virtual-translation with shifted reading frame or non-transitional translation code tables like mitochondrial translation code table.

Modeller
Modeller is the program to predict the structure of protein with given peptide sequence based on the homology model. When given query sequence, Modeller searches for the similar sequence from database sequence whose structure is known. It assumes that similar sequences have similar structures and predicts the structure of query protein as the combination of known structure with similar sequence. This method is very useful for prediction of single chain antibodies because the structures of many original antibodies are known.

Matt
It is also possible to compare the structures between FGF binding domain of FGFR and single chain antibodies by using Modeller manually, but it is not quantitative and estimated by the rule of thumb. So, the result is not useful for further analysis. We used Matt to compare the structures of FGF binding domain of FGFR and single chain antibodies. Matt uses algorithms to maximize shared structure with small translation and rotations. Matt provides quantitative results to enable estimation of similarity and aligned structures of proteins to visualize the alignment.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," Pink box represent the sgRNA binding site.
To examine the functionality of our fusion protein further, we studied integration activity with different sgRNA and target DNA notebook ). Moreover, we repeated the reaction with longer incubation duration. With increasing incubation time, we observed fading bands representing targeted integration with increase in bands representing random integration ( notebook )
Conclusion
We successfully constructed, expressed and purified the fusion protein. We developed a method to test its functionality both in vivo and in vitro. We successfully demonstrated that our fusion protein was able to perform targeted integration in vitro. We sequence verified the integration products and confirmed that integration occurred in the region close to the sgRNA binding site.
4. Targeted Sequencing with dxCas9-Tn5
Once the in vitro functionality of the fusion protein was established, we used it as a tool to prepare samples for targeted sequencing using ONT MinION sequencing. We proved the targeted integration of DNA adapters compatible with Rapid Sequencing kit ( Oxford Nanopore Technologies ) and linked this activity to the pipeline of library preparation for sequencing. Data analysis proved the potential of the fusion protein to be used for targeted sequencing. To compliment our work, we also developed software tools to generate sgRNA arrays and adapters with barcodes needed for MinION sequencing and a software tool for sequencing data analysis to identify gene-doping DNA.
4.1 sgRNA Array Determination for Gene Doping Sequences
Design: We developed a tool that screens through a gene coding sequence, identifies possible Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequences for dxCas9 and analyzes the number of possible sgRNA molecules required for specific sites. One final specific site is chosen based on the lowest possible variation due to synonymous mutations, which was 12 for EPO cds, followed by generation of this array.
Results and interpretation: We generated a heat map that indicates the regions of human EPO gene with the lowest possible variation due to synonymous mutations (figure 20). The exon-exon junction (target sites that are gene-doping DNA-specific) is indicated with arrows in figure 20.
Figure 20. Heat map representing the total variation of EPO cds possible based on synonymous mutations. X axis represents EPO cds gene divided into subzones of 9 bp each. Subzones with darkest blue represent up to 18 possibilities of DNA (3 codons with 6 possible combinations each), whereas lightest subzones represent least number of possible DNA combinations. Junctions between exons are represented (in total 4 junctions) with their position in bp in EPO cds, number of identified PAM sequences and minimal number of"
Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Ribosense#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," full and correct protocol on our protocols page , including the appropriate calculations, we lacked the filters and so were only able to record the A450nm. We feel that this was close enough in wavelength to be a suitable proxy for the A420nm reading required to assay the o-nitrophenol produced. We ran an initial assay and indicative results are below. All the A450 bar charts are based on two repeats, error bars are not included as they would not be statistically significant.
The timecourse of the first run of the β-galactosidase assay using crcB knockout B. subtilis transformed with the fluoride riboswitch
A450nm readings after 420 minutes with crcB knockout B. subtilis transformed with the fluoride riboswitch
A450nm readings after 420 minutes with B. subtilis strain 168 transformed with the fluoride riboswitch
A450nm readings after 420 minutes with E. coli carrying a plasmid containing the fluoride riboswitch
This data seems to show a trend, that at low fluoride concentrations there is a positive relationship between concentration and A450, the A450 then plateaus, and then at high fluoride concentration the A450 drops again, this gives the overall data a bell shape. A possible explanation for this is that there are two conflicting effects, an increase in fluoride leads to an increase in β-galactosidase expression which, in turn, leads to an increased A450. However, the increased fluoride concentrations begin to become toxic and so limit the cell’s ability to produce β-galactosidase, leading to a reduction in A450. It would also seem that the linear region of the initial positive relationship seems to lie between 0μM and 100μM. We therefore repeated the assay, with a longer time course, and with greater resolution in this range, in order to see if the original trend could be reproduced, and also to better quantify this initial correlation. Included below are the results for the repeated assay.
The timecourse of the second run of the β-galactosidase assay using crcB knockout B. subtilis transformed with the fluoride riboswitch
A450nm readings after 790 minutes with crcB knockout B. subtilis transformed with the fluoride riboswitch
A450nm readings after 790 minutes with B. subtilis strain 168 transformed with the fluoride riboswitch

Introduction
There are many kinds of useful substance which we want to use in environment.  For example, bitumen contains resin and aromatic hydrocarbons that are used as glues or paved road.  Metals which are rare and are thought to increase needs are also useful substance we want to get.  However, it needs a large amount of water and energy to pick up usable aromatic compounds and metals.  We aim at picking up them using our Eco-tanker.  Eco-tanker will run lower energy than existing methods.  In this system, we challenged uptake and storage of iron ion in bacterial micro compartment (BMC).
Why is this device needed?
To store iron ion in BMC, we aimed at using iron-binding peptide and applying to construct a BMC fusion protein.  We focused on alpha-synuclein, which is natively unfolded protein and composed of 140 amino acids.  It is reported that the some metals are bound at the alpha-synuclein and Fe (III) is associated only with the 25 mer C-terminus of alpha-synuclein (MPVDPDNEAYEMPSEEGYQDYEPEA).  The Kd value of this peptide was 21 µM evaluated by ITC analysis (1).
What is this device composed inside it?
How does this device work in EcoTanker
Now we are trying to evaluate the expression and function of iron binding peptide and to ligate the peptide gene to promoter (BBa_B0034) and terminator (BBa_B0016).  We also aim at construction of fusion protein containing PduP which is a component of tank protein and the iron-binding peptide, which will enable to store Fe (III) in tank.

Gel Extraction
Materials
You will need:
Fermentas GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit
Microcentrifuge tubes
Microtiter pipette & tips
Extra Notes
All steps should be carried out at room temperature.
All centrifugations should be carried out in a microcentrifuge at > 12,000xg (10,000-14,000 rpm, depending on the rotor type)
See Fermentas protocol booklet for more information and detailed instructions.
Procedure
Pre-binding procedure
Cut out gel slice with the desired DNA fragment and weigh gel.
Add 1:1 volume of binding buffer to gel slice. (Eg. 100μL of binding buffer for every 100mg of agarose gel.)
Incubate gel solution at 50°C-60°C for 10 minutes.  Inverting tube helps melting process.
(Optional: only use if DNA fragment is <500bp or >10kb long) If DNA fragment is <500bp, add a 1:2 volume of 100% isopropanol to the solubilized gel solution. Mix thoroughly.  If DNA fragment is >10kb, add a 1:2 volume of water to the solubilized gel solution.  Mix thoroughly.
Binding DNA
Transfer (up to 800μL) gel solution to spin column.
Centrifuge for 30-60 seconds. Discard flow-through and place spin column back into same collection tube.
Washing column of residue
Add 700μL of wash buffer and centrifuge for 1 minute.
Discard flow-through and the centrifuge empty column for 1 minute.
Place the column into a fresh 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube.
Eluting DNA
Add 50μL of elution buffer to the column.
Centrifuge for 1 minute.  Keep the flow-through.
Purpose
To purify the DNA from the gel.

Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," widely used in a range of cell/tissue type transformations, capable of rapid delivery of multiple plasmids for transient or stable expression and without the use of carrier DNA. The high-velocity microparticles can penetrate plant cell walls, enabling transformation of plastids such as the chloroplast, which we will use in our project.
As useful as this technique is, the cost of commercially-available biolistic systems can run into the tens of thousands of pounds, making them unattainable for smaller laboratories and the hobbyist Syn Bio community. Our design will feature similar functions to these systems, allowing optimisation of firing pressure, duration and distance from the target, but for just 1% of their cost. The gene gun will be designed to use lower-cost consumable options, such as easily-replaceable CO2 cartridges.
The design will also incorporate safety features for the user, which are generally neglected in existing DIY designs available online. (1) It operates at 140 psi, while most similar designs online use 600-700 psi, and most commercial ones around 1350 psi, (2) all electronics are contained inside a box, so no electrical connections are exposed, (3) additional circuit fuses are included and are specifically rated for the current going through, (4) all components are tested separately for leaks and electrical safety.
Growth facility
Within the field of synthetic biology, there has recently been a necessity for low-cost, DIY, biological lab equipment in order to maintain the momentum at which the field is developing. Our iGEM team has two solutions to this problem, one of which is the growth chamber. Our team’s growth chamber allows you to optimise the conditions and to record and analyse the growth of your 90 mm petri dishes at a fraction of the cost of the commercially available equivalents, regardless of the samples you're growing
Hardware Specification
Gene Gun
Total cost <£250 (1% of PDS-1000 retail price) – the final cost will be close to £228.05, with just the safety shield for the gun left to assemble.
Generate pressure pulse of at least 100 psi
Adjustable pulse pressure – maximum pressure of 10 bar.
Adjustable pulse duration – minimum pulse of 50 ms, adjustable in 10 ms increments.
Display pressure of firing pulse.
Contain all electrical connections and wiring within an insulated box, ensuring there are no exposed electrical connections to pose risk to the user.

Flux Balance Analysis
We aimed to use modeling to shape our product design, for example as a tool to optimise compound production under given conditions and to determine an ideal energy source that would optimise our compound of interest. To achieve this, we used the COBRA Toolbox that is implemented in MATLAB to conduct Flux Balance Analysis on various gut strains of E.coli. This involved sourcing existing models of our particular strain BL21, which was found on BiGG database [1]. This would serve as our primary model strain as the same particular strain was used for transformation and protein expression in the experimental outcome.
The concept was to optimize the non-native reaction by adding constraints and prioritising a particular reaction, such that a theoretical value is presented that defines the possibility of the reaction to take place [2]. In the models, there are numerous reactions that make up a large metabolic network. Additional non-native reactions represent the reactions that occur in the bacteria as a result of our genetic engineering. The objective of modelling is to predict the levels of L-DOPA and dopamine that can be produced in various growth conditions.
All metabolites involved in the large metabolic are produced and consumed, such that a steady state condition (the net flux of each metabolite is zero) is maintained [3]."

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#Synergene#applicationscenario_-_-_TEXT.html," these pipes or at chokepoints in the ditches and waterways would allow collection of the runoff phosphorus before it was able to spread further into the environment.
Floating Phosphorus Reclamation Module (PRM): While it may be useful to concentrate efforts of phosphorus collection as close to the source as possible, that is sometimes impossible. To counter this our team designed a floating PRM which could be placed on buoys in lakes and rivers to steadily decrease the phosphorus load in the surrounding water and help decrease the chance of algal blooms.
Methane Digester: A novel use for our system would be in combination with methane digesters. These digesters use bacteria to break down organic matter and produce methane which can be used for energy. The resulting effluent (broken down nutrient mash) can be placed on the field to act as fertilizer. While some nutrients in the effluent are effectively used and considered limiting (nitrogen), others can build up in the soil over time (phosphorus). Eventually the built up phosphorus will leach from the soil to nearby bodies of water. This problem may be avoided by extracting phosphorus out of the effluent before being applied to the field, using a system similar to our PRM.
Production & Costs
Our current working prototype costs around $40 to produce from easily obtainable parts (Two 5-gallon buckets, 3 canisters, 3 filters, tubing, pump motor). The final design will require either a power source or solar panels, which will drive up the initial cost. The biggest cost however will come from bead construction and filter replacement over the lifetime of the device. The filtration is done in two parts, a physical filter for larger particulates, and a packed bed of beads with our genetically modified E. coli inside, both of which are housed in a plastic cannister attached to the holding tanks. This filtration system will need to have both parts replaced once a month, which will cost approximately $2 per filter. Bead replacement will cost approximately $2-$3 per cannister including costs for E.coli propagation and silica bead production. If the final design contains 4 cannisters, monthly maintenance will be $16-$20. Ultimately, these monthly costs will decrease as economies of scale begin to work in our favor.
Risks
Biocontainment: As with most iGEM projects, biocontainment is a serious risk. Our even more so since the primary use of our technology is directly in the environment we are attempting to protect. Our first line of defense would the build of the phosphorus reclamation module (PRM), the"

To begin with our investigations of the following matters : communication, interaction and responsibility in scientific research, we decided to ask the general public about it. We designed a survey and submitted it in public to passerby in Lausanne as well as in Basel (in collaboration with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich ETHZ). This allowed us to better spot the expectations that people have towards the scientific community as well as opening our minds to views we are not used to meet as scientific students. It was also an opportunity to introduce synthetic biology to those who did not know about it. In addition to that, we asked the highschool students we invited at our Highschool day to fill out the same survey before they visited us on the EPFL campus. Here is a summary of the survey and an analysis of the most interesting results.
Public survey in Lausanne
On saturday the 22nd of August from 9 am to 4 pm, we held a stand in Rue Haldimand in our town Lausanne. Passerby came and went from and to the market and many of them were intrigued by our poster asking “What is synthetic biology ? Give us your opinion !”. We submitted them our survey and took the opportunity to answer questions about synthetic biology, iGEM and our project. About fifty people stopped by, talking with them was very interesting enlightening.
We began by asking the subject whether he/she had ever heard about synthetic biology, and if the answer is no, we provided him/her with the Wikipedia definition: “Synthetic biology is a scientific field combining biology and engineering in order to  design and build (synthesize) new biologic systems and units”. Note that the definition does not mention the word GMO, as this has its importance later on. It was clear to us that synthetic biology still is not a popular expression, as most people had never heard about it.
We then asked the subject whether this definition gave him/her a rather positive or negative feeling about synthetic biology. The answers were enthusiastic, with a vast majority of “rather positive”.
The interesting thing is that after several questions which content we will analyze later, our last question was:"

Our Simplest Guidelines for Safe Work and Ethical Practices, if you plan on working on real parasites!
Investigating samples from patients
As every enthusiastic scientist, since we started working on Human African Trypanosomiasis, we wanted to reach the stage where we could test blood human samples with our integrated system, to investigate its efficiency and specificity in real patients. Therefore, we started contacting experts in the field, to understand more about possible problems and to seek advice. From that perspective, World Health Organization has been one of our biggest targets. After more research, we found out that WHO targeted HAT elimination as a public health problem by 2020. Also, in 2013 WHO and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation signed an agreement to support innovative strategies to eliminate the disease. To support that, they set up a specimen bank containing blood, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva and urine from affected and unaffected people from endemic countries from Africa.
Acting upon it!
We completed a form to submit it to the organization. However, our naïve expectations were soon faced with reality after consulting our idea with one of the supervisors, Dr Berndt Muller, who further evaluated it with Aberdeen University Safety Committee. Unfortunately, we did not have the necessary training or the vaccinations required to work with real antigens. Even more, that could have exposed us to risk of infections, had we not checked it with qualified personnel before.
Different approach
Even though we felt disappointed, this experience taught us that ethical and safety issues are the basis of any scientific project and only by addressing those issues first, you can then be free to tackle the real scientific challenges. Our different approach was to design the project in the direction of a proof-of-concept idea and to find different ways through which we could get our project to the stage of a more real-life based assay and characterisation. Therfore, we did more literature research and contacted immediately two experts in the field of Human African Trypanosomiasis, Dr. Philippe Büscher, Head of the Unit of Parasite Diagnostics at Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp and Liesbeth Van Nieuwenhove, PhD Biology"

The Rita Women Development Association resides in the Rwenzori region of Western Uganda. This group empowers women in their community and promotes contraceptives to prevent the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases. Through the recommendation of Kabugho Beatrace of KUWA, we met the Rita women. Masika Vicky, the chairperson of Rita, informed us of the stigma on birth control (primarily condoms because they are the only contraception available). Read More >> Currently, their group is working on an anti HIV/AIDS campaign due to the high percentage of people affected by the virus in the Rwenzori region. The spread of HIV/AIDS stems from the stigma on contraception use; according to Masika Vicky's statistics, an estimated 98% of people fear to buy condoms in public and therefore have unprotected sex despite the outbreak of HIV/AIDS. This stigma also correlates with the high birth rates, similar to those seen in the Kasese Municipality where KUWA resides. Masika Vicky relayed that “Uganda is now highly populated, so we are encouraging family planning.” We spoke to five Rita women about their opinions on our progesterone-producing yeast and they all were excited for a contraception method containing naturally-produced progesterone. One Rita member informed us that they’ve initiated “related programmes to teach women about reproductive health and child spacing”. We are grateful to work with a group with similar goals to ours, and we appreciate the insight.

Dr. Pam Lowe, Aston University
Our team spoke to Dr. Pam Lowe from Aston University in the United Kingdom. Dr. Lowe is the Senior Lecturer for the Department of Sociology and Policy at Aston University. Dr. Lowe is well known for her strong opinions on the unspoken ‘two-child policy’ in the United Kingdom. According to Dr. Lowe, the only stigma on birth control is not on those who use it, but rather it’s on those who don't. Read More >> Fortunately for the UK, birth control is free with the National Health Service, even for teenagers. Even migrants make use of sexual health clinics in the UK since the NHS does not require a valid ID. In Dr. Lowe’s opinion, the UK most likely doesn't need our new method. Dr. Lowe’s information was valuable, even if it didn't favor our projects.

General protocol
Strike the desired strains on LB plates or LB plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic (depending on the bacteria we are working with: the wild type, sensitive to the antibiotic, or the transformed ones, resistant to the selective agent). Allow to grow by incubating at 37°C at least 24 hours.
Gather a large amount of bacteria with an inoculation loop and transfer to 1 mL of LB or LB supplemented with the antibiotic. Incubate during 20 minutes at 37°C and 200 rpm.
Inoculate 100 µL of bacterial suspension in a tube containing 3 mL of LB with antibiotic. Perform four biological replica of each culture. The                expression of Bb4 was induced with a heat shock at 42 °C for 2 min. The expression of Bb5 and Bb6 was induced by adding doxycycline and IPTG, respectively,                to the medium.
Incubate until OD595 is between 0.15-0.4 (1 hour aprox.).
Measure OD595.
In the case of Biobrick parts 4, 5 and 6, sonicate an aliquot of the culture (it allows us working with the pretein extract, avoiding the interference of cell density in the measurement of the blue, product of the XGal reaction), eliminate cell debris by centrifugation (2 min, max. rpm), add X-Gal, incubate 6 min at RT, and stop the                reaction by adding Na2CO3.
Measure either GFP fluorescence (Bb1 and Bb3;  λex=493nm;  λem=505nm), RFP fluorescence (Bb2;  λex=576 nm;  λem=592 nm), or absorbance at 630 nm                (Bb4, Bb5, and Bb6). Fluorescence measurements were performed in a Hitachi F7000 plate reader, whereas a spectrophotometer was used for absorbance                measurements.
With Excel, normalize fluorescence by cell density, and calculate the average and standard deviation taking into account the four biological replicas.                Represent the data.
Results
The behavior of all the Biobrick parts we tested is shown in Figure 1. From our results, it is evident that the expression of all but one of the          constructions, Bb5, clearly differed depending on the host strain of choice. Even for Bb5, using an ANOVA test for six groups and 4 replicas, one can reject the null hypothesis of"

Project Description
Background
Vitamin B12 is involved in metabolic functions in all organisms, and is therefore an essential nutrient. However, it can only be synthesized by some bacteria and archaea, thus, animals have to obtain it through their diet. Thereby, only animal products like meat and dairy contain B12 in general. This B12 was synthesized by microorganisms colonizing the gastrointestinal tract of those animals and accumulated in the animals’ tissues.
Vitamin B12 is one of the most expensive biochemicals in the world, and its synthesis is extraordinarily complex. Since the chemical production of Vitamin B12 requires 70 synthesis steps, it is far too technically challenging and expensive. Therefore, its production is facilitated by genetically engineered microorganisms. These are able to produce Vitamin B12 in industrial amounts and achieve a high product quality. However, the produced Vitamin B12 is harvested by cell lysis, which prevents a continuous production. The efficiency of production could be increased by exporting Vitamin B12 outside the cells. To date, no natural cellular Vitamin B12 exporter is known.
Relevance
An adult needs approximately 3.0 µg Vitamin B12 per day which is essential for certain functions: it is involved in processes concerning synthesis of DNA, hormones and neurotransmitters and also acts in the formation of the nervous system and blood. Hence, a B12 deficiency can cause diverse diseases like cancer, dementia, depression, pernicious anemia and polyneuropathy.
Nowadays, many people do not eat meat or animal products at all. Therefore, these people have a high risk to suffer from B12 deficiency if their diet does not provide enough B12.
Vitamin B12 is also used in the industry as it is needed in the biotechnical production of various organic substances. Furthermore, it is added to diverse daily products like toothpaste, fruit gum, non-diary milk or cleaning solution for contact lenses.
Our Aim
We intend to design, construct and introduce a synthetic Vitamin B12 exporter (“Synporter”) into a production organism. Thereby, we aim for facilitated and higher yields in the industrial Vitamin B12 production without requiring cell lysis. The B12 Synporter consists of a signal for a Twin Arginine Transporter (Tat) mediated export that is linked"

From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and"

HUMAN PRACTICES OVERVIEW
There are three aspects of human practices: integrated practices, collaboration with other iGEM teams, and educational outreach.
For integrated human practices, we were able to get advice from various different sources. Dr. Kagimoto, a founder of a biotech company, helped us understand the recent developments in gene editing and stem cell research in Japan. He also gave us further insights on how such technology can be combined and applied to treat mutational diseases in the future in a way that would benefit the patients. Our conversations with him inspired us to choose this topic for our project this year. Dr. Seyama, a researcher at Jutendo University, enhanced our background knowledge on A1AT Deficiency, the specific disease we decided to target in our project. Furthermore, we received advice on our construct design by Tokyo Tech and Bochan Lab, who suggested we use a histidine tag to improve our protein purification process.
Our team was able to reach out to other iGEM teams in order to share information and advice about our respective projects. We talked to Lacas Biobots through video chat and different iGEM teams in East Japan at a meetup. Through interactions with the other teams, we were able to gain insight on each other's projects and learn how the other teams applied synthetic biology in different ways.
Finally, we were able to implement educational outreach by leading a forensics lab during the ASIJ Summer Passport Camp program, holding a discussion with the GOA Medical Problem Solving Course regarding developments in genetic engineering, and presenting to ASIJ student parents during the High School Back-to-School Night.

Figure 1: Biobrick structure of the BUK/PTB pathway with the IPTG-inducible promoter (lacI)
RESULTS:
Successful digestion and assembly of the CDSs of the PTB and BUK genes into the PSB1C3 vector with the LacI promoter and RBS.
In order to confirm that the gene inserts were successfully ligated, Colonies were screened by PCR (Figure 2). Putative clones were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

Cloning the Butyrate Biosynthetic Pathway - PART II
Our overall aim was to clone the coding sequences (CDSs) of the butyrate biosynthetic pathway from Coprococcus sp. L2-50 (DSM 16842) for expression in E. coli. In total the pathway contains eight coding sequences. We managed to clone the pathway that would convert butyrate into butyryl-CoA (Pathway I) and, separately, the pathway that would convert acetyl-CoA into butyryl-CoA (Pathway II).
Pathway II:
AIM:
To clone the CDSs from the thiolase (THL), beta-hydroxybutyryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (BHBD), Crotonase (CRO), Butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (BCD), Electron Flavoprotein subunit a (EFa), and Electron Flavoprotein subunit b (EFb) genes from Coprococcus sp. with an IPTG-inducible promoter.  This BioBrick should catalyze the conversion of acetyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA.

What is your primary source of information about synthetic biology?
As we can see,
How would you rate the quality of this information?
The respondents rated information highly for accuracy (although perhaps this is to be expected as it is unlikely one would continue to read information from a source which regularly got the facts wrong). Relevance also scored highly, showing that people feel synthetic biology has a sufficient impact on their lives that they ought to be kept informed about it. The high score for availability is likely due to the heavy reliance on online information, however it is probable that this reliance also contributes to the relatively low scores for independence and accessibility. The sources accessed by the public online may well not be aimed at laymen but intended to be read by students or professionals and so may contain a high level of technical detail not accessible to the lay public.
The majority of teams (85%) appear to feel that there is at least the possibility that their project could be turned into a viable business or project – this makes sense given that many teams seek to use their project as an opportunity to use synthetic biology to address a problem.
Again this chart shows how few teams believe their project is relevant to society. There was a split, slightly skewed towards commercial investment, in terms of the favoured means of funding, although it should be noted that many participants selected more than one option, suggesting mixed feelings and uncertainty on this question. Donation to the public domain was a popular option, indicating that many students support the BioBrick agreement and are keen to contribute their parts to it.
Responses to this question support the need for guidance for iGEM teams on IP issues. Possible explanations for this the larger than expected (29%) group selecting 'adequate' include: evidence of a Drunning-Kruger effect whereby people overestimate their level of knowledge; underestimating the significance and relevance of intellectual property law to synthetic biology; or a genuinely adequate understanding amongst students.
The graph below shows that profit is the least important considerations to students, but all others ranked more or less equally overall. The most important factor overall was benefit to society.

International synthetic biology symposium
We hosted an international symposium with home speakers, invited keynote speakers from both academia and industry as                 well as four neighbouring iGEM teams. A debate about the risks, the regulation                 and the ethics connected to synthetic biology, free food and more were part of                 the symposium. Go to our symposium page to find out what we did exactly.
The Toulouse model
During the meetup with the iGEM team of Toulouse where we exchanged experience, we decided on a mutual             cooperation concerning the modeling of our circuits. The Toulouse team made a             Flux Balance Analysis for us to see the effect of the system on the total metabolism of the cell. You can find the model of Toulouse and our interpretation of the results in our modeling section . We also made a model for the Toulouse team. Here, we calculated the diffusion of both produced molecules formic and butyric acid to learn more about the effect on the Varroa destructor in the direct environment of the hive. After simulating their set up, we were able to suggest an improvement to the design of their trap. It currently includes a small tube which impedes the diffusion of the two molecules into the hive. Removing or shortening the tube could improve their design. You can find our model on the Toulouse wiki .
York water samples
We sent water samples from the Dijle river and the water we collected from a                 normal tap inside our building for a comparison study to the York iGEM team. According to their requirements, we filtered both the samples using a                 0.22 μm filter, measured the pH and then mailed the 10 Falcon-tubes with the samples                  to York. We hope the samples served the York team well.

Learning how to Facilitate Learning in Second Life :)
Did most of the debugging on DNA extraction today (almost done). We had an excellent meeting at ICT discussing how to implement better guides, etc. to facilitate learning on our island, which we will be starting to do shortly, as the basics of each of the three sections are finished (lab is almost there).
Third lab mission was written up: from DNA extraction of genomic DNA to PCR with biobricking of a gene from that DNA, to restriction digesting with other components to build a circuit.

Upstream to each promoter the gfp gene is cloned, for example when pHT3101-BtI-BtIIp-gfp is digested with PstI, a fragment of ~ 0.73 kb, corresponding to the gfp gene, is released (Figure 1D, lane 2). We are in in process of cloning both promoters into the pSB1C3 vector and also of confirming their functionality to regulate the expression of the green fluorescent protein in E. coli.
Amplification of Alginate lyase gene
    When we designed the biosensor, our first option to attack the alginate of the P. aeruginosa biofilms was the lysozyme (Rajaraman et al., 2016).  At the beginning we designed primers to amplify the lysozyme from leukocytes, we obtained RNA and then synthesized cDNA for using as template to obtain the lysozyme gene. Nevertheless, we were not able to amplify the lysozyme gene, so we decided to look for other options. Alginate is hydrolyzed by alginate lyase (Farrell and Tipton, 2012), one of the main component of P. aeruginosa biofilm (Tielen et al., 2013), but this  gene was not found in the registry. We analyzed the genome of one strain of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis AM65-52 (GenBank accession number: CP013275.1) and found a putative alginate lyase gene, so we designed primers to amplify this gene. It is important to indicate that there is no report of the cloning and characterization of an alginate lyase in B. thuringiensis. In this regard, we amplified for the first time a putative alginate lyase genes from a strain of B. thuringiensis, obtaining an amplicon of between 1.5  and 2.0 kpb in B. thuringiensis 4Q7 and B. cereus (Figure 2). We decided to continue working with amplicon of 4Q7 and it was ligated into the pCold to generate the pCold-algy and was transformed in E. coli. Also we sequenced the algy gene at Langebio, México."
