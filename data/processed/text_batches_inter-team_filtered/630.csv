But what is the real danger of microplastics?  Not enough research has been done to truly get a grasp on their widespread effects, but many concerning revelations have been made.  Many plastics are manufactured along with certain additives like dyes and plasticizers.  Degradation of larger plastics into microplastics can expose these often harmful chemicals to the environment.  Besides those pollutants the plastic is made with, microplastics have been seen to have an increased affinity for harmful persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that they encounter in treatment plants and the marine environment.  One study has shown that a polychlorinated biphenyl (a POP) levels were 106 times higher on polypropylene pellets than in the surrounding seawater.6 To compound the problem, the plastics are likely to release the POPs again in the presence of high levels of organic material, as found in the digestive tract of animals, for instance, a phenomenon that could be more intense for less hydrophobic polymers such as those from synthetic clothing.7 This means that microplastics can concentrate the POPs in the ocean, and when the microplastics are ingested by plankton or larger animals and those animals are eaten by others, the microplastics release the concentrated pollutants to the animals’ tissues. This intensified bioaccumulation of harmful chemicals affects not only marine life, but everything that eats marine life, including humans.
As was mentioned by David St. Pierre in the video above, there is currently no cost effective way to remove microplastics from the effluent at wastewater treatment plants.  Our project works to solve this problem through the creation of a biofilter to remove microplastics.  It has two unique parts which each tackle a different aspect of the filter.  On the one hand, we are attempting to create a strain of E. coli which will form a biofilm along the surfaces of a filter to increase the concentration of bacteria within the filter and minimize the amount of bacteria lost in the flow-through.  The second aspect of our project is to have those E. coli secrete a nylon degrading enzyme into the water which will degrade the microplastics passing through into their constituent monomers and prevent the polymer from leaving the treatment plant where it can wreak havoc.

Biology and chemistry are my biggest interest and also a sort of hobby to me so I chose to study biotechnology because of the mix of the two. I joined the DTU iGEM team to learn synthetic biology and to get the experience of doing it. I also like the idea that you can go into the lab and create something that has never been made before. When I’m not doing school work I enjoy watching sports like football, handball and boxing but road cycling beats them all. My favorite cake is banana cake with big chunks of chocolate.

Overview
    This Part Collection consists of parts from three different systems: oscillation system, light-dependent control system and logical gate system. Parts numbered from K1886000 to K1886002 belong to the oscillation system, in which two quorum sensing auto inducers, AHL and DPD reach their peak value alternately. Parts numbered from K1886003 to K1886006 and K1886017 belong to light-dependent control system, which can output either green or red florescent protein in response to different inputs (green or red light). Parts numbered from K1886010 to K1886013 belong to AND gate system. It can realize the coupling of the output of the two systems mentioned above. The combination of AHL/DPD and green/red light results the production of green/red florescent protein. There is other AND gate circuits that use IPTG/ARA and red/green light as input, in order to test the coupling of light-dependent control system and the AND gate. The range of part number is from K1886000 to K1886017.

Did a second attempt of miniprepping the pXRL2- and pUC19-containing E. coli, but unfortunately had salt contamination in our resulting sample. We attempted this a third time by tossing out flow-throughs between each step of the miniprep procedure and obtained workable plasmid samples for pXRL2 and pUC19.
Primers came in and were rehydrated.
We performed our first attempt to PCR amplify out the ade2 homologous arms from Y. lipolytica using colony PCR. No amplification was observed. For our second amplification attempt, we used Touchdown PCR and used increasing concentrations of yeast cells in the PCR reaction mixes. Still no results.

So many people are in the lab now! Because so many of our small lab teams have transitioned to lab work, the “Yeast Parents”, or team in charge of maintaining the yeast and the lab, gave everyone a tour of the space to keep everything organized (and keep us all in line).
Unfortunately, with great numbers of people in lab comes great margin for mistake. We burnt through a ridiculous amount of Q5 polymerase this week because we miscommunicated the concentrations needed to perform PCR. However, the team took this as a learning experience and practiced concentration math and master-mix-making. We are also going to begin a crowdfunding campaign to supplement the team funds when/if errors arise in the future.
Outreach is really cool! Three of us, plus our PI (of course), spoke to Martyn Smith, Managing Director of the Family Planning 2020 Secretariat, over the phone. He nearly gave us heart attacks when he offered to help us reach local agents familiar with the regulatory environments in the countries we wanted our project to extend to. Aside from the FP2020 call, two of our members have been diligently working on outreach at home. They’ve started to develop a game as an interactive way for high schoolers to join in when we present our project to them later this month.
After double checking that we were using the right volumes for our PCR reaction, we were able to linearize pUC19 and pXRL2. We then confirmed this by running it on a 1% agarose gel seen below.
We ran OE PCR reactions without prim"

With a incubation time of 2 hours with 0.5 mM CuCl2 we can double the activity of the BPUL laccase (see Fig. 10). Another interesting topic was the impact of imidazole buffer on the BPUL activity. For that we tested fr. 7 and fr. 18 in imidazole buffer and rebuffered in H2O. The results we got were unambiguously: BPUL in imidazole buffer didn't show much activity. Unfortunately we can't omit the rebuffering.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#News#Oilsands_-_-_TEXT.html,"umen is only extractable near Fort McMurray however because here it is closer to the surface.  In other locations, the bitumen is found too deep from the surface to be able to be extracted.
It was interesting to see the differences between the procedures used by Suncor in comparison to what ConocoPhilips does.  Were as Suncor uses surface mining, ConocoPhilips uses a method called SAGD.  This stands for surface addicted gravity drainage.  In this process, a vertical hole is drilled in the ground that then branches out horizontally once it has reached a certain depth.  Pipes are then inserted.  There are two pipes, a larger one for the Bitumen extraction and a smaller one to inject steam into the ground.  This steam is used to reduce the viscosity of the bitumen so that it can then diffuse into the other pipe.  Because it is less viscous then the surrounding bitumen, it is then able to rise to the surface.  Here it is treated with a synthetic crude oil product (produced by Suncor) which further reduces the viscosity so that it can flow easier through the pipelines on its way to be treated.  The steam moves upwards out of the pipe, creating a V shape of extraction.  This steam is then partially recovered through the use of lifting gas.  This form of extraction is used for bitumen found further from the surface than the bitumen that is mined through open excavation (like Suncor).  A result of this method of extraction is that the majority of the pant is found underground, this reduces the surface impact and footprint.  Pipelines are raised above the ground in several locations to allow various forms of wildlife to be able to cross underneath them.  The pipes are also bent in some places to allow room for expanding and contracting with temperature changes in the air, which can be a particular problem in the winter time.
At the end of this presentation, we briefly discussed some of the major problems that they face right now in trying to make their site more efficient and environmentally friendly.  This was interesting to us as this is where we might be able to help.  Some possible things to look into are:
Efficiency of energy production. One of the ConocoPhilips representatives mentioned that they can extract 6 barrels of oil for every barrel equivalent of energy that is put in. Most of the input energy is lost in producing steam to heat the bitumen and sufficiently lower its viscosity to enable it to flow. Although this number is certainly more realistic than what I heard at Suncor the day before (and, admittedly"

The captain Cheng unreservedly shared their experience to us, not only what new software tools they intended to use this year to build the wiki, but also the mistakes they have made when signed in the visa. Surprise and laughter could be heard during the communication. After the meeting, captain took us to visit their laboratories and showed us the ""kits"" standard parts sample sent by the official last year. Through the communication and learning with HUST-China, we have a more detailed understanding of wiki construction and transactional work such as visa. We really appreciate them.     
After the visit we took photos with the HUST-China team together
HZAU-China
    In the morning of May 21,we arrived at Huazhong Agricultural University to exchange our views with HZAU-China team members, who has participated in the iGEM competition three times and won three gold medals since 2013 for their outstanding performance in project innovation and modeling. Chu Pan , the leader of HZAU-China, offered a warm reception to us with other HZAU-China team members. Chu Pan first took us to visit their independent iGEM lab and introduced the basic situation of the laboratory. They patiently answered our questions and unreservedly shared their experience with us. For example, they advised us that if a suitable modeling breakthrough is not found, we can loop modeling pathway of the entire gene pathway. After more than three hours of communication, we had a more detailed understanding of the whole process of preparation. Our visit to HZAU-China came to an end after taking a photo of the whole group. What deeply moved us is that they specially asked one of their members to lead us to the bus station in case that we may lost.
We talked with HZAU-China captain Chu Pan about their project in the lab

The target organism is accounted for when collecting the necessary genetic code - as it may have already have the metabolic capability coded into its genome. Additionally, BioMORTAR will consider the existing biological library, the BioBrick registry, which is submitted to and verified by the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. BioMORTAR plasmid designer then finds an enzyme coding BioBrick sequence in the registry and uses it in the plasmid as appropriate. BioMORTAR also provides an easy-to-use interface for selecting the regulatory BioBrick parts for highly tuned pathway expression, including a given plasmid backbone, promoter sequence, ribosome binding site , and terminator sequence. Such controls allow for the novel pathway to be constitutive or regulated, the backbone plasmid to be multiplicative in the host (high copy number), or for complex self-regulation of the novel pathway (feedback inhibition).
Reads the enzymes from the generated metabolic pathway
Searches the databases for the genes for the required enzymes
Attaches specified promoters, ribosome binding sites, and terminators
Organizes all of the genetic code and creates a plasmid in silico

COBRA cell Modeling
The final part of BioMORTAR is the in silco prediction of cellular behavior and growth with the incorporation of the plasmid into a selection of organisms, more specifically Escherichia coli iJR904, iAF12 and the textbook strains; Helicobacter pylori iIT341; Methanosarcina barkeri iAF692; Mycobacterium tuberculosis iNJ661; Staphylococcus aureus iSB619; Saccharomyces cerevisiae iND750. The genome-scale metabolic reactions and pathway reconstruction models have been provided by the Biochemical, Genetic and Genomic knowledge base of large scale metabolic reconstructions, or BiGG (Schellenberger, 2010) in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) format. To assemble predicted growth and cellular behavior, the model is loaded into the Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis Toolbox (COBRA) using the Matlab software (Becker, 2007). This program is able to construct reaction fluxes of a biochemical reaction based on user-defined bounds for fluxes through reactions within the metabolic network. The COBRA program uses dynamic flux-balance analysis (FBA) to predict the maximum growth rates"

2. Calculation of the Minimum Free Energy Change of Stemloop Formation4 Assume i.j is the closing base pair of the loop
G（i,j）= min { GH ( i , j ) , GS( i , j ) + G ( i + 1 , j – 1 ) , GBI( i , j ) } ;
GBI ( i , j ) = min{ gbi( i , j , k , l ) + G( k , l ) } for all 0 < k – i + l – j - 2 < max_size
G(i,j) is the minimum free energy change of stemloop formation. GH is the free energy change to form a hairpin loop. GS is the free energy change to form a stack. GBI is to calculate the minimum free energy change of structure containing 2-loop. gbi(i,j,k,l) is the free energy change to form 2-loop.
3.Calculation of T Tail Score
Here we consider 15 nucleotide in the downstream of stemloop. T tail score nT is calculated as follows :
In our program, if the length of the T tail( n ) is less than 15, we will only consider n nucleotides. If TL is more than 15, we will only consider 15 nucleotides.
4.Calculation of Score
Score = nT * 18.16 + deltaG / LH * 96.59 – 116.87
Here nT is T tail score. deltaG is the minimum free energy change of stemloop formation. LH is the length of stemloop.5,6

Stuttgart,2017,Team:Stuttgart#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," we are aiming to engineer Escherichia coli to express enzymes like esterases, lipases and keratinases into the medium.          Due to the extracellular expression expensive and time-consuming purification steps could be avoided and the enzymes could be secreted directly into the drain. As a special feature we want to use the metabolites of the enzymatic degradation to produce a lovely rose-scent to refresh your whole room.          In addition this reaction could also be used to indicate that the enzymes are working efficiently on your drainage problem.

Light up the pipe - Three parts for a better flow
Part 1 - Esterases and Lipases
Hair is surrounded by a layer of grease and waxes which first need to be removed to make the hair-keratin available for keratinases.              For the first degradation step we choose a combination of  esterases and lipases.             Lipases and esterases are lipolytic enzymes that are used in food processing, beverages, therapeutics and degradation of synthetic materials (Panda und Gowrishankar 2005).              Lipases (EC. 3.1.1.3) and esterases (EC. 3.1.1.1) are hydrolases that catalyze the hydrolysis (and synthesis) of triacylglycerols into acid and alcohol molecules.              They differ mainly on the basis of substrate specifity and activation mechanism.              Lipases hydrolase triacylglyderols with longer fatty acid chains than esterases and lipases have a hydrophobic domain covering their active site.              Therefore lipases need to be activated with organic solvents to make the active site accessible for substrates.              Esterases and lipases are classified into 8 groups on the basis of the conserved sequence motifs and biological properties.              EstCS2 belongs to class VII (Kang et al. 2011; Shamsher Singh Kanwar).
We investigated two different esterases for their enzyme activity.            One esterase from the registry (EstCS2 BBa_K1149002) and one esterase (LipB) supplied by Dr. Eggert from Evoxx were compared.            Additionally, we choose the lipase TliA to support the esterases at the fat degradation and to accelerate the entire degradation process.            For the extracellular secretion of the enzymes we attached the signal sequence PelB which was provided on the iGEM plates"

KK Over the break we did little Lab work. Kelton was in Rexburg, and Clarice and I didn’t have the necessary primers to continue working. Today the primers came! We submitted primers for all the genes that have been cloned into pIG78 with pIG78 for sequencing. (I believe we included the primers for all the genes). We also have primers for working with CRO in the pBAD plasmid. Today our assignment was to make goals and set plans for what we hope to accomplish by the end of the term. Our plans are to be submitted by Friday. Our plans are spelled out in a table we’re printing, but they include understanding (via sequencing) what is ocurring in the plasmid by May 13th, correcting our system by May 29th, and demonstrating that we can induce Lambda into lysis through expression CRO. We will place CRO on the pBAD plasmid with the pBAD promoter (or on pLAT with a pBAD promoter), and the pBAD promoter is induced by arabinose.
KP Today we were trained in Cholera handling safety and we made our plans and goals for a summer full of success.
CHFirst day of new semester. Our First assignment is due Friday which is a detailed plan for the semester. Need to think about the web page and register for the team.

BioNetGen
The software we primarily modelled with, BioNetGen, is very intuitive to work with and very powerful. However prior to this year it has only been used by one other iGEM team . Therefore we gave a workshop on using BioNetGen to the other UK iGEM teams, which inspired another team to use the software. We also recorded an introductory video for modelling in BioNetGen using the Graphical User Interface - Rulebender , which can be found below. This video was also for a collaboration with the Manchester iGEM team for their introduction to modelling project.
BioNetGen is an example of rule based modelling (the only other commonly used example being Kappa ). In this we state a series of 'reaction rules' which specify what reactions can occur and at what rates. The same model can be simulated in two different modes (deterministically (using differential equations) or stochastically (using the Gillespie algorithm). Molecules are given 'domains' that represent binding sites to other domains, allowing the formation of complexes. A domain can also represent a site that can exist in multiple states, for example a site which can be phosphorylated and dephosphorylated. These features are unique to rule based modelling, and reduce the number of reactions that need to be written without sacrificing complexity. Furthermore we do not need to write any differential equations on the propensity functions for the Gillespie algorithm. Our reaction rules with rates are automatically converted by BioNetGen.

Une fois ses connaissances sur la bactérie suffisantes, il a validé théoriquement le concept en démontrant par la littérature scientifique que Mycobacterium remplirait parfaitement son rôle.
Dans l’optique d’une validation technique, il a élaboré une étude de suivi de cette dernière dans un organisme murin. Pour ce faire, il a su se rapprocher des spécialistes de Mycobacterium, et a fait des analogies avec diverses études menées In Vivo. Par la suite, il a pratiqué l’étude designée en laboratoire.
Enfin, pour la partie modélisation , Timothée KIRKHUS, étudiant en 4ème année spécialisé en Production en biotechnologie, a modélisé les effets de notre traitement sur une tumeur pulmonaire, afin de déterminer les cinétiques d'injection des différents systèmes du DVS.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html," purposely turned into an ethical debate, where viewpoints of ethical conduct were exchanged and discussed. After the presentations and discussions on metaethics, it was time for the wiki workshop.
The SDU-Denmark iGEM teams have won the Best Wiki prize several times in the past. As such, we wanted to share the knowledge gained from our university's experience. To facilitate this exchange of knowledge on wiki development, we recruited our current supervisor Thøger Jensen Krogh, to facilitate presentations on how to design a good wiki page. Thøger was qualified for this task through his role as the designer of the SDU iGEM 2013 and 2014 team wikis, both of which won the special prize on both occasions. During the presentation, Thøger had arranged several exercises where the attendees got to mingle, discuss and evaluate their wikis. This resulted in a steady flow of information and constructive feedback between all three teams.
After a long day of learning and discussing, we went for a tour around campus under the summer sun. This concluded in a visit to the roof terrace of the campus dormitory, followed by dinner. It was requested, by our fellow Danish teams, to make the SDU meetup an iGEM tradition.
Attending Meetups
Besides hosting our own meetup, we also attended several meetups during our iGEM experience. The first of which, was the 5th Annual Biobrick Workshop in March, hosted by the Technical University of Denmark, DTU-Denmark. This meetup not only gave us our first experience with Biobricks, but also worked as a foundation for friendships across different teams.
Our second meetup, the Nordic iGEM Conference was hosted by the University of Copenhagen, UCopenhagen, and took place in June. The main focus of this meetup was the traditional mini Jamboree. Participating in this  meetup gave us useful feedback from both the judges as well as from our fellow iGEM teams. This helped us greatly to shape and develop our project for the better.
To celebrate the beginning of our iGEM summer, we went on a road trip to attend the European Meetup, hosted by the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Here we discussed ideas regarding our project at a poster session, and learned about all the other great iGEM projects. We also made new friends from all over Europe.
Further Collaboration
In regard to our project, we have been in contact with the iGEM teams from Bielefeld and Imperial College, who helped us by sending crucial parts, relevant to the execution of our project"
Aachen,2017,Team:Aachen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"acellular concentration can lead to toxic effects because sodium ions can disturb the correct       function of specific cellular pathways [9]. The most important transporters forming this system are shown in Figure 4.
Fig.4: ENA1 and NHA1 form the native efflux system responsible for the extrusion       of sodium from the cytosol. NHX1 and GEF1 lead to sequestration of sodium and chloride in the prevacuolar compartments confering salt tolerance while also reducing toxic effects of sodium       in the cytosol.
When there is an increased concentration of sodium chloride in the environment, S. cerevisiae reacts essentially in two ways to the entrance       of sodium (and chloride) into the cytosol:
1. An efflux system consisting of two proteins encoded by the ENA1 and NHA1 genes transports sodium back into the extracellular space [15–18]:
Because the natural abundance of sodium ions in the environment is higher than the relatively low intracellular concentration, most eukaryotic organisms developed mechanisms to remove       sodium ions from the cytosol. Especially at high external sodium concentrations, Saccharomyces cerevisiae relies on the ability to extrude the cation from the cytosol to maintain a low       intracellular concentration. To achieve this, yeast developed two extrusion mechanisms.
The H+/Na+ antiporter, encoded by the Nha1 gene, can extrude Na+, Li+ and K+ using the proton gradient across the plasma membrane. However, the primary pathway for the extrusion of sodium ions       is the plasma membrane P-type Na+ -ATPase encoded by Ena1 (for exnus natru) [17,18]. The ENA1 ATPase couples the hydrolysis of ATP to the transport of cations against the electrochemical       gradients out of the cell [19]. This is because in yeast, the ENA1 gene plays an important role in salt tolerance. It encodes the most important protein for the extrusion of Na+ and Li+       out of the cell under saline stress conditions [20,18]. In response to saline or alkaline pH stress, the expression of ENA1 increases significantly, amongst other things, through the       activation of calcineurin [21–23,17].
Fig.5: The two proteins responsible for the efflux of sodium as a      stress response are highlighted in pink. ENA1 is a primary active sodium ATPase while NHA1 is a secondary active antiporter relying on the proton gradient over the plasma membrane

Rosettagami A strain used to synthesize many folded proteins which cannot be right folded by a WT strain.
DH5α Typical WT strain used for molecular biology steps like cloning vectors and amplifying plasmids. This strain methylates its DNA.
JM110 WT strain which doesn’t methylate its DNA, it is used mainly to obtain plasmids for digestion reactions.
All strains were cultured in LB medium
After we amplified our cultures, we were able to make competent cells with CaCl2 and we tried to transform EnvZ-/- and DH5α with our main reporter gene, RFP under OmpR promoter, but got only a single colony in DH5α strain, so we are going to make competent cells again.
Weeks 5 and 6 (June 29th - July 10th)
We followed DH5α, EnvZ-/-, SHuffle and Rosettagami’s growing rates by measuring absorbance at 600nm. They were cultured in complete LB medium.
We made competent cells again with CaCl2 and were able to transform a constitutive GFP and YFP to confirm that our cells were competent. After this confirmation, we transformed our reporter RFP from part BBa_M30011 in DH5α and EnvZ-/- strains.
Weeks 7 and 8 (July 13th - July 24th)
We prepared the solutions needed for a homemade Miniprep and got much more BBa_M30011 plasmid, so we transformed more EnvZ-/- strain with it and amplified both DH5α and EnvZ-/- cultures containing the reporter gene; we kept amplifying cultures with constitutive GFP and YFP in order to use those plasmids to test other techniques.
We measured the LB medium’s osmolarity, since it is important for our project to control it; our LB medium’s osmolarity was 420 mOsm/L so we are going to dilute it to reach an osmolarity of 300mOsm/L, which is the osmolarity of intersticial fluid.  We planned the curve we are going to measure in an ELISA plate in order to see how this reporter gene (“OmpR controlled mRFP”) behaves in different conditions of glucose concentration and medium osmolarity.

Procedure
For 10 μl lysate reaction with linear DNA templates:
Configure the platereader program and start preheating the machine to 29°C. Usually, the platereader measure all the wells for 6 hours.
Prepare mastermix. For one reaction:
2.5 μl energy solution
2.5 μl lysate
2.5 μl buffer A
0.3 μl gamS
1.7 μl $H_2O$
Prepare a mixture of everything minus the DNA — if 10 reactions will be running, prepare a mixture that would give enough for 10.5 reactions to account for some pipetting errors (if different volumes/concentrations of DNA are added to each reaction then prepare a mixture of everything minus the DNA and the water).
Notes:
For different final concentrations of DNA, calculate new volume to be added and compensate by adding more or less $H_2O$ to make the final reaction volume equal to 10 μl
For reactions with plasmid DNA rather than linear templates, exclude the gamS and compensate with $H_2O$
In order to have cheaper experiment, instead of using gamS protein, use Top10-gamS cells lysate (Top10 cells transformed with gamS gene)

They decided to run a campaign called 65     roses, of which people being photographed holding a rose in order     to raise awareness among the general public and raise money for     those great foundations, just like with the ALS ice bucket     challenge.
This campaign is worldwide. It is supporting the story of a girl     diagnosed with CF, who thought for the first time she heard about     the diagnosis that she has 65 roses .     Therefore we grew a rose for her in our lab.

Our Survey
Nowadays, digital espionage is becoming a problem. Its main goal     is to steal information of private parties and use it in an illegal     way. Our project consists of the development of a system to store     encrypted information in bacteria. In addition, the information     will be secured with several biological layers that make it     digitally uncrackable. We would really like to know how society     sees our problem, therefore we made a survey. This survey contains     questions like; “Would you send an important highly-secret letter     to someone you trust by post or email?“, „Would you trust bacteria     to store your highly-secret information?“. More about this survey?     See this link .
This survey was sent to most of the participating iGEM Teams.     The teams who participated are: University of Westminster iGEM     2016, Paris-Saclay iGEM 2016, UPO-Sevilla iGEM 2016, Paris     Bettencourt iGEM 2016, iGEM Pasteur 2016, iGEM Sheffield 2016, iGEM     Leiden 2016 and TU Delft iGEM 2016.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Model#Lattice Model_-_-_TEXT.html," after 50 000 iterations.
Figure 8: Two states of a simulation with exclusively favourable protein interactions. To the left, the initial state of the simulation is shown immediately after it is generated, to the right, the environment is shown after 50 000 iterations. Clusters of TDPs can be recognized, confirming the hypothesized protein-protein interactions.
Preservation of Cas13a activity by different types of TDPs
To determine which TDP preserves Cas13a activity upon drying best, we investigated the behaviour of CAHS 94205, CAHS 106094, SAHS 330 20 and SAHS 68234 with Cas13a at a concentration of 1 g/L and a volume fraction of 0.1, since Boothby et al. 2017 showed that LDH activity was already well preserved at a TDP concentration of ~ 1 g/L. The simulations were run over 300000 iterations. One of these simulations (SAHS 33020, 1 g/L, volume fraction 0.1) is shown in Figure 9.
Figure 9: Simulation of Cas13a with SAHS 33020 at a concentration of 1 g/L and in a volume fraction of 0.1.
Both the migration of proteins towards Cas13a and formation of protein clusters is visible. However, protein clusters that form further away from Cas13a tend to remain in place and attract other chains. This is also visible in Figure 10, which plots the number of SAHS 33020 proteins at different distances from Cas13a over the number of iterations. During the simulation the area close to Cas13a clearly attracts other proteins as visible in the lower bottom part of the figure. However, while there is a general movement towards Cas13a, tend to stay in clusters for an extended amount of time, as is for example visible at around 150000 iterations. To observe migration of more TDPs towards Cas13a, the simulation would have to be run for a longer amount of time.
Figure 10: Number of SAHS 33020 proteins at different distances from Cas13a over 300000 iterations. Data was extracted from a Simulation of Cas13a with SAHS 33020 at a concentration of 1 g/L and in a volume fraction of 0.1.
To determine which TDP would preserve Cas13a activity best, we analyzed two parameters: the coverage of Cas13a during the lattice model simulation (see Figure 11) and the development of the energy over time (see Figure 12).

Overall project
We are developing biological fluorescent lights that operate in emergency situations, for example exit lighting in cinemas. We will use a fun application of the technology to “sell” our project at the Jamboree by producing multi-coloured biological Christmas lights for use on a tree or around the house or garden. Our project is innovative as these biological lights will operate in an ethical, environmentally friendly, safe and non-toxic manner, thereby addressing the major concerns society has raised in relation to synthetic biology.

UiOslo_Norway,2014,Team:UiOslo Norway#Safety#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,"  Biocomputing, being another application that can have implications on how we think about machines. Since the emergence of synthetic biology the line that separated livings things from machines have gotten much more burred.
For waste degradation applications it means that MicrOrganizer needs to be either used in a controlled space where risks for scattering are limited or it needs to be released into the locations that are polluted were the risks are great as a bioremedial.  For the latter the threat of such a problem can eliminate by creating a death mechanism in the system that hinders spread outside the polluted area. A death mechanism in itself can be of discussion. Living biomaterials as an application will also be capable of encountering the same types of problems.
Conversely, at the current moment there are not many ethical questions about our project by itself that needs to be deliberated at it is at a proof of principle stage. There is still a need to view the general concerns when it comes to “playing with living organisms”.
Through communication, and dialogues, one may be able to reduce the doubts and fears that comes with statements GMOs and by extension synthetic biology.
Hence it is important that the public knows that there are restrictions on what type of research can be conducted and specific permissions are need to conduct research within different levels (for microorganism there are four different levels ) from the authorities.

INTERLAB
Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD?
METHODS OVERVIEW
The measurements were done in a plate reader. Because the 96 well format of the plate reader is convenient for multiple measurements, the methods are written from the perspective of 96 well format. The 96 well plates were clear bottomed plates. All plate reading was done using a Molecular Devices Spectramax i3x. This device has variable temperature settings, pathlength correction and can measure both absorbance and fluorescence. All GFP measurements were taken at wavelengths of 532/25 for emission and 485/20 for excitation. We did not perform the optional flow cytometry experiment as our flow cytometer is difficult to use, requiring the efforts of a trained technician, making it impractical for its use in this study.
For complete methods click here.
Calibration
Measured a standard curve for fluorescein to allow this data to be standardized with the data from other iGEM labs. Fluorescein displays similar excitation and emission as GFP and could also be read by the plate reader. This allowed for measurements of GFP fluorescing cells to to be transformed into similar fluorescein readings.
Followed a LUDOX protocol to serve as a reference point that functioned as a conversion factor. This conversion factor allowed for the absorbance values taken at 600 nm to be converted into OD600 measurements.
A plate was prepared with silica microspheres and read by the plate reader at 600 nm. These microspheres have similar functional characteristics to cells that allows for the absorbance measurements to accurately estimate cell counts. Our measurements for this step can be considered flawed as we neglected to perform the initial dilution of the samples before preparing the plate. As well, this sample was not recorded at the correct wavelength. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the error, and the limited quantity of the reagent, we depleted our supply and could not redo the experiment.
Cell Measurement Protocol
Day 1
Transformation of Colonies
The making of competent cells and transformation protocol were obtained from the iGEM protocol archive. Plasmids were resuspended in 10uL of ddH2"
Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"dbisd:P450bisd which subsequently was fused to an S-layer gene. Moreover we could show that the constructed fusion protein FNR:Fdbisd:P450bisd is degrading BPA intracellular. We have already shown that the Fdbisd:P450bisd fusion protein is degrading BPA more effective in E. coli than the polycistronic bisdAB gene ( data here ).
NAD+ detection
Our selected NAD+ detection method displays a molecular beacon based approach. These have been initially described in 1996 as nucleic acid probes that fluoresce upon hybridization ( Tyagi et al., 1996 ). For this effect the ends of a single-stranded DNA molecule are labeled with a fluorophore as well as with an appropriate quencher. Both are in close proximity to each other due to a formed stem-loop, so that the detection of any fluorescence signal is prevented.
The molecular beacon’s closed state can be applied to a bioassay detecting NAD+ even in very low concentrations ( Tang et al., 2011 ). Using two complementary targets hybridizing side-by-side with the hairpin enables NAD+-dependent DNA ligation by E. coli DNA ligase (figure 2). Only after closing the gap between both hybridized targets the stem melts and the secondary structure gets broken down to a linearized probe-target hybrid. The immediate consequence is a disruption of the close proximity of the fluorophore and the quencher, so that an excitation with light is converted into a visible fluorescence signal. Hence, NAD+ concentration determines DNA ligase activity, which is responsible for the formation of the molecular beacon’s open state and therefore directly correlates with the emerging fluorescence signal. Additionally, the highly selective NAD+ bioassay has a low limit of detection (0,3 nM) compared to other methods.
Figure 2: Principle of the NAD+ bioassay using molecular beacons and NAD+-dependent DNA ligase from E. coli (taken from Tang et al., 2011 ).
Because of the signal’s stability and the suitability for daily use the NAD+ bioassay can be coupled to NADH-dependent BPA degradation in the context of biosensing. See the results of our NAD+ degration here .

Motivation
I joined our team to experience how to manage a scientific project from the very beginning and to the end, to improve my team working skills as well as to work with some crazy science. Of course being shielded from the burning sun by spending most of my waking hours in front of a lab bench during the summer also kept me working on the project.
Major contributions
Coordination of the fundraising and sponsorships as well as maintaining a sterile environment in the lab.
How do you prefer spinach?
Try frozen spinach on a pizza with onion, bacon, goat cheese and a lot of garlic - that is delicious.

Motivation
My great interest in synthetic biology is one of the main reasons why I’m participating in iGEM. The great thing about synthetic biology is that we are not only examining and observing nature, but applying it in new contexts. This together with the the fact that it is a field experiencing rapid development and has a huge future potential.  iGEM is a unique opportunity for me to be a part of an ambitious team and to develop a project from absolute scratch to final jamboree. It is amazing how different iGEM projects are and I’m looking forward to seeing this year's contributions.
Major contributions
First of all movie star, but maybe more importantly responsible for preventing the autoclave from exploding.
How do you prefer spinach?
Spinach is a great color supplement to traditional Danish food often kept in different shades of brown.

Motivation
As a child I had a dream about studying biotechnology and being able to grow living houses from seeds. As I got older I realized that biology is much more complex than I could ever imagine. I have also always had a great interest within electronics and I like to build circuits to solve a problem. When I heard about iGEM, I immediately know that this was a fusion between two of my greatest interests. In a far future I hope that biological components are so well described that we will be able to program a cell to perform complex functions like growing a wooden living treehouse.
Major contributions
Making sure the DFHBI is stored properly and lighting up the bunsen burner.
How do you prefer spinach?
I prefer my Spinach fluorescent in the lab, bound to DFHBI forming a fluorophore.

Tuebingen,2014,Team:Tuebingen#Activities#SchoolProject_-_-_TEXT.html," introduction to our iGEM project and the achievements in synthetic biology that made it possible. Furthermore, we talked about the implications of genetically modified corn, and the techniques by which we tested our own corn samples for the existence of GM-corn.
Afterwards, the practical part began with a DNA extraction from food samples brought by the pupils (popcorn, polenta, cornmeal, etc.). The extracted DNA was then used for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in order to amplify the cry1A(b)-gene as well as a corn specific invertase gene that helps to determine if the corn genome has actually been extracted from the samples. The PCR products were finally separated via agarose gel electrophoresis.
Another approach to show the pupils basic methods of gene technology, was a restriction digest of a plasmid that was unknown. By digesting it and separating the fragments via gel electrophoresis, they were able to identify which one out of five plasmids was provided to them.
This little quiz, and the test on the cry1A(b)-gene were well received by the pupils as they could figure out what it is like to analyze their own results and draw conclusions from that. They performed positive and negative controls, as well as a control with the invertase gene, so that in the end we could discuss together what might have gone wrong and what can be said about the corn samples. Additionally, they were excited to perform the methods like PCR and gel electrophoresis, because such experiments are usually not carried out in school. E. g. the filling of an agarose gel was very fascinating for them and led to a lot of questions concerning the theoretical background.
All in all, we hope that the pupils enjoyed this excursion to the field of synthetic biology and got a profound first impression, so that they are able to form a well-founded opinion about gene technologies.

Cambridge-JIC,2014,Team:Cambridge-JIC#ExecSummary_-_-_TEXT.html,", as well as to address their concerns on genetic modification. We hosted students from the St. Paul's School collegiate iGEM team to inform them about practical aspects of iGEM, mösbi, and  wider issues in the synthetic biology community.
We realised that we have the opportunity to truly impact the future access to Marchantia and plant synthetic biology more broadly, and that future uptake depends greatly on the quality of the resources we provide. As a result, we built the only non-standard laboratory equipment for Marchantia: a portable growth facility, and provided detailed instructions for future users to build their own. We will also lead a plants workshop, in collaboration with the Norwich-NRP and Valencia teams, at the Giant Jamboree.  Collecting the expertise we gained from the Haseloff lab, we produced a comprehensive guide on Marchantia synthetic biology, which we hope will be openly added to by new users and the scientific community.
We hope that you agree that developing mösbi, the first sensor that can be grown at home and the first piece of consumer biotechnology, and truly working with all levels of the community to build a foundation for Marchantia synthetic biology are contributions in the true iGEM spirit.
We finish by expressing our sincerest thanks to our sponsors, those who donated their lab's work for us to work with, our wider support community at the Haseloff lab, the University of Cambridge and the John Innes Center. Finally, we give our personal thanks to Jim Haseloff, Bernardo Pollak, Anton Kan and Gos Micklem, whose long hours of effort with the team made for a truly wonderful iGEM experience.

Result – 2. Confirmation of DNA sequence
Figure 1. 2AGL_DT”
As shown in Figure 1 (2AGL_DT), we confirmed the construction of crr gene encoding IIA(Glc) from E. coli into Biobrick format – flanking by restriction sites of EcoRI and XbaI at the prefix, and SpeI and PstI at the suffix – followed by the sequence of double terminator (BBa_B0015). The other constructs which able to be confirmed by DNA sequencing was the parental plasmid containing crr gene only. While the rest of plasmids did not contain expected sequence.
While the final construct to be expected, namely BBa_J04450 followed by constitutive promoter/RBS/crr/double terminator was actually the sequence of BBa_J04450 only as shown in figure below. The data from forward sequence and reverse sequence (Figure 2; J04450_CP_RB_2AGL_DT REV/FWD) revealed the prefix and suffix sequences clearly.
Figure 2. J04450_CP_RB_2AGL_DT REV/FWD”
However, we can confirm the sequence of basic part in our project namely BBa_J23119 (constitutive promoter), BBa_B0034 (RBS) and BBa_B0015 (double terminator) alone. Thus for future works, we can confirm to use the plasmid for construction.

We had an awesome time and met other teams at the iGEM meet-up in Paris and Marburg
We have also been part of the newsletter of Xiamen University
Our first steps to iGEM
Made possible with the help from Bielefeld
The first time we heard about the iGEM competition was when team SpaceMoss from Copenhagen visited us at the Heinrich-Heine-University in Düsseldorf, presenting their project and iGEM to us.
From this moment on, we were infected by the idea to create the first iGEM team at our university. In October 2015, some students decided to arrange a first meeting. At this meeting 60 students came together to discuss and talk about iGEM and how we could establish a team in Düsseldorf.  It quickly became clear that we had a lot of questions which we were unable to answer ourselves, so we decided to ask team Bielefeld for help.
Soon, we had a meeting with them in their hometown. As it is the seventh time that Bielefeld is participant in the iGEM competition, they have a lot of expert knowledge.
They welcomed us with an iGEM cake and we spent a really interesting and nice afternoon together. During our meeting they gave us a detailed instruction for the Gibson- and Biobrick-Assembly and much information about Sponsoring. Thanks to team Bielefeld we had a good overview and lots of necessary information which we would have never found out without their help.
After all, we looked forward to manage our project and decided to sign up for iGEM.
Enlightening Aachen
We first met team Aachen in Marburg , where they presented their project about proteases, that can be activated via light. Proteases in laundry detergents are usually suppressed by boronic acid to avoid early activity. With Aachen’s light inducible proteases, boronic acid, which is harmful for the environment, could be avoided.
To test the optogenetic constructs Aachen was in need of a light box.  Since every team lacks time we offered our help in building a light box for Aachen. Since we had to build one for our Team as well, we could already collect some experience in the construction, to produce an even better result for Aachen.
The box contains a high-power LED emitting UV-light, which is adjustable in height and intensity. This allows the modelling of the protein-construct.

Carry this on until a suitable dilution is reached. We used the following dilutions:
O.D600 of 0.5 = x10-6 and x10-7
O.D600 of 1 = x10-6 and x10-7
O.D600 of 1.5 = x10-6 and x10-7
O.D600 of 2 = x10-6 and x10-7
O.D600 of 2.5 = x10-6 and x10-7
O.D600 of 3 = x10-7 and x10-8
6. Plate 100ul of the appropriate dilutions onto an LB agar plate containing strep (including 1 replicate)
Leave on bench to dry
Note: These dilutions were taken from imperial 08.  However, when I plated them, the agar plates were too dense.  Could be technique or perhaps more dilutions are required/ less volume to be plated.
7. Grow the plates at 37°C overnight in incubator.
Colony counting
1. The following day count the number of colonies on the plates.  Take them out of the incubator earlier so that they won't multiply and beome uncountable.
2.Multiply up the colonies counted by the dilution to obtain the colony forming units at each time point. Remember when plating the cells only 100ul of 1000ul was used to plate and so you need to multiply by a further 10.
Data manipulation
The absorbance is related to the number of colony forming units in a graph.
The equation of the straight line was used to convert all absorbance measurements to CFU/well.

Introduction
As a naturally formed immobilizing structure of bacteria, biofilm outstands in many ways such as the ability to withstand considerable degree of environmental fluctuation, the possibility for more efficient cell-cell communication as well as cooperation, and the stratified structure which may function greatly in phase-related synthetic processing. With this understanding and beyond, 2011 ZJU-China iGEM team tried to explore more about the potential of biofilm in applications.
Cellulose utilization for renewable bio-material production (especially bio-fuel production) has been a heated research interest for quite a long time. Due to the structural complexity and poor permeability of cellulose, a big obstacle for enzymatic break-down process, progress in promoting the utilization efficiency is slow.
Considering this problem with the advantage of biofilm as a reactor system, we believe the employment of biofilm and its stratified feature would help to surmount such obstacle.
Firstly, Sugarfilm, a three-layer biofilm-based expression system, is designed to directly attach to the surface of substrate (for instance, a sheet of cellulose debris). In this way, the distance between our “degradation engine” (E.coli cells) and the targeted substrate would be reduced greatly, laying the foundation of a more efficient system.
Two main cellulases involved in the first step of degradation, Cex (Cellulomonas fimi exoglucanase, BBa_K118022 , iGEM08_Edinburgh) together with CenA (Cellulomonas fimi endoglucanase A, BBa_K118023 , iGEM08_Edinburgh) will be expressed in the bottom layer of biofilm (as described in the “Design” part below in detail). Therefore, the secreted enzymes would get in touch with the substrate instantly.
In the next step, the preliminary products cellub"

Scientists
iGEM instructors
First of all, we warmly thank our amazing instructor: Gilles Truan. He was with us from the beginning to the end and even more! He is the master of cloning. He is the captain of PCR. Moreover, he knows how to grill sausages better than anyone! We kindly thank all the other instructors that helped us when we were lost with the scientific part or stressed by the lack of money. We especially thank Brice Enjalbert, Florence Bordes, Kaymeuang Cam, Magali Remaud-Siméon, Philippe Soucaille, Stéphane Guillouet, Isabelle Meynial-Salles and Alain Marty. Your advice and encouragements were very precious to us, and you deserve these thanks for all the energy you spent answering our questions (and we know that we are very energy-consuming!). To finish, a special thanks to Claude Maranges, who helped us a lot with the sponsoring aspect and all the administrative problems that we encountered. Indeed, if you have any administrative issue, he is able to solve it in less than 2 minutes (5 minutes during the holidays)! He knows how to make everything smooth in record time.
Bacillus subtilis specialists
Even if Bacillus subtilis is a gram-positive bacterium model, none of our instructors ever worked with it. It is why we asked other people's help when we had questions about B. subtilis. We would like to thank Nathalie Campo for her advice about B. subtilis culture, her encouragements and her kindness. Her friend Thierry Doan helped us too: he brilliantly answered our questions about B. subtilis. We also thank Sarah Guiziou, iGEMer of the 2013 Toulouse team, for her advice and her protocols.
Fungi specialists
We are grateful to Christophe Roux who gave us two non-pathogenic strains of fungi: Aspergillus brasiliensis, Trichoderma reesei, Aspergillus nidulans and Chaetomium globusum. We used them to test our SubtiTree system.

UFMG_Brazil,2014,Team:UFMG Brazil#Project#Policy_-_-_TEXT.html," wanted to count on the latin teams that had previously participated on iGEM. However, we got very few answers from them.
This indicates a lack of communication among students and scientists in Latin America. We live in similar conditions and face similar problems to do Science and  to participate on iGEM. If we interacted more, we could help and support each other more to overcome the difficulties found on the way.
Aiming to approximate latin teams, we created iGEM Latin America fan-page on facebook (fig 22).
In addition , we are also launching a campaign to form the Latin Network on iGEM (Fig 23). During the Giant Jamboree, we are planning to get toghether with our Latin pairs and share with them our ideas!
With all of these actions, we hope to improve Latin participation on iGEM and we are not afraid to dream that we can also make a difference for Science as a whole in our country!

Usage and Biology
In 2012, the iGEM team of Penn, University of Pennsylvania, created a generalized BioBrick surface display platform: the Ice Nucleation Protein N-, C-termini only (INPNC), BioBrick part: BBa_K811005 .
INPNC is a truncated Ice Nucleation Protein (INP, a protein which causes ice nucleation and formation but which is also used for its surface display properties). However, INP consists of a C-terminal region that is positioned on the outer membrane, as well as a central 8, 16 or 48 amino acid motif that is responsible for INP’s ice nucleation properties. These central amino acids motifs are not essential for INP’s surface displaying properties. Therefore INP was truncated, retaining only the N- (179 aa) and C-termini (49"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of"

Background
The Cancer Stem Cell Theory
Since the development of the cancer stem cell theory, scientists and media have been buzzing with excitement over what they claim could be a breakthrough in the way we view cancer. The cancer stem cell theory says that only a small group of cells in cancers (called cancer stem cells) possess stem cell like characteristics (like the ability to differentiate) and have the ability to form new tumors.  This theory has since been experimentally proved; and has shown that these cancer stem cells produce elevated levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase; an enzyme involved in the normal oxidative metabolism of alcohol in the body.
These cancer stem cells have also been implicated in recurrence; current therapies don’t eliminate them and since they are the cells with the tumor-regenerating abilities, they are able to form new tumors and cause recurrence.
Our Project
Our project therefore aims to make biological constructs that would identify these cancer stem cells based on their aldehyde dehydrogenase producing capability and eliminate them as well. To do this, we identified the sequence for four isoforms of the mammalian aldehyde dehydrogenase and created biobricks out of them.
The second part of our project was to create constructs to selectively isolate them. To do this, we chose to use the Plug and Play system of assembly created by DTU-Denmark for the 2011 iGEM competition and then make our biobricks RFC-21 compatible according to the guidelines for iGEM submission. To achieve this plug and play system, we contacted DTU and had them send us some of the parts they had made last year, as they were not available in the Parts Registry.
Mammalian Expression
Because cancer is a human disease, we decided to test our constructs in mammalian cells. One challenge we had was finding parts for mammalian expression. For this reason, we contacted the Serrano labs and had them send us their entire eukaryotic promoter database.

Biology
Constructs 14 and 15 are digested by Nco1 (cut into rpoSLS) and Ara1 (cut into fhaLS) in order to check for the presence of leader sequences. Negative results.
New PCR of rsmA, ligation in pTOPO and transformation. Screen of many colonies by PCR and mini prep. Test of different minipreping methods. The primers used for the screen are the same ones as the ones initially used to produce the amplicon. Incoherent results are given by the two methods. We deduce that the use of same primer set for amplify a sequence is not reliable for screening this same sequence on a clone in this case. Indeed, it is very likely to gives false positives.
Biology
According to the results from the sequencing order will have to start over constructions since the 1st-steps. A Purification step will be add for all 1st-step construction in order to  get round our resistance issues.

To perform this constructions, we used standard protocol: we kept the plasmid of the shortest biobrick which we inserted the longest biobrick.

So, even wrong constructions were selected on Petri"
Judd_UK,2017,Team:Judd UK#Pages#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," been out of the field for some time, I was amazed at the biotech content of the higher level courses. By nature, my interest is in ethology and conservation but the speed at which this field was developing fascinated me. I lead a DNA technology project in 2015 which won the Rolls-Royce Science Prize that year and this paved the way to iGEM. In further preparation for this, i am a regular attendee at SynBioBeta London and judged at the last iGEM jamboree in Boston. The UK schools are grossly under-represented at iGEM and I wanted to help change this; to help bring synthetic biology into the focus of the very bright students that I teach.

I graduated from the University of Buenos Aires with a degree in Biology specialising in Molecular and Cellular Biology and then completed a doctoral degree on the role of transcription factors in embryonic development and cancer formation in the Biology Department at MIT. During my time at MIT, I had the opportunity to teach undergraduates and thoroughly enjoyed it so after a short postdoctoral fellowship in the UK, in 2007 I decided to retrain as a secondary school Biology teacher. Since the start of my teaching career, I have wanted to put my training in DNA technology to the benefit of my students’ education and have strived to incorporate as much practical work as possible in this often underrepresented area in the school curriculum. After securing the appropriate equipment and introducing a number of key techniques for our students, I have been part of our winning participation in the Rolls Royce Science Prize in 2015 with a project on the advancements of DNA technology and now with the first UK state school to enter iGEM. I have enjoyed working with a group of talented students as they tackle scientific concepts at the forefront of scientific achievement."

NRP-UEA-Norwich,2012,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#NOSensing_-_-_TEXT.html," the mammalian-bacterial promoter ligated to eCFP at a 20mM concentration the intensity of fluorescence sharply decreases.
Figure 15.A graph comparing the intensity of RFP fluorescence at different wavelengths ranging at 610 nm where the samples were excited at 560 nm. The samples of E. coli were transformed by the B-M + RFP BioBrick and grown overnight in different concentrations of potassium nitrate (0 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 15 mM and 20 mM) before being lysed in order to release proteins from the cells for fluorometer analysis.
As previously stated, we were initially unsure of the effect that the orientation of the bacterial (pYEAR) and the mammalian (CaRG) genes would have in gene expression, therefore we synthesised two hybrid promoters in the orientation bacterial-mammalian and mammalian-bacterial. The graph above compares the intensity of fluorescence of the two hybrid promoters (BBa_K774007 and BBa_K774005)  ligated to RFP. There appears to be no pattern if the difference between the intensities of these two promoters; however both promoters do show a decrease in intensity at 20mM potassium nitrate and decrease from a maximum intensity of 82a.u. (bacterial-mammalian) and 66a.u. to approximately 36a.u.
Flow Cytometry
Three tubes of media were inoculated with E. coli transformed by the B-M + RFP or M-B + eCFP BioBrick. Each tube then had potassium nitrate added to it at different concentrations; 0 mM, 1 mM and 10 mM respectively. The E. coli were grown over night and then spun down, fixed in 4% PFA and re-suspened in 500ul PBS. The samples were then analysed in an Acuri C6 or BD Aria II flow cytometer.

To see this part on the iGEM Parts catalogue please click here .
Sequences for this part are also available in SnapGene (.dna file) , FASTA (.fa file) , GenBank Standard (.gb file) and Plain Text (.txt file) file format.
Aim
Our aim was to create a controllable Integrase producing plasmid as a submission part. From the submission plasmid the controllable Integrase Part could then be ligated into a convenient low-copy plasmid to help reduce the potential toxicity of Integrase to the cell.
Approach
The 2010 Paris Bettencourt team had developed a controllable Integrase part for use a population counter in their project. We contacted them to see if we could source the part from them but it was unfortunately not possible. We set about creating the BioBrick using the araC-pBAD from the well characterized part K731201 and ordering the IntI1 as a gBlock. The araC-pBAD system in pSB1C3 had previously been prepared by Honours student Sam Ross (called the SamR construct). Our next steps were the design of the gBlock and integration of the IntI1 gBlock into the SamR construct.

The code for the sequence for the IntI1 gene was sourced from pUS2056 but is highly conserved so this choice was out of convenience as the sequence was locally available. It was modified by Tom Geddes, Rokiah Alford and our supervisor Dr Nicholas Coleman to:
Include a Sac1 restriction enzyme site at the beginning before the Inti1 gene so it could be excised independently of the promoter if needed
Include a different ribosome binding site
Include Gibson"

Monsanto’s industrial seed chipper
Roots from plants whose seeds were treated with external coating
Our team was given the opportunity to visit and tour Monsanto’s plant sciences facilities on June 21st to learn more about their work and products. We were able to gain a glimpse of how Monsanto’s research combines agricultural research and development with technological advancements to help farmers achieve higher and sustainable crop yields. Learning about their satellite monitoring systems for gaining soil and weather data inspired us to explore a model that allows for large-scale data and analysis. We learned that a significant portion of Monsanto’s seeds are not only genetically modified, but have external improvements such as chipping or coating. The seed chipping facility slightly chips seeds before planting to allow easier gemination of the seed embryos and some seeds contain external coatings with extra nutrients to supplement the crops during growth.
We also gained a glimpse of some of their research methods through visiting their genetic modification center, greenhouses, growth chambers, and 3D printing warehouse. One of Monsanto’s synthetic biologists walked us through a step-by-step process of the work they do to genetically modify an organism beginning with the embryonic stage. The greenhouses and growth chambers were all highly regulated in every aspect including temperature, humidity, plant watering level, and sunlight and fine-tuned to the needs of each type of plant they were growing. Their 3D printing facility was used to create custom-made casings for their crops and specialized"

Electrophoresis
Introduction:
Gel electrophoresis is a method to visualize DNA in a cell.
Materials:
Agarose
Midori Green Dye
DNA Ladder
Coomassie Blue Stain
Procedure:
Make Gels
Mix 0.1g Agarose : 10mL 1x TAE
Microwave for 45s-1min. Continue adding 15-25s increments until the agarose mixture begins boiling. As soon as it begins boiling, take it out.
Mix 1uL DNA Stain : 10mL 1x TAE. Add to still hot agarose mixture
Pour into molds
Wait ~20 min to solidify
When taking out gels, first use razor blade/spatula to disconnect air seal between rubber stoppers and gel to prevent the gel coming apart.
Loading Gels
Take rubber stoppers off of the gel molds
Take the well molds out
Place the mold into the electrophoresis machine that is filled with 0.5x TAE (100 mL)
Be sure to have the wells on the negative end of the machine (the black end)
Draw out a diagram of your well (which samples are going in which lanes - it is helpful to put the ladder, positive, and negative controls directly next to each other and then load samples to the right of them)
On a thin strip of parafilm, place 2 uL of loading dye
Place 5 uL of DNA from PCR onto each spot of dye, add 5 L of water as well, immediately mix and then place into well

EPF-Lausanne,2008,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," by using microfluidic devices in order to culture the cells in an ordered and controllable manner. Furthermore, this will also permit to have control on the information flux dynamics between the cells.
In other words, we want to implement an in-vivo self organizing system. The cell population is self-organized in the sense that, unlike other experimental setups, no artificial gradient nor sender cells are required to generate a pattern. In these other situations, the cells are placed in different conditions at the initial stages of the experiment.
In our idealized case,  if a perturbation is applied to a subpart of the population, the same pattern can be generated regardless of what subpart of the cell population was actually subjected to this perturbation. Now the microfluidics-based control on the information flux across the population is not in essence contradictory to the ""self organized"" nature desired for our system, considering that the use of this control will only depend on the state of the cells. In other words, control on the signaling is equivalent to choosing a cell-cell communication protocol.
Our devices are custom-made for the project, fabricated using PDMS and multilayer soft lithography (MSL).   We designed an array of miniature chambers to culture cells. The chambers are linked to one another with a network of ducts enabling us to culture sub-populations of our cells in contact with each other. Depending on the chamber connectivity and the genetic rule-set used, we expect complex patterns of GFP/RFP expression to form (see patterns below).
The aim is to initiate a signal on one side of the channel and observe the propagation along the plate.
   
Our microfluidic devices are also used in a side-project in order to characterize the binding site specificity and affinity of quorum sensing-related transcription factors (the MITOMI devices).
Biomedical application
Our system could be further developed to function as a diagnostics device detecting disease-related biomarkers in bodily fluids. Each first column chip well would contain specialized bacterial cells engineered to detect specific biomarkers, allowing the simultaneous sampling of hundreds to even thousands of patient samples. Depending on which samples contain the biomarker of interest, a specific pattern would be generated. Using our algorithm, we would have a priori defined all possible patterns generated by all potential combinations of positive wells. Simple scanning and analysis of the pattern by a computer would then automatically identify which wells are positive, providing a cost-effective and high-throughput mechanism to analyze patient samples.
Initiation of the project
Our goal was to produce a system as simple as possible giving patterns as complex as possible.  We therefore decided to use only two quorum sensing"

CGU_Taiwan,2017,Team:CGU Taiwan#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," (2002), the project focus on three different kinds of deinking enzyme, such as glucanase, xylanase, and lipase. Glucanase and xylanase belong to cellulase and hemi-cellulase. In the deinking process, glucanase and xylanase bind with cellulose which is the main composition of paper fiber, while lipase bind with ink, so that the ink is able to be removed from paper fiber.
Different kinds of organisms produce same types of enzymes. To complete this project, we have to choose out the most suitable enzymes those are best fit to our need. To do so, computer simulation is the most effective and accurate way by testing for the binding affinity of enzymes and their ligand. Besides, we set up a hypothesis that the protein which produced by eukaryotic cells will perform better than the protein which produced by prokaryotic cells, because the protein post-translational modification has performed in the translation process of eukaryotic cells, so we think that the eukaryotic proteins are having higher binding affinity with their ligand, and we want to verify our hypothesis. Our selected protein came from protein docking, which test the binding affinity of enzymes to substrate. Discovery studio and AutoDuck was used for testing the energy of binging. In brief, we firstly use an original amino acid sequence of an enzyme as a template to find out the other proteins those have high similarity on their amino acid sequence from protein data bank, and then simulate the docking between proteins and their ligand by using protein docking software. Finally, the protein docking software will help to calculate the binding affinity of each protein, so that we can choose out the enzyme which is the most effective in performing deinking, and also increase the possibility of success of this project.
We had chosen the best enzymes that we could find to try to give a great performance of surface deinking. In our initiate test of deinking, we found that the enzyme secreted from our cloned yeast shows deinking effect in our built up paper making protocols. As summary, we wished to clone a yeast strain which could be activated by light and induces deinking enzyme secretion.
Cost, Efficiency and Future Work
Comparing to current method, our developing method costs high and has a relative low efficiency. However, the potential of preserving such big amount of paper fiber gives us the reason of developing it. In future world, natural resources would be restricted and cannot be made into new products. That is, reusing resources is a goal of technology development. To deal with cost and efficiency issues, we had"

We choose to approximate the citizen science group by examining the DIYBio network. As of October 2013, there are 42 groups DIYBio groups declared worldwide and 3353 members on DIYbio Google group mailing list. Disposable income for biotechnology pursuits vary, and we approximate expenditure between £500 and £1000, therefore we used £750 to estimate the DIYBio budget, placing it at 2.25 million. At present, only the UK market is accessible to us, which is approximately 0.67 million pounds.
Initially we predict to sell our products to secondary schools and citizen science early adopters. In the mid-term we want to increase our sales to the citizen science market, which we expect to become our main market in the long-term future. Currently citizen science in biotechnology is still a very niche field. However, as stated our aim is to increase biotechnology visibility in society and create a personal synthetic biology market.
Competitor Analysis
Market reaction
We considered 3 different groups that could be possible affected by our product's entry into market: DIY Biology companies, Global Biotechnology companies and Specialised companies. For each, we choose one example and evaluated the impact of our product.
DIY Biology Companies
Example: IO rodeo Most likely group to be affected initially by the Darwin Toolbox entry into the market, and also the most important group with regards supporting and growing our target market. Like our start-up, small companies typically struggle to compete with regards resources and reach. However they may also be sources of collaboration instead of competition.
Global Biotechnology Companies
Example: Bio-rad This group is unlikely to be affected in the first couple years. As their products are currently sold in mass quantities and with restricted accessibility to individuals, they don't currently reach Darwin Toolbox's target market. They may react to youGEM's entry by making their products better towards individuals.
Specialised Companies (e.g. forensics)
Example: Sirchie Similar to global companies, this group is unlikely to be immediately affected initially as it is well established. However as this group target a niche market, they may later be challenged by Darwin Toolbox's broader scope.
Competitor Analysis
There are no direct competitors who provide an alternative to our product. Our competition is more indirect and falls into three broad categories: companies offering laboratory equipment hardware kits, laboratory equipment supply and educational biotechnology kits. We assessed our product in comparison to other companies by the following criteria, and the results can been seen in the table below.

Collaboration
Collaboration have always been an important element for scientific research in today’s world. During the summer, we truly felt that collaboration is essential for us to get things done, in a much better way. In addition, we were also glad to help other teams.
Mentoring BNDS_CHINA - a High School Team
>>> Link to BNDS_CHINA
Since that the iGEM competition only has 10 years’ history in China, new teams without experience keep coming up in recent years. As pioneers in their own schools, they more or less have to face obstacles not only on equipment, resources and funds, but also about all kinds of knowledge concerning with basic facts, lab operations, tricks in this competition and so on. Although it is the first time for us to attend iGEM as well, we still hope to devote our scanty effort to helping other teams.
So this time, we are quite glad to mentor the high school team from Beijing National Day School (BNDS). Apart from offering some necessary reagents they need, such as restriction enzymes, we also taught them some important methods for experiments such as plasmids extraction and competent cells transformation, as well as correcting several mistakes during operations in Clean Bench (Fig. 1, 2). In addition, we also helped analyze the results they got, and gave some suggestions on their cutting and ligation protocol due to those outcomes.
Fig. 1
Fig. 2
The team members from Beijing National Day School have been working very hard. Beside this competition, most of them have to undertake the heavy load of Gaokao as well. They spend all the spare time staying in laboratory and consulting us with details in experiments frequently. Hope they will do a good job in Giant Jamboree.
All in all, we all felt that collaboration is quite meaningful and useful. It encourages communication between teams which brings new teams ready-made experience and creates more chances for iGEMers to make friends and share ideas. And the activity itself gives out the message that if everyone, not matter devoted to this area or just interested in Synthetic Biology, can work together and help each other, we can make a really big deal"

Overview
With the advent of rDNA technology in the late 1970s, medicine, agriculture and several other areas underwent a quantum leap and from that point, progress only hastened, from one only one recombinant pharmaceutical  approved for human use (insulin) in 1982 to one hundred and fifty-one FDA approved protein based recombinant pharmaceuticals by 2009 [1] . Despite being in high demand (due to the fact that most recombinant products produced on an industrial scale are therapies for chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes), recombinant products are expensive due to several factors like long and expensive development time, high failure rate (~80%) of the products developed, manufacturing costs requiring expensive technologies and processes (bioreactors, column chromatography, sterile conditions, etc) and the involvement of skilled labor on both the manufacturing and the healthcare provider’s side [2] . Treatments with these pharmaceuticals can cost from around 10,000 to 100,000 € per year for a single patient[2]. As scientists and engineers, it seems obvious that our contribution can be most easily and effectively be made at the level of manufacturing costs; to try to bring"

Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#testing#project#hprac#1_-_-_TEXT.html," impaired by the lack of nutritional supplementation, and they would be quickly outcompeted by wild-type strains.
This brings to the table a second research priority for field-deployability: engineer an auxotrophic strain of Shewanella to contain our constructs, and ensure that the likelihood of survival without nutritional supplementation is very, very low. We would also need to ensure, from a practical standpoint, that auxotrophy would not interfere with any other aspects of the physiology of the cells.
Evolutionary Prediction
Due to the relatively simple nature of our reporter system, we find it highly unlikely that our strains could evolve to possess any dangerous function if somehow released into the wild. However, it is still possible that the promoter regions of our constructs could mutate and alter the expected patterns of promoter activity, or that the functionality of mtrB would be impaired by a deleterious mutation. The former possibility could serve to make the strain more genetically similar to the wild-type, and thus more able to compete; this presents us with another reason to pursue auxotrophy as a solution, basically in order to ensure that our strains are not alive for long enough for mutations to accumulate.
However, we would also need to conduct extensive testing to ensure that our strains remain functional and responsive to analyte for the full 6-month period.
Gene Transfer
Perhaps the most pressing concern with any synthetic biology project is the possibility of horizontal gene transfer from engineered to natural strains, and vice versa. Again, our first line of defense is physical containment, but barring that, what can we do to reduce the possibility that our strains would transfer unnatural functions to natural cells? The biggest shortcoming of our current system is that antibiotic resistance is used as a selective marker on our plasmids, thus allowing for the possibility that antibiotic resistance could be spread among natural populations via conjugation or passive transformation. While we could explore the possibility of using another form of auxotrophy as a selective marker on a plasmid, we believe that a more viable solution would be to eliminate the need for a selective pressure in the first place, namely by chromosomal integration. The transfer of chromosomal DNA is much less likely than the transfer of a plasmid, and, as mentioned above, chromosomal integration would solve other problems in the functionality of our reporters.
Limitations of CEA
CEA allowed us to think about crucial future work for our project in order to make it suitable for field-deployability. However, in our interactions with environmental groups, public officials in water quality management, and industrial groups, we encountered several important questions that were not built into existing CEA framework"

TAS_Taipei,2016,Team:TAS Taipei#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," Dose
Each dose of nanoparticles are released periodically. The function $C_{oa} (t)$ models the GSR increase after a dose given at $t = 0$. If we apply  doses periodically, we can apply a time shift to this function by $n\cdot p$, the number of periods multiplied by the period length, to create the graphs shown in Figure C. We also apply a unit step function, so the function value is 0 before the eyedrop is applied. By summing up the contribution of each dose, we get the resulting concentration of GSR outside the nanoparticles over time. Remember that our aim is to maintain 43.5 uM of GSR.
$$C_{total}(t)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty {C_{oa} (t-np \cdot)e^{-k_d(t-np)} \cdot u(t-np)}$$
An example of the resulting $C_{total}(t)$ is shown in Figure D.
Our modeling equation bares a resemblence to Fourier series, but instead we use exponentials to model the concentration function. The analysis we take later is similar to how Fourier series are analyzed.
Assumptions
In this model, we made the following assumptions:
All nanoparticles are uniform. All nanoparticle doses that are manufactured will be uniform.
GSR is delivered directly into the lens.It is difficult to model the function of the lens or diffusion inside the eyes, so we assume almost all GSR that is delivered
There is no limit to the concentration of GSR that can be placed into a nanoparticle.This would be an issue of manufacturing, although the concentrations we use are reasonably low to ensure that manufacturing is not a problem.
Analysis of Changing Variables
We vary each variable, nanoparticle radius, concentration, and dose frequency, one at a time, while keeping the other two variables constant.
Changing Radius
We find that changing the radius has little impact on the resulting graph, shown in Figure 4.D. Equilibrium is slightly decreased when radius is increased. We will ignore nanoparticle radius. We will use whatever range that is most convienient for manufacturers. For our purposes, we will use r = 200 nm.
Although we disregard nanoparticle radius, this simplification is only true in our desired range of 200 to 400 nm. Extremely small or large nanoparticles will show a difference in release.
Figure 4.D: Changing Radius. As shown in this graph, when concentration and dose frequency are kept constant, changing nanoparticle radius results in essentially no change in the concentration graph.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

D.I.V.E.R.T. Directed In Vivo Evolution via Reverse Transcription
Abtract
In vivo continuous directed evolution offers significant advantages over classic in vitro methods as it drastically reduces the amount of time and actual lab work required. Most current approaches, however, are based on globally accelerated mutagenesis inevitably leading to unwanted off-target mutations. D.I.V.E.R.T. represents the concept of a new continuous in vivo evolution strategy that allows full spatial control of mutagenesis by building systems that resemble the retrotransposon life cycle: The gene of interest’s mRNA is reverse transcribed in an error prone way and reintegrated into the genome at the respective locus replacing the original gene for several cycles. To demonstrate the generalizability of the process we plan on carrying out our proof of concept experiment in yeast and E. coli. By the end of August we are still in the cloning stage. Additionally, we are working on a single plasmid system for CRISPR-enhanced chromosomal integration in E. coli.
https://2017.igem.org/Team:BOKU-Vienna
The project we intended to improve was the D.I.V.E.R.T (Directed In Vivo Evolution via Reverse Transcription) designed by the 2017 BOKU Vienna Team.
The original aim of the DIVERT project was the was to improve the retrotransposon system designed by Crook and al.(1). In fact, they noted that
Ty1 as a mobile genetic element can reintegrate anywhere in the genome [...] possibly reducing selection efficiency due to the presence of multiple copies of the heterologous gene in a single cell. Additionally, in this setting the reverse transcriptase likewise is continuously mutated increasing the risk of inactivation as time carries on.

Goal: To  verify if the transformation is successful and perform ligation once it does.
After  cultivated in liquid LB for 12 hours, bacteria were collected in 1.5mL sterile  tube and isolated plasmids. Digested for both restriction analysis and ligation  then ran on a gel. The image showed that transformation was almost successful,  still two of them appeared to be contaminated. We hope those extra bands were  due to some careless mistakes during isolation process, not transformation.
Cell  Immobilization:
Transferred  the PcI-RLT  beads into  LB medium with Ampicillin, 37°C shaker  incubated.
PcI-RLT beads  emitted fluorescence, which revealed more obvious under ultraviolet light. The  fluorescence didn’t trail off after cultivated for several hours.

Before  making the microcapsules, we prepared 6% PDMDAAC solution and NaCS solution  (the concentration was not sure ). For ensuring the concentration of NaCS solution we need, firstly we dissolved 0.4 g in 20mL deionized water,82°C water  bath, and gradually added NaCS to make it more dense and more viscous. It was  really a time-consuming process to Dissolve NaCS completely.
