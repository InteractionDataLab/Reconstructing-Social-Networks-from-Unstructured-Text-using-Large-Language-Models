Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," (Maurer et al, 2006).  That said there was some disparity between respondents on the scale and style of regulation, whether based on institutions, nations or even international regulatory bodies, although one idea raised in the report by Maurer, Lucas and Terrell was that as well as an ethics advisory committee, synthetic biologists could receive advice from ‘an Ethics Hotline’ which has to be met with scepticism as to the benefit, use and serious function that that it could be expected to play.  There is already in fact a great level of legislation in place concerning GMOs, such as the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) created by the National Institute of Health (NIH) introduced in 1976 with a number of guidelines creating thorough risk assessments for any genetic manipulation.  Indeed ‘many scientists considered the NIH guidelines overly restrictive when they were first introduced, but over the past thirty years, the guidelines have been gradually evolved in response to experience’ (Tucker, 2006).  As with the initial explosion of genetic techniques in the past, Synthetic Biology may be best served by an initial regulatory approach which might even run the risk of being overbearing with an understanding to evolve the system as research develops and for “good behaviour”.  Safety measures like techniques of making genetically engineered organisms less likely to survive independently, such as relying on nutrients not found in large (if any) quantities in an environment have no doubt contributed to the safety record of recombinant DNA experiments, creating safety nets to help prevent even accidental release causing a significant problem.
Even if the original NIH restrictions were unpopular with many scientists, the subsequent relaxation of many guidelines has not been popular with many civil society organisations such as the now defunct Sunshine Project, an anti-bioweapons NGO who were fierce critics of the American National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) claiming their recommendations were not for safe control but ‘will instead assault regulation of a wide range of biodefense and biotech risk’ (Balmer, 2008).  Another staunch critic is the Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration (ETC) who have made a range of criticisms of the companies involved in synthetic biology and of the area in general, some of which will be looked at it more detail later. Ambiguous results of potential unintended side-effects of previous genetic work such as Bt-corn (so called for having been transformed with genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis) (Losey et al, 1999) (Flachowsky et al, 2005) has no"

UC_Davis,2010,Team:UC Davis#notebook#c0051debug.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"zoom in"" on the sequence in Bba_C0051 that is responsible for this phenomenon. We expect to have this data for our presentation - please see our talk.
In addition to data from the previous point, we also intend to have some measure of relative promoter strength in time to present.  Again, please see our talk.
While we don't completely understand the mechanism of this promoter, we have made great strides to characterize this critical registry part and contributed a ""corrected"" promoter-free version of the part in the registry ( BBa_K327018 ).  Given the broad use of this part we expect this to have a relatively large impact.
Finally, a critical extension of this result is the conclusion that we must be prepared to accept the idea that the assembly of even well-standardized parts may be subject to unintended consequences that arise from the nature of the substrate we're working with (DNA).  That is, while we might understand the isolated function of each part, specific combination of these parts may invent novel function that were unexpected - the assembly of a device may lead to functions that are more than the sum of its parts.
More to Come!
We are currently working to clearly pinpoint the place in the cI-lambda coding region that interacts with the barcode and caused transcription.
In order to achieve this, we have designed primers, which are used to carefully truncate Bba_C0051. After these truncations are made, we will observe their phenotype in order to determine our results.
Also, we are in the process of characterizing and measuring the relative strength of the promoter present in the system containing a barcode.
We look forward to sharing the results of these quantitative tests at the iGEM Jamboree ‘10.

5. “Synthetic Biology 1” Video Series Translation
Throughout our interaction with the general public in Hong Kong, one obstacles we spot out is the medium of instruction.         While Hong Kong is a place where English is the secondary language, students especially from public high school are         taught in Chinese. However, interesting sources for learning synthetic biology are not equipped with Chinese translations,         which could act as a language barrier for any interested parties.
With great honor, we encountered Mr. Ariel Lindner who introduced us to the Synthetic Biology 1 page and invited us         to collaborate in Chinese translation with Mr. Edwin Wintermute. We translated the English subtitles to Chinese and         had produced a voice-over version for four of the videos shared on Synthetic Biology 1. Each video has both Cantonese         and Mandarin versions. Our translated videos have been uploaded on bilibili website: https://space.bilibili.com/178821464/#!/ which is also accessible in China.

This week's been crazy busy. I've been looking for bugs in Clotho, fixing up my Cartoonist plugin, and making the Clotho plugin tutorial . On Monday we had an introductory meeting and safety training so we can go into the lab. Doug helped us set up Clotho and handed out some tasks for the week. On Tuesday we discussed and chose our projects for the summer and started work on identifying bugs and cleaning up documentation. I'll be working primarily on a visualization piece with Joanna.
The rest of the week I've been hammering out a plugin tutorial for Clotho . On Wednesday I set up a plugins project in NetBeans and wrote up a preliminary draft of the tutorial. On Thursday and Friday I cleaned up the tutorial a bit and made a sample plugin XML file. I also tried out my tutorial to look for unclear instructions and potential problem points that I would need to point out in the tutorial. Lastly, sacrificing most of my weekend, I added helpful screenshots to the wiki page and cleaned up the tutorial some more. Unfortunately, the last section of the tutorial is still incomplete; I will have to finish it on Monday.

Week Two - 6/8
Monday The tutorial is done! Late post (from my daily notes) As for the rest of the week, I continued to look into BioJADE and ProMoT as starting points for Clotho's new visualization tool. The source code wasn't very useful or readable, so we decided to try using JavaFX. And that's where the rest of my week went- JavaFX looks great and runs fast, BUT YOU CAN'T CALL IT FROM JAVA."

However, the latest evidence suggests that this power, which came to be known as “Rishabh”, has recently taken residence in Ithaca, NY, inspiring novelties in synthetic biology through its peerless designs and sassiness, while stimulating the economy by circulating currency into Taco Bell and Chipotle. Everyone waits patiently, observing with anticipation, for they know that Rishabh is about to compose the next turning point in history.

Biological Engineering ('19)
I am a sophomore, majoring in Biological Engineering in CALS, but I am more well known for being obnoxiously tall, prone to blocking the sun from the shorter members. My accomplishments include being making burnt burgers for the iGEM BBQ, which they were forced to scarf down, playing chess in CS 1110, and admiring my multiple failed gel electrophoresis attempts. I also made it my desktop background because I believe failure is the road to success. During the summer, I was awarded with the position of the iGEM social chair because I talk more than I’m supposed to and I often carry a stress ball because you can always be making #gains for the fingers. Although my accomplishments and experiences are by far large and impactful, I consider myself statistically insignificant compared to the rest of my stellar teammates. I will be often found in my suite in Keeton, living the life of a lucky West campus bastard, so hmu if you actually get a good time slot.
I can be described by the 3 following emoijs: 💩🤓¯\_(ツ)_/¯

These composite parts come together to complete the pathway from Eriodictyol to Anthocyanin. These constructs are separated due to the size of the genes.

We believe that since the Interlab protocol is meant be designed to be as useful as possible for scientists around the world, it should be altered to reflect how most growth assays are currently performed which is to prepare a plate and grow the samples in the plate reader whilst taking regular measurements instead of growing large stocks of the samples and taking aliquots to measure. This would not only be more relevant but also a lot less labour and material intensive.
We were glad to participate in the Interlab study as not only did it count as a Bronze award criterion but many of the skills used in the study were directly applied to our own project, namely the use of plate readers to measure absorbance and fluorescence to characterise our parts. Not only did it help us get acquainted with the machines but there was also valuable information about how much samples should be diluted to get to particular starting OD’s.
We hope that the data gathered by us proves useful for the study."

A special mention goes out to Margot Chilcott for her expert guidance and hands-on teaching.  She was willing to drop whatever she was doing (including paper writing) to answer any questions we had (which our facilitators can testify to be innumberable!).  It goes without saying that the Surette lab was key in helping the 2009 University of Calgary iGEM team further their project to where it is at today.
Our facilitators, Sonja Georgijevic, Thane Kubik, Dr. Christian Jacob and Dr. Anders Nygren who enabled us to help direct and formulate the project.  Our endless conversations with them helped shape an excellent framework of knowledge, skills and ideas for us to build and elaborate on.  The tireless efforts of the facilitators, especially Sonja and Thane, to ensure our success is greatly appreciated by the team.

Overview
TU-Eindhoven 2018 functionally improved on the original truncated lysostaphin BBa_K748002 created by the HIT-Harbin 2012 team in multiple ways. Through codon optimization, expression of the lysostaphin domain has been improved considerably. The other major functional improvement was realized by fusing the truncated lysostaphin to the HlyA secretion domain via a cleavable thrombin linker. In this way, (continuous) secretion via the Type I pathway can be achieved by co-expressing it with the HlyB/D secretion proteins. This avoids the requirement of cell lysis for release of the truncated lysostaphin, improving on the project of iGEM Harbin 2012, as self-destruction of their killer device is no longer necessary. Additionally, this new construct simplifies purification of truncated lysostaphin as running the medium over a nickel affinity column followed by thrombin cleavage results in pure truncated lysostaphin. The part BBa_K2812004 has been characterized extensively and the expression, secretion and selective activity of the truncated lysostaphin against S. aureus is demonstrated successfully.

Experimental
To demonstrate the functional improvement over the original truncated lysostaphin BBa_K748002 created by HIT-Harbin 2012, we intended to assemble our BioBrick BBa_K2812004 with the T7 promotor BBa_K525998, allowing protein expression by induction with IPTG. Since the part BBa_K2144001 from iGEM Stockholm 2016 is this exact assembly, we requested their part from the iGEM registry and we transformed it successfully in E. coli BL21 (DE3).

Welcome! This is the official wiki of the Purdue Biomakers, Purdue’s official iGEM team since 2006.
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the premiere graduate, undergraduate, and high school Synthetic Biology competition. iGEM started as a month-long course at MIT in 2003 in which students worked on simple genetic circuits. The class was soon turned into a summer competition which has continually evolved into it’s current form with over 250 teams from around the world competing each year. At the beginning of each summer teams are given a kit of biological parts which contains pieces of DNA submitted by other teams during previous years. At their respective schools, teams assembly their parts into devices and place them into living cells. This format provides an excellent learning opportunity and is especially motivating as students have much control over their team's project.
2006 marks the year that Purdue participated, entering the competition with seven undergraduate members and three advisers. Purdue continued to compete until 2010 when a lack of interest and funding prevented a team from competing. Fortunately interested increase and in 2012 Purdue began competing again. Our first year back we received a gold medal and advanced to the international competition at MIT, the following year we ranked third in the undergraduate division of North America at the 2013 regional competition.
Now we are back; bigger and better than ever! Our team continues to grow and although this year was difficult with an untrained board and some growing pains, you can expect us to continue striving at this year's iGEM competition!

Aerobic consumption of ammonium and hydroxylamine

3 Results
3.1 AMO Transformant
3.2 HAO Transformant
4 Conclusion and Discussion
Introduction
In this aerobic experiment, we add ammonium NH4+ to AMO transformed E. coli cells and measure the consumption of ammonium to determine whether our AMO transformant is converting ammonium to hydroxylamine (NH2OH) faster than an untransformed E. coli control.  A similar protocol is used to determine whether our HAO transformant is converting hydroxylamine to nitrite NO2-, by measuring production of nitrite.
Methods
The experiment is based on the protocol Experiment 4 and it was performed on August 27th and August 28th .
Results
AMO Transformant
Ammonia measured plotted vs optical density from minutes 129 to 885 for two replicates of the AMO transformant, and an untransformed E. coli control.  The slope (change in concentration of Ammonia / change in optical density) of this graph indicates consumption of Ammonia.

Supplemental figures follow.
HAO Transformant
Over the course of the experiment, the OD for all treatments that hydroxylamine was added to decreased or remained essentially constant.  Additionally, no nitrite was detected in any of the treatments.
Conclusion and Discussion
The AMO transformant uses ammonia at a rate greater than the untransformed E. coli control.  This suggests that the AMO is consuming ammonia and converting it to hydroxylamine.  Additionally, however, the AMO transformant grows significantly more slowly than the control.
It is clear that hydroxylamine is toxic to the cells at this concentration.  With more time, it would be interesting to repeat the toxicity experiment using hydroxyl"
Toronto,2016,Team:Toronto#HP-Impact_-_-_TEXT.html," a purely technical solution based on consultation with the afflicted stakeholders. Bielefield, Paterson, and Swan (2009) provide a litany of benefits to young engineers from participating in a PBSL course. First, interpersonal skills like teamwork, communication, leadership, and project management are improved from working with non-technical partners. PBSL students exhibit greater sensitivity to the social, cultural, environmental, and ethical considerations when they can easily see the consequences of their decisions, and the constraints on decision-making that these considerations impose foster creativity in their circumvention. Additionally, young engineers report better self-confidence, self-esteem, interest in volunteering, and civic engagement, suggesting that the benefits pass through to their personal lives and role as a citizen. Lastly, the participation rate of under-represented groups is greater than their representation in the population of engineers, suggesting that the inclusion of social considerations can draw in minority engineers that might otherwise be pushed away. This then suggests that iGEM’s professed commitment to the consideration of issues “beyond the [lab] bench” confers those same benefits on its participants.
Empirical evidence also demonstrates that participation in undergraduate research improves cognitive abilities and increases the likelihood that a student goes on to become a researcher. Fechheimer, Webber, and Kleiber (2011) demonstrated a correlation between participation in undergraduate research and a student’s cumulative GPA, while controlling for innate ability with SAT scores. Of course, this is not a strong claim in favour of causality. Kuh (2007), writing in the annual report for the  National Survey for Student Engagement, reported that undergraduate researchers performing various research activities (designing the study, reviewing literature, collecting data, analyzing data, interpreting findings, writing up findings, presenting findings, and submitting a paper) saw statistically significant increases in various measures of deep learning (in higher order thinking, integrative learning, reflective learning, and overall deep learning). Lopatto and Tobias (2010) surveyed undergraduate researchers and found that they “were better able to think independently and formulate their own ideas, had become more intrinsically motivated to learn, and had become more active learners,” (2009). He also ran focus groups with undergraduate researchers and a control group; he observed that undergraduate researchers exhibited cognitive development and argued that there was a concomitant strengthening in the desire for knowledge that would lead undergraduates to stay in academia. Lastly, Bauer and Bennett’s (2003) survey of university alumni revealed that undergraduate researchers were 10% more likely to pursue graduate school, lending credence to the claim that undergraduate researchers were more likely to pursue research as a"

This year, we design a yeast system to produce antifungl                                       peptide which inhibits the activity of Fusarium graminearum,                                       the pathogen of wheat scab. To choose the suitable antifungl                                       peptide, we establish an evaluation model and want to know                                        which antimicrobial peptide gets the highest score.
We also design a complex system to sense and degrade the                                       toxin produced by Fusarium graminearum. Sensing and                                       degrading are dynamic processes so dynamic model is a good                                       choice to represent this part. Since the expression of degradation                                       enzymes are controlled by engineered photoactivatable switch,                                       we consider photochemical reaction kinetics and it performs                                       well.                                       In the same system, we put in a kill switch into the yeast. Yeast                                       will die without galactose induction so the safety of the system                                       is ensured. You can see how the yeast die by our model.
Antifungl Peptide Part
We intend to use yeast system to produce a large number                                           of antifungl peptides to kill Fusarium graminearum which                                           causes the wheat scab. Therefore, the selection of antifungl                                           peptide is very important.
We searched for some antimicrobial peptide databases like                                           Peptaibol Database, Defensin Knowledgebase, MiniCOPE,                                           APD and so on. Finally, we found 20 antimicrobial peptides                                           that inhibit the activity of Fusarium graminearum.
The ideal antifungl peptide should have the following                                                   characteristics:
(1) Being harmless to host cells.
(2) Being harmless to the human body.
(3) Having little damage on microbes in the soil.
Therefore, we set effective antifungl concentration, Activity                                               object, half-life as three indexs, and established an evaluation                                               model to evaluate if the peptide is suitable for our"
BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#Proof#test2_-_-_TEXT.html," different kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.
We assembled these corresponding circuits together for the final testing.
We assumed that, more arabinose added, more inhibitor will be expressed and the downstream in-promoter will be repressed. That’s what we are going to prove.
But when arabinose was added, RFP intensity increased contradicting with the expected results.                                 Maybe the terminator can’t completely isolate the two devices. Thought of it this way, we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits. The circuits are shown in the Fig.9.                                 So we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits.
After the pre-experiment, we chose a series of appropriate arabinose concentrations, and they are listed in table.1. The negative control is the strain containing the empty vector pSB1C3 and the positive control is the strain containing the (序号) with no arabinose added.
The improvement of device construction was that we added a terminator and changed the promoter direction. In this way, we could observe the decrease of RFP intensity when the arabinose concentration increases. It indicates that the change of arabinose concentration will affect inhibitor’s concentration, and the inhibitor can influence the expression of downstream gene. We chose the CI-pR circuit to do this experiment and got the diagram of the relationship of the time and RFP intensity under different concentration of arabinose.
From this diagram we can see, when the arabinose’s concentration reaches to 0.0030％-0.0040％, the RFP can hardly express. The result proved that the inhibitor can almost completely repress the killer gene at the turning point. Also,                                 we could say inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene.
Summary:
Above all, we proved that plasmid numbers will influence the concentration of inhibitor proteins, and the inhibitor concentration will regulate the expression of killer gene which is indicated by RFP measurement results.
After connecting with kill gene, the plasmids losing on different levels will influence the expression of killer gene, which means we can sense the plasmid numbers and accordingly decide whether or not to turn on the switch of killer gene. From all these, we can achieve the goal of controlling the number of plasmids as we need.

We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!

On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for"

Communication with Other Teams
It’s the second year for us to participate in iGEM, and we are lucky enough to have obtained much help from other teams. Especially, we communicate with the team of Peking University frequently. And we constructed good relationship with iGEM teams around the world through helping them in different ways. This year we started our modeling design without any experience from before. As for our noise analysis-model, ETH University helped us solve the fundamental problem of how to apply Gillespei Algorithm. And through communicating with Peking University, we have learned how to change whole biological reactions to elementary reactions and how to apply chemical mass action law.For 2012 world jamboree, Boston University buy the helium for us in advance to help our team show our project.
OUC-China iGEM Team belongs to Ocean University of China Association of Science and Technology (OAST). We did nearly half of the experiments in the lab of OAST. The experiments of GVP were totally done in it. Besides, most human practices were done with the help of other people in the Organization. We held Hands-on experience summer camp and 2th summer camp of life science and technology in favor of OAST this summer. Almost every iGEMers in ours team are OASTers. We love iGEM, and we love OAST.
Special Friends
Yang Liu : He is our advisor, he is our teacher, and what’s more, he is like our elder brother. One year before, we knew nothing about synthetic biology. He taught us a lot about experiments, managing lab and how to be a REAL scientist. With his help, we did most experiment of GVP and manage lab smoothly.
Wei Liu :She is our advisor and girlfriend of Yang Liu. Besides Yang Liu, she did much favor for us and helped Yang Liu to teach us Synthetic Biology. Because our team was divided into two groups and one group went to Qibebt, she helped us in qibebt about living, learning and experiment there.

Biological memory
Bacillus subtilis is a sporulating bacteria and can survive for years in its spore form. Also, we can make them respond to external stress such as electro-magnetic fields. Use these two features to engineer bacterias capable of storing information for years. This could become an immortal and unlimited memory. We could use bacterias in some way so that bacteria are 0 or 1 and use this to make a bacterial hardware or memory that is capable of storing octets and therefore that has memory.
Allergen detection and removal
Using bacteria as quality control and disabling of allergens by detection of peptides found to elicit allergic response in food, such as nut, shell fish, egg, dairy traces etc. Samples from batches could in theory be tested with a fluorescent output.
Calculator : Implementation of a simple calculator to add numbers
Soil Enhancer
Detection of nutritions on the soil and freeing up the minerals for the plants ( Article ) - maybe detect the N, P, K elements in soil and give different feedback like colour or flourescence , adjust it's metabolism system to generate a product which can be absorbed by plants easily.
Fast bacteria
Engineering the movement of bacteria with feedback systems like rockets ( Article )
Inflammatory disease treatment
This idea is a little similar to the allergen detector and corrector system - it involves using Bacillus subtilis in humans to target and deal with a particular allergen particle before the immune system sets in and creates the damaging effects of inflammation. Would make use of receptors which are able to bind to 1)IgE molecules and 2) the allergen particles themselves.
Gastric Inflammation
Treatment and prevention of H. pylori(stomach ulcer) - engineer a B. subtilis that can live and grow happily in stomach acidity (pH2) - an acidophilic strain will also be needed for the heavy metal trapping.
Skin repairer
Using the production of hyaluronic acid (HA) an important glycosaminoglycan which is found in synovial fluid, extracellular matrix and very important in wound healing. It was found by Widner et al. 2005 that the HasA gene for Hyaluronan synthase could be expressed successfully in B. subtilis. It could maybe be put into a plaster or gauze used to dress wounds?  (The bacteria should be friendly to the human body and generate a growth factor like HA or another product to help skin cells"

For example, Agrotis ypsilon (Rottemberg) and Spodoptera litura fall into the kind of moth that have negative geotaxis (antigravity, tendency to fly upwards). Thus, we made a trap with accessible pathway at the bottom. Once an insect enters the device, it could only go up and be trapped inside the pyramid. However, after field investigation, we found some insects still escape from the device. Then we came up with a new version trap with doubled layers, inner shell and outer shell.
Assembling Process
Before the detailed description of how we design our device, we can show you a simple animation of the assembling process of our device. As you can see, our device is very easy to use. Just assemble the outer shell, inner shell (containing PBAN) and tenons together to complete the device. Then, you can put the device at where you want to attract the harmful insects.
Mechanism of Attraction
As you can see, we divide our design into two parts－exterior and interior. The exterior is just like the appearance of a pyramid, and the interior is designed to accommodate PBAN. At the beginning of using the device, we turn on the blue light LEDs to attract the target harmful insects. When the target female insects are stuck in the interior and eat the food mixed with PBAN solution, they will release pheromones, and attract same-species counterparts. Even if we turn off the blue light, our device can attract many target male insects because the female insects inside our device is still in rut and releasing sex pheromone to attract their mates. After the harmful insects go into our device, the design of our device will take advantage of their habit. Insects always fly high to escape so they will be stuck in the top of our device.

We shaped the device into a pyramid. Its special layout also enriches the device with mysterious colors.

As for quorum-sensing oscillator, luxI proteins could generate AHL from some substrates consisting of acyl-ACPs and Sadenosylmethionine (SAM). We assume that the amount of substrates is sufficient.
AHL(Acyl homoserine lactones) is a kind of auto-inducer, which could combine with luxR protein and activate the promoter. In addition, the lactonic ring of the AHL will be hydrolyzed once in presence of AiiA protein.
For transcription activation, we use Hill function to describe the rate of production.

According to the above processes，we can describe the genetic circuit by the following equations:

, since it is not tagged for fast degradation.
DDEs
Due to the time interval between expression of regulating protein and transcriptional activation by the luxR and AHL complex which depends on the past concentration of internal AHL, we decide to use DDEs model. Transcription, translation, and maturation rate of proteins are combined into a single time-delay parameter
. We modeled based on the paper “Rapid and tunable post-translational coupling of genetic circuits”.
The simulation is carried out using custom written software in MATLAB. We get the simulation result of oscillator, as shown in Figure 1.

Conclusion
After a great summer of hard work, it's time to conclued on our project.
Concerning the laboratory experiment we learnt few things... The first one is that the bench work takes a lot of time, so even if our project is designed on paper, it's not so easy in the ""practical"" life.
Ethics is really important when a new discipline is created. In this direction, it was an evidence for our team to inclued the ethics as a part in our project. In this direction we were able to think about the synthetic biology and its applications. [ Report Synthethics PDF ]
About the collaboration, it was a great pleasure and it was really appreciable to work with other iGEM team for different part of our project (modelisation, ethics or i-phone tool). This collaboration allow us to contribute to the iGEM spirit.

BostonU_HW,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Collaborations#Blog3_-_-_TEXT.html," note is the scope of these protections. In this original copyright act, applicants’ work was guaranteed protection for 14 years. Fast forward to today: copyright protections will protect an individual’s work for the life of the individual, plus an extra fifty years [5]. Furthermore, the Copyright Act of 1790 only protected an author’s work from explicit verbatim copying and no more than that. This led to an interesting situation where Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, attempted to sue the German translator of her work when they secured a copyright for the German translation.  In 1853, the Pennsylvania Circuit Courts decided that the translation was not an infringement upon Stowe’s copyright, as it did not constitute verbatim copying. The Pennsylvania Circuit Court argued that “A translation may, in loose phraseology, be called a transcript or copy of her thoughts or conceptions, but in no correct sense can it be called a copy of her book” [6]. To give this example some context: imagine if Harry Potter (originally written in English) was translated to Spanish by another person, under the original copyright laws.  If that was the case, J.K. Rowling would not be able to protect the translated copy as her own work. Fast forward to today: copyright obviously protects the translation of an author’s works, but the scope of copyright has grown to protect not just texts, but photos, songs, software, and even architecture. (A big extension to the copyright laws was made in the Copyright Act of 1831, which allowed “musical compositions in the list of protected materials, along with books, maps, charts, prints, cuts and engravings.”[7]) Indeed, the U.S. courts eventually concluded that the essence of work protected by copyright is “in the substance, and not in the form alone.” [8]
Much as the scope of copyright laws increased – in both duration of protection and content protected – patent law in the United States also grew to encompass greater varieties of functional inventions for lengthier periods of time. In 1842, Congress extended patent laws to cover industrial designs in an effort to stimulate the industrial revolution at home. Congress also passed the Plant Patent Act of 1930, which allowed patents on unique cultivations of plant species. Interestingly, patent laws also grew to encompass surgical procedures after World War 2, unfortunately leading to a host of ethical dilemmas concerning the monopolization of life-saving treatments. This issue was addressed in 1996 when Congress granted physicians freedom from liability for infringement of patented medical practices. [9]

July 16 – 22, 2012
Finally the primers necessary for biobricking ADF-3 arrived! And we have got other important material: we talked with Dr. Hugo Olguin, and he is willing to share with us his anti-FLAG antibody. Furthermore, he allowed us to do the western blot in his laboratory. Additionally, we achieved significant advances in the wiki, especially in the section Human Practices.  Unfortunately, we still lack of salmonella.
July 23 – 29, 2012
After some research we found the promising projects of the Japanese iGEM team HokkaidoU 2010 and 2011. They used the E. Coli (k-12) strain SGSC4024, from Salmonella Genetic Stock Center(SGSC) in University of Calgary, Canada  ( http://people.ucalgary.ca/~kesander/index.html ). This strain carries a pBeloBAC11 vector encoding a genome fragment of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 which covers the SPI-2 region [B_STM07H21 SGSC4024 1464540～1562427] We asked the iGEM team members of HokkaidoU 2011 if the E. Coli (k-12) strain SGSC4024 is capable of secreting proteins to the external environment. But unfortunately it seems that is only capable of injecting molecules into other cells, and that is not what we need.

DTU-Denmark,2013,Team:DTU-Denmark#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," experimentally.   I joined the iGEM team because my concept of 'fun' includes dedicating my summer to work on a big project with other committed people.  Synthetic biology can be used to build a more sustainable future for us and our planet, and I'm excited to be a part of a team that is making that happen. Also, I am quite fond of chocolate cake.

Biology and chemistry are my biggest interest and also a sort of hobby to me so I chose to study biotechnology because of the mix of the two. I joined the DTU iGEM team to learn synthetic biology and to get the experience of doing it. I also like the idea that you can go into the lab and create something that has never been made before. When I’m not doing school work I enjoy watching sports like football, handball and boxing but road cycling beats them all. My favorite cake is banana cake with big chunks of chocolate.
Ariadni Droumpali
I am an environmental engineer, really excited to be on the iGEM team. I come from Greece with a background in Environmental Engineering and my study line on the master in DTU is Environmental Microbiology. My inspiration about microbiology is encouraged while working with other team members from different study fields like biology, chemistry, biotechnology as we contribute in our ambition to complete this project.  When I am not in lab, university or class, I enjoy participating in film festivals and a photography team. My favorite cake is brownies with chocolate and nuts!

Hi there! I just handed in my MSc thesis in Computer Science at DTU. My main areas of interest are high-performance computing, distributed systems and web applications. I joined the team as although, I have been working in as a scientific programmer in bioinformatics for quite a while, I have never been able to experience the ""wet"" side of research. Besides, I like mocking Kristian for the late-night stays in the lab way too much. Banana bread & coffee, anything else is a compromise.

Penn_State,2013,Team:Penn State#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM served as a crash course in plant and synthetic biology. Although difficult at first, it has proven to be a rewarding experience for her.  As part of the iGEM team she worked on the vanillin project and human practices. Outside of iGEM, she is a home body that enjoys reading, the cinema and spending time with family and friends.
Phillip Cygan
As a man of intelligence and drive, Philip joined iGEM this year for the first time. Going into his Senior year at Penn State, Phil is a Mathematics Education Major, planning to educate high school students in the complex ideas of mathematics and all it has to offer. Philip is involved in Penn State through many organizations and sports, leading a very active lifestyle. As an active student, he decided to try iGEM, even with a very small background, and is working on the Cas9 project and learning more than he imagined he could. He has become a lab rat, spending nearly everyday in lab, working on this project. Phil, not just a student in Math and Education, but a student in synthetic biology now too!
Sam Ewell
Sam just finished his third year of Biomedical Engineering at Penn State. His studies have focused on human biology, so iGEM has been a good opportunity for him to explore plant biology as well. During the summer he helped with the website and the butanol project, but his main focus was running our plant nursery. In order to test all these different ideas we needed a small army of plants and he made sure they grew up to be strong little soldiers. When not studying or caring for plants, he enjoys being the best.
Stephanie Everhart
Stephanie, going into her junior year at Penn State, is a Secondary Education Major in the chemistry option. She hopes to one day become a high school chemistry teacher that can inspire more students to pursue a future in science.  iGEM has given her the opportunity to explore different facets of science, which has proved very rewarding. As part of the iGEM team, Stephanie has focused her efforts on the education outreach aspect of the Human Practices component. Outside of iGEM, Stephanie enjoys running, hiking and indulging in a good movie. In addition, she is a strong advocate for military appreciation as the president of the Dear Hero Program, a student run group on campus that sends letters and care packages to troops overseas.

TU-Delft,2011,Team:TU-Delft#Project#Detailed_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM team (BBa_K193601 and 602) are used. Once mfp5 is hydroxylated, it will be adhesive. The previous mentioned L-tyrosines now have an additional hydroxylgroup and are called L-DOPA. To determine the adhesive properties, several experiments are done, including atomic force microscopy and MALDI-TOF. These results are also very useful for our mathematical model, so we’ll get the most realistic estimation/result.
Last but certainly not least, there is the project for localisation of mfp5 in one specific part of the outer-membrane. Therefore, we will combine our construct together with a Biobrick of the SDU Denmark 2010 iGEM team (BBa_K343003). The localisation is achieved by the use of the signal sequence which originates from the complex flagellar system.  When the localisation is achieved, we can make a controllable production-line when combined with different  properties of E. coli. This is the first step to have a chip with a product-line, which will have many beneficial scale-up possibilities in the future.

UQ-Australia,2009,Team:UQ-Australia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," contains genes which encode for reistance systems to Ag(I), Cd(II), Co(II), Cr(IV), Hg(II), Ni(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) [1] . These systems commonly contain a metal transporter, a metal binding protein, a reduction mechanism, and a metal responsive promoter. In the case of Hg(II), the currently accepted general system is outlined below. [2]
This system facilitates the transportation of Hg(II) into the cell, where MerA acts a reductase, producing Hg(0), which then diffuses out of the cell. However, our project focuses on the accumulation of mercury within the cell, so many elements of this pathway are unsuitable for our purpose. We envisage a system of two plasmids, one containing mercury resistance genes (mer genes).
Plasmid 1
This plasmid will allow for the transport of Hg(II) into the cell, where the protein metallothionien aids in intracellular accumulation. Once Hg(II) enters the cell, it activates MerR, a transcriptional regulator. When active, MerR will initiate the transcription of Antigen43 (Ag43).
Plasmid 2
A. DNA twisted conformation and transcription unable to occur B.Conformational change in MerR when Hg binds - transcription goes ahead C. Hypothetical situation in which MerD (in the endogenous system) binds preferentially to stop transcription (4) .
Ag43 is a surface expressed autotransporter [3] . This means all the information for suface targeting of the plasma membrane is contained within the protein. Since Ag43 is a native protein to E. Coli (specifically K12 strain), it must first be removed from the genome, then re-inserted as a plasmid so that its expression can be controlled. We were able to obtain a flu- E. coli strain, kindly donated by Associate Professor Mark Schembri from the University of Queensland. When two E. coli cells express Ag43, they aggregate together. Once enough of these cells aggregate, they will fall to the bottom of solution. This autoaggregation can be easily measured using a spectrophotometer.

MSU's Proposal
Shewlock in Water Treatment:
The ability to measure electricity production by Shewanella has the potential to be used as an economical alternative to current measurement systems that detect for harmful water contaminants.
Why?
As a Michigan team, water quality is an issue that hits very close to home. The Flint Water Crisis gained national attention for the extremely elevated lead contamination in the drinking water. This crisis began in 2014, however the Flint residents are advised to continue using filtered or bottled water until the pipes are fully replaced by the year 2020. Another famous American case of poor water quality is the Hinkley groundwater contamination made public by Erin Brockovich in 1993.

Microbial fuel cells (MFC’s) and other bioelectrochemical systems (BES) have been used in cyclic voltammetry (3) experiments for biosensing purposes and many environmental applications such as wastewater treatment (4). Glass bioreactors and three-electrode systems have been widely used (5-7). For example, Yang et al. used a platinum wire counter electrode, a carbon cloth working electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference (5). Single- chambered bioelectrochemical cells have been used to study electric current production in the bacteria known as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 which have been utilized to create biosensors(6-7). Cost-effective and easy-assembly BES would allow for easier in- field and environmental testing of water contaminants to utilize these biosensors on a broader scale and be used in wastewater treatment.
A simpler and more economical design for single-chambered bioelectrochemical cells was created in order to test the electricity production of S. oneidensis MR-1 ΔmtrB. The Mtr pathway in S. oneidensis MR-1 is an external electron transport pathway that transfers electrons to an external acceptor such as an anode, generating electric current that is utilized in bioelectrochemical systems. The mtrB gene was removed to prevent electron flow to an outside source through this key protein. Different plasmids were then inserted into this strain with the mtrB gene under control of a promoter that activates transcription of the protein when induced by compounds such as pesticides and"

A mathematical model to determine the experimental design
The modeling was done in order to realize what parameters are crucial and which experiments need to be conducted to determine those.
We asked the following questions:
How much Precipitator protein will bind to the Plastic surface? How stable is the binding of the plastic binding tag to polystyrene depending on the size of the column? How much His-tagged protein will the Precipitator be able to bind? Which parameters do we have to determine? How often can one column be reused until the efficiency goes too low due to unbinding of the Precipitator protein from the plastic surface? How can we find out the affinity constants? We developed a Flow"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#HumanPractices#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," that the most important technology platforms to continue to look into and which may provide early benefits to the oil industry are microbial degradation/conversion systems and biosensor systems.
Figure 2: Through various break out sessions and conversation our iGEM team aided this workshop by provided information on how synthetic biology and our project could be applied in the oilsands.
What Did We Learn?
There is a need for synthetic biology technologies in the oil sands.  These technologies must be feasible and provided needed benefits to the oil sands. These benefits should include the increase in oil recovery, the reduction in toxic compound production, remediation of oil sands, production of biosolvents including biosurfactants, biofuels, etc. Biosensors like FRED and Bioreactors like OSCAR are trending new technologies which could benefit the oil sands.

We subsequently digested the PCR product with XhoI and BamHI and subcloned it into the pET28a vector ( Novagen ) multiple cloning site. The sequence of the RMF insert was verified by sequencing. In order to determine whether the construct is expressed correctly and in order to verify the physiological reaction of E. coli cells to expression of RMF, we electroporated pET28a-RMF into BL21 DE3 cells (which hold a T7 polymerase gene on their genome and are therefore able to express genes under the T7 promoter) and plated the cells on LB-agar plates supplemented with kanamycin and found growth strongly diminished upon plating cells on IPTG containing plates. In order to verify the termination of growth after induction of RMF expression in liquid culture, we grew cells holding the plasmid in shake flasks and found that growth terminates rapidly upon induction. We prepared ribosomes from induced cells and measured their sedimentation velocity. Induced cells contain two poulations of ribosomes, one with a sedimentation velocity of 70S (suggesting monomeric ribosomes) and the other with a sedimentation velocity of 100S (suggesting dimers). Analysis of the different fractions by negative-stain transmission electron microscopy confirmed that both fractions consist of ribosomes although both of them appear monomeric in the electron microscope (probably the interaction is very weak and breaks up upon adsorption onto the carbon grid; an image of dimeric ribosomes seen in the electron microscope after the sample was treated with substantial amounts of glutaraldehyde has been published previously (31)). The two populations of ribosomes are equally found in uninduced cells, which have progressed into the stationary phase of growth, while the 100S fraction is diminished in cells during log phase and absent in RMF-knockouts (31).

This week more funding applications went out for the TU Delft project. I hope to get some positive answers soon and round up the funding part. The lab is calling out for occupation. It was a long and exhausting week for me so i'm very happy the weekend is ahead of me.
Week 22
This week I focused on the funding. Mondag and Thuesday I worked on the funding application of the StuD Fund. It is now finished and send out for evaluation. Wednesday I  had again a meeting with Simon Goede. Thursday and Friday I worked on the sponsor application of the University Fund Delft.
Week 21
This week we gave a lecture to all the professors about our project to gain usefull input. I worked whole week on the sponsoring brochure in Indesign, but it is a lot more complicated then I thought. A friend of mine, industrial design student Stefan Heijboer, made the final logo on thursday evening.
Week 20
Sunday we finished the OSLI sponsor application with a lot of effort from the whole team! Thursday we had a meeting with Han de Winde, head of department of Biotechnology. It was a brief get-to-know meeting. I also had a meeting with Elly Muilman, head of finance of Biotechnology. She explained me how fund raising works and she had very useful input. Wednesday I sad down with a friend to make a quick draft for the logo.

Guining Lu
    Professor of School of Environment and Energy, South China University of                         Technology
        ""There are more metal mineral resources in the southwestern and southern                     China, in which the heavy metal pollution is also more serious. What we should pay attention to is that                     Cd, As, Pb, Hg, Cr are very common heavy metals pollution ions."" Professor Lu said, ""the most common                     heavy metal detection methods are Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and Atomic Emission Spectrometry                     (AES). Both of these methods can detect ppm (parts per million) levels of heavy metal ions. Though the                     detection accuracy is high, both of these two methods require quite expansive equipment which is unaffordable                     for individuals and some small factories. The detection price of heavy meatal in a single sample given                     by the third party is about 250 RMB and the results usually need to wait for a week to come out which                     costs too much time for a daily operation factory.""

    Professor, Advanced Engineer, Lawyer, at Law School of South China University                         of Technology & Research Center Director of Intellectual Property and Enterprise Development
        Professor Yang said,” Chinese law lacks the specific regulation about how                     to standardize the genetic engineering products and currently there is a regulation of genetic engineering                     safety playing a certain guiding role on the biological genetic engineering research, industrial production.”
        Genetic engineering safety regulation defines the scope                     of genetic engineering, including the recombinant DNA technology using carrier systems, and the use of                     physical or chemical methods to directly import heterologous DNA into organisms. However, cell fusion,                     protoplast fusion, traditional hybridization, mutagenesis, vitro fertilization, cell culture and embryo                     culture are not included.

The stock solutions can be stored at -20°C for further use. The peptone stock should be prepared from scratch every time, though. Sterile filter and add the stock solutions to autoclaved, still warm (not hot!) Knop medium agar, working on a laminar flow bench. The glucose solution can be prepared and autoclaved seperately, since sterile filtering it through syringes is no fun due to the amounts needed. Add the plamictic acid last or it will lead to precipitation. You can re-use the filter tip if you can handle it in a sterile way. Last, add the G418 antibiotic for a final concentration of 25 µg/ml. Pour agar into plates while still warm.
Cultivation of P. patens
The standard cultivation conditions for P. patens are 25°C ±1°C under a 16/8 h light/dark photoperiod with a lightintensity of 55 μmol/(m2*s).
In our lab, we cultivated P. patens in Erlenmeyer flasks equipped with a sterile filter in the lid made of aluminum foil. To provide sufficient CO2, we used compressed air which went through the sterile filter and through an attached Pasteur pipette into the liquid medium. The resulting bubbles helped to continuously stir the culture. The liquid cultures were regularly homogenized using a Ultra Turrax T25 device at 19 000 RPM and the culture was subsequently provided with fresh medium. We also experimented with liquid cultures in the incubator shaker as well as in unstirred medium and with cultivation on solid medium and on medium soaked felt, as well as some other surfaces. We tried to keep the temperature constant by air conditioning, but it was of course subject to some fluctuations. The appropriate light/dark photoperiods were produced by hooking striplights up to a time switch. The whole set-up can be seen on the pictures below and we have installed all this equipment specially for our iGEM project as the laboratory is usually used for protein biochmistry of therapeutic proteins.
After Transformation, the regenerating protoplasts were incubated in regeneration medium in 6-well-plates sealed with parafilm for 10 days and then cultivated on a layer of autoclaved cellophane (seperated with Whatman paper during autoclavation, so they dont stick together), on top of Knop medium agar plates for three days under standard conditions. Then we transferred the cellophane layers with the"

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Membrane_-_-_TEXT.html,": Schematic of a tripolar cuff electrode [9].
2. Tripolar treatment analysis
The tripolar cuff electrode is considered as a spatial filter with a 1/h periodic frequency response, where h is the distance between the poles. For the spatial frequencies inferior at 1/h, the filter is a bandpass filter with a gain of 2 and a bandwidth of -6 dB between 1/4h and 3/4h.
If we consider the larger “d” of the electrode poles (Cf. Figure 6), the impulse response associated with each of the poles of the electrode is then a gate function of width d and amplitude 1/d.
3. Electrode sizing
n order to increase neural information relative to the noise, it is vital to optimize the cuff dimensions. The literature suggests that the best compromise between cuff length and the available place is a cuff length close to the wavelength of the transmembrane action potential. This one is approximately linear with fiber diameter [10].
According to Struijk [11], the action potential propagation velocity can be approximated as 55.800 nodes/s and the duration, of the transmembrane action potential, is approximately 0,4 ms.
Thus, to have an optimal measurement, the cuff electrode must cover 22 nodes of Ranvier. The inter-pole distance must, therefore, be adjusted to h = 11 lmy (lmy is the length of myelin separating two nodes of Ranvier). So, for a typical fiber, the inter-electrode distance h should be about 1 cm, which is used in most ENG measuring electrodes.
Figure 7: Extra-neural potential of monopolar action according to the position of the measuring point. The diagram at the top left shows the simulated situation. At the top right, the simulation corresponding to this configuration is represented: calculation of twice five monopolar potentials, for a typical axon (diameter of 8.7 μm, and lmy= 1 mm). The distances from this axon to the measurement points are ρ1=100 μm for site A and ρ2=500 μm for site B. Below, the monopolar signals at points “a” to “e” are shown for each of the measurement sites [9].
Knowing the characteristics of the electrode we want, it is possible to evaluate the distance h between the poles. This distance is of the order of a hundred micrometers which is much lower than that of a classical tripole which is of the order of a centimeter. This is why we"

Bring Biological Modeling to the Next Level
Chain-Node Model (Figure. 1) is a brand new Complex Modeling Concept incorporating its detailed structure description with universal applicability. Instead of treating complex as a whole while ignoring their basic composition and structure, Chain-Node Model view complex as a construction of it basic Parts . Just as its name implies, our model includes two components: Chain and Node. As a correspondence to natural polymer chains, each Chain consists of an arrangement of its basic unit, Part, whose concept has been greatly extended and includes but not limited to Biobrick Parts. The Node component is not a natural correspondence but an abstract concept to describe binding states of two or more parts: each binding will create a Node. The abstract nodes may continue to bind with other parts or nodes to form a tree structure. However, parts or nodes in bound states are not allowed to bind again. With help of chains and nodes, it is possible to model any complex with arbitrary architecture. Simple and inaccurate modeling of biological process could not keep pace with the development of synthetic biology and undoubtedly, our Chain-Node model provides a possible solution to the imbalance.
Figure 1: Logo of Chain-Node Model
A simple example, tetR dimer, is shown to illustrate our simple modeling idea (做一个tetR2的模型放在右边做为配图，否则右边太空了). It has two chains with each containing only one part, tetR. Dimerization of tetR will create a node to indicate the bound state of two parts. To explain more clearly, bound parts are also considered as nodes so that in this example, all nodes are organized in a tree structure, which includes two children (leaf) nodes and one parent node. We will conform to this convention in our wiki.
To know more, users are suggested to read this One-Minute Introduction to have an intuitive idea and deeper understanding of our modeling system.
Modeling with Templates
Modeling manually of biological system is widely used for synthetic biology modeling but it requires an overall understanding of the biological network. It is difficult for even professionals to provide such large amount of data"

    Previous work shows that artificial MBP chain still kept the in vivo metal-binding ability comparable to dimeric, full-length MerR[8], while it comprises less amino acids and will cost less for large-scale expression. Since our ultimate goal is to design a high-performance and less energy-consuming bioabsorbent, the MBP will be an excellent candidate for the absorbent effector. MBP was then fused with DsbA, a periplasmic expression signal protein, and OmpA, a membrane protein, to construct periplasmic MBP and surface displayed MBP, in order to maximize the bacterial capability of mercury binding. Finally, mercury MBP was constitutively expressed on surface, periplasm and cytosol of E.coli cells via carefully designed genetic circuits, to guarantee the maximum of Hg absorption.
Figure 3. Scheme of MBP construction and the predicted MBP structure. (A) Linear structure of MerR coding region. (B) Construction of MBP. The MBP was constructed by fusing two copies of metal binding domain of MerR in tandem with a flexible SSG bridge. Blue bars indicate the dimerization helix in the metal binding domain of MerR, and gray bars indicate other α-helices of MerR. The red line indicates the SSG linker, and the blue and green lines indicate the loop after the dimerization loop and the region after the loop, respectively. Orange dots indicate cysteines involved in Hg(II) binding[8]. (C) Predicted structure of resulted metal binding peptide. Mercury ions are indicated as black balls in metal binding pockets.

    Hg (II) ions can enter the bacteria cell by diffusion through the outer membrane [9], however, the hydrophobic inner membrane prevents them from passing through the inner membrane. To guarantee the binding efficiency of our bioabsorbent, we also designed the facilitation module to assist the MBPs to chelate enough Hg (II). MerT is a transmembrane protein which can import Hg (II) ions from periplasm into cytosol with the help of MerP; while MerC can directly transport Hg (II) into cytosol [10]. Therefore, we constructed constitutively expressed mer"

Summary
Sharing and learning from each other is one of the most important features of the iGEM competition, in that any lack of experience could be well ameliorated by studying the projects and the way of presenting them of other and/or previous teams.
We here present you with a collection and praise of historic iGEM projects. Though these projects selected may not comprehensively include all the meritorious projects of each aspect, we managed to introduce you some representative projects from different perspective. And we hope this collection might help iGEMers with their projects and presentations.
5 Meritorious Projects: Modeling
The first amazing modeling project for you is from Peking 2010 team. As they were endeavoring in the development of a sensing circuit for heavy metals, the linear range should be broad enough to include a change of several magnitudes. Taking an informative Biological Network Reverse Engineering approach to guide the circuit design, they were finally able to enhance the function to a next level.
Peking 2010
Then it comes to the modeling work of British Columbia of 2011. They have presented an example for an extension of traditional modeling. The protein structure alignment and the docking of the small molecule gave them information on what residues were responsible for the synthesis of terpene and thus for the synthase’s modification.
Brithsh Columbia 2011
In order to model the core repressilator system, Edinburg 2010 inventively utilized a stochastic agent and rule-based language called Kappa. In Kappa, proteins, DNA, and RNA are represented as agents that can be used to hold state or interact with other agents. And with kappa, they are able to assimilate the oscillation of the population of bacteria and the level of proteins.
Edinburgh 2010
What to taste something more than traditional dynamic modeling? Paris Bettencourt 2010 showed us an outstanding example of kinetic modeling and it came along with a real-time video illustration for readers to directly understand what is going on with the diffusion process.

To engage with the public and promote our project, we decided to showcase it to our two schools (St Paul's RC Academy and Grove Academy). The presentation allowed the pupils to have some insight to the work behind our project and give them an idea of the research being done in the field of synthetic biology, inspiring them to think about the opportunities available in a science career. Our presentations received great feedback through a questionnaire we made, which let us know that we successfully taught the pupils something they hadn’t known about before. The questionnaire was composed of five questions and we handed out 20 of them to the students, teachers and advisors watching the presentation. Before the presentation 17 out of 20 wrote that they did not know what RNA interference was and how it could be used to treat bacterial infections. We then asked some questions with a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being the lowest score and five being the highest). The average score for the presentation was 4.2. We also asked how well informed the audience was after the presentation on the RNA intereference concept. The average score for this was 4.1. We also asked how easy the scientific part of the presentation was to understand (with 1 being easy and 5 being hard) and the average score for this was 2.4. Finally we asked if the presentation would be suitable to present in front of a general audience with varied levels of experience with science. 15 people out of 20 said it would be suitable. These results showed us that we successfully managed to create a presentation that was very effective at educating pupils the work we have been doing for iGEM."
TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"21. After growing in LB medium to an OD600 of ~1, the cells were washed and resuspended in the same volume of PBS. Aliquots of 100 µL were put in a 96 well plate.
The emission spectrum of each fluorophore was determined by exciting at a given wavelength and measuring the output intensity at a range of wavelengths. Due to thelimit bandwidth of the spectrometer, Because of this, the emission at a wavelength too close to the excitation could not be measured without measuring the excitation source directly. This can be seen in the figures, where the left half of the emission peaks could not be measured. Especially for mVenus, where the excitation and emission wavelengths are very close together.
Results and Discussion
Fluorophores expressed under strong constitutive promoter
As all fluorophores were expressed under the strong constitutive promoter J23100, they were expected to show a strong fluorescence without the need of induction. Figure 1 shows  that this was the case for GFP, mVenus and mCerulean. mKate, however, did not show any fluorescent activity and was therefore not used in the subsequent steps of the project.
Figure 1: Emission spectra of the fluorophores GFP, mVenus, mCerulean, and mKate expressed under strong promoter J23100. Excitation wavelength was 488 nm, 510 nm, 433 nm or 558 nm, respectively.
GFP expressed under constitutive promoters of different strengths.
Not only did we express GFP under the strong promoter J23100, but also under less strong promoters from weak to stronger J23113, J23117, J23105, and J23108 (increasing in strength).
Figure 2: Emission spectra of GFP expressed under control of promoters with different strengths. Excitation wavelength was 488 nm.
For comparison, the emission was normalized by dividing by OD600. All strains were measured in the same dilution, in order to make the results reproducible. The emission intensity is as expected, corresponding to the strength of the promoters. All fluorophore spectra were also recorded in a dilution more suited for their emission intensity and normalized to their maximal emission to the maximum intensity of each construct (Figure 3). From this figure we can conclude that all GFP biobricks function properly.

TU_Dresden,2017,Team:TU Dresden#Project#Peptidosomes_-_-_TEXT.html," used the two B. subtilis reporter strains: TMB4131 W168 lacA::erm Pveg-sfGFP and TMB3090 W168 sacA::cat Pveg-luxABCDE. The first strain constitutively expresses sfGFP, which we used to detect the presence of bacteria in the Peptidosomes by following the fluorescence signal. The latter strain expresses luciferase in a constitutive way, which makes a detection of a luminescence signal possible. Having both of these well-evaluated readouts at hand, we wanted to demonstrate their applicability, with bacteria encapsulated in Peptidosomes.  We performed a plate reader assay using the well-scan-mode. In this mode, the whole well is scanned to detect the exact position of a signal, either fluorescence or luminescence. Its absence is displayed in a map with a green color, while the position of the fluorescence/luminescence source appears as red. Please check out the according protocol for details.
In Figure 12 examples of the well scans of different samples are displayed.
Figure 12: Overview of well-scans of the Plate Reader Assay The results of the well-scan measurements for the detection of fluorescence and luminescence are shown. If no signal is detected, the field of the matrix is green, otherwise red.
The well scan maps appear completely green when fluorescence/luminescence signals are absent, i.e. in water and empty Peptidosomes. Wells containing a sample of the day culture and lyophilized eGFP dissolved in water show a red colour in the whole map. However, a localized red spot over a green background is observed when the source of fluorescence/luminescence is contained: the cells are trapped inside the Peptidosomes. This also shows, that Peptidosomes containing cells hinder the bacteria from diffusing and rather keeps them contained within the structure, demonstrated by the locally limited red signal. We were able to reproduce these results over a longer time period under shaking, highlighting the robustness of Peptidosomes.

Next, we used Fluorescence microscopy to analyse a B. subtilis strain encapsulated in Peptdiosomes, which constitutively expresses sfGFP (Figure 13). We could demonstrate, that the fluorescence signal was restricted to the Peptidosome - standing in"

The chitosan in itself or in combination other natural polymers is an ideal scaffold material to manufacture different types of hydrogels as salves, micro-, macroparticles, solid bandages and so on. Due to its wound healing effects and in combination with the medical benefits of a hydrogel it means an optimal wound healing dressing. Our hydrogels should be easy to load and therefore an ideal local slow-release drug-delivery vehicle for various therapeutic agents, pharmaceuticals, antimircobials or growth factors readily incorporated in situ to a treated tissue.

Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

iGEM is an international, scientific project, which teaches to future scientist how to be a real researcher. As you know it is not only doing experiments, it also requires awaring of ethical issues, social situation and needs of the public which you are in, safety of you,your colleages and your work. As the future scientists, METU iGEM 2014 team, we are all aware of these critical issues and while working we try to apply this on our project. When we are selecting our this year project’s subject we also based on this iGEM’s philosophy which believes making science is not just about doing experiment.  We focus on the one of the most impoortant problems in nature, degredation of plastic more specifically PET. Also when we are doing activies for human practice , we had only one goal on our mind, spread science to all people  and share our humble knowledge with everyone and have a little fun while doing these. -In our SynBio Survey our aim was determine the interest and knowledge of the students from our university about Syntetic Biology and Genetics. We had the chance to put 2 best answers to our wiki websites, but based on all answer we got from people we can say that there are still so much ignorance and misunderstanding about Genetics and Synthetic Biology. So, especially as future scientists we should try harder to inform people around us.  -We wanted to do something about  spreading scientific knowledge around us, we found the excellent way for that and organise a Synthetic Biology day! We knew that there are lots of people around us who wants to know more about Synthetic Biology. Our speakers was the people who focus especially on Synthetic Biology and most of them even personally take part in last years iGEM competitions. We as this years iGEM team and participants learned so much  valuable things in this conference. -We met with young iGEMers from METU Development Foundation Schools and tried to share our last years’ iGEM experiences with them and perform basic procedures to do iGEM projects. It was so inspiring to met with these future scientists and we are very glad if we can teach them even a little thing."

Cambridge’s project
In 2007, the University of Cambridge iGEM team worked in developing both intracellular and intercellular communication pathways as well as a Gram-positive platform for synthetic biology. We were particularly interested in the intracellular project. It consisted of a PoPS amplifier made with transcriptional activators and promoters that were obtained from bacteriophage components. The Cambridge team decided to use activators from bacteriophage components because they are not common in the cellular signals of bacteria. In this particular case, they used activator and promoters from the bacteriophage PSP3 and fR73.
(For more information about this project, you can consult their wiki )
After reading about these projects we decided that we could adapt our idea and build upon the achievements of those two previous teams. We wanted to contribute in a significant way, so we began by analyzing their results and identifying points that could use more work. We found that, in general, British Columbia’s proposal was complicated and apparently ineffective. The problem seemed to be in the “lock and key” mechanism, which didn’t seem to behave as expected. On the other hand, we found that their “jammers” could be very useful and they seemed to work as expected.
So we began to design a different genetic frame to create “intelligent biosensors”, one that preferably didn’t contain a “lock and key” mechanism. Our solution is composed by a combination of parts of the two previously mentioned projects. We incorporated the “jammer” mechanism in addition to PoPS amplification systems in order to create a flexible genetic construction for concentration sensitive bio-reporters. Our proposed solution can be seen in Figure 1 (click on it to enlarge):
Figure 1
In theory, this genetic construction is able to detect different concentrations of a compound provided that you have three different promoters that are sensitive to different concentrations of the substance. Based on the amount of compound detected, the bacteria will produce one of three reporter proteins. For our project, we decided to use the same sensors and reporter proteins that the University of British Columbia team used in their 2009 iGEM project. Therefore we began with 3 promoters: pBAD wild type, pBAD weak and pBAD strong; each promoter was able to detect arabinose at different concentrations. Our reporter proteins were GFP, YFP, and RFP (Cherry). We arranged the constructions so that GFP is produced when the cells were"

This is how generated sequence looks like compared with the first BLAST hits:
Figure 3. Generated sequence and top three BLAST hits alignment. Matching amino acids highlighted in red, synonymous - in yellow. Figure generated using ESPript 3.0 (Robert and Gouet, 2014).
This amount of similarity gives us confidence that generated protein could perform same function as proteins from the training set.
Conclusions
We have successfully built a novel Generative Adversarial Network for novel Protein generation and then showed that our ProteinGAN is capable of learning the rules and patterns of protein sequences without ever seeing one. To our surprise - the ProteinGAN generated sequences that were not only unique compared to the dataset the networks were trained with, but at the same time being similar to the members of the same enzyme class from public databases.
Therefore, we can confidently say that ProteinGAN is a fully functional neural network that has the proven potential of creating novel and useful synthetic biological parts.
Deeper look at ProteinGAN
Data preprocessing
In order to use collected data we had to transformed it in a way that is suitable for neural networks. That meant that letters representing amino acids had to be translated to numeric representation. As a result, each amino acid has been encoded into embedding vector of 8 physicochemical attributes (Kawashima, Ogata and Kanehisa, 1998). We opted for using embedding vector due to its memory efficiency in comparison to one-hot encoding technique. In one-hot encoding, the amino acid would be turned in the vector of length 20 with 19 zeros and single 1, whereas with embedding vector, we can use vector which is 2.5 times smaller (See"

We learned a lot about the biotech world ranging from       distinguished mentors and advisors to partners and investors. Having spent every day in the lab with these enthusiastic young synbio startups, many of whom were       previous iGEM team members, was very exciting and inspired us for own futures. Daily lab life  included a mixture of lab work, research and mentorship while the       startup teams worked in one lab. Shama even got to interview the teams and learn more about how their synthetic biology companies are going to change the world for       the better!
Timothy learnt a lot from BioCellection . Miranda and Jeanny ,       the founders, are both final year university students in the University of Pennsylvania and University of Toronto respectively. Miranda       took part in iGEM last year . BioCellection is working toward creating a by-catch free fish food made from yeast and algae . Their yeast eats plastic and produces all       the components required for good quality fish food. Their aim is to save the world oceans by preventing over fishing and getting rid of the ever accumulating plastic       waste pollution. This is an excellent example of how synthetic biology has the potential to help our planet and we were more than happy to help them out too!

When Donnchadh returned to Ireland after carrying out the outreach for our detector in Malawi,  he teamed up with Shama to organise the Summer Party and Demo Dinner that took place on the 12th of August.       This event was attended by the hundreds, viewed by thousands and took place in the historic Cork City Gaol .      The teams delivered amazing pitches to an audience that consisted of investors, mentors, academics, friends and family. Cork iGEM were instrumental in making this event a success.       We welcomed and registered the guests and talked about iGEM & synthetic biology to everyone who would listen - even Cork City’s Lord Mayor wasn’t an exception.       We watched how far these teams have progressed, admired their success and wish them the best in the future.

These internships unveiled the global synthetic biology community and how iGEM plays a foundational part in it. We spent the summer with people who shared the       same enthusiasm and understanding of synthetic biology, genetics and biotechnology. We learnt about what's involved in creating a biotech startup, inspiring       our own futures! Despite the challenge of"

For this purpose, we wanted to build a device composed by a polyamine-activated promoter (atoC) and a gene codifying for vioC, one of the 5 sub-units that form the full violacein complex that is visible at daylight. Our plan was to constitutively express the remaining 4 parts, so that as soon as the 5th was transcribed, the full complex would form and “immediately” start producing coloration. Since we were also somewhat short of time, we planned on doing a proof-of-concept using GFP with atoC, which would, at the same time, allow us to characterize the activity of the promoter. Yet again, we didn’t manage to build the atoC-GFP as the sequencing revealed some deletions in the sequence which inhabilitated the device.
Regarding the mentioned characterization of the atoC promoter, we were willing to perform gas HPLC analysis, however we did not have enough time since this was an extra service which we did not have included in our lab facilities.
One of the main reasons why our time was so limited was that the sequencing bar codes did not arrive until the last minute, and we not now for sure if our parts were completely right. So, in the last few weeks, we had to repeat some of the clonings that went wrong, which is why we could not finish some of them.
Despite that we did not manage to do all what we wanted, we are proud of what we have done. Even if biotechnology is not part of the core subjects of our career, (since our team is composed entirely by biomedical engineers) we have been able to design our project and receive the approval of many experienced researchers. We have learned all the protocols and procedures in a matter of days, but we have just lacked some more experience in the lab, which would have marked the difference between almost getting to a result and actually achieving it.

Now he is in the board of University of Georgia and a famous scholar in science and technology, the director of the center for systems biology research at the University of Georgia. In 2009 he was awarded as a ""Changjiang Scholar"", the chair professor at Jilin University. In 2012, he was recruited as a Jilin university professor in ""one thousand plan"". Professor Xu is a world-class expert in computational biologist, bioinformatics, cancer research and so on. He has made quite a few significant contributions in the field of bioinformatics, for example: (a) biological pathways and the calculation method of networks and model research (b) cancer of bioinformatics (c) comparative genome analysis (d) Protein structure prediction and modeling. The papers he published had more than 40 H-Index. He got the Distinguished Scholar of Georgia at 2003, and was selected as American Association for Advancement of Science Fellow.
In the lecture, professor Xu introduced their recent research progress. They investigated the transcriptomes of different tumor tissue and make big data analysis.  They made two major discoveries. One is that all the tumors went through the process of chronic inflammation, but not all of the chronic inflammation can lead to cancer; and the other is that the basis of tumor proliferation is Fenton reaction.
Finally, professor Xu suggested some useful suggestions to prevent cancers:
First: Stay away from meat, red meat have higher iron content, which is the main force of Fenton reaction;
Second: Stay away from alcohol, especially the person who would show red face after drinking, the body is telling you not to drink;
Third: Male should make regular blood donation to help prevent accumulation of iron in the body; women don't have to bother before menopause.

2. Your Local Rules and Regulations
Who is responsible for biological safety at your institution? (You might have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, an Office of Environmental Health and Safety, a single Biosafety Officer, or some other arrangement.) Have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns they raised, and any changes you made in your project based on your discussion.
Prof. Masanobu Ito is responsible for biological safety. We had a discussion and our plan was accepted, so we did not have to change it.
What are the biosafety guidelines of your institution? Please give a link to these guidelines, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.
