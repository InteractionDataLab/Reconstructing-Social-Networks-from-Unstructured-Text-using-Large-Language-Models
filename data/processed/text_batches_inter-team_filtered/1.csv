Interview with Dr. Levy
Dr. Levy is the director of the Center of Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance at Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts. He studies how Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic cells adapt to environmental signals and hazards. Currently, Dr. Levy is studying the efflux of the Tet Protein and Tetracycline use.
Dr. Levy thinks that the fight against antibiotic resistance should be multifaceted. Treatments to aid conventional antibiotics should be developed, as well as new antibiotics. From his knowledge, Dr. Levy thought that are proposed gened editing therapy was feasible and that ""young individuals should be able to try out new techniques"". As an afterthought, he mentioned that a easy way to fight antibiotic resistance is swap out your toothbrush multiple times a year, especially after sickness.
Takeaway: Our interview with Dr. Levy gave us confidence that our project could potentially be feasible. Dr. Levy was very encouraging and supportive of the scientific process. However, he gave us advice to do failure analysis on our solution. Often times, treatments improve in some areas over their predecessors and fall short in others.
Interview with Special Agent Mahlock
Scott Mahloch is a former member of the Navy turned FBI agent. After entering the FBI in 2008 and completing training, Mahloch was assigned to Milwaukee Division’s Kenosha Resident Agency, where he worked on a variety of cases. He currently is the Chicago Division’s Weapons of Mass Destruction Coordinator.
Special Agent (SA) Mahloch didn’t have to much to say in relation to antibiotic resistance or the specifics of our project. However, Mahloch did highlight the use of biological threats when it comes to weaponry. He emphasized the importance of being vigilant and aware of ones surroundings while working in a lab and reporting potentially suspicious activity. Mahloch helped us understand that the FBI was not a regulatory agency but is often the eyes to make sure that everything is working smoothly and safely.
Takeaway: There isn't much we can change about our project from Special Agent Mahloch's presentation. However, our team is more aware of the dangers of biology and how it can potentially be used for nefarious acts. If we see something we will definitely say something!

The Team
We are a French team from Grenoble, a well known city for skiing and nanotechnology. We are forming a joint team between biology students from Université Grenoble 1 (Joseph Fourier University)  and engineer students from Grenoble INP Phelma (Grenoble Institute of technology) that have taken some more specialized courses in biotechnology.
The team will be composed of 11 students that will work in 7 different laboratories (lab directors in parentheses):
2 microbiology laboratories (H. Geiselmann, I. Attree)
3 laboratories of biotechnology (F. Bruckert, O. Peyret, D. Peyrade)
1 Fundamental research laboratory  (R. Calemczuk,)
1 bioinformatics laboratory (H. de Jong).

I am Felix Ciceron and I am studying molecular and cellular biology at the University Joseph Fourier in Grenoble, France.  I would like to work in bioremediation, bio-detection of pollution, or enzymatic engineering.  All of these fields require both laboratory and project  skills.  I believe the iGEM competition is a tremendous way to get experience of working in a team, as it combines the spirit of"
Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#Team Members_-_-_TEXT.html," example to make a good theoretical model it is necessary to be aware of the approximate character of the experiment and to evaluate the collected data. According to him this combination of the theoretical and the experimental approach is impressively realized with the iGEM idea. He is grateful to be part of this year's team and to have a nice summer with the students.
Corinna Hiller
Corinna has finished her bachelor thesis about experimental and computer-associated search for p53 inhibiting agents with subsequent validation by crystallography at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) as a student of Molecular Biotechnology. As one of 30 other students she will start with the master of Molecular Biotechnology at the University of Heidelberg in October. The iGEM competition demonstrates a unique opportunity to organize a scientific project and to meet a young inspirational team of students.
Nao Iwamoto
Nao is a Master student of Cancer Biology at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). During his Bachelor's program in Theoretical Biophysics at the Humboldt University to Berlin he gained his strong enthusiasm towards Systems Biology. Before joining the iGEM team Heidelberg '09 he worked as a student research assistant in the lab of Dr. Ursula Klingmüller (Systems Biology of Signal Transduction) at the DKFZ. Being a member of the iGEM team Heidelberg '09 he is looking forward to contributing to the exciting project on the theoretical side and is glad to share a wonderful summer with the students.
Stephen Krämer
Stephen has just finished his 4th semester as a student of Molecular Biotechnology at the University of Heidelberg. He believes that biology can contribute to solutions to major challenges of the 21st century like the growing water and food shortage in many regions of the world. But in his opinion modern biology will only unfold its full potential if it will be based on a systematic foundation. This is the reason why he is fascinated by the ideas of Synthetic Biology.
Hannah Meyer
Hannah has just started her fifth semester as a student of Molecular Biotechnology. In her second semester she has started working in the Tucker group at the university of Heidelberg where she has worked in the field of neurogenesis and nerve development. After having learned new methods in wet lab work, she is looking forward to bringing in her experiences but also to organizing and setting up own scientific projects. She is very excited to work in a new field of biology and hopes to have a great summer with the other team members!

Fusion protein functionality testing: integration assay
Previous integration assay did not show any integration product on the gel. In this section, we will perform PCR amplication with primer sets that will specifically bind to integration product (primer will bind on the target DNA on one side, and to the adapter on the other side). Since this is the first time this type of experiment was carried out. Different variables were tested:
Two different reaction time were tested, namely 1 and 16 hours to see the effect of reaction duration on integration.
Some of the reaction were stopped with heat or SDS to release DNA from the protein. PCR clean up were carried out right after the integration to get rid of excess SDS before PCR.
For the rest of the reaction, PCR reaction was done directly after integration.
The PCR product was either directly run on the gel, or was first subjected to PCR clean up to get rid of small background DNA fragment before running it on the gel.
Second PCR was done to reamplify the first PCR product, in case very little product was visualised.
The components of the reagents can be found on the protocol. The sequence of the adapter used in this assay is shown on table 1.
Table 1: Primer sequence to be annealed for the adapter. Note that 5’ of the upper strand of the adapter has to be phosphorylated for successful integration.

learnsynbio
Our main outreach initiative is a series of Synthetic Biology learning modules which we call LearnSynBio.org.             After the success of our 2015 educational outreach, we wanted to switch gears and target our outreach efforts             to a demographic which has not received as much attention for educational outreach.
Most outreach seemed targeted either to young children, with the hopes of  introducing them to science in general,          or to the general population, with the hopes of sparking a discussion about the ethical concerns and societal          implications of synthetic biology. But we found comparatively little that reached out to high school students          who are on the cusp of deciding potential career paths in a way that introduced them to synthetic biology as an          actual scientific field. These students seemed like an ideal audience for our outreach efforts.
Since many of the core concepts within synthetic biology are fairly simple to understand with only limited background          knowledge, we set out to create educational materials targeted explicitly towards these high school students in order          to introduce them to the field of synthetic biology as a potential, and perhaps exciting, career option.
LearnSynBio consists of four modules of instructional videos and supplemental materials (worksheets) which are meant          to introduce high school students with basic biology and math background to the ideas in Synthetic Biology. LearnSynBio          is organized into four modules: an Introduction to Basic Biology Concepts, an Introduction to Experimental Techniques          used in Synthetic Biology, an Introduction to Genetic Circuit Theory and Mathematical Modeling, and a module on the          Ethics and Implications of Synthetic Biology.
In order to develop our materials effectively, we spoke with our former high school biology teachers to ask them what          features they would like to see present in LearnSynBio in order to best facilitate its incorporation into the classroom.          They emphasized the relatively short, discrete nature of the videos (preferring several videos in a module to one long          video), and really emphasized the importance of supplemental materials like worksheets which reinforce and complement          the material presented in the videos, and we incorporated these suggestions into the design of Learn"

Methods: Restriction digest
Protocol: RD1.1
Experiment done by: Maria, LC
Notes: /
Results:
A single band is seen on the gel, which means that the multiple bands in the miniprep gel were only because of supercoiling.
Analysis: Sample 2 and 3 got pooled and frozen, 1 and 4 were discarded, since their length didn't seem exactly right.

What is the problem?
Plasmid segragational instability has been the limit step for large-scale protein production and bioremediation. Antibiotics for plasmid retention is not practical in this situation.
High copy number (HCN) plasmids are lost from population at a high rate due to the large metabolic burden and lack of nature factors for plasmid maintenance.
Our P-SLACKiller
IDEA
Equip the bacteria with a plasmid-sensing logically adjustable cell killer (P-SLACKiller), and we need to select a signal which can indicate the intracellular plasmid numbers. Here we give a definition, when the bacteria containing few plasmids consume lots of nutrition but don’t work efficiently, we called them slackers. There is a basic rule: when the plasmid numbers are above a threshold, we regard the bacterium as normally-working and the P-SLACKiller won't start; however, when the plasmid numbers are below the threshold, we judge it as a slacker and the P-SLACKiller will kill these slackers, so that we can achieve the goal of increasing the plasmid maintenance. In the end, in order to kill the slackers and thus control the plasmid numbers, we selected the inhibitor protein as the signal molecular and the in-promoter repressed by inhibitor as a switch to start the killer gene.
PART DESIGN
The basic circuit is shown in Fig.1.
Fig.1 The basic circuit of P-SLACKiller.
We use the constitutive promoter to express the inhibitor protein, thus the intracellular inhibitor concentration is positively correlated with the plasmid numbers. So the inhibitor can be used as a signal indicating the plasmid numbers. The inhibitor can repress the in-promoter and control the expression of downstream killer gene. When the inhibitor concentration reduces to a threshold, the downstream killer gene will express. To avoid the unexpected leak out of killer gene caused by the constitutive promoter, we designed the gene circuit with the constitutive promoter and the in-promoter transcribing along different directions like Fig.1.
The genetic locus of functional gene can be substituted on the basis of production demand in the future.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki"

This is just the summer diary. During the academic course we all have spent much time working hard looking for money, organizing the team, giving talks in high-schools, writing in our synthetic biology blog, etc.
Week 1
First week here in the dry lab! We are going to make our work in the physics lab, where we have some computers to work with. Moreover we plan to have weekly meetings to check the state of the project. This first week I have started a simple implementation of the spatial simulation of the bacterial biestable. I have spend much time searching for information about  many parameters that we want to have present, as ribosome number in a bacterium or translation and transcription rates. The information is not always accurate and depends a lot on the source, but finally we have taken the decision of taking data mainly from CyberCell Database. After this, I have implemented a first version of the simulation and experimented several things with NetLogo.
Week 2
I carry on programming day and night. NetLogo is a good tool because it is easy but there are many things that could be written in other way.
Week 3
This week I have almost finished the final version of the simulation. I have spent a lot of time debugging thousand and thousand of little mistakes in the source code but it seems to be finished. I have just to implement the temperature effect and the IPTG effect and it will be finished, but now I am a bit more experienced with NetLogo it will not take me so long. (I think).
Week 4
I have been trying to represent the RNA strings as real string which can bend like ropes, but it makes the simulation unnecessary complex. So soon I discarded this idea and finished the simulation. Now it is ready to run. Let"

Both the expression of CheZ and intracellular concentration increases with increase of transport rate. The bacteria will produce more CheZ and therefore higher level of directed movement. The CheZ response curve shows that the transport rate can be used to tune the CheZ response, as the threshold intracellular concentration of theophylline required to trigger the CheZ response increases with transport rate.

Crust Protein Genes Organization
The gene cgeA is located in the cgeABCDE cluster and is expressed from its own promoter PcgeA. The cluster cotVWXYZ contains the gene cotZ which is cotranscribed with cotY and expressed from the promoter PcotYZ. Another promoter of this cluster, PcotV, is responsible for the transcription of the other three genes (Fig. 2). Those three promoters were evaluated with the lux reporter genes ( pSBBs3C-luxABCDE ) to analyze their strength and the time point of their activation (see data ).
Fig. 2: Gene clusters of cotZ and cgeA
Based on this data, two of the three promoters could be used for expression of spore crust fusion proteins.

Semi-stable transfection of the receptors in human cells
For the first trials of testing our constructs in human cells, we chose the MEXi™ cell line for semi-stable transfection.  MEXi™ is a suspension HEK293E cell line by iba lifesciences that encodes the viral protein EBNA1 in it's genome. EBNA1, being a protein derived from Eppstein-Barr-Virus that mediates the viruses' replication initiation, gene regulation and maintenance of its DNA in the host cell. The second part of the MEXi™ system is made up by the pDSG-IBA vector that carries the specific origin of replication that is recognized by EBNA1. EBNA1 binds to this origin, and recruits the replication apparatus as well as inducing the maintenance of the inserted DNA in the host's nucleus, leading to the episomal maintenance and co-replication of the plasmid during every division cycle. [14]
Thus, we cloned our receptor constructs into the pDSG-iGEM vector and then transfected the MEXi cells using the PEI transfection method (see methods). Polyethylene imin (PEI) as a cationic polymer forms complexes with the negatively charged DNA. These complexes are taken up by the cell via endocytosis and carried to the nucleus. [15]
Fig.6 pDSG-Iba plasmids where used for semi-stable transfection of HEK293E respectively MEXi™ cells.
An everlasting bond: creating  a stable cell line
Fig.7
Printing tissues - or even only parts of organs - requires billions and bilions of cells. An average liver, for example, weighs about three pounds and hosts ~108 cells per gram tissue. [16] [17] Since transiently and even semi-stably transfected cells do not propagate the transfected DNA indefinitely, repeated transfection of cells would be unwise due to the high consumption of time and ressources. Therefore, we created three stable cell lines that chromosomally encode the respective receptor constructs. For this purpose we used the FlpIn™-System by invitrogen. The three compound system consists of HEK-TRex™-293 cells that harbour one chromosomal Flp recombination"

Another thing that supports the graph is that the sum of the Induced Scaffold Sites and the Empty Scaffold sites is comparable with the dark blue graph (Binding Sites for Scaffold). The decrease of the dark blue graph means that there are bonds formed between the Scaffold and the Binding Partner.
Figure 1: Graph of the amount of molecule(s) (sites) over time
In Figure 2 we can see how many complexes are formed. With the programs provided by NFsim, we could extract the total amount of molecules and the average complex size. They also provided us with a method to determine the amount of single molecules (they call it complexes with size one) and we used that to determine the amount of formed complexes and the average complex size, where the single molecules are not taken into account. Just as we mentioned as comment for the first figure, the initial values of Complexes and Average Complex size >1 start at zero, but is not visible in the figure due to the logarithmic scale.

Simulation for Potsdam
The team from Potsdam has a project with some similarities with our own project. This leaded to collaboration on different fields of the iGEM competition, including modelling. As there was not much known about their system, a model would help with getting more insights and a better understanding. The main problem was that they did not know much about the aggregation principle, so we had to make some assumptions and test different approximations, and see how well they fit with the wet-lab results.
Approximations
The first approximation was the concentration of their protein in the yeast cells. They found a rough estimation of a range, which was 0.1 - 1.4 μM. We therefore set the initial concentration to be 0.5 μM, which lies somewhere in between. For the association rate, we took the same as we used for our own simulation, namely 105 M-1s-1 as found in the paper of Schlosshauer [2]. The known information of the system includes the molecular weight of the protein, being 60.4 kDa and the droplet size, with an average diameter of 1.19 μm. The weight of a single molecule can be used to approximate the volume of a single molecule with Protein Volume = 1.21 Molecular Weight [3].  This leads us to a volume of 73.084 Å3 per molecule.

It appears that the Gibson for Nox has also worked. I restreaked two colonies. Additionally, I've set up and run a colony PCR on the two streaked colonies from PR+Blh and the 2 colonies from Nox. Both sets are being run with the verification primers at 62 degrees Celcius with an elongation time of a minute for 30 cycles. This will determine whether the two Gibson have truly worked.
I have gel purified the iLOV Backbone from the gel. I have attached a figure of it post-purification with the gel-purification kit, followed by an additional purification with the PCR-purification kit. These is an abnorammyl large protein spike (alhtough this seems ot have become the norm, for whatever reason. I don't think it will have a major negative effect on the Gibson, since the Gibson guide says to not run a Gibson with > 20% of unpurified product, which would seem to suggest that some spurious proteins/enzyme are acceptable (and this is purified, in theory).

St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#switch_-_-_TEXT.html,"-1 functions to protect the body against non-host cells by integrating itself into the phospholipid bilayer of prokaryotic bacteria, destabilizing the membrane and causing pore formation (Lam, 2006).  These pores inhibit the cell’s ability to control transmembrane ion and water movement, resulting in cell death via either osmosis or cytosol loss.
The idea behind our kill switch would be to induce bacteria to produce AMPs intracellularly, and allow these peptides to integrate into the membrane.  As the concentration of AMPs builds, pores will form in the membrane, inevitably leading to cell death.
Antimicrobial peptides are highly conserved within evolution and can be found throughout all classes of life.  This is in part due to the fact that mutating to resist AMPs is near impossible.  These proteins attack bacterial membranes, meaning that multiple chance non-detrimental mutations across multiple genes controlling phospholipid bilayer structure would be required in order to resist AMP interactions.  The chances of these mutations occurring within a single replication are astronomically small.  This means that the use of protegrin-1 as the functional aspect of our kill switch will never lead to the creation of an AMP-resistant strain of E. coli.
Concerns were raised about the effectiveness of intracellular AMP production.  In nature, protegrin-1 attacks bacterial membranes from the outside by burrowing a hole into the outer leaf of the phospholipid bilayer.  We were unsure of protegrin-1's ability to perform this action from the inside of the cell; specifically, whether or not it would interact with the inner sheet of phospholipids.  Little research has been conducted on intracellular AMP production, so with no directly available answer, we decided to explore for ourselves.  All the material we found provided no strong evidence that there was much structural difference between the two layers of prokaryotic membrane.  Both layers have a mixture of zwitterionic and acidic phospholipids, the latter of which contain a negative charge that facilitates the electrostatic interactions between the AMP and the bilayer.  Eukaryotes have almost no acidic phospholipids on their outer layer, and imbedded in between the lipids is cholesterol, which increases the stability of the phospholipids and impedes hydrophobic AMP interaction (in conjunction, these two traits provide the protection that stop AMPs from attacking host cells).   So, as long as there are a sufficient concentration of acidic phospholipids to facilitate the interaction, the AMPs should"

Binding of these sites by Mg2+ results in compaction of the regulatory region of the riboswitch, which in its unbound state acts as an anti-terminator. Loss of this anti-terminator activity results in the activity of a downstream terminator (included in this sequence) which terminates transcription of the gene.

Figure 6: Animated graphic showing consecutive off and on photoswitching of Dronpa. Each frame of the video corresponds to 286 ms. Off switching of dronpa was achieved by illumination with 488 nm in 2.5 min. Follow-up switching on by illumination with 405 nm yielded immediate recovery of ground state fluorescence.
Figure 7: Overlay pictures of Dronpa fluorescence and brightfield channel. The scale bar (left picture) corresponds to a size of 3 µm. From left to right: Dronpa before illumination, Dronpa after 1 min 488 nm illumination, Dronpa after 2 min (total) 488 nm illumination, Dronpa after 0.3 sec (follow up) 405 nm illumination.
In addition to the Dronpa photoswitching at the microscope we also illuminated cells expressing Dronpa or NLS-dronpa directly in a 96 well plate. For this setup (Figure 8 and figure 9) we used 50W halogen lamp powered with 16V and 4.8A as source for white light and used a monochromator to single out a specific wavelength.
Figure 8: Schematic of the setup we used to illuminate Dronpa expressing cells directly in a 96 well plate.
Figure 9: Photograph of our Dronpa illumination setup for 96 well plates.
With the monochromator set to 488 nm one Dronpa and one NLS-Dronpa expressing sample were illuminated for 10 min. Afterwards Dronpa fluorescence of the illuminated samples, non illuminated samples grown in the same batch and wild type cells were measured in a Tecan plate reader (Figure 10). Unfortunately, we could not detect any effect on the Dronpa fluorescence using our own illumination setup. Probably, the intensity of the light source was not high enough to activate photoswitching.

This workshop consisted of a historical insight into the history of GMO provided by our very own historian, as well as a hefty, kind-hearted debate, supervised by our own philosopher.
All of these considerations, debates, and results led our philosopher Lene to write a longer guidebook entailing an overview of the various bioethical arguments often made for and against the use of synthetic biology. The guidebook is mainly an insight into the most important ethical considerations made by our team, e.g. how they shaped our product, but it also offers a personal and clear overview of arguments and principles meant to help future teams to get a conversation on ethics started!
Make sure to give this guidebook a read, it is definitely worth it!
Integrated Practices
- An Implementation of the Future
“The best way to predict your future, is to create it”
Abraham Lincoln - (former) president of the United States of America
Not that we can claim to be anything like Abraham Lincoln, or even to be vampire hunters. Nonetheless, we do agree that to create the future we all hope for, we must contribute to find a sustainable solution for a greener future. Before we can tackle the task of providing a sustainable future for the entire world, we must first look to our own local environment. We believe that the best way to gain a better understanding of a global dilemma, is to examine how a local environment is affected by it. Hopefully, this approach will help future iGEM teams find a connection between global issues and local ones. This approach has helped us elucidate specific issues and find sustainable solutions, which can be implemented into our society with the help and endorsement of local agents.
A Statement from the Mayor of Odense
We first decided to reach out to the mayor of Odense, to investigate the possibilities for iGEM to help in the government's endeavours to make Odense a CO2 neutral city.
“We face a series of challenges that we have to recognise, in the chase of the good and sustainable life in the city of Odense. Some of these concern local circumstances, while others contain national and even global issues. We as the municipality can only go so far on our own. So, we are entirely dependent on the help of local agents. It makes me so happy, when the students of the city, have taken on the mantle of developing new green technologies that solves global issues, while contributing to local city growth”

Extremely big thanks goes to Monika Kairevičiūtė for drawing beautiful icons for our wiki page.
Webdesign
The Vilnius iGEM website was coded and designed by team member Danielius Dvareckas. After coding website he explained to other team members how to use this code and make additional content changes. To wiki design also contributed other team members by suggesting wiki tweaks.
Graphic elements used on index page four boxes (just below the slider) and judging form were drawn by Monika Kairevičiūtė. Diagrams in descriptions were drawn by team member Ieva Savickytė. Icons used in footer were taken and re-designed to match wiki design from free stock icons website. All drawing and stock icons were retouched by Danielius Dvareckas using open source vector software Inkscape.

jQuery (v1.11.3) is a powerful JavaScript extension library.
History.js was used to ensure compatibility with HTML4 browsers, that do not support history.pushState().
Slimbox 2 (v2.05) was used as a picture viewer. The code had to be adapted to work with the wiki and bxSlider. TU-Munich (2013) had already solved this issue, so modified slimbox 2 version by TU-Munich (2013) was used.
bxSlider (v4.1.1) is a JavaScript library which allowed to add slider on wiki front page.

Recombinant out of the laboratory is regulated by the rules and might be in danger if spread outside of the laboratory. In this presentation we used E. coli as recombinant organism.  However, if it is out of the laboratory, there is a risk that would change the ecosystem of the environment.（Because of geraniol）
Integrating the investigated issues into the design of our project(Flavorator).
We concluded as follows.( In addition to the above) As a countermeasure, we replaces the bacteria and the medium directly. As method, we will replace boxes included of E. coli and medium. The container of the recombinant E. coli could be completely separated from the food by double filter system. In the future, we will use the other bacteria. There are two ways. First, such bacteria could be used, which causes no problem even if eaten by humans（(Etc: Lactobacillus, Bacillus subtilis var. natto) If you choose Lactobacillus. Lactobacillus is not only good for intestine to digest foods, but also Lactobacillus can synthetize geraniol. In overseas, there is also a culture of drinking perfume to control body odor. The body odor changes by geraniol is great. However, we do experiments in model organisms. And, there is a need to make sure there is no expression of harmful genes. Second, We use bacteria that do'nt need to put a nutrient source. We use the photosynthetic bacteria. Since it can live in inorganic environment, there is no need to provide nutrients. The use of photosynthetic bacteria, which was isolated from the food, could be used in Flavorator."

(Step 4) Of the successful amino acid/antibiotic cassettes, Jacob and I transformed genes ""4"", ""7"", ""12"" (Tet resistant) and ""M3"" (Amp resistant)- names of the genes to follow - into EPI300, DH5a, and BL21 all with the recombineering plasmid pIJ790. The ones that sparked during electroporation are: 4 (EPI300), 4 (DH5a), 7 (BL21), and M3 (BL21). Quite a mix, but the addition of DMSO and MgCl2 to boost PCR efficiency increased the salt concentration of the solution and may have caused sparking. Gene 4 had both compounds added and 7 had DMSO (unsure about M3 - that was Mehul). Only 1 uL of PCR product was used to transform cells to reduce chances of sparking, which may have helped.

Designed primers for constitutively expressed GFP, RFP, and YFP to be put in the PCC1FOS vector. This is to allow us to see consortia dynamics by a standard curve of fluorescence. An EcoRI site was added just before the start of the promoter, and a BamHI site was added to the 5' end of the reverse complement. The melting temperature was normalized to about 59°C, and the primers were checked for any secondary structure.
There were no colonies on the plates transformed with any putative biobricks, so the procedure was attempted again.

T6SS in Serratia secretes Ssp1 and Ssp2 which is an antibacterial toxin which kills closely related cells and has peptidoglycan endopeptidase activity, degrading peptidoglycan in the membrane of the target cell.
Ssp1 and Ssp2 from S .marcescens were cloned onto multiple cloning sites on the C-terminal of the receptor binding domain of truncated colicins Ia and E9, resulting in modified col Ia-ssp2, col E9-ssp1 and col E9-ssp2. These were fused with a HA-tag then cloned into pBAD18 vector with pBAD promoter of the araBAD operon. pBAD can be repressed with glucose and induced with arabinose. The modified colicins were ligated with pBAD18 and grown on LB plates with kanamycin resistance and 0.5% glucose, to repress expression of the toxin while it is taken up by cells.
pcol Ia-ssp2 fusion in pBAD: pcol Ia-ssp2 fusion was amplified with a HA tag for detection by western blot and cloned into a pBAD18 vector with an inducible pBAD promoter so that expression of the toxin can be controlled.
Western blots were carried out to determine if our fusion proteins were being expressed:
Detection of Ha-tagged pcol Ia-ssp2: Single colonies of pcol Ia-MCS and pcol Ia-ssp2 2:1 and 3:1 were grown overnight in 5ml LB with 0.5% glucose at 37°C. 250μl of cells were then grown in 25ml of LB at 37°C until they reached an OD of 0.5A. They were then represssed with 0.2% glucose and induced with 0.2% arabinose and 0.5% arabinose and incubated at 37°C for 5 hours. 1ml sample of each was taken, pelleted, then 100μl of laemmli sample buffer and B-mercaptoethanol was added to each and they were boiled for 10 mins. 5μl of pre-induced and induced samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) transferred to membrane and probed with HA-antibody.

Abstract
Welcome to Scotland’s first ever high school iGEM team! For our project, we have assigned our special agent spiRNA on a mission to target Vibrio cholerae and Shigella flexneri - two waterborne bacteria that cause the diseases Cholera and Shigellosis, often proving fatal in developing countries. To achieve this, we’ve created a fusion protein which will allow our spiRNA to hitch a ride out of E. coli. Our agent will sneak its way into the target pathogen and complete its mission by preventing the pathogen from causing an infection.
We’re targeting Cholera and Shigella specifically because they are both a major cause of fatalities in developing countries, due to treatments not being readily available or affordable. Therefore, we aim for our spiRNA to be a cheaper, more effective and more accessible alternative to current treatments; in other words, for it to FIGHT BACTERIAL INFECTIONS!"

Compared with the control, it is seemingly that the BL21 with RibB gene part can product more riboflavin (riboflavin solution looks yellow), seeing Fig 4.
Fig 4 From left to right, respectively, the solution is BL21 control, BL21 with K1755005, BL21 with K1755006, BL21 with K1755009.
Use spectrophotometer to measure the concentration of bacteria and riboflavin at different time. The consequence of the experiment can be seen in Fig 5.
Figure5-A
 
Fig 5-A Bacteria concentration of  K1755005, K1755006, K1755009 bacterial strains vary with time.
Concentration of the microbial strains of  K1755005, K1755006, K1755009 bacterial strains basically don't have difference at the same point in time, and the corresponding statistical analysis also showed that there are no significant differences between the three parts(the results are shown in Table 2). It shows that when bacterial strains are linked with K1755005, K1755006 or K1755009, the influence to the viability of the bacteria is very limited and can even ignore it. That's why the concentration of the microbial strains is basically the same with the different processing at the same time. In the following research we can directly compare the concentration of riboflavin to analyze the ability of riboflavin synthesis in different bacterial strains.
Figure5-B
 
Fig 5-B Riboflavin concentration of  K1755005, K1755006, K1755009 bacterial strains vary with time.
The bacterial strain linked with RibB has a better performance of producing riboflavin and the promoting ability from strong to weak can be easily seen as following: K1755005, K1755009 and K1755006. Moreover, the distinction between K1755009 and K1755006 isn't obvious. The construction of these three parts are familiar and the the statistical analysis also showed that when the bacterial strain linked different parts, the ability of producing riboflavin is totally different with the original BL21 (The analysis result is shown in table 2), which proved that K1755005, K1755009 and K1755006 have all accomplished as we anticipated.

Histamine-Tar fused with GFP marker:
To prove the correct localization of the Tar-Histamine,           GFP was fused to its C-terminus with a short linker sequence (E0040) .           The results of these tests as seen in figure 4, prove our assumption           of correct localizations.

As we demonstrated, Rosetta provides us with the means to           redesign a chemoreceptor to bind new ligands. In the           future this ability can be used in the same manner to           design dozens of new receptors. The critical step of the           design process remains the lab work required to clone and          test the variants, this step can be optimized by using a high           throughput chemotaxis assay. Aside from this, any receptor designed           can be further improved by introducing a directed evolution step to           improve its specificity towards the new ligand.
In addition, we wrote a “How to use” Rosetta guide in cooperation with the Rosetta developers and          iGEM TU Eindhoven team, and built a framework software tool to allow fellow researchers the ability to redesign a binding site easily.

To showcase the power of this application in a way the public would engage with we tried to come up with a strategy to improve the activity of PETase to make the enzyme efficient enough for operative PET-biodegradation. The gene encoding PETase would be mutated randomly via the D.I.V.E.R.T. method and then screened for enzyme activity on a PET-film as substrate. Then, the best mutants would be chosen for another round of mutation. This cycle could be repeated until no more significant improvement would be detected. Since D.I.V.E.R.T. is intended to work rather fast, the screening method for finding the best PETase mutant should be very time-efficient as well. This imposes several additional problems, but we managed to gather enough information to come up with solutions for all the foreseeable challenges.
Step 1 - D.I.V.E.R.T.
For the purpose of using D.I.V.E.R.T. it may be beneficial to employ Escherichia coli as chassis for the improvement of PETase. In order to apply selection pressure to the E. coli growing on the PET-film, they need to be able to utilize the product of PETase as carbon source. This way, in an otherwise carbon-deprived culture medium, the mutants expressing the best PETase should also be the fastest growers. This creates a situation where the fittest species will also make up the biggest portion of the population. However, PETase is secreted into the medium in order to degrade the plastic film ultimately causing less efficient mutants to benefit from more efficient mutants in their proximity drastically decreasing up screening stringency. However, as long as some form of selection pressure is upheld, the D.I.V.E.R.T. method should yield improved mutants.
PETase hydrolyzes PET into its monomer MHET (mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate). MHET is then degraded into TPA (terephthalic acid) and ethylene glycol by the enzyme MHETase. E. coli is most likely not able to utilize MHET as carbon source, however, some mutant strains of E. coli are able to to grow on media containing ethylene glycol as their sole carbon source.1
The E. coli strain may have to be modified further, to be able to effectively grow on and degrade the PET-film. E. coli can be made “sticky” to hydrophobic surfaces by having them display an adhesive catecholamine moiety on their cell surface. These proteins are inspired by muss"

Newcastle's School of Computing Science Integrative Bioinformatics Research Group has developed a software system for grid computing applications in the scientific field, called Microbase .  The Microbase project is a grid-based system that uses web-service-based technologies to integrate distributed components and ensure that they interoperate.[3] Funded by the BBSRC and the DTI, Microbase has been used in Microbial Genome Comparison and Analysis.[1] Microbase works by splitting a task into a number of 'Jobs' and managing how these Jobs are run on grid-based systems.[2]
Keith Flanagan, a Researcher at Newcastle University and member of the Microbase Project, suggested that Microbase could aid us in the development of a distributed version of our bacterial population simulation. Using Microbase meant that almost all of the programming concerned with the smooth running of our modelling was simple to carry out, and we were easily able to convert our single machine program to a distributed one.
Using Microbase we are running our simulation on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, a service provided by the e-commerce company Amazon.com, which gives users access to a large number of powerful machines. The development of Microbase for use on Amazon's web services has been a part of the Microbase project to provide further processing capacity.[4] Prior to running our simulations using Amazon's computers, we tested our program using some of the machines in some of the University's computer clusters.
Code
Advice about the code for our population simulation model is available on request. Please the model requires specific libraries, database setup and Microbase setup, etc to build and run correctly. Please email Morgan Taschuk , one of our advisors, and visit the Microbase homepage for more information.
The Java source code for our model is available here:

Results
This is an example graph created using some of the output from a small run of the population model, with a maximum of 27 cells of bacteria.
The results from various runs of our population simulation have been fed back into the development of other parts of our project, namely tuning sporulation. We have used the outputs to more closely determine how much of the population we can allow to become non-germinating metal sequestering spores.

Alongside the actual simulation we are developing an application to visualise the output of our simulation in a three dimensional environment.

Our boolean constructions are two, the AND & OR, for it to form a system, but how we will connect this two operations? With the nanotubes that Bacillus subtilis form.
Why B. subtilis?
We found a paper in which Ben-Yehuda et. al. demostrated that Bacillus subtilis form nanotubes between them, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. And they were able to get through a GFP and some other smaller molecules. So, we decided to use this connection to form the principles of a molecular computer. How? The output of the first operation will the input for the next one, and that was what we did. Also, there is not many work in the B. subtilis at the iGEM competition, so we decided to standardize the protocols of competent cells and transformation, and to send biobricks that B. subtilis could transform and integrate for them to work correctly (new standard protocol) .

BIT-China,2017,Team:BIT-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," sensitivity of △sst2 strain to α factor will be increased. Meanwhile the larger antibacterial circle will appear when the amount of α factor is reduced.
(3)The far1 of △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2 is knocked out successfully, and this strain will still keep growing under the effects acted by α factor and antibacterial circle will not be shown either.
Conclusion： Because far1 can make cellular period stop at the G1 stage by  α factor and sst2 can reduce the intensity of the transmitted signal. So we want to knock out of  far1 and  sst2.From the above results we can see that in the α factor concentration range, the strain will be inhibited by  α factor. With the increase of the concentration of the alpha factor,the radius of Antibacterial circle increases and the inhibitory effect of the growth of the strain was enhanced. And more obvious. Knocking out of  the sst2 gene, making the strain respond to α factor enhanced.
The growth curve
The impacts acted by the various concentration of α factor to the growth of the bacteria immersed into liquid.
The research of the impacts acted by various concentration of α factor to the growth of Cen.PK2-1C,  △sst2 of CEN.PK2-1C.
The plan and method
The gowth of engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains were determined by measuring the initial rates of α factor at concentrations of 0-15 µM . We take out 5ml cultivating bacteria liquid of each of them during  30h and correct them by the YPD solution which not inoculates yeasts after  shake culture. We obtain the value of OD600 at position of wavelength of  600nm by UV-Vis spectrophotometer.
The results and discuss
(1)With the increasing  concentration of α factor, the growth curve of CEN.PK2-1C is inhibited by α factor.
(2)the growth curve of △sst2  is bit lower than CEN.PK2-1C. It’s strongly inhibited by α factor.
Conclusion：From the above results we can see that in the α factor concentration range, the strain will be inhibited by  α factor. With the increase of the concentration of the alpha factor, the inhibitory effect of the growth of the strain was enhanced. And more obvious. Knocking down the sst2 gene, making the strain respond to α factor enhanced.

Q15: Where you get the date for modeling?
A: We obtain the most data from the experimental results. To some date cannot from the experiments, we adjust these data from the latest literature to make the models more consistent with the experimental results.
Q16：Can we change the promoters to prevent the problem of basal expression?
A: Those promoters could be replaced by other promoters. The aim of our project is to provide a new solution for logic lock in microorganisms; all biobricks in our system are able to be changed if the architecture is intact.

Q4: The desirable design for eliminating bacterial spill is to immediately knockout the construct                             containing GM gene without the delay of recombinase or endonuclease expression. Thus, one question                             raised would be ‘When and in which scenario should time delay be used?’ if time delay is not                             used in the accidental release of GM bacteria.
Time delay can be useful in laboratory experiments where GM bacteria should not last for so long                             time. This does not require modification of bacteria having genetic code dependent on some nutrients                             to survive nor require the activation of toxin killing GM organism in the culture. Thus, safer                             extraction of proteins (both secreted and non-secreted) can be achieved with no contamination                             of toxic compounds. Additionally, we would not need to worry about any changes in the organism’s                             genomic content..

FUTURE SUGGESTIONS
Suggest for an alternative way of resolving the leakiness of promoters,pluxR
We suggest that expressing our construct in gram-positive bacteria may avoid leaky expression                                 due to an auto-activation of pluxR. Gram-positive bacterium has SAM molecules that are conserved                                 in both gram-positive and gram-negative species. However, gram-positive bacteria do not use                                 the same communication pathway. It employs two component systems called oligopeptide auto-inducers,                                "

in vivo selection of functional mutants from a large library of variants using a “survival of the weakest” strategy;
in vitro characterization of affinity and specificity of mutants with MITOMI;
in vivo characterization of selected mutants using reporter plasmids.
Our data can be found here : Data .
Our project can be decomposed into four main parts:
In vivo TF selection system
As the first step in our pipeline we propose a new in vivo method for the automated selection of mutant transcription factors or transcription factor binding sites from large and diverse libraries containing millions of variants. The novelty of our approach lies in the fact that we use negative selection, or “survival of the weakest” as the selection strategy. In our method, a functional variant activates lysis of the host, leading to release of the plasmid DNA coding for the functional variant. The plasmid DNA can then be amplified, transformed, or directly sequenced to determine which variants were functional. We believe that our negative selection scheme is a potentially powerful approach when coupled to next-generation sequencing. Using a proof-of-concept version of the system , consisting of a T7 driven lysis cassette we were able to show that:
Cells can be specifically lysed upon induction of the lysis cassette.
DNA can be recovered from the lysed cells.
We get an enrichment of plasmids originating from lysed cells in a mock selection experiment.
In vitro TF characterization
We used a microfluidic based approach for characterizing TF mutants in vitro. The MITOMI method allows us to measure absolute binding affinities and specificities of transcription factors. We determined the precise binding energy landscape of the wild type TetR transcription factor. We also generated several TetR transcription factor mutants and determined the specificities of a number of the new variants.

Abstract
The expressed purpose of this model is to take the data obtained through experiment and simulate the actions of saccharomyces cerevisiae at different voltages. The yeasts, in SC complete media, were electroporated at various voltage to induce calcium ion intake through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels.[1] As yeasts have no sarcoplasmic reticulum, calcium will be imported largely from outside the cell. by following precedents set by the Reuter-Stevens (RS) and the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) models, the total charge in calcium imported into the cell during the period of electric stimulation was derived from the current-voltage relationship. The concentration of calcium taken into the cell was derived from the total charge imported, and used to determine the output of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). the model consists of two major parts: the calculation of calcium intake and the determination of transcription/translation levels induced by calcium. These results fit the data presented in the notebook.
Figure 0. A mathematical model of voltage-gated calcium-controlled transcription and expression in S. cerevisiae. Note: Degradation constants not shown.
Like the Valencia team in 2009, we utilized the stochastic approach through the analysis of gating through probabilistic variables. In fact, the stochastic model they utilized is not entirely accurate; recent literature suggests that the f2 inactivation gate does not play a role in yeast voltage-gated inactivation as much as in mammalian systems. By far, the largest improvement upon the mathematical modeling done by Valencia exists as that of the gene-to-protein modeling. Using the control system depicted in this model, we are able to predict the expression, and therefore, the luminescence of the yeast. The next step in advancing this prediction would be to fine-tune the control"

BNU_China for BIT_China
Click here to see BNU-CHINA's description of our collaborations.
○ Modeling
BNU-China mainly helps us to establish a model of substance changes during the pH regulation stage. Specifically, they build a model to link six chemical reaction processes together, all of which are controlled by switch in pH. With change in pH, main chemical reactions will change subsequently. We provided them the conditions and equations of each chemical reaction stage, and they are responsible for the realization of the equations and the whole regulation process.
The difficulty we BIT-China meet is how to connect the six groups of chemical reactions together with the switch in pH, how to identify the reaction time and the results of each chemical reaction, and how to draw an image to reflect the pH variation as function of time. Because some members of BNU-China are majoring in physics, math, computer science and chemistry, they have much experience in differential equations, application of MATLAB and designing computer programs. With these resources, they have helped us solve our problems successfully.
The description of variables are written as followed:

SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Policy&Practices#Survey_-_-_TEXT.html," As the time went by, the public awareness is improved. This makes people reduce the use of antibiotic consciously when it is unnecessary.
Question 3, The antibiotics that you contact in daily life including?
A. Floxacin (42.68%)
B. Penicillins (81.53%)
C. Cephalosporins (64.33%)
D. Tetracyclines Antibiotics (26.11%)
E. Macrolide Antibiotics (23.57%)
This shows that Penicillins and Cephalosporins are still the mainstream antibiotics on the market. It is not difficult to find that Macrolide Antibiotics becomes more and more popular at the same time. Especially, the most bacterium resistance works for Penicillins, which makes macrolid antibiotics expect to take place of penicillins. In other words, it is necessary and hopeful for us to produce a new macrolide antibiotic, using Synthetic Biology.
Question 4 to 6, Investigate the public attitude toward antibiotics.
Will you ask doctor to add antibiotics if you catch a cold?
A. Yes. I will if the drug is not effective.
B. I will be sure to follow doctor's orders.
C. I prefer to buy cold medicine by myself.
D. I will buy antibiotics by myself.
What will you do if you have to take antibiotics?
A. If the drug doesn't take effect, I will increase dosage with the permission.
B. I won't take medicine any more.
C. I will take medicine when I remember.
D. I will be sure to follow doctor's orders.
What will you do if the doctor give you some antibiotics used for long time?
A. Ask doctor to give me other antibiotic of new generation.
B. I will be sure to follow doctor's orders.
C. Have no sense in it.
As people have a deeper understanding of ABR, the usage of antibiotics becomes more the norm.
The rest of questions mainly investigates that how many solutions do public know to decrease antibacterial resistance and will they be willing to accept a now antibiotic.
Different from above, many people do not know how to decrease antibacterial resistance effectively.
What do you think about exploiting a new antibiotic using Synthetic Biology?
A. The first time must take the sufficient quantity of antibiotic.
B. Avoid using a same antibiotic for a period of time or using the same antibiotic for many times.
C. Mix different antibiotics for one time.
D. Transform the existing antibiotics.
E. Screen the new and effective antibiotics.
What really got everybody aflutter"
JNFLS_China,2016,Team:JNFLS China#Experiments and Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the concentration of the microRNA is below this theoretical value, predictable low florescence intensity would occur because of the low concentration of microRNA's incapability of covering the amount of the repressor's production. In another word, retroactivity would occur in our experiment. When the promoter strength of the repressor gradually decreases, the ""detectable minimum value"" will decrease as well. This means the detectable range will increase. For microRNA with the same concentration, a combination with low promoter strength will output a relatively higher "" Δ Florescence Intensity max"" which perfectly fit our observation result.
To choose the most favorable repressor for Device 2.0, as the figure 9 present, Lacl-Plac genetic circuit provides a distinguishable data under different promoter strength. This means when the promoter strength is settled, for different microRNA’s concentration, there will be a great possibility for Lacl-Plac to produce very distinguishable data that could be applied to real detection and experiment. On the other hand, for the NOT gate circuit constructed by TetR-Ptet, it didn’t express a very distinguishable difference of Δ Florescence Intensity max when under the conditions with a clear difference in promoter strength. Still, we cannot say that the TetR-Ptet is not a favorable element for the construction of Device 2.0. Possible reason is that the system reached to the ‘detectable minimum value’ in advance due to the weak binding affinity of the repressors to the DNA. Therefore, maximum promoter strength will produce a high Δ value. In this case, the device is favorable to work under a condition of a low concentration of microRNA. Moreover, we think theoretically should exist a genetic circuit which repressor has strong binding affinity to the DNA and favors the condition with a high concentration of microRNA.
4 In summary
Our expectations were fulfilled with these well-constructed genetic circuits. And by adjusting the concentration of microRNA (Device 1.0) and the promoter strength of the repressor protein (Device 2.0), we have illustrated that our devices are capable for producing a Laddering Response to the different microRNA’s concentration and our devices are possible for further more practical applications.
Even though so far our devices have been proved to be ‘well-functional’, we don’t regard them as the ultimate system. A big obstacle about ""the window period"" still lies between our system and more practical applications. This means our system has a certain period for data collecting and a huge disadvantage in real practices. Limited by the iGEM’s schedule, we cannot make any further development for now"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

Variations
A digestion over night is possible. If you digest over night use only 0.1 µL restriction enzyme.
It is also possible to use PCR product as insert. Digest after PCR with corresponding restriction enzymes and clean up with PCR clean-up kit . This could lead to higher yields of insert DNA because a lot of DNA gets lost during the gel electrophoresis clean up.
Sometimes some BioBricks are hard to assemble. Then you have to clean up the vector by gel electrophoresis as well.

As is shown in Fig.1, 2, 3, and 4, in ""Stable State"", before poured into the soil, we culture the bacteria fertilizer in the medium with IPTG. Promoter 1 is a weak constitutive promoter, so lacI is transcribed and translated at a considerate low level. High concentration of IPTG, which inactivates LacI by changing its conformation, could turn on promoter 2. Then, CI can be highly expressed to repress promoter3. At this stage, mazF expression could be inhibited.
Once poured into soil, the bacteria are no longer exposed to that level of IPTG. As a result, LacI with a stabilizing tag takes time to accumulate to the repression threshold of promoter 2. When lacI concentration exceeds the threshold, promoter 2, as well as the expression of cI, get repressed. Time needed to finish this progress is referred to as ""memory time"". Before lacI reaching the threshold, E. coli takes its own responsibility to deliver Mo. After that, suicide would be triggered.
As shown in Table 1, all the biobricks in the design are from the top 10 most used parts of iGEM to guarantee the feasibility.
Table 1 Biobricks used in the design
In the future, we plan to model the “memory time” and do more wet-experiments to confirm its feasibility. As for the modeling, we will test the expression level of promoter 1, the minimal stand of LacI to repress promoter 2 and the degradation speed of LacI. On the other hand, we will test the background expression of CI after removing IPTG to check if the CI concentration is low enough to open the promoter 3. Then we will strive to make this system more effective.

One starts practicing in details with the goal to play the whole at the end of the day. During this process one realizes that there is too much information for the brain to deal with. My approach to this complexity is defining points in the piece that act as triggers. Those triggers are memorized until I know them by heart and am able to play them perfectly correct. In between those triggers many unconscious processes happen at the same time. You can imagine this process as proceeding on a ladder, trigger after trigger.
What we learned from this interview
For Mr. Veress as a teacher complexity in his occupational field arises from the accumulation of many tasks, all of them of simple nature. Additionally he as a teacher is a psychic entity interacting with his students also being psychic entities. Humans as thinking creatures are often non-predictable. This is where he sees complexity emerging, thinking creatures being part of a variable organizational structure. Asked of a universal principle to deal with complexity he suggested to reduce complexity to simple circumstances. In his leisure time he deals with the famous body-mind problem. There we have on one hand scientific facts about the brain and its development and the communication within complex processes delivered by neurobiology. On the other hand we have the subjective way of describing processes occurring in our mind. The latter leads to a description in the first form singular where we have the means of language to describe processes of the mind. For him there exists a gap between the science of neurobiology and the subjective way of describing phenomena of our minds.

Escherichia Coli Case Studies
What is the timeline of an outbreak?
In order to implement the biosensor correctly, it is imperative to find data about how E.coli outbreaks progressed. Last year, there was on outbreak of E.coli O104:H4 in Germany. It was first detected in early May of 2011, by causing an increased amount of patient who presented hemolytic uremic syndrome (Rohde). As the E.coli outbreak continued to spread, traces of E.coli were present in different foods. According to Dr. Rohde in the Open-Source Genomic Analysis of Shiga-Toxin-Producing E.coli O104:H4 case study, the genomic experiments began with how the E.coli phenotype was determined (Rohde). It wasn’t until five days after the first detection of the E.coli did lab work begin (Rohde). Although this case study reference is a food E.coli outbreak, it continued to grow in size as more food was found to be contaminated. This scenario is similar to a water based E.coli outbreak because typically in larger outbreaks it will affect more than one geographic area. Using this timeline as an example, between the first detection of the outbreak to the E.coli phenotype being determined, it was a period of three weeks.
According to research, detection of the pathogen took a very small amount of time compared to determining the phenotype of the pathogen (Rohde). At this point in time there would have been many sick patients and potentially deaths depending on the severity of the outbreak. With our biosensor, this time could be dramatically reduced. Our biosensor could detect ideally any pathogen of interest. In a hypothetical situation, a potential timeline would be that the water would be tested the day a potential contamination would occur. This contamination could come from heavy rain, flooding, development of a new community, natural disaster, etc. Within minutes of the test being initiated, a path"
ShanghaitechChina,2016,Team:ShanghaitechChina#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," field experts again, they were pretty impressed by our soon improvements. As they commented, our new system demonstrated huge potential in massive industrial application. For the next step, they suggested us to work more on the efficiency. Since the electron transfer operated as key step in our system, we then tried to cultivate the biofilm on some small beads, increasing the contact area to achieve a better efficiency. Also, with the application of these small beads, the NRs attached on the biofilm were more easily to be collected and recycled, simply by spinning down the beads.
Brief Time Line
1. Social investigation on background as well as brief counseling with field experts.
2. Finalization of the topic we plan to work on, the energy issue.
3. Further talks with field experts.
4. The application of biofilm.
5. Public Questionnaire.
6. Interviews with people from different aspects.
7. The application of the co-culture system.
8. Further social talks and connections.
9. The application of biofilm coated beads.
Further Intergration & Real-time Interaction
To bridge the gap between academic research and the industrial application as well as further develop our project in the real social context, our team raised a social investigation with regards of the global energy issue as early as we started the project. By doing so, our team kept a real-time interaction with the society, promoting our project to be applied into real use to yield social benefits. This social research generally consisted of two main parts, the public questionnaire and field interviews.
Through the public questioner, we were able to hear from the public attitudes with regards of the energy issue. Also, mainstream concerns were addressed and critical comments were learnt. You can click here to learn more about the analysis on the questionnaire.
Meanwhile, in response to the strong necessity to get connected with the industrial, the academics, and the authority, so as to better promote and prepare for the real industrialization, a series of interviews from various aspects were carried out. Our interviewees included scientists exploring in energy field, industrial representatives dedicating to the energy conservation, as well as administrative officers from the relevant governmental departments. Some of the representative interviews were displayed on the page.
To sum up, it is the real time social interactions with various aspects guiding us to gradually improve the project adjusting the system to be closer and closer to the real industrialization. This is just the true essence lying behind the Human Practice.

CMV Promoter
Introduction
CMV (Cytomegalovirus) promoter is a constitutive mammalian promoter.
For this promoter's characterization we assembled it with GFP reporter ( BBa_K648013 ) and hGH polyA terminator ( BBa_K404108 ). The Pcmv-GFP was then transfected into HEK293FT cells and in vivo green fluorescence signal was observed under confocal microscope. The positive control was pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) that contains CMV promoter and EGFP reporter. The negative control was the same as the experimental construct, but minus the promoter. The detailed protocols employed for our characterization work can be accessed via the link.
Characterization Procedure
1. Build:
-       CMV promoter characterization construct: CMV promoter – Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) – hGH polyadenylation sequence (hGH pA) - pSB1C3 (BBa_K1119006 – BBa_K648013 – BBa_K404108 – pSB1C3)
-       Negative control construct: GFP – hGH pA - pSB1C3 (BBa_K648013 – BBa_K404108 – pSB1C3)
2.    Culture HEK293FT cell line (see below)
3.    Transfect CMV promoter characterization (CMV – GFP – hGH pA – pSB1C3), negative control (GFP – hGH pA – pSB1C3) and positive control (pEGFP-N1) plasmids in HEK293FT cell line. *We cloned CMV promoter out from pEGFP-N1 (Addgene) that contains CMV promoter and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). We used this plasmid as our positive control"

This is a complete VirA/G signaling system without a reporter gene, so any gene of interest can be assembled to a vir promoter. We assembled some sensitivity tuners and a luciferase gene behind this BioBrick, so we get an enhanced luciferase signal (e.g. in part <partinfo>K389421</partinfo>).
tightly controlled lac operator, <partinfo>K389050</partinfo>: <partinfo>K389050 SpecifiedComponents</partinfo>
composite
A lac operator is combined with a lacIq so there is always enough lacI to repress the lac operator. The system is still inducible with IPTG but it has a low basal transcription (in theory). This part should be used to test the sensitivity of the luciferase BioBrick <partinfo>K389004</partinfo> and compare it to the sensitivity of the mRFP BioBrick <partinfo>E1010</partinfo>. But the part did not work as expected - it had a very high basal expression. The problem is probably the lacI gene <partinfo>C0012</partinfo> from the registry which has a degradation tag. Either this tag leads to that quick degradation, that the lacI repressor cannot work as a repressor anymore or the repressor itself does not work properly.

The part <partinfo>K389050</partinfo> is combined with a luciferase gene as reporter. But <partinfo>K389050</partinfo> does not work as expected so this part could not be used for its original purpose (demonstrating the sensitivity of the firefly luciferase).

SYSU-Software,2017,Team:SYSU-Software#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," to stimulate one's inspiration in synbio work design, we tried the following explorations: The tree of words, and network analysis.
The tree of words: When you first enter the search engine of S-Din, you could search any word you like, or try selecting a word to explore more! When clicking, You will see the subordinated words. After few repeats, you will finally get the projects that you want. This function is designed to help specify your need, and help you understand your idea better.
Network analysis: This function is designed to help you find out potential relationships between two parts, projects or keywords. Sometimes the recommendation may be hard to understand, but perhaps it would open a new direction and lots of inspiration for you.
To learn more about these functions, check Gold Integrated page  for details.
Project Assessment
Safety assessment
We examined all parts in our database, and no part is from chassis of Risk Group 3/4. The ""Unknown"" parts are examined again with DSMZ Database . They are safe enough.
Figure 16: Risk group distribution of parts in S-Din's database.
We checked the parts again to judge if it has ""Red Flag"" tag. Only 26 parts are tagged. Since we are dedicated to providing an open platform for synthetic biology, the users won’t be limited if they search for ‘Red Flag’ parts; However, users will be warned and advised not to do so once they attempt to design new circuits with ‘Red Flag’ parts.
Figure 17: Red Flag part distribution in S-Din's database.
More safety details on Safty page.
Societal effect assessment
Once we had ideas of S-Din, we interviewed professionals or scholars in different fields and searched related policies. We had a better awareness of our project in the context of scientific inspiration, societal attention, safety and security, and legal considerations.( Silver page)
When S-Din was finished, we introduced it to the professionals. With their advice and help, we wrote a product statement combined with four parts: Terms of use, Bio-safety Alerts, Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy.
See statements page for more details.
Public promotion
When S-Din started to take shape, we promoted it to several iGEM teams and biology laboratories. They were interested in our software and tried out, then we were glad to receive their encouraging user feedback:

In other droplets, where the Trigger RNA binds to the Toehold Switch with weaker affinity, there are also less catalytic biomolecules and Product Nucleotides produced. Finally, the droplets in which the Trigger RNA does not bind to the Toehold Switch, there are no biomolecules or product nucleotides produced.
After the Amplification and Sequencing steps, from each unique sequenced single molecule we can receive the information about the Toehold Switch and Trigger RNA sequence pairs, and also the information about how that regulatory pair interacted. In this case the interaction stands for how strongly the specific Trigger RNA bound to the Toehold Switch.
For our proof of concept, we have chosen multiple Toehold Switches which were already described in literature. We have first prepared a small library of different combinations of Toehold Switches and Trigger RNAs. Then, we measured those interactions using standard, low-throughput methods. Lastly, we have used CAT-Seq to determine those cross-interactions in high-throughput.
In this way, CAT-Seq can be applied to conveniently record the activities of large number of regulatory parts and at the same time assess their cross-interactions."

Methods
Molecular Biology Methods
Isolation of Plasmid DNA from E. coli (miniprep)
Plasmid DNA from E. coli was isolated from overnight cultures using the DNA extraction mini-prep kit (Qiagen). The principle of this method is alkaline lysis of bacterial cells followed by a selective immobilization of the plasmid DNA on a column, subsequent washing steps to remove impurities and the elution of plasmid DNA.
Determination of DNA Concentration
DNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). The concentration was calculated after determination of DNA specific absorbance at 260 nm. Furthermore, the ratio of sample absorbance at 260 and 280 nm as well as at 260 and 230 nm were measured to specify the purity of the samples. A ratio of 260/280 of ~1.8 is generally accepted as “pure” for DNA. If the ratio is appreciably lower, it may indicate contamination with proteins. The 260/230 nm ratio indicates contamination with thiocyanates and phenolate ions since these absorb at 230 nm. The value is expected to be in the range of 1.8-2.2 in case DNA is relatively pure.
Agarose Gel-Electrophoresis
Agarose gel-electrophoresis was used to separate double-stranded DNA fragments by length. Ethidium bromide was applied as a nucleic acid stain (Sambrook et al., 1989). This method was used for the restriction analysis of plasmids (analytical gel-electrophoresis) as well as for the isolation of DNA fragments (preparative gel-electrophoresis). After preparative gel-electrophoresis, the bands were cut out and purified using a Qiagen Gel extraction kit.

BGU_Israel,2018,Team:BGU Israel#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," knocked down, leading to a decrease in cytokine secretion. We also expect to see a lower expression of cytokines in the -LPS wells (columns 7-12) when compared to the same treatments with LPS (columns 1-6), since non-activated microglia should secrete a negligible number of cytokines.
Results:
Figures 5-6 - ELISA for TNFα expression in knockdown IKK (shIKK) microglia BV2 cells. LPS activated BV2 microglia with and without IKKb knockdown (shIKK) showed reduction in TNFα expression in microglia cells treated with shIKK compared to -shIKK (spinfection, transfection reagent).
The +shIKK +LPS samples expressed lower TNFa protein than the -shIKK +LPS samples. Additionally,
the -LPS samples expressed TNFa protein in levels lower than the standard curve and therefore are not presented in this graph. Each sample with LPS expressed more TNFa than the same sample without LPS.
Discussion:
All of the results agreed with our expectations. There is a clear reduction of TNFa between the +LPS +shIKK samples when compared to the -shIKK +LPS samples. This indicates that the shIKK vector successfully induced knockdown to the IKKβ gene. In addition, the fact that the TNFa protein levels in the absence of induction by LPS were below the standard curve, indicates that our microglia activation process is indeed successful.
Experimental Weaknesses:
Must preform more repetitions to statistically prove our results.
Experimental Strengths:
Very reliable results since we are measuring protein levels.
ELISA is a very sensitive assay

Macquarie_Australia,2016,Team:Macquarie Australia#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," emissions. To generate hydrogen within E. coli we are building on the work of previous Macquarie iGEM teams.
Rural Vulnerability
More than one-quarter of the world’s population live in remote areas that lack access to grid electricity. As a result of this they rely heavily on local diesel generating systems to meet their electricity demands. This reliance is paralleled with a variety of challenges including; time delays, higher prices, supply problems and increased vulnerability to outages.
Team Macquarie’s conceptual design, [The Living Battery] will provide individuals living in remote areas of Australia with a portable, renewable and low cost energy source. The H2 gas produced by “The Living Battery” can be used in fuel cells to power generators to meet the daily electricity demands of the community.
Our Contribution
Currently, the high price of photovoltaic cells, and the low efficiency of solar to hydrogen systems are delaying the transition from fossil fuels to a clean energy source [5]. The H2 bio-chamber we are developing at Macquarie may hold the answers to this problem. Our hydrogen-producing, conceptual design could be used within rural communities; supplementing or even replacing traditional fossil fuels. An important part of this project is determining if our system will be embraced by our target market. A few of our team members ventured to outlying communities to talk to business owners and farmers. We discussed our technology and the concerns they had with adopting our technology. Based off their feedback we revised our [The Living Battery] prototype so that it incorporated kill switches for safety and a sealed culture tank with an import valve to reduce the risk of tank contamination.

Chlorophyll Biosynthesis Pathway
Figure. 1 Chlorophyll Biosynthesis Pathway
Chlorophyll plays an essential role in the photosynthetic pathway as it has the ability to absorb and transfer energy from light [6]. Chlorophyll molecules are embedded in thylakoid membranes within chloroplasts. Chlorophyll absorbs energy from incoming photons and uses resonance energy transfer to excite the p680 reaction centre of Photosystem II.
Chlorophyll a synthesis (Fig. 1) can be significantly increased in E. coli by eliminating the heme production pathway.  We have achieved this by knocking out the hemH gene (encodes for Ferrochelatase), using CRISPR/Cas9 approach. Ferrochelatase utilises Protoporphyrin IX to make heme in the heme synthesis pathway (Fig. 2). Therefore, by making this enzyme dysfunctional, we can redirect all cellular Pro"
