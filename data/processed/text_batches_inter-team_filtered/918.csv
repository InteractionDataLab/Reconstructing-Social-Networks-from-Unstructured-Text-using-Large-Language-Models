Design Principle of RNA Aptamer Probe
The Spinach aptamer, along with its structural characteristics and photophysics are well-characterized. According to the crystal structures of Spinach and iSpinach-D5, the Spinach aptamer generally consists of two arms, P1 and P2, surrounding a G-quadruplex containing docking site of its fluorogen, DFHBI. While the docking site is indispensable for the formation of the Spinach-DFHBI complex, the lengths of the arms have shown to be less important by previous mutagenic studies to shorten the arms. In particular, the P1 arm length has a dramatic effect on the fluorescence level, which the single-base deletion can lead to complete loss of fluorescence in E. coli.
By adding a 11-bp arm to each side of the P1-truncated Spinach aptamer, which its sequence is complementary to a specific sequence of RNA, it can become a split light-up RNA aptamer with a modulable sequence design targeting influenza RNA. It works by having a misfolded / unfolded conformation of the Spinach aptamer on its own, but changing to a correctly folded conformation of the Spinach aptamer when hybridized to the influenza RNA. (Fig. Right)
In silico Design of RNA Aptamer Probe
As there are no known algorithms for predicting the binding of RNA to DFHBI and the resulting fluorescence level. According to previous data, shortening of the P2 arm did not have significant change in the fluorescence level of the Spinach aptamer. Based on these data, we have made 2 assumptions in our design: (1) The formation of the docking site is dependent on the correct folding of the P1 arm. (2) The P1 arm folding is optimized when the hybridization of the variable regions is the most favorable. Based on these two assumptions, we utilized the Invitrogen BLOCK-iT siRNA Designer, which can find the region of RNA with the least amount of secondary structures, as well as human genome BLAST.

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Project#LOV_-_-_TEXT.html," via a fast track cloning strategy using CPEC. Employing the same method, constructs were generated that do not contain the LOV domain. Both, controls that should be able to conduct the splicing reaction and controls that contain mutated intein residues at the splicing side preventing the splicing reaction were produced. Subsequently the C - terminal SspDnaX containing the LOV domain and the N-terminal construct were cloned in bisctronic expression backbone using standard biobrick cloning.
Measurement of reconstituted fluorescent protein
We transformed all constructs in BL21(DE3) to allow expression under the T7 promoter. 5ml cultures were inoculated with 500 µl of an overnight culture and induced with 1mM as soon as the cultures reached the OD600 of 0.8. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C for further 1-2 hours. Subsequently, the cultures were left on room temperature as it is described in the paper that originally describes the S11 inteins [11]. Simultaneously all cultures were portioned and distributed on a 24 well plate and either illuminated with blue light of 470 nm for 30 min to 12 hours or kept in the dark for the same period of time. All samples were irradiated to either allow the conformational change of the LOV domain or prove the invulnerability against phototoxicity. The fluorescence was measured with the FACS using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission spectra of 497 to 522 nm for sfGFP and excitation wavelength 561 nm with an emission spectra of 602 to 662 nm for mRFP. The samples were diluted 1:1000 and every FACS run analyzed 100000 events. To validate our results we conducted several assays with a series of biological replicates following the same experimental layout. For the Western Blot, cells were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 8000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 4 °C. After collecting all samples of each time point, the pellet was re-suspended in 50 µl Laemmli-Buffer and heated at 95°C for 10 minutes. The samples were once again centrifuged and 2 µl of the supernatant was diluted with 10 µl Lämmli-Buffer. 6µl of each dilution was loaded on the SDS-PAGE, either stained via Coomassie solution or visualized in the Western Blot.

③If the sgRNA designed perfectly hit another sites, the penalty Sph = 25;if perfectly hit more than or equal to 4 loci, the total score Sguide is 0.
Steps:
(1) Firstly, find out the number of off – target sequence Nfg, if Nfg = 0, output Sspe= r1*100; Otherwise, detect the third condition. If there is a sgRNA designed perfectly hit another site, regard the number of it as Nph, and then the score of the first step: S1 = Sph * Nph (Nph is 4 or less). When S1 is equal to or less than 75, perform step (2), otherwise the output Sguide = 0;
If there is no sgRAN designed perfectly hit other sites, the score of the first step S1 = 0. This illustrates that there is no nucleotide which are matched between sgRNA and the place missed. Then perform step(2).
(2) When performing step (2), remove the Nph which is perfectly hit first. For Nfg-Nph which does not perfectly hit, please combine the weight ratio which obtained in the literature: M=[ 0, 0, 0.014, 0, 0, 0.395, 0.317, 0, 0.389, 0.079, 0.445, 0.508, 0.613, 0.851, 0.732, 0.828, 0.615, 0.804, 0.685, 0.583];[4] Using the formula:

The Precautionary Principle’s complexity warrants a more detailed account and discussion, which are both found in the Parts & Procedures chapter, on the safety page.
Studies on the Precautionary Principle
The problem with precaution and risk is that one never seems to have a certain knowledge about the outcome of an event. On everyday basis it does not seem to be a big issue: “maybe I will get wet if I leave the umbrella at home”. But when it comes to the decisions we have to make as a society then it is a different story: e.g. what will the consequences be if one was to allow more use of pesticides? When the consequences can not be known for certain then there is room for potentially big catastrophes - maybe all our water supply will be contaminated, which could lead to hormonal imbalances or something worse and unforeseen.
When considering the options, one should ask at least three questions: “What possible outcomes could the action have? How good (or bad) are these different outcomes? At what likelihood would these different outcomes occur?” The problem is that especially the last question possesses unknown factors. What we, as a society, seem to lack is a way of rationally deciding which action to take when factors are unknown. One also needs to be able to distinguish between which possible risks are important to take under consideration and which are not. It is not rational to take all possible risks under equal consideration - there seems to be some possible risks that are so unlikely that one should not take them too seriously, e.g. when transforming E. coli to synthesize spider silk, the impact on global warming should not be a problem to take into consideration.
In our field of synthetic biology we find the possible consequences in the lab and their probability are mathematically decided. But on that note there is a clear difference between the probability for the hypothesis or theory to be correct and the probability threshold we decide by when it comes to risk assessments.
Take for example a hypothesis stating that “the chemical substance X is dangerous and leads to cancer”. For this hypothesis to be accepted into the scientific corpus it needs to fulfill different - and more - requirements than it needs for the society to ban substance X on the base of precaution. Because if they knew it could potentially lead to cancer, they would be scared and why should they risk it? The epistemic values are simply different when it comes to scientific theories compared to the qualities which we value by when it comes to risks. Normally, when it comes to risk assessment it is more fatal to accept a technology or new substance"

Features
Our app works on both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa . We recommend trying it out - the usage instructions below detail how to set it up if you're unfamiliar with the platforms or just want more help. Our app can currently lookup parts and iGEM teams or lead you step-by-step through protocols.
One of the most important features is that it makes you feel like you’re in Star Trek .
Hands free
Being hands free eliminates the need to touch surfaces such as phone screens or keyboards. This reduces the contamination risk, especially while handling biologically hazardous materials. This in turn improves biosafety, but also means you’re less likely to  contaminate your own experiment.
Not requiring books or laptops frees up space on the lab bench. This means you are less likely to knock over tubes when leaning over to look something up (trust us, we’ve done it)!
Integration with existing services
It sources parts data from iGEM’s Registry of Standard Biological Parts API, uses Protocat (Michigan Software 2014-2017 iGEM) for protocols and iGEM’s teams API.
It’s very easy to use the software in existing workflows; if your protocols aren’t already on Protocat they simply need to be uploaded and they’d"

Human Practice Overview
The HKUST iGEM 2014 team has three main components for human practice: start-up kit, outreach, as well as safety and ethics. Our goal is to introduce the idea of synthetic biology to wide range of audience in the society. We targeted groups of audience consisting of college freshmen, secondary school students and members within the iGEM society. Each group of audience has potential to contribute to the field of synthetic biology in different ways, and we believe that putting equal amount of effort and paying attention to them all should be the best approach to ensure healthy growth and development of the field of synthetic biology.
Start-up Kit
Start-up kit is a manual designed to aid future iGEM teams in starting their own human practice projects. Click to find out more about the items we have prepared.
Outreach
A key element in human practice is to create a link between the society and synthetic biology. Check out whom we have reached out to during this process.
Safety and Ethics
Safety has been the foremost concern when it comes to laboratory experiment. Read more to see what the experts have to say about the safety aspects of our project.

The sender cells produce some signaling molecules (inducers) which diffuse out of their membrane, then diffuse in receiver cells membrane, and bind to the regulator molecules in the receiver cells, thus activating the transcription of certain genes. In order to characterize the quorum sensing module with a transfer function, we consider different initial inputs of external AHL, and see how much output is produced, as it was done in the quorum sensing experiments .
As diffusion through the membrane is very fast [27] , according to Fick's law of diffusion, internal and external concentration of AHL can always be considered as equal. This can also be observed in the diffusion model results . When an initial external AHL concentration is given, AHL diffuses into the cells very quickly (less than 20 seconds) [27] until internal AHL concentration equals external concentration. Then as soon as some internal AHL is consumed in the cell, it is taken up again without affecting external concentration, because external volume is very high compared to internal volume. Therefore we can consider in this module that external AHL (which is equal to internal AHL) only degrades, with the rate of extracellular decay.

We decided to shift our goal, and rather than killing S. aureus, we would limit the virulence of the bacteria and restrict its ability to form a biofilm. This could be achieved by subverting the quorum sensing of the pathogenic bacteria and blocking the signal. In this way, S. aureus could be handled by the host’s immune system and by the patient’s doctor with a normal dosage of antibiotics.
In order to learn more about the significance of these issues in the medical field, we interviewed many professionals working either directly with patients, industries working on high tech metallic or ceramic implants, and amputees through the contact of ADEPA « Association for the Defense and Study of Amputated People ». Through all this work, we were invited for many tours, first at the European Hospital George-Pompidou where we had the chance to observe Dr. Benjamin Bouyer M.D., a lumbar rachis surgeon, during surgery to see the procedures put in place to diminish the risk of infection during the integration of an implant inside the body.
Targeted pathogenic bacteria and Chassis
The first thing we needed to do was to narrow down the pathogenic bacteria we would work on. After researching in the literature and talking with experts in the fields of prosthetics, we found out that Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are the two most frequently found bacterial infectious agents on implants. We decided to use the biobrick designed by the iGEM team LMU_Munich 2014, who worked on a genetic circuit enabling Bacillus subtilis to actively detect Staphylococcus aureus.
Our bacterial chassis of choice, which would inhibit the quorum sensing of Staphylococcus aureus, needed to be a bacterium naturally occurring inside the human body. Indeed, we didn’t want to introduce a new strain inside the human body. The chassis also needed to have a good secretion system, as well as a good tolerance for the immune system. We narrowed down our choices between Bacillus subtilis, which the iGEM LMU_Munich 2014 worked on, and Escherichia coli, naturally living inside the gastrointestinal tract of humans with mostly no problem except for some strains. Because we wanted to improve their construction and because of convenience inside our lab, since we already had competent E. coli cells, we decided to use this strain. We optimized our sequences for an E. coli expression, and adapted them to its secretion system by adding export signals."

9/2 - Plans for Asia Jamboree
14 members have decided to participate in the upcoming Asia Jamboree held in Hong Kong.
We decided that each member should book an airline ticket separately, because of the difficulty in booking seats for 14 people.
We have reserved rooms for 14 people at Regal Riverside Hotel.
9/18 - Briefing on experiment results
Overall result is as described below.
- It did not turn out very well as detection of hydrocarbon failed.
- We are not certain of the reason for the failure, but it must be either the compound's concentration was too minute to be detected or it was simply not produced.
- If detection failure is due to low concentration of the compound, we will have to concentrate the culture medium to increase the amount of hydrocarbon.
- TLC will not be useful for this task, so we will have to use GC to detect.
- The reason for using E.coli BW25113 is because of their promoter, Pbad. Bacteria that utilize Pbad utilizes arabinose as an inducer, and is not able to metabolize it.
To Hong Kong, one of our advisors, Han-Sung Roh will accompany us.
We formed teams for poster and powerpoint design, and organization of experimental results.
9/30 - Almost finished..
Current situation
- Codon optimization failed, resulting in low fluorescence
- We thought about using triton x-100(a type of detergent) on E.coli, which theoretically will weaken its membrane, letting hydrocarbon diffuse more easily. Our advisor however did not approve of the option.

BIT-China,2015,Team:BIT-China#project Fine-regulation circuits.html_-_-_TEXT.html," family. Bxb1 could be divided to two parts, gp35 and gp47. The gp35 part could recognize specific sequences, called attB and attP, and then integrate, invert, or excise dsDNA depending on the orientation of recognition sequences. When it inverts DNA sequence, the attB and attP sequences are changed into attL and attR, as other DNA recombinases do. Another part called Bxb1 gp47 binds to integrase-DNA complex and this complex flips DNA back into original sequence by regenerating attB and attP sequences. So the efficiency of inversion mediated by Bxb1 is half and half [42].
According to the function of Bxb1, we design the second type circuit to regulate the environmental pH(Fig.11)
Fig.11 The gene circuit of Bxb1-mediated recombinase system
This circuit is applied when the functional acid and the alkali are both strong. In the primary state, the bacteria also produce alkali. Since the alkali is strong, the pH of environment could reach the responsible range of P-atp2 easily. It can lead Bxb1 to work. The promoter J23119 could be inverted persistently until the inversion efficacy reaches half and half. In this process, the bacteria produce the acid and the alkali at the same time, it can create a wave-motion of pH. And the pH of environment will be stable finally. The final pH is influenced by the promoter sensing pH and the strength of acid and alkali.
3)FimE circuit
There is another condition. In this condition, we use the assemble of the strong acid and weak alkali, or strong alkali and weak acid. We use FimE to achieve the fine-regulation. This is our gene circuit of FimE-mediated recombinase system. (Fig.12)
Fig.12 The gene circuit of FimE-mediated recombinase system
FimE is different from other kind’s recombinase. Its recognization sites on the upstream (IRL) and downstream (IRR) are not same. It means that after the recombination mediated by FimE happens, the sign sites would be exchanged, so that the new sign sites couldn’t be recognized by FimE again. Thus the recombination mediated by FimE is irreversible.[43]
Granted that the bacteria produce the strong alkali in the primary, the environment would turn alkaline quickly. So P-atp2 can correspond the change of environment and start the expression of FimE. FimE recognizes IRL and IRR"

Human Practices
Individual Interpersonal Workshops
As part of our research project we conducted one-on-one consultations with residents of the five boroughs of NYC: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx and Staten Island. These interpersonal workshops allowed us to gain insight into the ways in which our urban community is engaging with their outdoor spaces, and provided an opportunity to educate them on the health of their soil. Upon the first meeting, a team member plotted areas of interest or concern on the resident’s property to sample. A thorough explanation of the sampling procedure was explained to the residents. Once the sample had been collected it was brought back to the lab for extraction and processed to determine the level of nutrients present in the soil. After processing, a profile of the results is generated and a diagnosis is provided to the participant and added to our map of local soil conditions. A final meeting with the residents is scheduled to review the results and discuss procedures and techniques to remedy any issues regarding their soil’s condition.
Human Practices
The primary goal of The Soiled research project is to educate the public on the importance of healthy soil, and in the process develop a safer, more accessible way to test its nutritional values. To accomplish this we created a personal dialog with the 60 residents of New York City. We recruited participants by reaching out via email; once we received replies, our team set up appointments to meet with interested participants at the sample collection sites. The Soiled Project is designed to facilitate opportunities to reach out to the public about the important role soil health plays in agriculture, and in turn promote personal sustainability through education and community.
#06 - The Power of Nature
Traveling to a plot labeled #6, which was located far down the B line into Sheepshead Bay, a story of the power of nature was told.  The yard I sampled was in a normal Brooklyn neighborhood near a bridge that led traffic to the Atlantic Ocean.  It was an extremely hot midday, and while sipping sweet iced tea, the owner of the land was describing the power of hurricane Sandy.  The house is located far inland from the ocean.  Apparently the storm surge of Sandy traveled across the bridge a half"
Dundee,2011,Team:Dundee#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," to terms with the fact I am entering my final year of university. I am interested in anything to do with cells and molecules but also enjoy the microbiology portions of my degree so bring on the bacteria! I love the interdisciplinary element of this project so can’t wait to get started as synthetic biology is a new and exciting area for me. Outside of science I love to cook, play tennis and watch my beloved Dundee United..
Richard Owen
Richard is a 3rd year biochemistry student, with interests in how science can be used to approach the global problems we face in a responsible and sustainable manner. I think that synthetic biology is a very interesting expanding field that has potential to address some of these problems, such as climate change and resource shortages. Outside of study I like to spend time with friends, cycling, camping or working on the university allotment.

Created devices that produce YFP in response to oxidative stress
Based on our studies of inducing stress promoters with hydrogen peroxide, it seemed that the CCP1 and TSA1 promoters were the most promising ones. In both of these promoters, increasing H2O2 concentrations seem to lead to stronger activation of promoters and thus to more intensive fluorescence signals, as seen from results obtained from microplate reader results where fluorescence is normalized to cell density (Figure 1). The functionality of the promoters was confirmed with fluorescence measurements performed with flow cytometry (Figure 2).

We managed to produce a phenotype change in yeast by replacing QDR2 transporter
Using our foam-based visual catalase assay, we managed to prove a phenotype change after replacing the original QDR2 transporter in the S. cerevisae strain SS328-leu genome with the corresponding transporter from strain VL3. This can be seen in increased catalase activity levels compared to the non-modified strain after incubation in different concentrations of microcystin (figure 3). Despite the increase of catalase activity base level, the assay didn’t give definitive proof of the functionality of the integrated transporter, as the observed response to microcystin concentrations in SS328-leu with QDR2 transporter was different than in VL3. However, this response might also be partially obscured by the large margin of error in our experiment.
Figure 3. Relative catalase activity in different yeast strains when exposed to different concentrations of microcystin.
Based on the phenotype change, we assumed that the replaced transporter was functional. However, when we attempted to induce fluorescence of our stress promoters in the strain with the replaced transporter, we didn’t obtain any fluorescent signal compared to uninduced values (figure 4). In this experiment, varying microcystin concentrations did not significantly affect any of our promoters, which we concluded to be due to the inability of the transporter to"

Digested pAK13D was dephosphorylated, then crtI , crtB, and crtY were ligated with pAK13D to put them under the T7 promoter, hopefully producing pAK13AB, pAK13AC, and pAK13AD, respectively. pCg13R was also ligated with pC13Q, hopefully producing pCg13U. All four constructs were transformed into DH5α via electroporation.
Yesterday's digestions were gel extracted, ligated, and transformed. Hopefully it worked this time!

hph was amplified with Gibson primers from pAh13G, and the pSB1C3 backbone was amplified with Gibson primers from pC13F (BBa_J04450). When assembled, they will form pCh13V.
There were no transformants, again :(. On the other hand, we received our tube of Ganoderma Lucidum from Dr. David Hibbett today! Once more with feeling, we redid the four digestion-ligations for crtI, crtB, crtY, and nptII. We also amplified hph, the hygromycin resistance gene, from one of the plasmids we got from Dr. Turgeon's lab, as well as pSB1C3 backbone, and we will use Gibson assembly to put them together (as hph has both EcoRI and PstI sites)-- the gels looked good for both of these. Finally, we submitted pAb13T (pBARGPE1) for sequencing to determine the sequences of the Aspergillus nidulans gpdA promoter and the bar gene, which confers phosphonothricin resistance.

Unfortunately, sequencing center returns message kindly explaining that concentration of DNA was still insufficient. Three cultures inoculated for plasmid prep tomorrow. Safety form updated. Lab notebook and weekly update section updated. Plan is tentatively to send for sequencing tomorrow morning by 9 after doing some tricks in plasmid prep to increase DNA concentration. Then, if sequencing results confirm presence of successfully ligated G2, scale up plasmid stock, digest out G2, replace in four ligations with the other GFPs, then transform cells and plate. After this, plasmisd prep and send for sequencing to confirm presence of all five GFPs. If sequencing fails to confirm, investigate other methods of introducing GFP into pFTV (cbar). Inoculated three cultures of pFTV+G2 to plasmid prep tomorrow.

One of our dCas9 ligations, with backbone Plasmid 1 #1 had colonies grow on the plate. The ligation to backbone #2 was not successful. #2 did not appear to sequence well, so perhaps that plasmid is not 100% correct. Emily made a large gel and we ran the digested backbones on it. All 6 plasmid digests ran well.
Plasmid prepped three cultures from yesterday and sent for sequencing on campus, this time with high enough plasmid concentration. Prepared SOC media. Tested electrocompetent cells by transforming one tube with original pFTV and the other with nothing. Plated on Cm plates. Realized problems with Reverse inverse PCR primer. The annealing section is correct but the tail is complementary to what it should be. This is resulting in the correct sequence containing Sac1, a spacer, and Pst1 in the bottom strand instead of in the strand that we want it to be in. Met to talk about the design of the dRBS. It was decided that we would order two oligos with the ends as if the restriction enzyme has already cut them. The plan is to anneal these oligos and we can then skip the digestion step and just ligated them directly into the digested cells. Fingers crossed that this will work. Dr. Salis thinks it should be okay, but Iman has doubts because annealing the two strands (each is a dRBS) is really 48 ligations proceeding simultaneously in the same tube and is bound to"
Melbourne,2016,Team:Melbourne#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," achieved with two star peptides joined together in conjunction with the enzymes attached to the ends of the arms as illustrated below.
Collaboration with the NUS Singapore iGEM Team
As part of our collaboration with NUS Singapore, we asked them to provide us with a diffusion simulator so that we could gain insight into the behaviour of molecules surrounding the star peptides.
The raw MATLAB files provided can be downloaded here.
The model was set up to mimic the two star peptides illustrated above. The aim of the model was to map the concentration fields of Acetoacetyl-CoA and HMG-CoA as they are produced and consumed at the arms of the star peptides. The following assumptions were used:
the concentration of Acetyl-CoA is uniform and not a rate-limiting factor
the initial concentration fields of Acetoacetyl-CoA and HMG-CoA are equal and uniform
the diffusion constants of Acetoacetyl-CoA and HMG-CoA are equal
the rate of conversion of Acetoacetyl-CoA to HMG-CoA at the HMG-CoA Synthase node is dependent upon the concentration of Acetoacetyl-CoA at the node
the rate of consumption of HMG-CoA at the HMG-CoA Reductase node is dependent upon the concentration of HMG-CoA at the node
The adapted NU Singapore MATLAB files for this model can be downloaded here.
The following concentration fields were found:
These concentration fields clearly demonstrate the production and consumption of Acetoacetyl-CoA and HMG-CoA at the relevant nodes. However, the positioning of the contour lines brings into question a previously used assumption. The questionable assumption is that products from one enzyme reaction will flow towards the node of the other enzyme reaction where they are being consumed. If this were the case, then we would expect to see contour lines encapsulating and running between both the production and consumption nodes. Therefore, further testing using similar simulations should be performed in order to verify the accuracy of this assumption. Please note that the diamond shapes (which should be circles) are due to MATLAB's interpolation and not the diffusion simulator.

We shall now simulate the reaction kinetics of the mevalonate pathway using the SimBiology toolbox in MATLAB.

Pulling down, improving lysate reactions, new aptamer design and testing in serum
Tim:
Following negative results, pulldown experiments were performed with different biotinylated compounds to check if our streptavidin beads were still functional. However, the substrates used were in quantities too low to determine anything.
However, we finally did a titration of Cy5 labeled aptamer using the magnetic beads and determined the detection limit for 60-18[29]a aptamer.
Elia, Lena, Lisa, Malek:
We tested out whether or not adding Buffer Z to lysate/toehold/trigger solutions improved reaction kinetics and output, results were good and this proved that the extra buffer was unnecessary.
John, Matteo:
We both designed a new trigger-aptamer (aka thrombin aptamer 2 + trigger extension) with the help of NUPACK for its secondary structure.
We tested out whether or not the new design correctly bound thrombin and correctly triggered the toehold. And the experiment was performed again using serum as a medium.

First, Mr. Ramírez covered the topic of the importance of bees, emphasizing how they have always been considered an essential factor for environmental health and he even showed us a funny cucumber that had not been correctly pollinated; it was very small and thin.
Bee   diseases   were   our   next   topic.  He  commented  how Foulbrood
presence isn’t that strong in Mexico, however, in Europe and in the USA, this is not the case. Mr. Ramírez took advantage and included implications of other frequent bee diseases like Nosema and Varroa in the conversation. He mentioned a very important point that we had previously started to notice: Most of the serious problems in bees caused by viruses or bacteria, are not correctly detected or even known. As Mr. Rodríguez had previously commented, Mr. Ramírez mentioned how different extracts of plants are used against diseases in bees, in this case, mint and grapefruit were the examples. On another hand it was mentioned how antibiotics are not an option at all for treatment, since the European Union does not accept them, neither does accept the presence of transgenics in the honey; there are rigorous studies exercised and if there is something wrong the EU may return an entire shipment of honey back to the remitter. We discussed the issue of innocuity of honey by highlighting that when there is a new product added to the hive, it should not generate any residue at all or change the expected properties from the consumer.
After talking about our project, a question arose in Mr. Ramírez, an issue that would be asked many times since that day and that we would do everything possible to solve and validate: Our product would actually pass from the food that the nurse bee ingest all through its system until reaching the larva by means of the royal jelly? And regarding the method of application, (initially consisting in applying the final product in the bee bread), Mr. Ramírez explained to us how this bee bread is created, and the fermentation process it goes through in the bee cell.
We also had the great opportunity of listening to some of the concerns Mr. Ramírez has as a beekeeper: He thinks the beekeeping area could be greatly impulsed by receiving more support from governmental institutions and he perceives that the validation of honey innocuousness here in"

A blog investigating science communication. Linking linguistics to Synthetic Biology
Sci Com Seminars
October 4, 2017
Breaking down the barriers
As a culmination of our research into science communication we complied a set of guidelines to advise on communicating synthetic biology to the public. We hope this will help address the problem of how language can be used most effectively to bridge a gap which can result between scientists and the public.
Our guidelines go through the process of communication, from the more broad level of ensuring a full understanding of the intended genre, audience and purpose you are reaching for, to the more specific aspects of word choice, informed by linguistic research.
Sharing at Seminars
To talk to scientists about our research, we organised some seminars with research groups. In these, we presented our research into science communication, talked about our guidelines, then opened up for discussion.
The information was received with interest, and we got loads of really enthusiastic and interesting discussions going. There were debates around the nature of synthetic biology and how definitions can be important to people to help them understand what they are reading about.
The scientists also shared their own experiences of science communication. Something which we found particularly interesting was learning that when submitting work for an academic journal, it is becoming more frequent to be asked to write an abstract specifically for the public, summarising your work in an understandable way. We thought this was an area where our guidelines could be useful!
It was great to get to share the research with people more directly involved in the field, and fantastic to experience the enthusiasm"

The initial concentrations of several species, such as dCas9 and guide RNA, which are fairly difficult to ""guess"" and nowhere to be found in literatures, can be better estimated by running simplified models only regarding the equilibrium of the relevant molecules. Here, we present an example run by SimBiology App on MATLAB. The diagram of the model is shown below.
Figure 2   Graphical Representation of the SimBiology Model for Determining Initial Concentrations of CRISPRi-Related Species
Running the model with relevant parameters set on SimBiology can provide us with diagrams showing the result of simulation. The result of the simulation provides us with initial concentrations of the relevant molecules which are probably more believable.

3.1 Effect of AHL concentration
According to our expectations, the Test System is inducible upon the addition of external AHL. With proper concentrations of AHL, the cells would undergo a series of changes regardin gene expression. The most obvious change is the increase of GFP concentration in the cell, for us. The “safety catch” component also ensures that the system has minimal leakage, meaning that minor fluctuations in the system when no AHL is added, or very trace amount of AHL should not activate the system. To test whether the Test System does possess these features, we will run a series of simulations of"

What has been most interesting and enjoyable for us about Human Practices?
We think Human Practice itself is an interesting thing for us which we enjoy so much. We know a lot about the society. Throughout this summer, we visit the best cancer hospital in China----The National Cancer Center and communicate with the experts who have a deep understandings of Esophagus Cancer in order to ensure that our project is addressing a genuine need as defined by those who know best.
We learn how doctors work, how they take care of patients, how they do experiments and overcome difficulties. Doctors in China have really hard work to do every day. We have a better understanding of the disease which we deal with. Over 90% esophagus cancer happens in China and the survival rate is lower than 20%. We also visit labs and give questionnaires to the public. What we do makes us acquire the current situation of esophagus cancer and the life of doctors in China. These things really attracts us.
What challenges has your team faced in developing and running our Human Practices activities?
At the beginning, the challenge for us is how we can visit the hospital. We don’t know any doctors and we are not sure whether the doctors want to communicate with us. So we contact with some medical students in The National Cancer Center at first. Thankfully, they’d like to help us and make an appointment with the doctors.
During our visiting, it comes the biggest difficulty------the way we communicate to the patient. We want to know how they feel and we want to comfort them, but none of us know how to start to talk. We are afraid that we might not be polite to them or disturb them. At first we were a bit embarrassed when facing them. However, they were friendly and we had a good conversation.
What support or resources can iGEM offer to help us improve our Human Practice work?
We hope that the iGEM foundation can propagandize more about iGEM competition and make more people know about it. It’ll help us easier to get access to the resources. Meanwhile, we hope that iGEM can help us propagandize our ideas. We’ll be really thankful!

Collaborations
HUST-China, WHU-China and HZAU-China, three universities located in Wuhan region have been keeping close communications and collaborations these years. This summer, we continue the tradition, we three iGEM teams held a seminar in 29st Jul,    during which we reached the consensus to establish Wuhan iGEM Committee in the future and held conferences and Science Fair at regular intervals to spread the idea of synthesis biology. Moreover we discussed about our project and exchanged some valuable suggestions. Here are the three main collaborations we made this summer.
Construction of CI-PSB1C3
We helped WHU team constructing a standardized plasmid C1-pSB1C3. Owing to the limit of time and the cost of fragment’s synthesis, WHU decided to generate a short C1 fragment through anneal of single-stranded DNA then insert it into the pSB1C3 between the restriction sites of XbaI and PstI. But they met difficulties and failed after several attempts.
After discussions and new experiment design, we helped them finish the construction through the following protocol:    1. Mix up 2.5μL primer F and R
2. Put the mixture in PCR Amplifier :
DNA denateration for 5 minutes
Annealing for 30 seconds
3. Ligation with pSB1C3(XbaI and PstI digested) for 1h
4. Transformation to E.coli
5. Plasmid extract

From 2011.igem.org
After our discussion event, we decided to hold a series of in-depth interviews on several of the topics raised with people who hold a vested interest in science. These range from science correspondents to academics to funding advisers, and set out to gather a range of perspectives on iGEM and synthetic biology.
Geoff Carr , Science Editor of The Economist , explained what he thought were the reasons for interest in the field of synthetic biology. He described synthetic biology as a stimulus for philosophical discussion, likening the change it brings to the move away from vitalism in the nineteenth century.
Despite this interest, Geoff expressed the opinion that it was not the responsibility of journalists to force education about synthetic biology. He instead prioritises the field when it provides something socially significant to analyse. He also considered which movement of synthetic biology is going to be the most useful in the long run, elaborating that MIT’s programme has yet to produce anything of significance. He was sceptical about the future viability of the field, comparing its lack of progress to the huge growth continually experienced in other fields such as computing.
When discussing our project, Geoff explained that publicising the functional details of DNA vaccines and our improvements is unnecessary. He said that most people, including scientists in other fields, don’t know, or need to know, how they work to understand their importance.
Geoff was critical of common conceptions of synthetic biology and ‘human practices’, and this highlighted the importance of maintaining a degree of detachment from the competition to conduct an effective analysis of iGEM.
Ian Sample and Alok Jha , Science Correspondents for The Guardian , had strong opinions about the value of iGEM and the potential of synthetic biology. We asked how they thought news media shaped perceptions of the field, and Ian explained that the diverse range of UK media outlets present science topics from a variety of angles, both positive and negative. In this way, readers choose coverage in line with their personal beliefs. This suggests that no more attention must be paid to coverage of synthetic biology than any other science.
Alok was more optimistic about MIT’s form of synthetic biology, explaining that it was only a matter of time before it produced viable industrial applications. He also explained that iGEM’s primary purpose is in training future scientists for industry, comparing the competition to a self-funded summer internship. He suggested that since industry was the eventual benefactor of the competition, it would not matter if the BioBrick Registry was"

What is a Riboswitch?
A riboswitch is a piece of mRNA that regulates gene expression. There are primarily two types of riboswitches: translational and transcriptional riboswitches. The fluoride riboswitch is a transcriptional riboswitch (Figure 2), which means that a terminator is formed when the riboswitch is transcribed that limits the processivity of the RNA polymerase transcribing downstream genes. When the aptamer (ligand-binding) region of the fluoride riboswitch interacts with fluoride, the terminator is not formed allowing the RNA polymerase to proceed and transcribe the downstream gene.
Figure 2: Schematic of a transcriptional riboswitch
2015 Exeter iGEM Team, RNA Riboswitches
In our project, we will use the fluoride riboswitch. In Figure 3 you can see a crystal structure of the aptamer domain of the fluoride riboswitch. How can a negatively charged piece of RNA bind to a negatively charged fluoride ion? The fluoride riboswitch encapsulated three Mg2+ ions that can bind to the fluoride ion (Figure 3).
Figure 3: Crystal structure of a fluoride riboswitch
Aiming Ren, Kanagalaghatta R. Rajashankar, Dinshaw J. Patel “Fluoride ion encapsulation by Mg2+ ions and phosphates in a fluoride riboswitch” 2012 Nature 486, 85–89
In nature the riboswitch regulates the expression of genes that help the organism deal with high levels of fluoride. These genes are often pumps that allow fluoride to be exported out of the cell (Figure 4). In E. coli the gene crcB encodes a fluoride efflux channel that removes excess fluoride from the cell so that it is no longer toxic. In E. coli when the crcB gene is genetically deleted (ΔcrcB), the phenotype is increased sensitivity to fluoride and concentrations above 500μM are lethal. In our experiments we needed to utilize the ΔcrcB E. coli strain so that fluoride could accumulate intracellularly.
Figure 4: Crystal structure of a fluoride channel
Our Design
We constructed an operon that would enable us to regulate the expression of the gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase with the fluoride riboswitch, called CHOP (Figure 5). We ordered the synthetic operon from IDT DNA with overhangs that have homology to the pSB1A3 vector so we could clone our operon in with Gibson. We used the pSB1"

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," the cells. Image was taken with the help of the fluorescence microscope.
In our work we built an expression system for the iGEM Team Technion from Israel containing a Tar receptor-GFP fusion protein. In contrast to the iGEM Team in Israel we decided in agreement with their team members to test the expression without putting any linker between the two components. Thereby, we wanted to test the influence of a linker and try the possibility of working without any linker.
We can confirm that a missing linker between the two proteins could cause a weak GFP signal or a misfolded protein, which makes a localization of the Tar receptor impossible. In most of the cases the fluorescence signal was detectable in the cytosol, which indicates that the Tar-GFP protein did not fold in the right way to localize in the membrane. But we can also see that our expression system in general worked, because we were able to detect the fluorescence at the poles of some cells.
Because of our work the iGEM Team Technion knew that working without any linker could result in native folded proteins but is not the best option for secure results in their further project. The linker could still play an important role in the folding process of the Tar receptor and therefore influences the position of the Tar receptor in the membrane of E. coli .
All in all, we showed that detection and correct location of the fused proteins could be possible even without linker. However, the rate of positively measured fluorescence in the requested/desired location in the poles of E. coli was very low, which illustrates the importance of a linker between both proteins. With this work we could help the iGEM Team Technion finding the right focus of their problem by trying a different way of expression for them.
iGEM Team Technion Israel for iGEM Team Aachen
The first approach of the iGEM Team Technion to help us was to model the incorporation of the non-canonical amino acid DMNB-serine in the active site of subtilisin E. As this did not work out as expected, they helped us to confirm the idea of theoretical inactivation by talking to several experts in their university. Based on the native structure of subtilisin E and the structure of the used non-canonical amino acid, they all agreed on the prosperity of that method. So we had an independent opinion about our project idea and were assured in following this theory once again. Moreover they gave us some useful hints on how the modelling of our protein had worked out and which parameters are needed to model the effects of the incoporation of our amino acid DMNB-serine.

Alkaloid isorhy against Parkinson's
- It is rumoured to be a potential treatment for Parkinson's and it would make a good project if this were to be produced by bacteria
- On further research it turns out that the evidence for this drug as a treatment is weak and there is no information available about the gene or genes that encode it, so the idea was dropped (Text by Frank)
Bacterial tattoo
- After being inspired by a student from the Royal College of Arts who presented us with her work on a project to create a living dress, Frank began to research the notion of a melanin tattoo, so that alpha-melanin stimulating hormone is applied to the skin and held in place until the skin darkens in the shape of the template. The alpha-MSH could be produced by bacteria.
- the alpha-MSH gene is produced as one gene that also contains beta-MSH and gamma-MSH that are made available through post-transcriptional processing, so only the alpha-MSH region is required as it is the best characterised and has been expressed before
- Once the alpha-MSH is expressed, it can be collected, soaked into silk (for example) that is cut into a pattern and will allow the hormone to diffuse into the skin, producing a (probably temporary) tattoo. From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte-stimulating_hormone
- However, it seems that alpha-MSH is a rather powerful aphrodisiac and so a different hormone will have to be chosen, in addition, it seems that the hormone is unlikely to penetrate the skin as there are many different layers as well as proteases secreted by the skin
- alpha-MSH, or its analogues are already used as tanning solutions and the analogues are considerably stronger
- so then, bacteria could express the gene for melanotan - which is a cyclic lactyam analogue, and this will be very difficult to express, as a method will have to be found for cyclisation.
- One further problem:   ""As of 2010 no compound incorporating the melanotan II peptide has ever been approved for use by any governmental drug regulatory"

With this research and the exploration of previous iGEM projects, we decided to create a construct that would express a Keratinase enzyme to break down the keratin in the hair and feathers, thus solving the issue.  Because iGEM requires collaboration between teams, we decided to try contact you due to your decision to tackle this problem last year. As much of our project is based on building on, and optimizing previous constructs, we are looking for some more in-depth information concerning the cleaving process, and some issues you tackled there, and how you have dealt with them. We know that Keratinases are difficult to express in E. Coli, due to it getting stuck in the periplasm when expressed, because the Keratinase folds, and because when expressed, the export tag does not always get cleaved properly, so if you could give us any insight upon this, as that is an issue you have faced, that would be appreciated. We have worked with our mentors to optimize the Keratinase cleaving issue, but haven't yet managed to express it, due to problems with our lab work. We think that the cleaving issue should be fixed, but are not sure yet.  We would also like to get some of your current opinions on the issues, if you have any advice for us that could make us more successful at the competition and if you had devised a way in which you would have deployed your construct outside of the lab, if you had been successful. We also were wondering what your plans were for implementation of the biobrick into the real-world, and safety precautions to be taken outside the lab through implementation. We have been thinking bioreactor implementation for wastewater treatment plants, but regarding poultry farms, it is not a very applicable implementation. Looking forward to hearing back from you soon and we understand if you can't answer some of our questions.
Thank you sincerely,  Our Lady Of The Snows Catholic Academy 2015 iGEM Team
Hi Freya (and team),
In regards to the Keratinase results we saw - once we had colonies that we'd confirmed contained the Keratinase via PCR, we went straight to assay via incubation of feathers/nails (grim I know) into cell culture during growth. The paper we'd taken the construct sequence from had a great set of images of feathers being degraded over a period of 24h or a few days. We had no luck there which is why we chose to"

This statement correlates with statements from the other women, which describe that culture plays a large part in birth control issues; Mexico is largely Catholic which discourages women from discussing their sex lives. Many women feel too embarrassed or ashamed to purchase contraception, feel unable to use protection during sex, and must take care of the child(ren) that may result. We hope that our new, discrete birth control method may help women feel more at ease, as it won’t require them to routinely purchase it in public.

Ava, New Zealand Citizen
Ava, an alum from the University of Otago, shared that she often struggles to obtain birth control. In New Zealand, 15-minute appointments with a local health care provider are available to all citizens but are too short to be personalized enough to the patient, and while longer appointments are available, they are more expensive. This lack of personalization and Ava’s lack of funds deterred her from pursuing birth control forms that require a prescription, so she instead pursued condom use. Read More >> One-use condoms, however, became expensive after a while, and Ava decided to spend her money on things she saw more important than her sexual health. Although many of her peers used oral contraceptives, her low-income background forced her to prioritize buying food and paying rent over sexual protection. Sexual health education is not emphasized in the rural areas around Ava and locals still use traditional forms of birth control, many of which are painful, unsafe, and/or ineffective. For example, in areas where poroporo leaves are found, people make a broth from these leaves that they believe acts as a contraceptive. The leaves have not been shown to suppress ovulation [3] . These misconceptions and alternatives prove to our team how much our cheap and safe contraceptive has potential to help.

○ Design
Step by step instructions(Fig. 6):
1. Amplify the target gene under error-prone condition.
2. Ligate the DNA fragment into a plasmid.
3. Transform the plasmid into a competent cell.
4. Pick out mutants shifting to 96-well plates for more experiments[27][28].
Fig.6 Four steps of EP-PCR
Conventionally, P-atp2 promoter wasn’t as well function as a mechanical device, and our machine could never use the only one alkali-induced promoter to regulate all the complex situation.  What’s more, we anticipated knowing the accurate response range of P-atp2 promoter, so we could extend it. Thus, the idea was appearing, by using error-prone PCR to mutate promoter, which has different efficiency and different ranges of response to the environment.
The process of mutating P-atp2 is cockamamie, when it does not require excellent skill of experiment or advanced technology. Even though there are several ways to change the reaction condition, we finally chose to put manganese ion into our error-prone reaction system.
After the amplification, agarose gel electrophoresis analyzed the promoter DNA fragment, which was using the P-atp2 as the template of error-prone PCR. The size of P-atp2 is about 355bp. Then the right gel was extracted. And another agarose gel electrophoresis analysis was done, while the P-atp2 was linked to Lac Z alpha by using the OE-PCR. Then we ligated the production into pXMJ19 and transformed the plasmid into BMTOP10.
While the whole positive-bacteria couldn’t be active 100%, our promoters still needed to be verified.
In order to attain our goal, the strategy we have devised was measuring the activity of enzyme β-galactosidase(LacZ). Most recently, we picked out every other 94 bacteria of experiment groups into a 96-well cell culture plates, the rest of two wells were the negative control(NC) and the positive control(PC). As these bacteria grew normally and the OD600 was up to about 1.5, we lysed cells, then added ONPG to start a color reaction and recorded the response time.

Lab Note
We started our experiment on August 10th.
Open the page, as you can see, our experiment notebooks are written in Japanese. We tried hard to report the experiment in more detail than any other team. This is why we decided to explain in Japanese.
If you understand Japanese, and if you don't have any knowledge about iGEM rule, you can get a lot of information through reading our notebooks. Our notebook will contribute to JAPAN in future.

Brasil-SP,2014,Team:Brasil-SP#Results#Sporulation_-_-_TEXT.html," a different approach. The experiment was performed in duplicate. We exposed the spore solution to boiling water for 5 minutes to kill only the bacteria. After this, we plated at LB medium. After 24 hours of growth, we have the following result:
Sample 1 diluted to 10-6. Growth in the non-heated plate, but not in the heated one.
Sample 2 diluted to 10-6. Growth in the non-heated plate, but not in the heated one.
Sample 1 diluted to 10-4. Growth in the non-heated plate, but not in the heated one.
Sample 2 diluted to 10-4. Growth in the non-heated plate, but not in the heated one.
Sample 1 diluted to 10-2. Growth in the non-heated plate, but not in the heated one.
Sample 2 diluted to 10-2. Growth in the non-heated plate, but not in the heated one.
     In five individual experiments, our spores didn’t germinate. They only germinate once, in the only one that didn’t have a replica. We discussed about two potential reasons to explain the differences between the first and the second attempts: 1 - bacteria didn’t get killed at 60°C, and 2 - contamination.
      Our experiments showed that with this germination approach our strain can’t grow. Even with heat activation, the free amino acids able to trigger the molecular pathways showed above are in a very low concentration in LB medium, being unable to turn on the bacteria again.
What we learned
     Our first conclusion is that 60°C is too low to kill all bacteria, generating an erroneous result. We suggest the use of an autoclave, equipment available in almost all laboratory, to create a gradient of temperature making sure that all bacteria get killed and spores survive. We can also use a less intense heat-treatment to kill bacteria and also activate the spores, what enhances the germination process, as follow. In literature, we found information about variation in the temperatures and the time that spores are exposed to this temperature. One of the possible choices is 75°C for 30 minutes, followed by 15 minutes on ice. It gives a more consistent result between spores in the same sample and ensures higher germination efficiency. However, in our device, we can’t activate spores using heat. Without heat activation, germination didn’t work well, but can be triggered at lower levels. So, we concluded that the solution could be a concentrated LB medium (10"

By double cross-over it replaces amyE gene, which is   necessary for production of alpha-amylase ,   with desired insert which is located between amyE front flanking region and   amyE back flanking region. See the plasmid map below.
PCR
Experiment:
10/08/16: sfGFP(Sp) was amplified from pNW plasmid together with its    promoter (Ppta), which is a constitutive promoter from Geobacillus DSM2542 for phosphate acetyl transferase expression, and a triple    terminator (3TER). Primers used for the amplification were F-gfp insert    and R-gfp insert (primer sequences can be found here ).

For detailed information on how to prepare and run agarose gel see following protocol .
Figure 2. DNA electrophoresis with amplified     Ppta-sfGFP(Sp)-3TER (1147 bp in size).
Conclusion:
Amplification of the Ppta-sfGFP(Sp)-3TER was successful. It was    verified by DNA electrophoresis. Correct size of a band    could be seen and that was 1147 bp. However second band could be seen,    that was probably caused by unspecific binding of the primers used.    Therefore lower band of correct size was cut out from the gel and DNA    was extracted.
Procedure after gel validation:
DNA extraction was done according to this protocol .
Restriction digestion
Experiment:
10/08/16: On this day restriction digestion of PCR product of the    sfGFP(Sp), pDR111 integration plasmid and pDR111+message    integration plasmid was done. sfGFP(Sp) as an insert was cut with BglII    and NheI restriction enzymes. Integration plasmid pDR111 and pDR111+message as a vector was cut with BamHI and NheI. BglII could not    be used as a restriction enzyme for pDR111 due to multiple recognition    site of this cutter. BamHI as a compatible restriction enzyme to BglII"

Nox His Tag Purified SDS-PAGE
Despite our greatest efforts we were unable to image a gel of purified his-tagged Nox protein. In our collaboration effort with the Harvard University iGEM team we asked the team to attempt to his tag purify the Nox protein. Unfortunately the attempt was unsuccessful.  Through our characterization assay we’ve determined that the protein is indeed being made and appears to be working.

The transformation on the parts BBa_R0010 (lacP promoter) and BBa_E0840 (GFP coding seq.) from yesterday was unsuccesful so the experiment was repeated today.
Freezing stocks of E. coli with pSB1C3 and pSB1K3 were stored at -80°C. Each culture were mixed with 50% glycerol
Furthermore fast digest on our 3 PCR products were made with XbaI and SpeI.
PCR 1 and 3 were ligated and PCR 2 and 3 were ligated.
Thursday 3/7
Today the ligated PCR1/3 and PCR2/3 were purified by running them through a gel. The concentration of the purified constructs were measured by nano drop.
In order to create ""sticky ends"" on PCR1/3 and PCR2/3, the parts were fast digested. Also pSB1C3 was fast digested, so that it could be used as a backbone. The different fast digested parts were gel purified. PCR1/3 and PCR2/3 were then ligated to the backbone (pSB1C3).
Colony PCR was performed on a colony from the  transformation from Wednesday 2/7 of the lacP promoter (BBa_R0010) and GFP coding seq. (BBa_E0840). The gel showed bands that were too long, therefore a new colony PCR was performed on a different colony. The results from the new colony PCR were the same as before, with the weight of GFP just above 1000 bp and the weight of lacP promoter just around 500 bp.
Friday 4/7
A miniprep was performed on the ON containing lacP promoter (BBa_R0010) and GFP coding seq. (BBa_E0840), and a freezing stock was made.
Furthermore a PCR was made on the products from the miniprep. Unfortunatly the PCR didn't work, as the gel didn't show any products.
Because the PCR didn't work we found the products from the iGEM kit from 2014 and made a new PCR.
This time the  PCR worked and the products were gel purified and the concentrations meassured with NanoDrop.

Mr. Teng (52-year-old)      Pancreatic cancer sufferer
It was in May or Apr., 2016, Mr. Teng went for examination due to abdominal pain. At first, he thought it might be a gastrointestinal disease, but later results showed that it was actually pancreatic cancer. He had side effects like skin rash and hair loss, but his mental state is pretty good.
Mr. Teng has been applying chemotherapy since August this year. His treating cycle was 15 days of infusion followed by 8 days of withdraw, and his treatment costs 15k RMB (around 2200$) each time.
Mr. Teng did not take new treatments such as molecular targeted drugs into account because he thought it may not be practicable, and he emphasized the use of chemotherapy to get his situation under control. However, the patient did have a good understanding of new therapy, and he showed us some of the new cancer treatment that he knew before. For example, he mentioned a ‘cancer cell hunger therapy’ discovered in Zhejiang University, and also interference therapy from Japan. Mr. Teng has fundamental information related new therapy, but his understanding of cancer and therapies still left deviation.
Mr. Zheng (72-year-old)  colon cancer sufferer -> liver metastasis sufferer
In Nov. 2014, Mr. Zheng suffered from blood in his stool, and stool was too soft to form normal shapes. Then he went to hospital for colonoscopy. The results showed that there were distinctly 9 polyps in his gut, two of which have red tips. The doctor suggest two treatment options, one of which is to remove these polyps from anus, and the other option is to apply minimally invasive surgery for the removal of polyps. At the same time, metastatic cancer cells were also detected in his liver, forming two lesions of different size.
Now he mainly takes treatment combining chemotherapy and interventional therapy. Chemotherapy has been practiced for more than a year and most commonly, twice in each month. To be more exacted, he goes for 3 days of chemotherapy every 12 days. Previously he used Irinotecan, but recently it started to develop resistance, so he replaced it by Oxaliplatin. In addition, Mr. Teng has been applying interventional treatment for about once a month, but it’s not fixed, depending on his specific circumstances. The drugs enter mainly from the artery to surround the tumor, and block the blood vessel supplying nutrients for cancer cells, commonly known as ""starve cancer"

Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Lab Book#CRISPRi_-_-_TEXT.html," the observations of CRISPR interference systems reported in the literature
. To ensure that our parameters were at fault, rather than the fact that we were examining CRISPR in S. aureus instead of E. coli, we consulted fluorescence results from the laboratory, which showed that unrepressed YFP continued to fluoresce after several hours.
Parameter Adjustment
Confident that the initial model was inaccurate, we had to update some of the model parameters. We were least sure of our estimates of the mRNA production rates from the literature and manual fiddling showed that CRISPR interference in the model with adjustments to the production rates only. Accordingly, we used MATLAB fmincon to find updated mRNA production rates and fixed all other parameters.
In the MATLAB fmincon parameter search, we generated an error function by comparing the sum of squares error of the model YFP dynamics to time-series data derived Qi et al.
, who measured repression with CRISPRi and found a short delay followed by exponential decay with a 35-minute half life. We assumed that the delay and rate of decay would be similar in our system, but fixed the final level of repression according to the two extremes reported by Bikard et al. (6-Fold and 35-Fold)
. The simulated time-series data and the model output after the parameter search are compared below.
Satisfied with these fits, we simulated the system again using the fitted values for the mRNA production rates. The model output using the novel parameter sets are shown below for both the 6-fold and 35-fold simulations. The results with and without CRISPR interference are contrasted as before, though now a difference is observed when CRISPR inteacts with YFP
Simulated System Dynamics with 6-Fold Repression
Simulated System Dynamics with 35-Fold Repression
The system dynamics differ quite notably depending on the fit: in the 6-fold system, the equilibrium levels of sgRNA are quite low while the equilibrium levels of dCas9 mRNA are high, which is reversed in the 35-fold system. More laboratory characterization would be needed to determine which model most closely replicates the actual system dynamics. However, the two sets of parameters provide a basis for sensitivity analysis and some idea of the expected time-series repression.

The Pheromone Trap
Introduction of Pheromones
A pheromone is a secreted or excreted chemical factor that triggers a social response among members of the same species. Pheromones are capable of acting outside the body of the secreting individual to impact the behavior of the receiving individuals.
There are many kinds of pheromones such as alarm pheromones, food trail pheromones, sex pheromones, and many others that affect behavior or physiology.
Sex pheromones are an important factor in finding a mating partner. When a female releases chemicals, the mating search is initiated, and the male moths begin their upwind motion toward their potential partner. Pheromones have the ability to propel long-distance attraction and are emitted by the  abdominal glands of female insects in most cases.
How to Produce Pheromones
There are 2 main ways to produce pheromones. One through chemical synthesis, and the other through biosynthesis approach.
Chemical Synthesis Approach Used in Factory for Massive Production
It is difficult to make pheromone with a chemical synthesis approach. This approach requires many kinds of chemical compound which may cause pollution to the environment. Furthermore, the control of reacting condition may consume a lot of energy. An example of chemical synthesis approach: Leafroller moth, Bonagota cranaodes.
Fig.1-3-1 If we want to produce the pheromone of Leafroller moth (Bonagota cranaodes) by chemical synthesis approach, we have to purchase expensive equipment to control the conditions. And it may produce toxic byproducts.(34)(Paulo H. G. Zarbin et al. 2007)
Simulating the Biosynthetic Pathway in Insects with E.coli
Biosynthesis approach requires the cooperation of different enzymes, which is too complicated for E.coli to carry out. In addition, E.coli lacks Glycoproteins for posttranslational modification. Therefore, it is nearly impossible for E.coli to produce pheromones.
Fig.1-3-2 If we want to produce the pheromone of Gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar. We have to pass at least four complicated pathways. That will be highly stressful for E.coli, and it may also cause low efficiency of producing pheromone.(35)(Russell Jurenka, 2004)

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". The students were very curious to hear why we decided to spend our summer in the lab! We also introduced the newbies to our iGEM project and asked them whether they would wear a patch with bacteria on their skin. Interestingly, after sharing some information on the role of the bacteria in our design, they seemed to agree that they would wear the patch if we could ensure the safety of the patch.
August 27, 2018. Burn wound center Maasstad Ziekenhuis
As several experts  told us that our patch could have potential as a treatment of burn wounds, we wanted to know more about the options and requirements. We contacted Dr. Jan Dokter, specialized in burn wounds at the Maasstad Ziekenhuis. This hospital in Rotterdam hosts one of the three Dutch centers specialized in the treatment of burn wounds. They treat approximately 300 patients annually, who represent 45% of all Dutch patients with severe burn wounds. Dr. Dokter was so kind to invite us over for a visit.

August 27, 2018. Burn wound center Maasstad Ziekenhuis
After getting changed into a blue apron (burn wounds a very prone to infections indeed), we were welcomed by what seemed to be the entire team of the burn wound department. Dr. Dokter and colleagues told us that the treatment  of (antibiotic-resistant) bacterial infections is high on their priority list. This is because burn wounds are never sterile, since they are always colonized by bacteria. The goal of the medical team is to contain the bacteria and to prevent them from developing into an infection, as this could be lethal. Currently, containment is done through systemic use of antibiotics, mechanical cleaning of the wounds and/or antibacterial creams. However, they recently observed an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as MRSA, meaning that an alternative like ours would be very welcome. They told us they would already order some patches if possible. 😉They also foresaw benefits for the patients, as wound dressings must be changed regularly: two times a week for small burn wounds, and even daily for larger ones. As changing is painful for the patients, it would be great to use a wound dressing like ours which could stay on the wound for a prolonged time while ensuring drugs are administered to the wound.
Although they were very enthusiastic about our product, they also saw some room for improvement. Their advice was to complement lysostaphin with other systems to target different bacteria. Bacteria found by the Maasstad burn wound center in burn wounds include Staphy"

When she isn't working on iGEM, she practices aikido, a Japanese martial art, and is generally interested in Japanese philosophy and culture. She is very educated and masters eight languages at the age of 25, largely due to several years spent abroad. She has lived in South America for half a year and in Japan for a year, and these stays have made up the foundation of her mastery of Spanish and Japanese.
She has a great passion for mushrooms which she collects, dries and displays in glass jars. She is also a vegetarian.

Søren is also one of our philosophy students, currently on his fourth year, and, as opposed to Sif, he is a true humanist. Although he is only 22, he is easily pictured sitting in a large, cushioned chair by the fire, smoking a pipe of fine tobacco and pondering the mysteries of life.
He has been a inexpendable asset in the development of our human practice project. He has made a great effort to understand all the details of microbiology before we started the serious part of our project and has been invaluable as a mediator in our discussions, particularly in the discussion about watermarking.
When he's away from his cushioned chair, he enjoys listening to heavy metal and playing Munchkin.

Tommy is a hardcore chemist, and during his four years of study, all the chemicals have taken their effect. He is the funny guy on the team, entertaining us all with homemade words such as his favourite swear: “Craparoo”. There can be no doubt about when Tommy has finished an experiment. He loudly exclaims “Done!” in a way that only he can reproduce.
In the lab, Tommy has been a great help calculating concentrations.
Tommy dreams of becoming a famous black rapper called Dr. T (another thing only he can say properly), but he’ll probably end up actually using his education and become the leader of a high tech lab.
When he’s not spending his time on iGEM, he enjoys drinking, gossiping and spending time with his lovely girlfriend.
By the way, he’s 24.

First, we tried to clone fhlA by PCR using specific primers to the wild-type genome of E. coli.(Jm109) However, unfortunately, the fhlA gene contains an Pst1 restriction site. Therefore, we had to introduce a silent mutation in the sequence of this restriction site by Site-Directed Mutagenesis using inverse PCR. We called this fhlA with a silent mutation mutationfhlA.(mfhlA) Next, we introduced mutagenesis at the codons corresponding to the amino acid replacements E363G in mFhlA by Site-Directed Mutagenesis using inverse PCR. We named this gene mfhlA(E363G). The hycAp sequence was also obtained by PCR using specific primers and the wild-type genome of E.coli. (Jm109)
The RBS, the promoter, the double terminator and the GFP that we selected are the following.
pLac: BBa_R0011
RBS: BBa_B0032
d.Term: BBa_B0014
RBS-GFP (+LVA Tag)-Terminators: BBa_I763020
After obtaining the genes we wanted by PCR, we ligated them.
1. pLac-RBS-fhlA-d.term: BBa_K778007
2. pLac-RBS-fhlA(E363G)-d.term: BBa_K778008
Then, we inserted these into the pSB1A2 plasmid. We cultivated E.coli with the plasmid in anaerobic conditions, because the genes coding the FHL complex are expressed only under anaerobic conditions, and assayed the amount of H2 produced by using Gaschromatography(GC).
We assayed the amount of H2 produced in three types of E.coli: wild type, mfhlA and mfhlA(E363G) .

GFP production model for diffusion simulation
Sunday, August 3rd
We need an efficient way to simulate diffusion experiments. A receiver cell at the end of a channel receives AHL produced by the well at the other end of the channel, and starts to produce GFP. By using quasi steady state aproximations (considering that binding is much faster than transcription and diffusion), we have a simple equation for GFP production as a function of AHL :
Equations and approximations for the model of GFP production by sensor cells used in simulation of diffusion and cross-talk experiments
By using producer cells on one side of the channel and receiver cells in the other side, and putting cells in a punched cylinder in agar, we should see fluorescence appear at different times depending on the channel length (1 to 4mm) :

Here is our first millifluidic chip for diffusion experiments ! This time we used a layer of PDMS thin enough so that we could peel it without breaking it. In some wells will be added producer cells or pure AHL, and in the wells on the other side of the channels, receiver cells. There are several lengths of channels, this should enable us to retrieve diffusion parameters by recording when receiver cells start glowing.

PLASMID CONSTRUCTION
5μl samples of the double enzyme digestion products for tcdA1-device were loaded onto a 1% BioRad Ready Agarose Mini Gel, then subjected to AGE. See (protocol) for AGE parameters. Sizes of the XbaI and PstI–cleaved assemblies were determined by AGE analysis. The DNA size standards were the DL5,000 DNA Marker (M2; TaKaRa, Cat#3428A) and 1kb DNA Ladder (Dye Plus)(M2; TaKaRa, Cat#3426A). Bands were visualized with a Shanghai Peiqing JS-380A Fluorescence Imager.
First we construct the tcdA1 device in pSB1A2. Our target fragments can be clearly seen in the right position (figure 6). As the fragment is a little big(7.2k), the efficiency is low when we change the backbone to pSB1C3 and the unwanted fragment is hard to explain(Figure 7).

Overview
Army West Point
Our team had a video conference with team Cadets2Vets in late June. During the video conference we were able to discuss a few issues that the Army team was having with their project. Due to our teams past experience we were able to not only give advice, but we were also able to correct some of the minor issues they were having with their project. We were also able to give insight as to how to prepare for the jamboree and what they should expect.
Airforce
Our team also had a video conference with the Air force team in late June. We mainly discussed the interlab studies with this team. At this point in the summer our team was able to complete the majority of the interlab study, so we gave them a few suggestions. We were also able to answer a few questions regarding the project as a whole. As a team sponsored by a secure laboratory, it becomes difficult in some aspects for the team that are taken for granted by other non-military teams. For example, our team and the air force team was restricted in the ability to take pictures in the lab and even to bring our work with us at the end of the day. This was due to the level of security that was apparent at these military research facilities. As an iGEM veteran, our team was able to give them key advice on how to get around some of these restrictions.
NRL
We were fortunate enough to collaborate with the Naval Research lab to debunk a few misconceptions the civilian population might have about the use of synthetic biology in the military. We were able to contribute to a podcast that will be available on the NRL website sometime in November. In this podcast, we talk about the military and their use of synthetic biology, why as Midshipmen and Future officers in the Navy and Marine Corps it is important to be knowledgeable in these biological advancements."

Brainstorming
This page contains a summary of the ideas we developed throughout our brainstorming sessions towards the beginning of the project.
Bacterial sunscreen
- Evidence suggests that several components found in most sunscreens are harmful to us and can be carcinogenic, also most sunscreens only protect against UV B (315-280 nm) and not UV A
- These sunscreens use metal oxides (Zinc oxide) to absorb UV radiation, but the effects of absorbing these metals into your skin are not fully understood and are thought to lead to production of reactive oxygen species and could lead to melanomas rather than preventing them.
- Scytonemin is a pigment found in cyanobacteria which protects them from UV radiation, absorbing 325-425nm. Its synthesis requires three enzymes, SycA-C
Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are produced by organisms adapted to environments with high levels of sunlight (eg. cyanobacteria and algae), protecting them from UV radiation. There are 20 types and they also serve as anti-oxidants by stabilising free radicals (anti-ageing?). In a bioinformatics study the genes YP_324358 (predicted DHQ synthase) and YP_324357 (O-methyltransferase) were identified in A. variabilis PCC 7937 cyanobacteria. (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888754309002353) MAAs have already been recognised to have sunscreen potential and are found in some anti-wrinkle creams
- gene cluster encoding 4 enzymes required for all MAA synthesis. Expressed this gene cluster from a cyanobacterium into E. coli and got pigment production. (Text by"

Workshops
We keep in mind the importance of interacting with the public and getting feedback from them, at at the same time communicate about science, synthetic biology and citizen science.  We collaborated with several institutions and teams to organize events and workshops where participants could test spectrophotometer units… or even build their own units!
Figure 7: DI-lambda Luna. It is a version designed specifically for our workshop at the ​NightScience 2015 conference held at the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity in Paris. Largely based on the test rig model, with some added elegance. It is easy to build, and can be used for Do-It-yourself workshops. Search on github to get the complete design!

NightScience conference at the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity in Paris was an opportunity in early July to meet 10 testers that built a simplified 1-channel version called DI-lambda Luna (Fig. 6). They had a high interest in electronics and synbio but low knowledge.
We took some time to cross the English channel and visit our friends at UCL. We spent a few days in London in the iGEM bootcamp organized by the students of UCL with the participation of synbio enthusiastics, high school students from UCL academy, and UCL, Birkbeck and London Hackerspace iGEM teams (Fig. 7). The pictures are just beautiful!

What is next?
We are planning to make this tool available to more people and be able to mass produce it, keeping a cheap price and simple design. The interesting features of this tool are the low price and the ease to hack it, tune it to a specific need.
In order to do this tool and many more, this tool will continue integrated in the project Open Science School, at the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity of Paris.
Please, do not hesitate to contact us if you want further information."

Interview with Prof. Ingo Potrykus
Prof. Ingo Potrykus
This is a translation from the german original questions and answers ( see below ) done by a student. We try to translate as accurately as possible, but we are no ribosomes. No mistake that arises through translation mistakes is intended.
Question: Is the elongation of the Moratorium an indication for the little appreciation by society and politics of research regarding GMP in Switzerland?
Answer: The elongation is an indication for the influence of the farmers lobby that expects higher incomes with food labeled ‘not genetically modified’.
Q: How do you react on people that sabotage the research of GMP in outdoor tests?
A: I think they are misguided idealists that do not understand about GMPs. Never the less their actions are against the law and should be fined. The destruction of fields of GMPs can destroy years of work of PhD students and compromise their graduation.
Q: In other words: Does the moratorium say that gene technology is safe, but not in Switzerland where the resentments of the public are greater than the benefit of GMPs?
A: Approximately yes.
Q: Which consequences does the moratorium have for the research on GMPs?
A: The series of moratoriums decisively contributed to the fact that research with GMP makes no more sense in Switzerland, with all consequences. Switzerland bows out of the development of a technology that is regarded as ‘strategic future technology’ in many other countries. Switzerland once had a leading position on this field (see golden rice project).
Q: Should Switzerland, after the results of the NRP59, not be a pioneer in GMPs to raise the acceptance elsewhere? How could one convince the Swiss of"

Integrated Human Practices
From our initial idea, the design of our toehold switches and our model to the future applications of our project, the opinions of specialists have been vital in influencing our work.
Here, we have broken our project down into its different parts. For each, we explain the role feedback played in improving the aspect of the project, and why we changed what we did.

Dr Kirsten Jensen
Our initial constructs used a constitutive promoter. After cloning our construct in pSB1C3 plasmid, we attempted to amplify them in E. coli. However upon sequencing the amplified inserts, none of the sequences were what we expected to find.
We asked Dr Kirsten Jensen, an expert in synthetic biology at Imperial College London for advice. She inspected our sequences and suggested that the transcripts from our constructs were toxic to E. coli. She therefore suggested that we switch our promoter to an inducible promoter to avoid synthesis of the transcript during amplification in E. coli.
Following her advice, we used an arabinose inducible promoter, which resolved the issue for the 15b-5p switches and allowed us to continue with our experiments. However, the 27b-3p switches were still toxic.
See the results page for more details.

Dundee_Schools,2016,Team:Dundee Schools#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," standard deviation, however, we would need to run some further experiments to see if this is truly the case.
Looking at these results, it can be seen that we have managed to prove that our S.O.R.D. can be secreted and that our spiRNA from E. coli is able to affect the motility of bacteria. Some further experiments we could have ran would be to test our spiRNA containing a chiA Hfq binding site from Serratia marcesens to see if it also works at reducing bacteria motility. We know Hfq is an RNA binding protein but we don’t know how this function could be affect once it is fused together with OsmY. In future, we could run an experiment called an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to see if it can still bind to the spiRNA."

Temperate phage models
Why consider a temperate phage?
One of the biggest issues surrounding Clostridium difficile infection, is that of reinfection. We originally planned on using a temperate phage, modified so that it could not enter the lytic cycle, with the hope that a stable population of non-toxigenic lysogens (see lab pages for how we developed non-toxigenic C. difficile) would be formed that could outcompete toxigenic C.difficile strains [10]. Hence, we wanted to model the interaction between our engineered temperate phage and bacteria to see if a steady state could be reached and what conditions would be necessary for this to occur. We also wanted to see the time difference in effective treatment between a lytic and temperate phage to ensure that we did not sacrifice speed of treatment in order to prevent reinfection. We later decided to see what would happen if we allowed for phage to undergo induction.
Click on the links below to see our results for both models.
Model without induction Model with induction Induction as a function of phage concentration
Comparison of models
In this section we compare lytic and temperate phage models in order to direct the phage modification strategy employed in the laboratory. We wanted to predict whether it would be beneficial to produce a strictly temperate phage or whether the natural lytic cycle of the phage should be left untouched. The models were compared in terms of the proportion of lysogens to toxigenic bacteria, the speed of action and the potential for phage to remain in the system to prevent reinfection.
Click on the link below to see our model comparison.
View section
Methodology
In this section we focus on finding and classifying equilibrium points for two types of system, one with the ability to induce a lytic life cycle and one which models a strictly temperate phage. This information is important as it allows us to identify the conditions that must be satisfied by a phage in order to lead to a long term population of lysogens and free phage

Parameters
The utility of a model is strongly dependent upon the parameters used. Some of the parameters used were acquired from relevant literature while others were determined experimentally in the laboratory. One key parameter was that of decay rate which an analysis of phage literature revealed to be strongly positively correlated with burst size. This correlation"
Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," questions can be set and discussed in seminars with the supervisors, and meetings with other students. These questions might include:
What is the context and what are the current hypotheses in this field?
How relevant to the field of Synthetic Biology is the paper?
Has this paper been cited before? If so, how respectable is the journal?
What is the rationale for the study?
What is the aim of this study? Is it clearly represented/logical and well reasoned?
What are the methods used in this study?
What are the key results and how are they evaluated/analysed?
What conclusions are drawn?
What are the implications for this research? Are there any future challenges?
Does this paper provide the foundations for more pioneering future research into Synthetic Biology?
This exercise will aid the student with the other papers during this module.
Lectures:
There will be a lecture series running throughout the module which aims to give the students a more comprehensive understanding of the theory behind Synthetic Biology as well as opportunities to look further at outside reading around the subjects studied. The students will study:
The Fundamentals of Synthetic Biology
Genetics overview/recap e.g. central dogma, mutations, gene splicing, nucleic acids etc
Molecular Biology recap
Microbial growth
Fermentation, bioreactors and microbial biotechnology
Factors affecting gene regulation
Circuit design and logic gates
Plasmid design, construction and sequencing and vectors
Biosafety, kill switches and ethics
BioBricks
Cloning strategies
DNA constructs and genome integration
Overview of biological modelling and design of experiment
The students will also support this theory with understand of the analytical techniques and practical skills in Synthetic Biology - which will be looked into further with the practical element of the module.
Practicals - in the latter half of the module:
Students will be given a list of parts, a selection of BioBricks, which they will later be able to access and told to design a plasmid which includes the gene that codes for the production of a fluorescent protein or biosensor for example. The students will have to research methods of plasmid construction and design an experiment; this uses elements from the journal club and the lecture series. They will then be tasked with constructing this plasmid in small groups (of around 4) in labs and if successful, the protein will be expressed.
Formative Assessment:
Lecturer and demonstrator feedback during practicals - assessed orally.
Summative Assessment:
The summative assessment will take the form of a mini iGEM project wherein the students will be assessed on three skills:

Intro
Starting this summer, we have formed connections and maintained communications with other high school                     and                     collegiate teams, and we are glad that we could offer our help to some of the teams, and happy to                     receive theirs.
RDFZ-China
We provided lab resources to team RDFZ-China for two times. In the first time, we provided Kit Plate                     4 N4                     L12 and Kit Plate 3 G6 I6 F22 to their team. In the second time we provided bacteria solution of PSB                     1c3                     with designed restriction enzyme cutting site. Since high school teams do not usually have the                     financial                     support from school, most of the lab materials used by RDFZ are purchased by their team members. We                     are                     very happy to share our lab resources and help keep their experiments going and make their project                     come                     true.
Shipment Coordination
Because of the fact that the person responsible for receiving part in Genescript has recently                     resigned                     from his position, so there was a period of confusion where all the teams in China didn’t know who                     to                     send their parts too. One of our team leader Ruohong Wang actively communicated with the Genescript                     company and after rounds of negotiation finally got to know the new recipient of all the team’s                     parts.                     After knowing this piece of information, Ruohong spread the news the all the teams in China and                     helped                     all of them with this shipping problem.
