Porine-pIV leaky-Marciano : BBa_K2093000
The BioBrick that we submitted encodes a mutated version of the pIV porin from the filamentous bacteriophage f1. Those secretins are quite interesting since their opening are controlled by phages (1). When expressed in E. coli, this porin is localized in the outer membrane. The mutation confers a ""leaky"" phenotype to the bacteria, i.e. periplasmic content is released in the culture supernatant (2). Spagnuolo and his team used a random mutation technique, followed by a positive selection to get those leaky mutants. Indeed mutants having trouble to stay entirely closed or opened (leaky), were obtained after mutations in the C-terminal secretin family domain; GATE 1 and GATE 2 and in the N-terminal (periplasmic portion) which could be involved in the controlled opening of the gate.
This property is potentially useful for secreting recombinant proteins or metabolites. When expressed in E. coli strains lacking the endogenous lamB outer membrane protein, the pIV allows the bacteria to grow on oligomaltosides (tetra-, penta-, hexa- and hepta-maltose) as carbon source.
The part is expected to work under different promoters. Furthermore this part contain a sequence which allows the protein to be inserted in the outer membrane of the bacteria.

Discussion with an Agronomist
The Cardiff-Wales team brought our project idea to their agronomist mentor, who suggested that while stem rust is not a problem in the UK, it could be a good baseline system for the monitoring of other airborne plant pathogens. The agronomist also mentioned that with the Puccinia strains, it would be prudent to keep the 7-day period between infection to the expression of symptoms in crops. The system could not be applied to the early detection of crop pathogens in Britain, but it could be a useful tool for data collection purposes.
The agronomist also estimated that research stations would be willing to pay up to 10,000 pounds (or 13,000 USD) for one of our devices."

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," pupils work on a self-chosen project and present their results at regional levels and later at a national contest to an expert jury. Some winners of this competition were invited to Aachen and visited different scientific places. We organized a presentation and a tour through the laboratory for them. It was inspiring to see, what an immense interested and advanced knowledge about science they have already have.
After the presentation, we had a chance to talk about our project and the iGEM competition.
It was amazing to be able to enthuse these promising young people further for synthetic biology.
Writing Competition
In the German society knowledge about synthetic biology is not very widespread: we found out that the possibilities for people to inform themselves about synthetic biology are very limited which causes a mostly negative attitude towards this subject. Many are sceptical and focused more on the dangers than the possibilities. That’s why we wanted to give especially young people an exciting opportunity to get in touch with synthetic biology via a writing and arts competition - submissions of all group of ages were welcomed. Participants were encouraged to deal with aspects of synthetic biology in a creative way and express how they feel about it. Combining their great ideas with this topic led to amazing stories, which built a bridge between the scientific society and open minded people who were inspired to create their own opinion about synthetic biology.
The winner in our iGEM writing competition 2016 was Hannah Lanzrath with her story titled “14. Oktober 2044”.
Figure 4: Prize for the best story.

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Project Idea#Pre study_-_-_TEXT.html," lot in articles such as this in the context of vitiligo. Therfore, I think this transcription factor seems to be good to introduce into the skin and further into melanocytes.
""Recently, beyond the already large group of genes activated by MITF, other potential targets were identified by using the microarrays in MITF-overexpressing human melanoma cells (20). Because severe MITF mutations preclude the development of embryonic melanocytes (21) and MITF is required for the survival of adult and even malignant melanocytes (22), the MITF protein is believed to be an essential regulator of the life and differentiation of melanocytes.
Melanomas generally express high levels of MITF, although these levels differ greatly among melanoma cell lines and cells in the tumor tissue."" - ‘‘Transcription physiology’’ of pigment formation in melanocytes: central role of MITF p. 2
Nina: MITF seems to activate genes that code for enzymes which can take care of free radicals (ROS). The ROS have been shown to be accumulated in vitiligo skin since maybe a lack of these important enzymes, hence melanocytes die because of the many ROS.
""MITF controls not only expression of pigmentation-related genes but also genes involved in diverse biological processes in melanoma cells (Fig. 1a) such as proliferation, invasiveness, resistance to apoptosis and stress mediated by reactive oxygen species, and possibly metastasis."" - ‘‘Transcription physiology’’ of pigment formation in melanocytes: central role of MITF p. 2
Nina: MITF looks to be very important to melanocytes.
""At least four different transcription factors participate in the transactivation of the MITF gene in melanocytes: the paired box-containing transcription factor PAX3, a sex determining region Y (SRY) family member SOX10, the Wnt ⁄ b-catenin pathway effector LEF-1 and the cAMP pathway effector cAMP response element binding (CREB) (Fig. 2), with the last two proteins being probably more important for the maintenance of MITF levels in melanoma cells"" - ‘‘Transcription physiology’’ of pigment formation in melanocytes: central role of MITF p. 3
Nina: If it becomes to difficult in the practicals to introduce the transcription factor MITF, we may introduce instead the transcription factors involved in activating MITF in melanocytes, but hopefully we do not need to make this step.

Future Direction: Cellulase Pairing.docx
Future Direction: Cellulase Pairing
            Polysaccharides are a convenient energy storage system for many organisms. In order to use the energy, the organism must break down the polysaccharide chain into smaller mono- and disaccharides. Cellulose is one such polysaccharide, an energy storage form for plants. Glucose monomers link together in long rigid chains to form cellulose.
The plasmid breaks down plant products that are not cellulose, but similar in structure (hemicellulose and pectin). We have three enzymes to accomplish this: xynA, bglS, and yesZ. The endo-1,4-beta-xylanase xynA cleaves xylan polysaccharide chains to form shorter xylan chains. The enzyme yesZ has beta-galactosidase (beta-galacturonidase) activity, cleaving exo-1,4-beta-D-galactans to produce single galactose molecules from RG I Pectin. The endo-1,3-1,4-beta-glucanase (bglS) will cleave internal 1,4 linkages adjacent to 1,3 linkages.
A secretion system (One ring to secrete them all) has been designed to release the enzymes from the bacteria. This mechanism is the central focus of the project and will be the most helpful to other iGEM teams The “One ring to secrete them all” system can be used to secrete any other enzyme/molecule chosen by an iGEM team.
Finally, a safety mechanism is included in the plasmid design. If the plasmid is ejected from the bacteria and picked up by another, the gene producing the toxin will not be suppressed and will kill the cell.
In future experiments, other enzyme-producing genes will be added to break down plant material further. Cellulase genes are first in line, as cellulose is the largest composition of cell wall. The 2008 Edinburgh team designed"
Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Detectives_-_-_TEXT.html," questions to ask. As a group we did a few trials of DNA extraction from strawberries in order to become proficient in our techniques for the Telus Spark adults only night the following week. We experimented with various strengths and types of alcohol, freezing, thawing, and incubation times and also whether or not the strawberries were frozen in order to optimize the process of making the “DNA-daiquiri’s”.
We continued our efforts to clone the parts necessary for our genetic circuit. Many of the small parts (e.g. promoters and RBS) could not be validated with confidence either with colony PCR or restriction digest because their sequences are so short, therefore we instead ordered PCR primers to ‘synthesize’ the small parts by essentially filling in the gaps at the ends. We also went over the BioBrick assembly scheme and are ready to begin assembly of our reporter/repressor genes.
We are still looking for a suitable reporter. At this point we think that the most appropriate reporter will likely be an enzyme capable of producing a colored product, this would allow for a large degree of signalling without the side effects of cytotoxicity from the accumulation of recombinatory protein. The enzyme could potentially produce more product and therefore more response than the production of recombinatory protein would allow. Two examples of potential enzymatic reporters found in the registry are the lacZ and xylE genes. We are also considering using a novel enzyme which we could characterize and submit to the iGEM registry.
Week 5: June 9 - 11
Assembly of our reporter/repressor constructs is predicted to be troublesome. To hedge our bets we began designing sequences for synthesis. These sequences are essentially identical to what our in-lab assembled constructs will be, including scars between the BioBricks (Fig. 1). Literature research was performed on the subject of reporters. We are interested in finding and using a novel reporter in the form of an enzyme/substrate, we feel that the enzyme/substrate may be the best choice since we can obtain a continuous signal without risking recombinant-protein toxicity. However, we are also exploring chromophoric proteins. We are considering the lux and electrochemical reporters for a potential ‘premium tier’ version of our detector which may be of use in more advanced laboratory settings.

The  bacterial liquid had fluorescence, both of them! This exciting news had raised  our hope. Isolated the plasmids and digested for restrict analysis. The result  indicated that one of the bacterial culture was correct! So added 100 μL  aliquot into LB, attempting to make bacterial glycerol stocks. However, strange  thing was that liquid culture had not illuminated! Added another 100μL  aliquot into LB and put two LB in the shaker at 37°C.

Isolated  the plasmid of original correct bacterial in 21th and two liquid culture in  22nd from the original one. Ran on a gel for restriction analysis. The result  was beyond belief: only the band of  original one was correct, but it seemed that once we add 100μL  aliquot of original bacteria into new LB, the band went wrong. We cannot figure  out why this strange thing could happen.

We cultivated bacterias contains these plasmid and their control group in the same condition and value their integral function by monitoring the fluorescent density and its ratio to the OD value.
In integrated plasmid A, GFP is co-expressed with gdh under start-stop codon” TGATG” or with Hairpin. Their control groups is a GFP-gdh uncoupling expressing group and a single GFP group. The relatively density (fluorenscent / Optical) result shows that both two kinds of integrated plasmid A can help increase the final relative expression level of GFP.

Chewing over the agenda.
Although we had encountered many problems at the beginning, we were extremely grateful that all the difficulties could be overcome with the assistance from our instructors and the team members of the NCTU_Formosa (2013).
We were more than delighted to see the iGEM 2014 turned out to be a wonderful and successful conference in that the whole meeting went smoothly, and more details and trivialities could be well taken care of throughout each individual section.
Fig.2-1-4 Presentation of our device.
As a warm-up Asian Jamboree, the Conference set up a stage for each team to present their projects and posters for exchanging research ideas, sharing experiences, or acknowledging difficulties that all delegates have encountered.
Fig.2-1-5 Discussion of our device.
We were not only grateful to acquire all the feedbacks and advices on our project, but were also deeply intrigued and impressed by the projects carried out by the other teams. Their endeavors and methods were indeed very inspiring that have helped us to generate more research ideas, and to raise the possibilities for collaborations with other teams.
Fig.2-1-6 Taiwanese banquet.
In addition to the scientific sections, we also arranged several social events, including a welcome party, one-day trip in Taipei, and a roadside banquet as the farewell party. We believed the traditional Taiwanese cuisines and unique foods of night markets might be the most effective vehicle to make friends and strengthen our relationships with the delegates from abroad. Despite being exhausted in planning and hosting all these events, we hoped that all delegates felt entertained and welcomed.

K2020052 to K2020061
– tRNA synthetase specific for DMNB-serine and UAG codon in E. coli → version 1 to 10 All of these parts are variants of a DMNBS-synthetase to be used as an orthogonal synthetase in E. coli. Each of them can be used in combination with the cognate tRNA BBa_K2020042 to incorporate DMNBS in response to an amber stop codon.
Incorporation of ncAA: Photo-cleavable non-canonical amino acids offer the opportunity to control protein function on a non-invasive basis. Working with non-canonical amino acids requires an additional, orthogonal pair of a tRNA and a cognate synthetase i.e. which does not crossreact with the endogenous tRNA/synthetase pairs. The tRNA's anticodon is mutated to an amber stop anticodon. Hence, it is possible to incorporate an amino acid at a chosen position in a protein via amber codon suppression. A previously reported tRNA/synthetase pair for O-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl)-L-serine (DMNBS), which derived from Escherichia coli and was used in Saccharomyces cerevisiae leads to the lack of a possibility to work with non-canonical amino acids replacing serine in E. coli by using a 21st amino acid. Based on computational modeling a tRNA synthetase for DMNBS in E. coli was designed by creating a semi rational mutation library. Assembly in a synthetase plasmid for incorporation of ncAA: Most synthetases are used in low copy plasmids (e.g. pACYC). The tRNA and the synthetase have to be assembled in a low copy plasmid, each one with its own promoter and only one terminator. Host organism: This reporter plasmid and the measurement of its corresponding proteins expressed are previously used both in an amberless E. coli strain and BL21 DE3 gold. The latter results in competition of the suppressor tRNA with RF1 at the amber stop codon. Screening Results:

If the levels of optical density of the tRNA synthetase to be evaluated and a working synthetase are equal, a first approximation of efficiency and fidelity can be made by normalizing GFP levels. Thus, one can eliminate"

China_Tongji,2015,Team:China Tongji#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," optogenetics, we may find a better way to solute this problem.We can stimulate the dopaminergic neuron and let it secret more dopamine so that the mental condition of patient will be remitted. Besides, there are research shows that when express activated opsins into mice brain, the anxiety behavior will decrease under the irradiation of light. This strongly proved that this technique can be used in treatment of depression one day in the future!
6.3 Useful tool in scientific research
6.3.1 Research of neural circuit
As a quick operate tool, neither will it make extra damage on biological sample like electric stimulation, nor it would appear the inaccurate area like traditional stimulation method. At present, optogenetics can achieve ‘ms’ level optical control on intact mammal neural circuit. This offers wider approaches for research on neuron which has contact with specific cell.
6.3.2 Research of animal behavior
Optogenetics can also be used in research of animal behavior. For instance, researchers use optogenetics to make dopamine secret inside drosophila’s body. This will accompany with obvious behavior. So they can figure out the relationship with the dopaminergic neuron’s actions and drosophila’s behavior, which will be very difficult to use traditional method to make position locate.
6.3.3 Research of neuropharmacology experiment
Traditional neuropharmacology experiments rely on detection of behaviors, which is slow and inaccurate. Optogenetics let us can operate the behavior easier. Like what we have done in our project, we use this technique finding out the specific function of different muscle or neurons. Besides, traditional method should use couple of days to remove the drug completely, while optogenetics only need very little time.
6.4 Conclusion
We can see from the material above that optogenatics has unlimited potential in real life’s medical care. We still need to work on this topic for a long time!

Being the first time we used the Building with Biology kits with the public, we found it to be excellent conversation starters on what synthetic biology could do. Many parents wanted to learn more, and we directed them to Building with Biology website. We worked with about 60 students at the event.
Public Forums
September 28, 2016
October 18, 2016
At Broad Run High School we held two  public forum events to discuss and educate students about genetic engineering and synthetic biology. These events took place in the Independent Science Research class and Research Chemistry class of Ms. Kieninger, also our iGEM instructor. Each class had over 30 students and we used the entire hour and a half block for the forum. We discussed the effects of genetically engineered mosquitoes to combat the various harmful mosquito borne diseases such as Zika virus and malaria, that are rapidly spreading. Students weighed the pros and cons of releasing genetically engineered mosquitoes, and at the end, they decided whether or not the benefits outweighed the potential risks. During the public forum, we utilized components from the Building with Biology kits to give students a better understanding of how genetic engineering works,  and understand their views and questions about the subject.
Students recorded on notecards their final stance on the issue of releasing genetically engineered mosquitoes.

October 1, 2016
We were invited by Loudoun STEM Day director Laura Siko to be a facilitator at the 2016 Loudoun STEM Day. We used the Building with Biology kits Super Organisms, See DNA, and Kit of Parts. Additionally, we also used the popular Plasmid bracelet activity from William and Mary iGEM team’s teacher curriculum. At the full day event, students had fun while interacting with the kits. Working through the activities, we aimed for the students to get a sense of the interconnectedness of the activities from the DNA they extracted to the genetic parts they interacted with to create a super organism with special abilities. As we requested adults to fill out the survey, we had many interesting conversations. These ranged from general inquiries, expression of concerns on safety, to  vehement opposition to synthetic biology. We even had  a person who read our iGEM poster and surprisingly commented on how his father held a patent on microbial use in wastewater treatment. In total, we worked with over 300 students at the full day event.

versions, is prone to clogging to due to the mixing of the calcium chloride and sodium alginate solutions, making this chip inefficient to test.
Conclusion
While the chip did not completely work with the final design, we learned about the effects of viscosity on droplet-based microfluidic systems during the four chip iterations and subsequent weeks of testing. If we were to continue this project, the next step would be to perform a more in-depth study of the effects of viscosity on the generation of droplets in microfluidic devices by experimenting with various flow rates and chip geometries.

Our team hosted the Northeastern iGEM Conference (NEGEM) with the BostonU iGEM team. On July 6, 2018, the iGEM teams from Harvard, MIT, UCONN, BostonU Wetlab, and BostonU Hardware teams met at Boston University to present their work and share advice among teams. Each team presented within time constraints of the Jamboree, with 5 minutes allocated to set-up, 20 minutes for the presentation, and 5 minutes for questions. We created feedback forms for each team in order to create a simple and organized method of collecting feedback.
NEGEM gave our teams a great method of obtaining
feedback, networking for potential collaborations and getting Jamboree-like presentation experience.
Serial Dilution
Inspired by the InterLab Study, this series of chips attempts to follow the protocol of running three consecutive 1:20 dilutions followed by a pair of consecutive 1:10 dilutions. These sequences of mixers are then paired with an valve actuated output selection mechanism such that either the third, fourth, or fifth dilutions can be selectively dispensed onto an agar plate. Since the real estate on our desktop CNC milled microfluidic chips is limited, this protocol has been divided into two chips which, when run in tandem, accomplish these specific serial dilutions. The first chip in the system consists of three consecutive mixers, design with flow rates intended to handle the three 1:20 dilutions. The other chip will run the two 1:10 dilutions and the output selection mechanism.
Version 1
This initial chip consists of four inputs, one for the initial sample and the other three are used to dilute that initial sample by adding water."

What is the origin of the genetic material used? What does the the genetic materiale do in this origin? Is there uncertainty about the genetical materials function?
What modifications were done on the genetic materiale before insertion? If anything was modified, what function do you hope to achieve?
What vector did you use? Which antibiotic resistance were involved? Which protocol was used to insert the vector?
What is the stability of the insert with respect to genetic traits?
How easily can the insert transfer to other bacteria or lifeforms?
Where there safer alternatives to achieve this function? Where there safer alternatives to the host organism and vector used?
Is your construct watermarked?
The above list of question is more or less derived from a more throughout list of questions relevant to assessing the safety and securty of the parts, see appendix II.
Further Information
Risk-assessment for organism
Should the part, or a number of parts, be inserted into an organism the team should perform a risk-assessment and make it available on the parts-registry. In some countries, it is mandatory to submit a risk-assessment prior to engaging in a project involving synthetic biology, so we believe that any risk-assessments should be made public through parts-registry.
Inclusion of copyright information?
We do not believe in any form of copyright prohibition. We believe in an open-source approach to the field of synthetic biology, as in iGEM. Any copy-right prohibitions would only stall the progress in this most vital field of science. We believe that any and all information on created parts, and experience with these parts in particular organisms, should be shared freely.
Information on how to neutralize bacteria
This clause is intended as security measure. Should the bacteria be released into the environment, the parts-registry site should contain information on how to neutralize the bacteria. If the bacteria has an kill-code inserted, the site should describe how to enact the self-destruct mechanism.
Anticipated problems
Code deterioration
The code will deteriorate over time due to mutation. This could prove to be a serious problem should watermarking become an integrated part of synthetic biology. Should the genetic watermark deteriorate to the point where one is no longer able to read"

2017 Wet Lab Summary
The 2017 Lambert iGEM team worked two-fold on developing a proof of concept for the Chrome-Q and assembling a genetic construct to use the Chrome-Q to quantify data. In the process of advancing the Chrome-Q, there were three methods in which Lambert iGEM attempted to grow E. coli expressing color for data collection.
Several weeks were devoted to construct pλR LacI R011 RFP in the NEB 10-beta E. coli strain, with individual parts given from Monica McNerney at the Georgia Institute of Technology. However, the lack of RFP expression in the cells led the team to believe that the sequences - particularly RFP - were mutated when attempting to digest and ligate the parts together.
Next, the team referred to the parts registry to use existing chromoproteins. From Uppsala 2013, Lambert iGEM attempted to ligate AmilCP (BBa_K592009), Amaj Lime (BBa_K1033916), and CJ Blue (BBa_K592011) into backbones to obtain a variety of measurements on the Chrome-Q using the HSV color space. After adjusting digestion, ligation, and transformation protocols and still failing to see the expected color expression, the team referred back to Stanford-Brown’s wiki page on their usage of the chromoproteins for their project in 2016. It was discovered that their team also did not successfully transform those chromoproteins; as a result, they had ordered their parts to obtain their results.
Subsequently, to troubleshoot for both the RFP construct and Uppsala’s chromoproteins, Lambert iGEM ordered chromoproteins from ATUM: TinselPurple, ScroogeOrange, and VirginiaViolet. While the two purple chromoproteins (TinselPurple and VirginiaViolet) gave a variance of the color, ScroogeOrange provided a contrasting pigment for the Chrome-Q to measure. After successful transformations, liquid cultures were induced with varying levels of IPTG - 0uM, 10uM, 100uM, 500uM, and 1mM. Distinct visual differences were observed: incremental concentrations of IPTG"

Model
Model
In order to explain and model our final design—a “2-input-3-output” logic circuit, we introduce the neural network algorithm and establish our own neural network which consists of an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer.
Firstly, the input layer is composed of two units. The value of each unit can be chosen between 0 and 1, and when the value is chosen as 1, it presents that a specific input signal is added into our system. Accordingly, 0 presents that the specific input signal has not been introduced to our logic circuit. Here, our input signals are different kinds of small molecular which can regulate gene expression or the activation of its target proteins. And based our final design, we define Input-1 as tetracycline (Tet) and Input-2 as Tamoxifen(TM).
Secondly, the hidden layer is comprised of seven units that are chosen and established dependent on their biological roles. It should be noted that there are only four functional elements (a pair of Cre-Loxp sites, a H1/T0 promoter and two tet-on promoters) regulated by our two input signals, so we have three “bias units” in the hidden layer, which represents two ribozymes and a constitutive promoter respectively. Therefore, we get a biological functions-dependant hidden layer and it help this model become vividly.
In the last layer of our neural network, we have three units respectively representing three different kinds of output results which depend on different input signals. After comparing the value of each unit in the last layer with the threshold we choose (Here, we choose 0.5 as our threhold), we can obtain the anticipation result, and in our design, the results correspond to cell fate.
In addition, we also entrust biological significance to both weight matrixes. The parameter aijk (i represents the no. of the weight matrix; j represents the no. of the unit in the former layer; k represents the no. of the unit in the former layer) is defined as a measurement of the effect that the specific unit in the former layer has on the given unit in the latter layer. In detail, aijk can be 1, 0 or -1, and 1 presents that the effect was positive, 0 presents that there is no relationship between the two units and -1 shows that the unit in the former layer is a negative regulator of the specific unit in the latter layer.

Overview
Our project focuses on the drug screening of anti-cancer medicines, especially those that can prevent the growth of tumor cells by inhibiting the disaggregation of microtubule. The existing methods to extract microtubule are quite expensive and complex. What’s more, observing the aggregation or disaggregation level of tubulin requires electron microscope or spectrometer which can measure the light absorbtion in 350nm. Enormous inconveniences of using such equipment are obvious, not to mean the low accuracy in measurement. Based on current status, we hope to express human tubulin monomers in E.coli prokaryotic expression system, and use FLC(Firefly Luciferase Complementation) or BiFC(Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation) to detect the aggregation degree of tubulin monomers in vitro. Under visible spectrum, the detection should be more easy and sensitive.
Taxol is widely used among anti-cancer medicines. It can inhibit disaggregation therefore stabilize the tubulin [1] [15] , preventing the tumor cells from growing. Based on this principle, we plan to use our designed novel system to detect the existence of taxol, and hope to quantify its concentration through fluorescence intensity.
In order to achieve our goal, We ligate N-luciferase and C-luciferase(or YNE and YCE) to α-tubulin respectively for n-luc-α-tublin(YNE-α-tublin) and c-luc-α-tublin(YCE-α-tublin) vectors. We also construct β-tublin vector which can express β-tubulin monomer. All these vectors are transformed into E.coli TransB(DE3) cells for the expression of our objective proteins(Fig.0.1).
Fig.0.1 The production of our objective protein
After expression and purification of α-tubulin(linked with N/C terminal of signaling proteins) and β-tubulin, we mix them in vitro and add taxol sample. Fluorescence intensity will tell the concentration of taxol or its analog"

Therefore the aim is to produce 2.5 g of the   peptide aptamer per batch. The wanted concentration is reached by measuring the concentration at the   release of the broth and adjust the elution accordingly. This determines the volume   of the elution, the result can be viewed in table 13. Elution is performed with column buffer. If this buffer is   not suited for storage, it can be changed by dialysis, though for now it is assumed appropriate. Reference: NEB-impact

Regeneration is   performed by washing the bed with 3 BV of stripping solution (0.3 M Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)) and   then leaving the bed to soak for 30 minutes. After which the column is washed with additional 7 BV of the   stripping solution, followed with 20 BV of water. Lastly 5 BV of column buffer is applied. Reference: NEB-impact

To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was performed with T7 Promoter Forward and T7 Terminator Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly the band should be 360 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, then bands should be 837 bp long.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check for a second cloning control. We used BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes for cut-check.
WESTERN BLOTTING
After cloning GadE into pET45-b successfully, we did Western Blot experiment through  N-terminal located His Tag in proteins, so we managed to show the production of required proteins.
FUNCTIONAL ASSAY
To understand if the proteins we produced are functional, we designed and performed  a functional assay. We incubated these two types of bacteria in liquid culture for 13 hours at 37 C; pET45-GadE plasmid  containing BL21 bacteria and another BL21 bacteria which contains only pET45-b plasmid for negative control. At 13. our, we added 100 mM IPTG into these liquid cultures. By doing this, we removed the suppression on GadE protein expression. After adding IPTG, we incubated 3 hours more at 37 C.
We prepared LB mediums with different pH values to show produced GadE proteins’ functionality. These LB mediums’ pH values are respectively 7, 5, 3,5; 2,5 and 2. We added thebacteria whichis incubated for 16 hours into LB mediums at the rate of 1:9. This means, for each pH value we added 0.5 ml liquid culture into 4.5 ml LB medium. We also added 1.5 mM Glutamat in each mix and incubated the final mix at 37 C. We made spectrophotometric measurement in 600 nm periodically for the samples that we incubated. Thus we observed how long the bacteria survives in different pH values.
The measurement results are shown below.

Collaborations
During the later half of the iGEM season, our team was fortunate enough to be able to collaborate with the UMaryland iGEM team. Together, we helped improve each other’s presentations and gave feedback on each other’s projects.
On October 7th, our team presented to the public for Baltimore Innovation Week at our community lab, the Baltimore UnderGround Science Space (BUGSS). The UMaryland team came to watch us present, and gave us valuable feedback. While they were at BUGSS, they were also able to conduct outreach with the people that were there for Baltimore Innovation Week.
On October 21st, the UMaryland team came and showed us their presentation. We were able to learn more about presenting well, and they were able to get feedback on their presentation.
Using the allergen screening protocol that we wrote (learn more about it here ), our team also helped the UMaryland team characterize their biobricks.
For the biobrick Part:BBa_K2477003 , there was a 28.7% of identity match and 47.1% similarity match to major latex allergen Hev b 4 from Hevea brasiliensis, in the allergen database. This means that the biobrick part is NOT of potential allergen status. In 80 amino acid alignments by FASTA window, no matches found that are greater than 35% for this biobrick. This also means that there is not of potential allergen status.
For the biobrick Part:BBa_K2477006 , there were several matches. The top two matches were at 63.4% of identity match and 83.4% similarity match to Thaumatin-like protein PWIR2 and 55.5% of identity match and 79.1% similarity match to Pathogenesis-related protein precur. This means that the biobrick part IS of potential allergen status. People using this part should consider the risk when using this in lab, for production, or in the environment. In 80 amino acid alignments by FASTA window, there were 33  matches found that are greater than 35% for this biobrick. This also means that this part is of potential allergen status. The majority of the matches are bannana"

First image will be the photo of our team, then it will slide by to be a video of the elevator pitch. Doesn’t want it to be a video of people, but more of an animation or a pretzi-like thing. Will have voice try-outs in collab with human practices video. Is compiling a new list of supplies.  - Asha - gonna move on to cloning wtPUF to PBAD30 with Anthony. Human practices is going to do filming soon. Need microphone. Anthony has a professional recorder.
Friday, 7/20/12  - no advisor’s meeting - Meetings have been moved - they will only be on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. On Fridays that we have advisor’s meeting, we will not have a separate meeting but instead wrap up for a few minutes after the advisor’s meeting.  - For future gels, or really nice gels that we want to take good picture of, don’t use the big UV tray next to the computer.  - Angela - YFP (Venus) fluorescence! Also, it’s sequence has been confirmed.  - Divya - did PCR and will run gel later.  - Asha - PCRed more WT PUF for pBAD.  - Isiah - working on digestion of linear PSB1C3. Will later run a gel.  - Adi - miniprepped petduet and the K---- biobrick part (NCFP and CCFP).  - Cara - Waiting on the digest for more conclusive results  - Uros - tethering is delayed because a delay on one primer and no sequence of mutant PUF.
Wednesday, 7/25/12  - Angela - no colonies on PUF eYFP construct. Needs minipreps of puf, pbad, ptet, everything. Did a 4th ligation and will hopefully see colonies. the backup is synthesis, will speak with Dr. Jin about it. Credits! We can get credits for this research, but need to check with the individual advisors in your home department. An evaluation has to be done after the summer, but should really been done in the first 2 weeks of the semester. Will probably get 2-4 hours. Need to get going on"

Collaboration with university team
Collaboration with NUS Singapore Team-A
Our team did not get desirable results when probes are expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). While Team NUS Singapore-A initially wanted to explore using RNA aptamers as a reporter system for the stress promoter htpG1, they had difficulties in cloning the construct for months. When they discovered that we are working on aptamer and the expression of it in E. coli, their team leader, Nanda, has a small meet-up with our wet lab team members in Hong Kong. We saw that our projects are closely related and there is an opportunity for collaboration.
Nanda (far left) with the members from CUHK iGEM team
After the discussion, we found out that their team has BL21 Star (DE3), a RNase-knockout strain of E. coli. As we expected see stronger signals from expressing the fluoescent RNA probes, we asked for this strain from them, which they kindly delivered it to us in the form of dried filter paper. We made competent cells from it and performed the assay again .
We received the package!
On the other hand, NUSGEM needed help on RNA aptamer constructions. While de novo gene synthesis or PCR from plasmids did not work for them, we have succeeded in cloning using oligo PCR, a design that allows the partially overlapping oligos to extend and form the desired gene fragment. We attached the Spinach aptamers to either a constitutive lpp promoter as a positive control, or a htpG1 promoter for their assay. Both teams agreed on constructing the constructs from both teams simultaneously, using the set of primers which our team has designed. In the end, their cloning was finally successful and is documented in the parts registry ( BBa_K2819010 ).

The effect of radiation on human body is recognized and the usage of radioactive materials in daily lives is also acknowledged by a lot of people.This effect is mostly negative but this usage is not always negative. This is a very interested result. (Q10)
There is not much to choose between the influence of newspapers and that of Internet.When thay get information about radioactive problem, they collect it from skeptical standpoint.Thus, people might want more reliable information.(Q11,Q12)
Almost all people do not know relationship between ""radiation"" and ""bacteria.This cause is,we think,a gap between physics and biology.(Q13)

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html," to make a central place in Bolbro; a place that invites the citizen to meet and dwell. Your solution should be able to contribute to help citizens recharge their phones, e.g. a solution could be implanting the PowerLeaf into a interactive furniture, but where the demand an aesthetic pleasing design still remains.”
“A part of the vision of this project is the concept of making a pop-up park with differently designed multi-furniture, preferably in wood and organic design, which are removable to the various areas where we are going to develop in the district. It is furniture that should be able to be used to relax in and at the same time also motivates children to move. There is also a need for charging devices and it therefore demands that your solution is an integrated, but still mobile solution, as the park will move physically over time. Finally, the playground is to be developed especially for the young audience, which is a major consumer of power for phones. The playground must be a place where youngsters hang out after school, while maintaining its status as a green space.”
The making of the furniture as a prototype called for a revisit of our safety concerns. We now knew that children would be climbing and playing on the furniture, making it crucial that the material of the PowerLeaf will not break. This is a concern we discussed with Flemming Christiansen, which you can read all about next.
Finding the Proper Material
Criteria to the Prototype
The system itself will consist of two different compartments, an outer and an inner chamber. The first will be facing the sun, while the other will be facing the building or furniture. Since one culture of the bacteria depends on solar energy to produce its product, the outer compartment must allow for sunlight to pass. It should here be noted that the prototype is purely hypothetical, as the membrane, between the two compartments, should exclusively be permeable to cellulose. For that reason, we wanted to find a material, that fulfilled our established criteria, so that we could illustrate the technology.   The device itself will be made entirely from plastic, a material that is thought to be undesirable due to the difficulties in its disposal. This is due to plastic being of a xenobiotic nature, making it generally recalcitrant to microbial degradation Fewson CA. Biodegradation of xenobiotic and other persistent compounds: the causes of recalcitrance. Cell. 1988. . Following these concepts, we can identify the following set of criteria for the desired material:
Solar exposure. The material covering the solar cell, must allow sunlight to pass through to reach the bacteria.

Apparently piceatannol also inhibits something in humans? What part of piceatannol is actually interacting with the insulin receptor? (To check on this last one, contact the Theorectal Biophysics group on campus to see if we can get time on their computers to do some protein docking modeling.) Edit: An email update on this has been sent out. - Application idea: Synthesize piceatannol (somehow) so that it will work in the body and be able to help maintain a healthy level of body fat. Create an E. Coli system that will allow piceatannol to work in the human body.

Ian hopes to gain more skills in the lab and possibly utilize them in the future. When Ian is not in the lab, he is also very passionate about photography and takes portraits of individuals and families often.
Meet Keshava Katti
Keshava is preparing for his second year of iGEM and has a enjoyed more than a year of wet lab work. As a high school junior, Keshava began with no pipetting skill, a nebulous concept of the central dogma, and an equally clueless understanding of PCR and gel electrophoresis. Today, he leads lab efforts that extend further than he could have ever dreamed, from fluorescent protein analysis to in vitro DNA extraction. Keshava will be attending the University of Pennsylvania in the fall and plans to double major in electrical engineering and mathematics. In the future, Keshava hopes to harness his understanding of synthetic biology for electrical engineering applications.
Meet James Lee
James, a rising senior in Charles Wright Academy, hopes to pursue his passion in science by being a part of RAIN’s iGEM team.

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"1 | type II binding site | P1R | P2R |
Once we get our test sequences back from IDT, they will come in a 96-well plate with one oligo in each plate.  We should make a mixture using some of each well in order to create a tube that contains all 96 sequences.  This will simulate the tube that we will receive from Agilent, except instead of 55,000 sequences we will have 96 sequences only in this tube.  From here, we can practice using this as a library.
We can pretend that this tube is just 96 generated sequences on the chip, treating the positive controls as if they were also generated sequences (we only include them in the 96 to ensure that we will indeed get a ""hit"" from this practice screening).  Thus, we can just use the P1F/P1R primer set to amplify all of them in order to use them for the subsequent steps.
These subsequent steps will be those that were outlined above, namely cutting out the F1 sequence from each oligo, ligating this F1 into our expression plasmid, putting the expression plasmid into our selection strain, observing colonies which get infused with ZFs that bind to our target site (the ""hits""), and sequencing the colonies that get hits to determine which ZF they are expressing.
We will be repeating these exact same steps once we get the chip, so if we can perfect our protocols with these practice sequences, we should be golden when the chip comes in.

Kill switch.
MRT-2 mutant Kill Switch
This is an indirect kill switch. The teams plans to use a mutant strain of bacteria which has losts its molecules for immortality. It can reproduce for only a couple generation and will then become sterile, leading to the extinction of this bacteria population.
RNAi Kill Switch
RNAi knockout is a method of gene regulation where double stranded RNA (dsRNA) is introduced to the worm, binding to gene products such as specific RNAs (mRNA), thereby decreasing or eradicating RNA activity by recycling said products. Only a few dsRNA molecules per cell are required to produce effective interference.

MRT-2 mutant Kill Switch
""Given that the germ-line of the mrt-2 mutant has a limited number of generations in which it can reproduce, our created strain is timed for eventual extinction of a span between 2 months and 1 year, with the average being 6.25 months"". However, no experiment is provided, and so we do not know how they obtained these numbers, but we could assume they come from the literature.

The team managed to have the sensor part work (the bacteria can efficiently sense a change in light, temperature and osmolality. However they did not manage to get the lysis module to work. Therefore this system was never completed, so there are no results available in terms of its efficency to prevent bacterial escape from the fermentor.

Research Presentations
SILS Presentation:The Summer Institute for Life Sciences (SILS), a program of the Office of Undergraduate Biology (OUB), invited undergraduates to give a talk on their summer research activities. Talks included published research, on-going research, technology applications, and future research directions. The Cornell iGEM Team represented by Sachi Koide and Saie Ganoo presented this year’s project, fishPharm, to an audience that consisted of faculty and students and were able to discuss with fellow researchers possible problems that could rise regarding the innovative fish tag’s application.
Splash! at Cornell: Splash! at Cornell is a one-day educational program in which hundreds of high school students from all over the United States come to Cornell to take classes taught by undergraduates in any subject.  We teach a hands-on synthetic biology crash course in the fall and spring through the program. Splash! is an excellent opportunity for the team to shed light on the iGEM experience to young minds.
Community/Student Education
ENGRG 1050 :  Our team conducts a series of presentations targeting students in introductory engineering seminars (ENGRG 1050) to introduce them to synthetic biology. These seminars are a mandatory course for all freshman engineering students at Cornell, and thus is a great way to  expose potential future participants to how rewarding the Cornell iGEM experience can be. We touch upon our projects in the past and discuss the multidisciplinary focus placed upon our designs over the past years. In doing so, we emphasize the integral role of various fields of engineering as well as synthetic biology in providing comprehensive solutions to real-world problems.
Lab Tours: Cornell iGEM is always eager to share our lab experiences with members of the community, and to this end has offered a series of educational lab tours. We invite underprivileged incoming Cornell freshman through the Pre-Freshman Summer Program (PSP) as well as local Ithaca High School female students interested in pursuing engineering to come visit our lab space."
SCAU-China,2016,Team:SCAU-China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," high school students of Guangzhou NO.47 Middle School, Guangdong experimental High School and Guangdong Guangya High School. Our courses mainly focused on the advance research in biological areas in these years, especially synthetic biology. We've also introduced iGEM to them and showed them how to take part in iGEM as a high school student. After that, we also built up a good relationship with a high school group from Guangdong experimental High School and Guangdong Guangya High School.
According to the feedback, the students have a better understanding of biology after our lessons. It's quite a good experience to communicate with middle school students and teach them what we've obtained in taking iGEM competition and doing biological research.

For each PCR product a gel electrophoresis is made to make sure that the PCR product has the correct size.  7-10µl loading buffer is added to each 50µl PCR product and the samples are run in 2% agarose. The Gel electrophoresis were set on 75V for 30-60 minutes (according to the length of the product).
Purification of PCR Product
Materials
GFX PCR DNA and Gel band purification Kit from GE healthcare is used to purify the PCR product after gel electrophoresis.
Preparations
Ethanol is added to the Wash Buffer 1 and the label is marked. Store in airtight container.
Procedures - GE healthcare protocol
Sample Capture
A DNase-free 1,5 ml eppendorf tube is weighed, and the weight is noted.
By using long wavelength (365 nm) ultraviolet light and minimal exposure time, the sample in the gel is visualized. A clean scalpel is used to cut out an the sample from the agarose gel. The agarose gel band is placed into a DNase-free 1,5 ml eppendorf tube and weighed. The weight of the agarose band is calculated.
10 μl Capture buffer type 3 is added for each 10 mg of gel slice. Never use less than 300 μl Capture buffer type 3.
The Capture buffer type 3-sample mix is mixed by inversion and incubated at 60°C for 15–30 minutes until the agarose is completely dissolved. The sample is mixed by inversion every 3 minutes
For each purification a GFX MicroSpin column is placed into a Collection tube.
Sample Binding
The Capture buffer type 3-sample mix is centrifuged briefly to collect the liquid at the bottom of the DNase-free 1,5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
Up to 800 μl Capture buffer type 3- sample mix is transferred to the assembled GFX MicroSpin column.
The sample is incubated at room temperature for 1 minute.
The sample is centrifuged for 30 s at 16 000 × g. The flow-through is discarded.
Repeat the sample binding until all sample is loaded.
Wash and Dry

Hong_Kong-CUHK,2018,Team:Hong Kong-CUHK#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," which can find the region of RNA with the least amount of secondary structures, as well as human genome BLAST. The web page generates the sequences of 25 bp length.
The gene sequences of influenza A were chosen as follows (Table Below). The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes were selected for influenza subtyping, while the region of Polymerase Basic 2 gene that is ubiquitous in most influenza A genomes were chosen for influenza detection (This was inspired by the influenza expert that we interviewed, Prof. Lee Shui-shan ). After inputting the selected sequences in BLOCK-iT designer, we have chosen the ones with the GC content around ~50% and randomly selected a 22 bp region for probe design (Fig. Above).
In vitro screening of probes
1. Production of RNA Aptamer Probes and Target RNA
To produce RNA probes and their target RNAs for assays, we used in vitro transcription kits. We designed oligos that can hybridize to each other and extend in a PCR reaction to overcome to length limit of oligo synthesis. After Phusion PCR, the product was gel purified and used as a template in NEB HiScribe T7 Quick High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit. After DNaseI treatment, the reaction was directly purified using phenol:chloroform extraction, and the RNA concentration was measured with NanoDrop 2000. RNA molar concentration was calculated using the corresponding MW according to its length.
2. Aptamer Refolding Assay
In order to investigate the effectiveness of our designed aptamers, in vitro transcribed RNA aptamers (1uM) were mixed with its target, 2X aptamer folding buffer (20mM Tris-HCl, 200mM KCl, 10mM MgCl2) and fluorophore DFHBI, inspired by Kikuchi N, 2016. Controls were set up by mixing the above components without RNA aptamer. The fluorescent signal was observed under blue light box / Chemidoc and was determined by CLARIOstar plate reader.
Characterization of Aptamer
1. Specificity
Though our aptamers were designed to target hemagglutinin or neuraminidase genes of influenza subtypes, unwanted binding between aptamer and target of two subtypes may happen in real life. 5 of our aptamers (i.e. for N9, N2, H7, H3, PB2) that performed well in previous RNA fluorescence assay were selected to investigate their cross-reactivity. They were mixed with targets from different subtypes"

Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
Prepared plasmids for sequencing. We sent another isolated plasmid with'ecol(T7)_His. Also tthl(t7)_His,  bahl(T7)_His and  bpul(T7)_His plasmids were ready for sequencing.
Team Fungal and Plant Laccases:
We looked for the sequences of the laccase of Trametes versicolor in different databases. By searching the specific sequences we realized, that we have to pay special attention to the strains the sequnces came from. During our search we cannot find any published strain in the DMSZ or other straincollections. So we decided to write e-mails to different working groups all over the world to get the published strains.
Team Immobilization:
Today, we took our first step: we started searching for publications which describe different methods for the immobilization of laccases, especially those from Trametes versicolor"

Human Practices:
•Grace, Alex and Emaleen met with USYD bioethics expert Dr Narcyz Ghinea     who specialises in the ethics behind high cost medicines. We discussed     issues with how medicines are priced and the costs of going through     clinical trials.
Education and Public Involvement:
•We were visited in the lab by a group of year 10 girls from Mt St     Benedicts school. Our PI Nick spoke to them about microbes in our     environment and Ruby, Grace and Emaleen taught them how to gram stain and     use a microscope.

•Erica transformed our bacillus expression vectors pUS258::Yncm-Winsulin     and pUS258::Yncm-Proinsulin into our competent WB800 B. subtilis cells.     These transformants were patched to a starch plate to identify where the     gene had been correctly integrated into the genome:
WB800 pUS258::YncM proinsulin
WB800 pUS258::YncM Winsulin
•Erica and Jamie transformed our sequence verified pET15B with Ecotin     tagged gBlocks into E.coli expression vectors into BL21.
•We decided to express the cytoplasmic gBlocks in the SHUFFLE strain as     this strain will aid in the folding of cytoplasmic proteins.
•Alex and Courtney IPTG induced transformed B. subtilis and E.coli cells     transformed with our pET15B and pUS258 expression vectors. Grace and Alex     extracted the proteins and His-tag purified them, then and ran non-His tag     purified and His-tag purified samples on SDS-page gels. This didn’t give     any indication of protein expression. Alex and Grace then ran whole cell     lysates of these induced cells on a gel. It was still difficult to see     whether any protein expression has been induced

Collaborations
We collaborated with Judd, Carroll High School, University of Westminster and EPFL. We helped them with a mixture of modeling, and wiki development and they have helped us massively in return - giving us advice, testing our hardware and software, reviewing our guide for high school teams and letting us use their facilities.
Judd School
Judd-UK is the only other UK high school team. Luckily, they’re only a short train journey away.
Their collaborations page mentions us too!
What we did for them
We met near the start of the iGEM cycle and discussed both wiki development and modeling, giving them lots of advice and actionable tips - these are available for all high schools in our high school guide . We helped them derive their differential equations and explained some reaction kinetics.
We later advised them on modeling. We suggested ways of modeling their inducible promoter and advised them on solving differential equations, both analytically and numerically. We also helped them find constants for transcription and translation as they are also using a cell free extract. We checked the matlab code for their final model. Their results validated their model. Take a look at their modeling page for details
At the UK iGEM meetup we gave them ideas about what to do for human practices.
What they did for us
They tested our synthetic biology bot giving us useful feedback including suggesting the team lookup feature, the ability to repeat a step in the protocol (as opposed to just next and back), which we implemented. They also suggested having a command to skip to a particular step which we tried to implement but found it"

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the experts once said, excess is NEVER a right thing. The consequence will take its toll on the one who doesn’t cherish their body.   
As for the sugarcane-farmer exploitations, we are quite sure that this situation won’t happen. In fact, no matter whether our product is prescription medicines for assistant purpose. That is because the sugar nowadays we use is mostly Corn syrup. The growth of corn is all mechanized and at area of large scale of land, which is as they are like apples and oranges when it comes to sucrose farmers exploitation. That’s why most news about farmer exploitation focuses on cocoa beans or coffee beans instead of sucrose.   
There are always two sides to one coin. Everything has its own defect no matter how perfect it is. Facing the fault, what we should do is manage to solve it in preference to leaving it to the unsure factors in the future. Thanks to the Mingdao Voice and all the experts for helping us passionately. It is the bilateral communication between science, humanities and social science that makes our project more specific and more mature to be closer to come true.

Characterization / Contribution
We improved the characterization of a part encoding the cysteine desulfhydrase( BBa_K731400 ). We found out a new function of the part, to generate sulfur ions from cysteine to precipitate the cadmium ions. In another word, this protein can increase the bacteria's resistance to a certain concentration of cadmium ions and solve the pollution of cadmium ions.
This year, we used a part encoding the ccm A-H( BBa_K1316011 ) to mature Mtr CAB, which belongs to the family of cytochrome c. In our project, we improve the characterization of this part about its function to mature cytochrome c, especially about the effect it can make. With heme staining, we can safely conclude that this part has the expected function.

To simplify the model, the high affinity of RelE and RelB was used to ignore single RelB and only consider the dimer, RelB2 Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N. Conditional cooperativity in toxin-antitoxin regulation prevents random toxin activation and promotes fast translational recovery. Nucleic Acids Res. 2012;40:6424–6434. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks297 UniProtKB - P0C079 (RELB_ECOLI) . Thus, all mentions of RelB in the model refers to its dimer.
Whilst RelB has a relatively low half-life at about 3-5 minutes Overgaard, M., Borch, J., Jørgensen, M. G. and Gerdes, K. (2008), Messenger RNA interferase RelE controls relBE transcription by conditional cooperativity. Molecular Microbiology, 69: 841–857. doi:10.1111/j.1365-2958.2008.06313.x , RelE is rather stable and its half-life, here set to 43 min, is primarily an effect from dilution caused by the bacterial growth Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N. Conditional cooperativity in toxin-antitoxin regulation prevents random toxin activation and promotes fast translational recovery. Nucleic Acids Res. 2012;40:6424–6434. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks297 . However, when growth is restricted during dormancy, the half-life of RelE is increased to 2000 min, corresponding to approximately one day, as the dilution effect is no longer applicable. As the protein complexes are relatively stable, their half-life was set to the same as RelE. However, for RelE to become active in the inherent system under starvation, RelB in complexes must decay Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N.

Tsinghua,2014,Team:Tsinghua-A#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," half repeat showing similarity to only the first 20 amino acids of a full repeat. To reduce the risk of recombination events between the 17.5 highly homologous repeat sequences which is mentioned in the hypothesis part, we codon-optimized AvrBs3 applying the codon usage.
In a single Golden Gate cloning reaction, cloning efficiency is significantly reduced for assembly of 17 repeat modules. Therefore, we split the assembly in two successive steps. In the first cloning step, 10 repeats were assembled in one vector (K1311000, http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1311000:Design ). The preassembly vectors confer spectinomycin resistance and encode a lacZ-α fragment for blue/white selection. On both sides of the lacZ-α fragment a type IIS recognition sequence, BsaI, was positioned. Similarly, 11~17 repeats and NG-last-repeat were respectively ligated and inserted into another vector (K1311001, http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1311001:Design ). After preassembly of the 10 and 7 and last repeats using BsaI, the intermediate blocks were released via Esp3I and cloned into the final assembly vector (modified pTAL1) (K1311002, http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1311002:Design ). As is explained in the backbone part, we constructed a backbone with constitutive promoter which can express under normal condition, and another with a tetracycline-induced promoter, which is expressed with tet. Modified pTAL1 confers AmpR, and allows plasmid replication in E.coli. The vector pTAL1 also contains all elements of the final TALE expression construct, including TALE N’ and C’ arms, replication origin, etc., but a lacZ-α in between the left and right arms.
During the construction of wild-type control plasmid, we used the modified modules provided by our lab. In order to confirm our hypothesis, the designer TALEs were oligo-synthesized according to the results given by optimizing algorithm. We reserved the fusion sites for golden gate reaction, and broke each repeats into 2 parts. After annealing in PCR amplifier, the linear sequence of the repeats can be added to the golden gate reaction and be ligated with the primary vector and continue further ligation to accomplish the final construction.

Synthetic Biology
Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary scientific area that has recently developed. It links various fields of science like biology, chemistry, physics, molecular genetics, informatics and engineering.
Due to this combination the relation of biological design and function can be investigated from an entirely new perspective. The previous approach was limited to the examination of a structure and its function and the attempt to explain how they correlate. Recently, the reverse strategy is applied. Biological parts are specifically designed and constructed according to a desired function. These parts are characterized by a standardized modular design that facilitates their handling. The subsequent introduction of the synthetic constructs to living cells can either cause the replacement of original cellular components or result in additional elements that act cooperatively or more or less autonomously (see fig. 1).
Nagarajan Nandagopal and Michael B. Elowitz. (2011). Synthetic Biology: Integrated Gene Circuits. SCIENCE, Vol. 333: 1244-1248.
Another very important and necessary feature of biological parts is orthogonality, which means in this context that independent devices can be combined unrestrictedly.   This principle derives from the area of engineering and aims to alter subsystems,   without impeding others.
This way cells can be modified as requested, resulting in a predictable behaviour. Among others, this technique can be beneficial for the effective production of certain substances, like biofuels or antibiotics.

Kill Switch for BeeT (Wageningen_UR iGEM 2016)
Introduction
NUSgem Kill switch Toolkit can also be applied to environmental applications such as the engineered bacteria BeeT from Wageningen_UR iGEM team. The engineered bacteria BeeT is programmed to release toxin that kill the parasitic mites Varroa destructor in beehive. Upon their release into the external environment, the two kill switches will be activated to kill bacteria, thereby preventing the spread of genetically modified genes into the ecosystem [1]. Their original kill switch comprises:
Optogenetic kill switch based on the pDusk/pDawn blue-light sensing system and the mazEF toxin-antitoxin system. When blue light is present, more toxin is produced. The accumulation of toxin in BeeT will degrade mRNA and cause cell death [2].
Cas9 kill switch which is auxotrophic for a synthetic amino acid, para-L-biphenylalanine (BipA). In the absence of BipA, the activated kill switch degrades DNA [2].
Analysis and modification of BeeT Kill Switches
The proposed kill switches is indeed robust, yet it still has some limitations. Firstly, it requires the production of many proteins in the cascaded pDusk/pDawn system for the optogentetic kill switch to function. This may increase metabolic burden on cells. Secondly, the cascaded pDusk/pDawn and Cas9 systems are large. Hence, it may be difficult to integrate both kill switches. Thirdly, it requires additional resources and effort to produce and apply synthetic amino acid, BipA to beehive for the Cas9 kill switch to work.
In light of the abovementioned limitations, we propose three modifications for the original kill switch. Firstly, we replace the pDusk/pDawn system with the BLind-v1 blue-light sensor promoter, which is smaller and has similar effectiveness in detecting blue light [3]. Secondly, E2-IM2 killing mechanism is adopted since it can degrade both mRNA and DNA [4]. This eliminates the need for the two kill switch systems, hence alleviating the metabolic burden on cells.Lastly,"

A focus of our work over the summer was to utilise our strengths to aid members of the iGEM community. We achieved this by providing help to as many iGEM teams as possible.
This help largely consisted of the provision of bacterial strains which the respective teams required in order to realise their project. To ensure a safe transport of any samples, we had our lab mascot Jessie (Giraffe) bless the containers before they were sent off!

Each bar represents a different level of education and each color represents their feelings about synthetic biology, where the more positive feelings are towards the bottom of the bar and the more negative feelings are towards the top
Education Level: We found that education level did not significantly affect a person’s answer (p = 0.10). When we compared the percentages of positive responses and negative response across the bars, they stayed relatively the same for each education level.
Figure 7: Do political affiliations affect how people perceive synthetic biology? The bars represent different political affiliations and each color represents a different feeling about synthetic biology, where the more positive feelings are towards the bottom of the bar and the more negative feelings are towards the top.
Political Affiliation: We found no correlation between people’s political leanings and their view of synthetic biology. Our analysis comparing the percentages of positive responses and negative responses resulted in a p-value of 0.8.
Altogether, there appears to not be a significant impact of education level and political affiliation on the survey responses.
Multiple Regression Analysis
We continued our analysis by conducting a multiple regression analysis, to test the impact of several factors on a person’s understanding of synthetic biology. Our results are shown below.
Our regression analysis suggests that there is no significant correlation between any one individual variable and the perceived potential of synthetic biology. However, by considering all variables simultaneously, we observe a significant correlation (F = 1.23E-10). This has important implications. In order to encourage the population to support and make informed judgments on synthetic biology, we must address multiple factors simultaneously.
We also determined the degree to which our independent variables were correlated with each other:
Our results reveal that most of our independent variables are not strongly correlated in a pairwise manner, which bolsters the statistical strength of our multiple regression. The two variables that have significant pairwise correlation are perceived understanding of synthetic biology and perceived understanding of genetically modified organisms. This is reasonable, given that genetically modified organisms are deeply tied to synthetic biology.
Accounting for Error
We acknowledge that multiple biases that may have influenced our statistical results. First, there is some degree of convenience sampling. For the Stony Brook responses, the majority of responses came from college students who identify as politically liberal. This skewed the data, since college students do not represent the general population. We also recognize the existence of reporting bias, which may be especially significant in the current political climate. It is likely that those who align with conservative policies are less likely to reply out of perception that manipulation of genomic information is associated with more liberal policies"

Introduction
Last year, we were able to successfully begin an Archaeal Interlab study and distribute cell extracts of Methanococcus maripaludis containing mCherry mutants to 9 iGEM teams. We asked teams to record fluorescence readings of mCherry protein extracts. What we found was that the fluorescence readings were largely dependent on the type of machinery used to measure fluorescence: plate reader, confocal microscope, Bradford/ BCA and NanoDrop. We decided to make some adjustments this year and start a new project known as the “Formaldehyde Fixed Single Cell Project”.
Instead of lysing our cells and measuring the fluorescence of the mCherry protein extracts from our Methanococcus experiments like before, we decided to fix our harvested Methanococcus cells with 5% formaldehyde before measuring the fluorescence of the mCherry protein. The use of formaldehyde will harden the tissue components of the cells keeping the structure of the proteins intact and ready for measurement of the fluorescence.
The Experiment
For this experiment, the following cultures: L2C16, L1C18, L1C12 were used as well as Wild Type culture as our negative control. The wild type culture does not contain the mCherry protein and instead just plain plasmid. Since the wild type culture contains no mCherry protein, there was technically no fluorescence; the value recorded was used as the background.
The transformed cells were first grown to a specific absorbance, the cells were centrifuged and the cell pellets were re- suspended in a suspension buffer"

“It is interesting as it has raised questions that humans have never had to face before, however I feel you can’t just treat ‘ethics’ as a separate issue and ‘science’ or ‘GM’ as inexorable processes.  All these things are rooted with the people who created them and influenced how the research worked, and everyone is working within a framework of ethics all the time, whether others agree or not.  As a general principle, I see these things as tools, not good or bad, though they can be used for both.  So our ethics must come in how we live our lives and use these tools every day.  Also generally, there needs to be a greater democratisation of the decision making around these things, and better attempts to explain them to people who have a right to know- which is everybody.  However, I am pro GM because I believe dissent towards it is rooted mainly in non-specific, self-justifying ideas about what is ‘natural’, rather than understanding the issue.  But that doesn’t make me pro Monsanto or companies that lie about the content of their foods.  I feel most medical advances can only improve things- however there must be a lively and open debate about when we should ‘fix the person’ or when we should ‘fix the world’.  How far we should go with experiments is something that it is more important there is debate about than ever finding answers.  Synthetic biologists and the companies they work for should have the ethical position of being very careful with what they let out into/push onto the world, and many would argue that they have not yet proved to be.  And a very important part of ethics is not selling your results to the highest bidder, something which I do feel strongly about.”

“While there are a myriad of different angles and personal choices, projects should retain a sense of context and not rush blindly forwards, committing errors comparable to the ecological disaster the introduction of the Cane Toad was to Australia for instance.”
Hannah, 31, Virologist
“I think the technology is exciting that will undoubtedly reveal a lot, but that it will have to be correctly policed.  I understand the desire for self reviewed control, but it is I think limited.  I think public perception of this work has improved, in part thanks to scientists engaging with the public more.  I have found that working with viruses, people sometimes make judgements, but many don’t find the idea so scary anymore once explained.  I think"

In addition, overexpressed livJK do not have enough time to be transported into periplasmic space and congregated into together in cell because of hydrophobic N terminal and livJK do not have enough enzyme to cleave N-terminal of livJK, which may be another explanation for performance of overexpressed livJK. The two explanation for livJK are not mutual excluded.
Please note that all of those explanation of leucine uptake derived from conjecture. To ascertain the puzzle results, further and sophisticated experiment should be carried out."
