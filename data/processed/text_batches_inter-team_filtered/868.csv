In the model, we assumed that all of the mRNA molecules would be exported to the cytosol. The differential equations representing the variation in mRNA in the cytosol are represented below in equations 1.2, 2.2, 3.2 and 4.2.

2.1 Variation of GEV mRNA according to time.
TrsGEV mRNA is the ratio of the amount of GEV mRNA that was transfered to the cytosol. This value is set to 1.
GEVmRNA is the amount of mRNA transcribed in the nucleus.
DegGEV mRNA the average degradation rate of an mRNA molecule in a cell.
CytGEV mRNA amount of GEV mRNA in the cytosol.

Computing the variation and amounts of mRNA in the cytosol over time then allowed us to compute the variation of protein translated. The equations of translation shown below in equations 1.3, 2.3, 3.3, 4.3 represent the variation of protein in the cytosol over time. The translational rates were calculated based on the average translation rate of a ribosome (9.5 base pair per second 12). Here, we assume that the quantity of ribosome is not a limiting factor and that there are no translational regulations involved in the model. The degradation rates are taken from the average degradation rate of protein in yeast14.

2. Clotho Hub
To make the location and management of connections easier, connections are grouped and linked to ClothoHubs (#2) in Figure 6 . Like connections, hubs are categorized as view, interface, connector, and function. There is one type of each of these hubs in the system. Connections belong to one hub each and belong to the hub corresponding to the type of connection they are derived from. Hubs maintain a list of all connections they are responsible for and provide information about these connections to the ClothoCore during initialization. This information includes the hub address of the connection and connection abilities.  Hubs allow for not only point to point communication between connections but also can broadcast a single ClothoData object to all the connections of the hub. This is useful if an application wishes to send one piece data to multiple connections simultaneously. All hubs are connected to one ClothoCore.
For more detailed insight into the operation of a hub you can check out the java doc here .
3. Clotho Connection
ClothoConnections are the workhorses of the system. They represent the computational aspect of PBD. Connections are categorized as view type, connector type, function type, and interface type. View connections deal with the display of biological information. This can be both graphical or textual. Views may also present (push) system information to the user. Connector type connections connect Clotho to external tools or data sources. Function connections are processing engines for data. Interface connections are points of interaction for the user to control the operation or settings assigned to Clotho. Interface connections can also manage libraries which Clotho uses. An example of a ClothoConnection is marked by (#3) in Figure 6 . Notice that connections are explicitly separated from the user interface (UI). This allows complete aesthetic overhauls of Clotho without having to modify the connections.
ClothoConnections are by far the most prevalent objects in the system. They are derived Java classes which inherent methods to process data, communicate with other connections, display information to specific debugging sources, group themselves with other connections, and to make themselves explicitly available to the user via a Java Swing GUI interface. Key to the operation of ClothoConnections, is the ClothoData object which will be described next.
For more detailed insight into the operation of the connections you can check out the java doc here .
4. Clotho Data (Generic)
In Figure 6 , (#4) marks a ClothoData object. ClothoData objects are the means by which ClothoConnections communicate"

== 1~2 July 2008 == - Secretion of Cellulomonas cellulase enzymes We have already obtained designed primers for all four Cellulomonas fimi cellulase genes: cenA, cenB, cenC and cex. I am currently investigating how the products of these genes might be secreted by E. coli. Based on the predictions of PSORT (psort.org) and papers documenting the expression of cenC and cex by E. coli, it would appear that existing signal sequences in the gene products result in (1) extracellular secretion in Cellulomonas fimi and (2) secretion into the periplasm of E. coli.
Hence, my objective now is to find a means by which the gene products could be induced to cross the outer membrane of E. coli. The easiest method might be fusing our gene(s) of interest with the C-terminal region of haemolysin A, which 'contains all the information required for efficient translocation and can therefore be used as a signal sequence for recombinant protein targetting' (Mergulhao et al). Alternatively, we could use the signal peptide from E. coli's outer membrane protein A (OmpA). Signal sequences from Bacillus have also been shown to direct extracellular secretion in E. coli.
Meanwhile, Andy has a rather exciting proposal based on last year's Paris project that has lots of potential for modelling.

1 THERMOGENIC RESPONSE NUTRIENT BIOSENSOR (THE RENBO)
2 ABSTRACT

THERMOGENIC RESPONSE NUTRIENT BIOSENSOR (THE RENBO)
ABSTRACT
To develop flexible and better sensors for environmental, agricultural and engineering applications are the aims of the UTP-Panama Team “SynBio Engineering Tool Kit”. In this way we work with Nitrate Biosensor (PyeaR - GFP composite) developed by Team BCCS-Bristol 2010, which expresses fluorescent signals upon nutrient detection, producing a high-resolution map of arable land.  To achieve this goal we use the collateral effect of the AOX enzyme (Alternative oxidase) mainly designed to generate heat in response to a cold-shock, using the hybB promoter. This effect increases the bacteria growth at temperatures below 20°C. Finally we design a prototype device with a better cold shock promoter (CspA promoter) developed by UNAM-CINVESTAV Team in 2010, in order to give our E. coli a “Intelligent Coat"", which means that not to only survive a cold-shock but to also still been able to keep up with his duties due to improve their expression mechanism at low temperature.

Yet, in  addition to the constitutive system, we are assembling a fatty acid inducible  construct that allows tunable gene expression according to the concentration of  fatty acid around. We decided to introduce this inducible system to prevent  fatty acid deficiency when the concentration of fatty acid in body is low,  hopefully overcoming the foreseeable shortcomings of the original constitutive shunt.
Lastly, the  inducible and constitutive system will be compared in terms of fatty acid  uptake rate in a range concentration of fatty acid and their performances shall  be evaluated.

Model
ITB_Indonesia 2015 initially wanted to developed a system where rhamnolipid production is controlled under quorum sensing. Quorum sensing proteins, LuxI and LuxR, would be expressed under trp promoter. Inoculum would be grown in minimal media containgi glycerol and tryptophan. When grown in media without tryptophan, quoring sensing protein will be expressed. LuxI will produce co-activator AHL. When AHL passes a threshold concentration, it will bind effectively with LuxR and activated enzyme’s expression and eventually rhamnolipid production. We wanted to make nitrogen as limiting factor, therefore putting a nitrogen sensor that will repress rhamnolipid production under nitrogen absence.
Model was adapted from Henkel et. al, 2014. In that paper, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1 was utilised as inoculum, sunflower oil as carbon & energy source, and nitrate (NO3) as nitrogen source. In the model, sunflower will be metabolised into glycerol and fatty acid, which will be used for productions of biomass, N-butyryl-homososerine (HSL) needed for quorum sensing, and rhamnolipid. The presence of 2 carbon sources will cause diauxic growth resulted from carbon preference. Fatty acid is expected to inhibit cell’s growth. In Henkel’s model, nitrate is assumed to produce biomass as well as lipase enzyme needed for sunflower oil metabolism. Rhamnolipid concentration is related to produced HSL concentration.
There are differences from initial system designed by ITB_Indonesia 2015 with Henkel’s. We would utilise E. coli as inoculum, glycerol as carbon source, and ammonia ("

Our Tetracycline biosensor can detect the tetracycline residues in agricultural products (such as: meat, eggs, milk, etc.). By using the approach of synthetic biology, our Tetracycline biosensor provides a new way to detect tetracycline. Click here to see the complete achievement.
Background
Currently, the overuse of antibiotics has not been effectively regulated in China. A survey from 4152 Internet users of 31 provinces and autonomous regions in China shows that 74% investigation families have been or have equipped with antibiotics. Moreover, the application rate of antibiotics in hospitalized patients is 80% in China, far more than the international standards (30%).
Many problem stems are from overuse and misuse of antimicrobial agents in human medicine, however, large-scale use of antimicrobials in agriculture also contributes to the crisis. For treatment, prevention of diseases and the need of promoting animal growth, some of the farmers use antibiotics extensively which cause the rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Yonghong Xiao, professor of Clinical Pharmacology Research Institute of Peking University, pointed out that the annual production of raw materials antibiotics close to 210,000 tons, while 97,000 tons antibiotics is used in livestock breeding industry, which accounted for 46.1% of the total production.
Motivation and Innovation
The misuse of antibiotics is endangering human health and ecological balance. In terms of medicine use, we can develop standards to use antibiotics reasonably. But agricultural uses of antibiotics produce environmental exposures in a variety of reservoirs, which are impossible to be guarded against. Our group hopes to use synthetic biology method to provide a simple, reliable and efficient method for detecting the antibiotics.
After investigation, we choose tetracycline as the research object because of its extensive existence in animal husbandry. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics of tetracycline class may make these drugs residues in edible animal, which will cause a damage in human liver, kidney and digestive tract. A long-term residue will also make the bacteria microbial tolerance, which may cause a double infection.

We will use a coexpression of GUS-PTS1 and Snc1-Pex15 or Snc1-PEX26 to identify the secretion of the compounds. Furthermore, we will use GUS-PTS1 expressed in S. cerevisiae without Snc1 fused to a membrane anchor for a control. We will measure the active GUS in the supernatant with a liquid assay based on the turnover of  4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide to 4-methyl umbelliferone (4-MU) (Blázquez et al, 2007) . Here we expect a higher activity of GUS in the supernatant of cultures with Snc1 decorated peroxisomes.
To increase the variability of our constructs we also designed vectors with and without a GS-Linker connecting the Snc1 with the Pex15. Additionally we tested our constructs in strains with a deletion of Pex11 . This deletion leads to formation of larger peroxisomes and may increase the efficiency of our secretion mechanism.
Size and Number
Size matters! Want to know how modifying out compartment’s morphology can benefit your reactions? Check out our design!!!
Size&Number
Pex11
For our first approach we took to regulate size and number of our compartments, we chose to work with Pex11, which is naturally involved in the constriction of peroxisomes. Thereby, an overexpression of Pex11 leads to a large amount of smaller peroxisomes, whereas a knock-out provides a small amount of enlarged peroxisomes.
To achieve full control of peroxisome size and number with Pex11, we first aimed at showing the expression of Pex11 in the cell and its integration into the peroxisomal membrane. Therefore, we used parts of the Dueber Toolbox.
Figure 4.1 Level 1 plasmides for expressing Pex11 in yeast cells. Assembled by the Pex11 coding sequence, the fluorecence protein Venus, the Terminator ScADH1 and different promoters. Top left ScSSW12, Top right ScPAB1, Bottom left GAL1 and Bottom right CUP1.
This way we were able control the strength of the gene expression. To reveal the successful expression we designed Pex11 as a Toolbox part and fused the fluorescence protein mVenus to the n-terminal end of the peroxin. This way, we could both detect"

KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,", they would have low survival chance. Indeed, they would have to compete with other organisms for nutritional sources and E. coli could lose this competition since the other organisms are adapted to their habitat, while ''E. coli'' is adapted to live in the mammalian digestive system. [5, 6, 7]
The basic idea of our project is to make the bacteria E.D. Frosti, which makes ice nucleating proteins or anti-freeze proteins, after which it kills itself. The bacteria themselves only act as physical carriers of the proteins. Afterwards, we would add the bacteria with the ice nucleating proteins on their membrane to cold water, which allows the water to freeze faster, and crystallize at a higher temperature. On the other hand, bacteria coated with the anti-freeze protein can be used to induce ice melting, so that they can replace sprinkling salt on the roads. One problem is if the general public will accept engineered bacteria in the environment. If something went wrong in our project, this could have major consequences for nature and mankind. We worked out our biosafety issues with the ‘Fault Tree Analysis theory’. This method defines unwanted scenarios and traces them back to the necessary precautions that are needed to avoid these failures. [2] We’ll demonstrate this theory with some examples relevant to our project.
Apocalyptic scenario 1: creation of the everlasting Ice age.
One of the possible scenarios is an everlasting ice age. This could happen if the bacteria would make nonstop ice nucleating proteins and find their way into canals, hereby freezing all connected canals. Frozen canals, rivers and lakes can lead to frozen oceans. We would need new technologies to defrost water so we can drink, shower, etc. But it doesn’t stop there: the ice cap will reflect more sunbeams and the temperature on earth will get lower. So eventually, the whole planet would turn to ice. This scenario would speed up the ‘snow ball earth hypothesis’. [8] Luckily, E.coli (and thus our E.D.Frosti) cannot survive at freezing temperatures, so cell death will occur.
Apocalyptic scenario 2: the final meltdown.
Instead of the ice nucleating protein staying active, imagine that the anti-freeze protein stays active and the bacteria reach the arctic. If an enormous amount of anti-freeze protein reaches this point, it could cause a glacial meltdown. This scenario is comparable to an acceleration of the global warming, leading to more floods, tsunamis, tornado, etc. and this could lead to the extinction of human race. [9]

Our Backbones.
Standard BioBrick cloning is a universal way of putting two BioBrick parts together to build a new BioBrick part. Despite several alternative cloning methods allow the assembly of multiple parts at one its simplicity and the broad availability of compatible parts keep it the 'de facto' standard of the iGEM-community.
Using standard BioBrick cloning, the generation of translationally active parts requires often more than one round of cloning. The ability to easily test the functionality of a protein before cloning them into complicated circuits has the potential to prevent many unsuccessful experiments of iGEM teams and may improve the characterization of the parts in the parts registry. However the extra amount of work required to clone such an additional construct may inhibit this behavior. We therefore improved the standard plasmids pSB1X3 and pSB4X5 by inserting a lacI repressible T7 promoter directly upstream to the BioBrick prefix of those plasmids. This promoter is"

• Current UTI treatments are ineffective and fail to prevent recurrent infections
It could be hard to tell if the sentence “Antibiotic resistance in UTIs is caused by biofilms” be categorized into providing 1 attribution of responsibility, since biofilm cannot be a cause if there is no antibiotic.
(2). We confront another situation in deciding how many attribution of responsibilities are provided, see 2013 igem TU-Munich :
Antibiotics, hormones and various noxious substances threaten environmental health and are not effectively removed by conventional waste water treatment.
They provide three attributions to the issue in a sentence, we finally decided they fulfill the item of providing more than three attribution of responsibility.
In more case, iGEM teams wrote down sentences in a straight-forward, affirmative voice, leaving no room for more consideration and thinking. In other words, though there may be many factors contribute to one phenomenon, for many time we hesitate if we should consider an article as “there is no attribution of responsibility provided” or “There is one attribution of responsibility provided.”
2. The exclusion of school education. In this research, we won’t and are unable to investigate the effectiveness of school education, though it is the most important part of laying down the scientific knowledge basis for our society.
3. The limit to audience. In this research, we assume that the information is transferred and translated to general public with basic knowledge about science, the so-called educated layman. Besides, the target audience of newspaper, journal and iGEM wiki diverse form each other, making the comparison                     invalid to get important information form analysis.
For iGEMers who are interested in social research, here are some dilemma we encounter:
i. Hard to consider the difficulty of a technical term
A. Gene technology-related term:
Understanding of a term may vary.
Take CRISPR/Cas9 for example, many college students may have heard of it, but to what degree do they know about CRISPR/Cas9? When we consider restriction enzyme as high school level gene technology-related term, some, or to say, many high school students may not actually understand how this protein works. And to know how restriction enzyme works is beyond what undergraduate have to know.
B. Not gene technology-related term:
Take 2013 iGEM Colombia Uniandes wiki for example:
It is widely accepted that exposure to stressors increases secretion of glucocorticoids, cortisol, and corticosterone in a wide variety of gnathostome                         vertebrates (Stephens, 1980) (Greenberg"

Moreover, he suggested to try to apply the quorum sensing systems in different organisms, since the used parts should, according to him, be transferable to other organisms.
In addition to that, we encountered some issues when comparing the growth situation of the wild type co-culture with the mutant co-culture which included the quorum sensing harbouring microorganisms. He recommended to just check the overgrowth of the specific organisms in the two different situations.
Regarding this, another important advice he gave us was that a good overall experimental time is 24 hours.
Finally, to solve the problem of quantifying AHL - the quorum sensing molecule of interest - he proposed to us to use a qualitative approach instead of a quantitative one, hence to try titration of different AHL concentrations and to check the impact it has on our cultures.
When getting to know Dr. Scott, we found out he was a member of the iGEM team Berkeley 2011 which is why he did not only give us significant advice for our project, but also told us about his experience with iGEM, further increasing our enthusiasm for iGEM and the final Giant Jamboree.
We would like to thank Dr. Scott for this amazing skype interview and the great input he gave our team. We hope - with the gained iGEM experience and future research we will do a great job and one day will also be able to help other iGEM teams and play a role in their interesting projects.

      我們調控的最終目標為，紅螢光蛋白只有在計時器計時完畢，或是外來菌濃度過高時表現。由於在培養期與計時期都不予表現，所以在設計上經過一番巧思。 首先，RFP上游的K145150是一個受雙重控制的啟動子，要啟動它必須同時滿足：(1)環境中沒有CIIP22蛋白及 (2)與AHL-LuxR複合體結合，兩種條件。
      因此，我們就可以在適當的時機去控制其運轉：當記憶系統的轉譯功能被關閉 (加入乳糖啟動裝置的階段，培養期)，以及tetR不再被轉譯進而造成AHL-LuxR複合體累積 (乳糖逐步被分解，作用期) 後，K145015開使運轉，造成紅螢光蛋白的表現並達到警示的目的。

Nagahama,2015,Team:Nagahama#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," great quantity of terpenes they need many terpene precursor. E. coli produces a small amount of the terpene precursor in MEP pathway. In MEP pathway, there are four enzymes (ispD, ispF, idi, dxs) which are speed limiting enzyme for terpenes precursors produce in E. coli. In order to create a high-yield strains producing IPP and DMAPP, we exogenously engineer to superimpose these genes into E. coli to create strains overproducing IPP and DMAPP in a MEP pathway. To confirm increased production of terpene precursors by Terpene precursor mass-production device. We put attention on ubiquinone. Ubiquinone 8 is made from Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) which is one of the terpene precursors. quinone is one of the electron carrier present in the cell membrane of prokaryotes. And also they glow when exposed to UV rays. In the measurement of production of quinone it was measured by thin-layer chromatography. (TLC silica gel)
Result:  The figure on the left is analysis of Ubiquinone 8 by thin-layer chromatography.  Right lane is JM109 /Terpene precursor mass-production device with IPTG  Left lane is JM109/Terpene precursor mass-production device IPTG minus . Both it was 2μl spot.

Discussion: From this result, the amount of Ubiquinone 8 of the final material by the increased amount of terpene precursors is increased by re-introducing the four genes are over-expressed in E. coli. Therefore, it considered could strengthen the MEP pathway.

Cornell,2015,Team:Cornell#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," filtration system will not allow bacteria to escape, and we have structured our future directions around risk management for the future. In addition, our project is an intellectually responsible pursuit: it cannot foreseeably be used to cause people harm. In the spirit of democratic deliberation, we launched our Humans & SynBio campaign, to get people thinking and talking about the ethics of synthetic biology. Our proposed system would be easy, cost-effective, and potentially usable on a global scale. Additionally, the modularity of our platform allows it to be adapted to the needs of different communities, in order to best serve global populations and environments.[14]
Limitations and Future Directions:
We have learned from our studies that there needs to be more education about synthetic biology, as many people are not fully aware of this field. In addition, it would be helpful to have a comparison of opinions before and after we discuss what synthetic biology is. In order to make our human practices assessments more effective, we would need to have a broader sample size of people taking surveys and answering our questions. Because we live on a fairly liberal university campus with a constituency that socioeconomically slants towards the upper-middle class, our answers may be biased. However, if we were to interview a much larger and diverse sample size, our survey results would be more informative.
Risk assessment can constantly be improved upon. It would be interesting to know what versions of our project, within our portfolio of future ideas and applications, would be the most widely used and accepted. Could we use other materials/gels to make our FishBit more biodegradable? Would other industries be interested in using this tag system to treat other animals that face other diseases?

Figure 8: Plot of the population ratio over time for a stochastic simulation of predefined ratio 1:1 with a starting ratio of 0.6.
Figure 9: Plot of the population ratio over time for a stochastic simulation of predefined ratio 1:1 with a starting ratio of 1.5.
Above are the results of the models which implemented each stage of our molecular circuit from the cell receiving the quorum molecule to the binding of GP0.4 to the FtsZ molecules of that cell. The model was run 60 times in total, 30 starting at a ratio of 0.6 (figure 8) and 30 starting from a ratio of 1.5 (figure 9). Each plot has an average plotted in black.
This model shows underdamped oscillations which reach the desired ratio of 1:1 at roughly 170 minutes. Furthermore it can be seen that the further away from the desired ratio the initial ratio is at the beginning of the simulation, the longer it would take to reach the final ratio as expected.  Hence in graph 1 the time to reach a ratio of 1:1 is 170 minutes whereas in graph 2 it is 180 minutes due to the value of the initial ratio.
Figure 10: Plot of the population ratio over time for a stochastic simulation of a control system without our circuit with a starting ratio of 0.7.
A control for each of these starting ratios was also run (figure 10), with no circuit implemented to compare the random growth of two e.coli populations against the growth of e.coli populations in which we have implemented our circuit. Due to the nature of the control, each population is always shown to grow at the ratio it began at irrespective of the population size, whereas in reality we expect that one population will outcompete the other for nutritional resources and space. As previously mentioned, these aspects were not implemented into the initial model and hence for continuity were also not implemented into the control. The full code for both of these models and all following models can be found on our Github.

Modeling
We developed a MATLAB simulation in order to model how the system and concentrations would change through time. It takes into account the transcription and translation rates for our two enzymes, and the corresponding reactions that transform cysteine into hypotaurine. This simulation uses the parts and compositors MATLAB framework developed at MIT for the “Principles of Synthetic Biology” edX course.
The equations used to describe all reactions are based on the law of mass action, using estimated rate constants. The two enzymatic reactions would be better modeled with Michaelis-Menten equations, but we could not find characterization information for our two specific enzymes, and therefore the simpler mass action equation was used with a single rate constant. However, the code includes comments for changing this easily.
This model can be seen as a template which describes how the system would work in general, and can easily be edited to improve it with Michaelis-Menten kinetics if the enzymes are characterized to get a more accurate representation.
Below is a plot of how the system would behave with an initial cysteine concentration of 1000 nM. The CDO and CSAD lines overlap, as we assumed they are translated and degraded at the same rate.
As we can see in the plot, in this simulation the enzyme concentration increases until it stabilizes at 90.9 nM, and there is no change in the cysteine concentration until CDO and CSAD have been produced. After cysteine sulfinic acid starts being produced from cysteine, it immediately reacts with CSAD to form hypotaurine.
With no initial cysteine:
In this second plot we can see that if no cysteine is present, then no reactions take place. As soon as cysteine is added, the reactions start immediately as the enzymes were already produced.
We did not include them in the plots, but the simulation also takes into account the DNA, mRNA, and RNA polymerase concentrations in order to model the transcription and translation of the two enzymes.

Animal Practices
     Animal practices are quite varied. Applying and testing the effectiveness of the engineered bacteria on a variety of animals using a slew of different delivery methods (mostly food) would be the first step. Current possible animals include dogs, horses and cows.
Outreach:
     We chose to look into the ethical considerations that are at the forefront of synthetic biology. With this in mind, we will be visiting a local high school to present our results and discuss the ethical issues involved in the field of synthetic biology. We will conduct a discussion (please click the picture below) and present the results during the Jamboree.
Safety Video
We have also created this video to discuss issues of safety and ethics involved in our project.
In today's instant gratification society, we created the safety video that was both entertaining and informative in order to keep people's attention. Because we are targeting animals, we also took a new and different approach by considering the animal's rights in this matter.
Collaboration:
     We have created a Vine for University of British Columbia. Their goal was to compile all iGEM projects in order to create a quick way to view the 200 teams that are competing in iGEM this year. This six second video shows the Streptococcus mutans bacteria attached to the surface of a tooth. The Escherichia coli is moving in with our synthetically engineered biobricks which causes the S. mutans biofilm to break apart. Please click here to view our video.

UCCKE / Engagement
In this page, we will show you what have we done to promote science, iGEM and research.
Introduction
The Biology Research Team of UCCKE has been been promoting science in UCCKE with our full dedication. The following activities is what we have done in the past year to both the team and the fellow student of our school in aim to cultivate a research and scientific atmosphere in UCCKE and to let students develop their potential in Science.
Weekly Course (Coverage: 45 students)
The weekly course is held every single monday at 16:30-17:30 for both biology research team members and anyone who is interested. The course covers a compressive content of synthetic biology and science through both theory mentoring and wet laboratory work. The content taught in this series of course are as follow.
Principle of Science
Principle of Synthetic Biology
Techniques of Synthetic Biology (With wet-lab experience)
3A Assembly
Transformation
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
Gel Electrophoresis
Laboratory safety
Laboratory skills and Preparation
The course has received very positive feedback from our student too. The course have grown from a total participant of 12 to around 45 participants (including staff members) and is currently one of the most famous Co-Curricular Activities in our school, attracting a lot of newcomers every year. We are working on building a much larger team and creating a stronger bond between the teammates.
For every topic mentioned before, we created a set of teaching materials including fact sheet, worksheet, protocol and quizes. We do this to ensure that they will understand and remember those techniques easily. The following image is a part of our fact sheet for transformation. A link to download all materials in zip format is provided below the image.
File:T--Hong Kong UCCKE--teachingmaterials.zip
A successfull course must not only have well prepared leaders and teaching materials, we believe good preperation is also a key to success. Therefore, we have very detailed time table planning on what do we do each week to teach them. The following 2 images are samples of our timetable of Transformation and 3A Assembly.

To realize ""Flovorator"" we need to make E. coli produce Farnesol. We have succeeded in confirming amount of transcription of PgpB.dev and YbjG.dev . Our new biobrick device “PgpB.dev” and ”YbjG.dev” worked as expected.  Because we validate this fact by RT-PCR analysis experimentally. We have documented and submitted this new Biobrick device ( http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1950007 ) ( http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1950008 ) to iGEM Registry .

We want to make the E. coli produces farnesol which are one of the terpenes. To produce great quantity of terpenes they need many terpene precursor and Farnesol synthase. E. coli produces a small amount of the terpene precursor in MEP pathway. In addition, E. coli has dephosphorylation enzyme of endogenous. This is likely to synthesize farnesol from Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), which is a precursor of farnesol. In MEP pathway, there are four enzymes (ispD, ispF, idi, dxs) which are speed limiting enzyme for terpenes precursors produce in E. coli.  Last year, in order to, create a high-yield strains producing IPP and DMAPP, we exogenously engineered to superimpose these genes into E. coli to create strains overproducing IPP and DMAPP. This year, in order to generate a large amount of further farnesol, exogenously engineer genes coding for farnesol enzyme synthesis , YbjG and PgpB, as farnesol synthesis in E. coli. These are endogenous dephosphorylation enzyme of E. coli. Farnesol is generated through FPP hydrolysis by PgpB and YbjG of endogenous phosphatases , which are induced by an increased intracellular FPP level. To confirm whether the transcription of these genes is going well or not, we confirmed amount of the transcription of these genes by"

A TOUR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY iGEM TEAM
Welcome to the third stop of our tour! Below is a brief overview of our entire project. In order to complete our goals of furthering iGEM and synthetic biology through educational endeavors and the addition of a new, characterized, signalling system, our project has been divided into 4 MAIN components. We have the lab project: Biofilms & Bacterial Chatter, the modelling portion: Modelling Bacterial Chatter. As well, we have the Second Life project (Synthetic Biology Interactive), which is our primary outreach initiative. This is in addition to our other Human Practices endeavors, which include our work in examination of ethics, fundraising, and outreach. To begin, the tour will take you towards the lab project HERE .
OVERALL PROJECT
The University of Calgary iGEM team goals for this year are to expand the focus of biology into different aspects. Our project is not just based on biological merit, but rather on other additional aspects such as mathematical modelling, Second Life as an educational tool, and community outreach. By examining different areas of education and knowledge, the promotion and awareness of synthetic biology can be heightened in the public community. This year, we are focusing on building a Synthetic Biology community of Alberta. Through proper training and education of individuals in Synthetic Biology, qualified individuals with sufficient accessibility to public funding for both academic and industrial based pursuit of Synthetic Biology can be achieved. This year’s project involves several components:"

We attempted many trials to confirm successful site directed mutagenesis. We failed many times do to bad polymerase, conducting colony PCR on yeast as well as bad thermal cycler settings.We also conducted a PCR with Q5 polymerase to relinearize the plasmid in preparation for yeast mediated cloning. The results of that were great! All of the bands were at the expected size of the full plasmid.
Over the course of this week we were able to get platings of E. coli transformed with all 5 of our pOPPY_GFP series plasmids. Growth of these transformants, however, was inconsistent, with multiple platings being required to get colonies for each sample. By the end of the week, only transformants carrying pOPPY_GFP(2), (4), and (5) were able to be isolated enough to grow monoclonal liquid cultures. Upon plasmid isolation and PCR testing with the Rib(f)2 and Rib(r)1 primers our gel images suggested the presence of D17 plasmid in our pOPPY_GFP(3) transformants. Considering these troubling results as well as the fact that liquid cultures were failing to grow, we opted to discard these samples and begin the next week with new transformations.
We conducted a 4th yeast miniprep attempt with an identical sample, but instead followed a protocol given to us by UCSC Professor Kamakaka. We obtained an improved Nanodrop curve that indicated the presence of DNA. However, there was still an unknown source of salt contamination.

There are several methods to verify the pathway’s enzymes. First of all, violacein and several intermediates (prodeoxyviolacein, deoxyviolacein, proviolacein) are colorful and the production in yeast can be visualized easily. Furthermore we added a His-/Flag-tag to the N-terminus of every protein (see geneious plasmid cards) to confirm their expression via SDS page and western blot. After verifying the presence of the enzymes the next step is to test their functionality. Before performing in vivo experiments in yeast an in vitro assay was implemented. For this the three enzyme pathway leading to PDV was reconstructed, testing VioA, VioB and VioE. To enable the best conditions for the enzymes, the pathway was studied intensively and all needed cofactors were calculated and added to the in vitro reaction (see protocol prodeoxyviolacein in vitro assay ). This included FAD, MgCl2, catalase for decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, and the substrate L-tryptophan. The in vitro reaction was followed by qualitative analysis via HPLC and mass spectrometry.
Design Rules For Genome Engineering Regarding Customization of Peroxisome Properties
In order to reach the ultimate goal of creating a fully controllable artificial compartment, genome engineering can be utilized for customizing the compartment's properties,.These include aspects such as membrane permeability, size/number, or decoupling of peroxisomes from the cytoskeleton, the peroxisomal proteome or metabolome. In our project we used the Crispr Cas9 system for knocking out several genes (Pex9, Pex31&Pex32, INP1, POT1) at the same time in order to engineer the previously mentioned properties. Furthermore, we designed a yeast strain  with a completely replaced protein-import machinery for controlling the entire peroxisomal lumen.
For the future one could think of much more radical strategies for peroxisomal engineering with a final goal of a “minimal peroxisome” by redirecting metabolic pathways through changing the protein-localization-signal in the yeast genome. Additionally, endogenous metabolic pathways could be redirected to our novel artificial compartment for establishing a customized metabolism specifically tailored for the user's application.
Introduction
In order to achieve a fully controllable artificial compartment, the first step was to"

1. Species-specific: PBAN is species-specific just like pheromones, meaning that every kind of insect produces specific PBAN that  only binds with its specific receptor, resulting in the production of a particular pheromone.
2. Small and simple: The coding sequence for a PBAN is only around 100 base pairs. For E.coli, 100 base pairs is totally within its working capacity. Therefore, E.coli can be a low-cost PBAN factory. By transforming the DNA sequences for different PBAN into the E.coli, we can even gain a variety of PBANs.
3. Secreted directly:  Because PBAN can be synthesized by the insect itself, the insect would not form a resistance to it compare to use pesticide.
In conclusion, using PBAN is totally a environmental friendly way for solving harmful insects problems with easily triggering the production of pheromone by contacting with PBAN receptors.
Main Idea
We plan to produce PBANs through E.coli and make the PBAN come in contact with the target insect. The target insect will then start producing pheromones and attract more target insects.
Pheromone Production
Before we could employ PBAN to accomplish our goals, we need to obtain enough background knowledge to evaluate the workability of our plan through paper research. First, we had to confirm whether an insect can take in vitro PBAN and allow it to function. From “Pheromonotropic Activity of Naturally Occurring Pyrokinin Insect Neuropeptides (FXPR-Lamide) in Helicoverpa zea”(37), this method has been proven possible. In this experiment, 0.05 pmol to 200 pmol of PBAN had been injected in to corn earworm and the amount of pheromone produced had been measured.  The result (Fig.1-2-4) showed that PBAN produced by insects itself can effectively increase the production of pheromone. The maximized amount of pheromone production was reached with only ""10 pmol"" of PBAN. This experiment means as long"

On the first image, we observed fluorescence localized to the membrane when growing bacteria transformed with PBad-ClyA-RFP on a medium with arabinose. We can compare it to 2 others images from microcoscopy : with Pbad-clyA-RFP without arabinose, the fluorescent is less intense (pBad isn't repressed so there is little expression of clyA-RFP). The third image demonstrate that without clyA, RFP isn't localize exclusively in the membrane (here, it's an example with )
Controling vesicle production and addessing proteins into them
The strategy was here to destabilize the outer membrane by playing with the tolAR system (). We either worked with tolA- strains or we tried to overexpress protein domains of tolR in order to disrupt the Tol protein complex essential for membrane stability.[ More information ]
Production of vesicles OFF
Production of vesicles ON
As OMVs are very small (around 100nm) they are impossible to see with optical microscopy. As we did not dispose of an electron microscope we tried to see if our clyA-mRFP1 when expressed in a tolA mutant could lead to the presence of red fluorescence into vesicles. Here are images of what could be fluorescent vesicles. Nevertheless we are just above background fluorescence and more controls would be required for a real proof, electronic microscopy and ultra centrifugation will be the next step to prove that we are really observing vesicles containing ClyA::RFP.
The next step in the development of this strategy would be the implementation of the delay system to ensure a good quality of the emitted signal as shown thanks to modeling studies :
we have tested the two part separately the two parts:

☁ Questionnaire for industrial and agricultural producers
We interviewed the main potential producers of pollution sources: factories and farmland, and sent them some questionnaires to try to understand whether there could be TCP residues in plant waste and pesticides. After the investigation, we talked to them, listened to their views on soil pollution, and taught farmers some basic ways to prevent excessive use of land and prevent pollution.
Analysis: We found from this questionnaire that peasants use the most pesticides as insecticide.

☁ Questionnaire for local residents
Ordinary local residents are the most vulnerable population to soil pollution. Their living conditions and their attitudes are a matter of great concern to us. Before we identified the project theme, we investigated the environmental concerns of the public and collected their opinions towards synthetic biology. Combined with the work that iGEM had done a few years ago, we found that soil contamination was a widespread problem that had not yet be well addressed.
Analysis: We found from this questionnaire that there is no correct understanding of biosafety.

☁ Questionnaires distributed all over China
Hundreds of volunteers distributed a total of 500 questionnaires throughout the country, and we analyzed those questionnaires from different areas and accumulated most valuable information and statistics.
Analysis: We found from this questionnaire that half of the people agreed with the plants to solve the soil.

Connection with experts
Soil pollution is a widespread problem. To solve the problem, we can not only rely on ourselves unilaterally, so we need to get elites from each aspect of society involved. Therefore, we interviewed experts around the world in the field of biotechnology and environment, hoping that they can bring us some useful advice. And we leave our footprints throughout the world map to build a comprehensive and holistic view.

This summer, in Chengdu, we met professor Chris Rushlow of the New York University Graduate School professor, and left a mailbox,"
Freiburg,2017,Team:Freiburg#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," were fitted and combined in the AND gate model, thus describing the functionality of our system.
Additionally, the dependency of the HIF1A concentration on the pH and the oxygen concentration is shown in a heat map (Fig. 6). All data refer to a time of 24 hours after exposure to the respective conditions. The HIF1A concentration depends on both a low pH and hypoxia as it is present in the tumor microenvironment . Since it regulates the CAR expression, it can be estimated that the promoter for the CAR expression will only be activated if both conditions are fulfilled.
Figure 6: Heat map of HIF1A
Heat map illustrating the model predictions of the HIF1A concentration in dependence of the pH and the oxygen concentration in the tumor microenvironment. Different colors describe the relative amounts of HIF1A specified in the sidebar. The marked areas show the characteristic conditions in healthy tissues as well as in the tumor microenvironment (TM)(Tian & Bae, 2012). It indicates that the CAR expression is largely restricted to the tumor microenvironment.
×
The mathematical description of our AND gate leads to more ideas of how to improve the design of our logic gate. For example an improvement of the AND gate could be achieved by varying the number of enhancer elements. Depending on whether there is any cooperation in the binding to the enhancer elements and the leakiness of the promoter, different constructions are conceivable. At this point, modeling becomes even more important to create an encompassing overview about the different possibilities and simulate the system’s behaviour.
If you are interested in trying out different functions of data2dynamics applied to our AND gate model, you can download the code for it here . To run the model, also Matlab is required.
Effective Range of Activated CARTELTM T cells
We often received the question 'How far can a T cell migrate after being activated in a tumor microenvironment?'. We consulted this year’s iGEM team from ETH Zurich due to their modeling expertise to find an answer to this issue. Their basic model indicated that cells migrate on the average 6 mm from the tumour microenvironment before getting inactivated.

Probiotics, on the other hand, as a kind of no side effect of drug carrier, more and more get the welcome of people, however, its colonization ability needs to be improved. We want to use genetic engineering technology, gene cloning Slps, design of controlled Slps operon gene expression, to build them into the expression vector, recombinant plasmid, electricity into a receptor in bifidobacterium, testing after transforming of bifidobacteria in vivo and in vitro resistance, adhesion and live action, in order to get more colonization ability of bifidobacterium, solve the disadvantage of low utilization rate of foreign probiotic bacteria in the body, make foreign probiotic bacteria in the body better able to play a role.
Community Class
Our team organized a community class for children to introduce our iGEM team and the microorganism on our bodies, especially on our feet. For the beginning, we listed some common microorganism, and differed the beneficial from the harmful. Next, our team gave a presentation about our iGEM project. At last, some children who behaved actively got microscopes as gifts.
The class attracted many children and their parents. In the class, kids gained the microorganism knowledge and had an initial understanding of synthetic biology which they showed a strong interest in. Some kids even said they wanted to be one of us in the future. Sincerely, we hope their dreams come true one day.
After the class, the parents and the children asked lots of questions related to genetic engineering and synthetic biology. Our team members explained to them patiently, and our project got a wide recognition.
As believed, genetic engineering is one of the most exciting areas in contemporary science and technology, and synthetic biology will definitely do more and more for our life. We hoped to do our bits to raise the children’s awareness about the subjects and encourage them to be curious in biology, particularly in genetic engineering and synthetic biology.
Teach-in for Freshmen
Right after the beginning of this semester, we held a teach-in for the freshmen in the College of Life Science of Sichuan University.
This teach-in was hosted by the team SCU_China. First, we introduced the origin of iGEM and synthetic biology in front of over 200 students who attended, then the contents of the iGEM competition (about the experiments, hardware design and modeling). We then shared our feeling about what wonderful experience iGEM brought to us, and how we practiced our ability of doing research from students ‘perspective. At last,"
SCU-China,2016,Team:SCU-China#Drake_-_-_TEXT.html,"9 percentage of leucine in these genes =number of leucine/number of amino acid
Firstly, we list leucine number and percentage in these genes, and we considered that if there are more leucine in the protein, it will uptake more leucine from medium. But we did not find any relevance between these data and results in figure 7.
Then we scrutinize the construction of the leucine ABC transporter. Although there is a little information for the transporter, we find that the hydrophilicity plots can brace the six genes into three categories.
figure 10 hydrophilicity plot of livJK
figure 11 hydrophilicity plot of livHM
figure 12 hydrophilicity plot of livGK
As figure 10,11,12 shows, livJK owns a hydrophobic N terminal. It is the signal peptide that guides livJ and livK to transport inner membrane and to be trapped in periplasmic space. livHM should be transmembrane protein since they have very hydrophobic peptide span. LivGF do not contain obvious very hydrophobic peptide span but contains Walker A and Walker B motifs involved in the binding and hydrolysis of ATP (according to results of BLAST).  Thus we can imagine the structure of leucine ABC transporter which is shown in figure 13.
Figure 13 predicted structure of leucine ABC transporter.
Oversxpress livJK in DH5a will not increase uptake of leucine in high leucine concentration medium (around 1ug/ml). Overexpress livMH in DH5a inhibits leucine uptake of leucine in high leucine concentration medium (around 1ug/ml). Overexpress livFG in DH5a promotes leucine uptake of leucine in high leucine concentration medium (around 1ug/ml). It may be explained that livFG works like a pump to hydrolysis ATP and obtain energy to transport leucine from periplasmic space into cytosol. More livFG means more energy is used to pump leucine into cytosol.
Overexpress livHM may result in more transmembrane pathway which may be a handicap to retain leucine in cell cytosol without futher energy to determine direction of transportation, that is, there will be some leak of leucine when overexpress livHM.
Overexpress livJK can not increase uptake of leucine may be explained that livJ and livK are saturated for transporter livHMGF, that is, more livJK to pass"

NCTU_Formosa,2017,Team:NCTU Formosa#Disease Occurrence Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"_Formosa built a model predicting the diseases relating to everyday weather information that was based on the neural network. There were two kinds of data in our predict                     system, which were the recorded diseases happening data that were collected from the government agency and the weather data from the Central Meteorological Bureau's website that corresponded to the data forward. Then, we combined these two and then deleted the recorded data that had no weather data to match with.
     Finally, our data contain weather feature and the Label. The weather feature is a two-dimensional array which has 14 days x 11 features. The 11 features include relative humidity, rainfall and the maximum, minimum, average of the temperature and air pressure. The Label contains two classes, negative(diseases that would not happen) and positive(diseases that would happen).
Figure 1: Data process flow chart
     In reality, the spore germination needs some specific weather conditions. Also, the plants may be influenced by the change of weather and become weak. However, this relationship is hard to be recognized by humans. Therefore,                     we used Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) as our method to catch the weather patterns.
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
Figure 2: This is an overview of our model,it contains the convolution layer, max pooling layer and multi full connection layer.
     Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is a powerful network that can automatically recognize the patterns of the features in a period of time, just like the favorite weather change to the fungal diseases in the life cycle. In other words, it means it can recognize the pathogen life cycle in a specific time and mark them out because life cycle’s patterns can happen everywhere over a period of time. For example, our model used weather data for the past two weeks as the model input, and the weather patterns can be found in this 14-day data.
     After the CNN layer, the weather features then converted to weather change features, then a max pooling layer was added to filter some noises after the CNN layer. Weather patterns that caused diseases wouldn’t change in a                     short time, so the function of max pooling was to only return the maximum values in the filter.
$$ f(x_i) = max(x_i) $$
     For example: if the input array is [2,5,1,7,0,4] and the max pooling filter size is 2. When the filter step(distance the filter moves) is 1, the first max pooling output will be max(2,5)=5, and the second output is max"
Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," has been only weakly successful. We have seen one correct colony in several attempts.
To attempt the LIC method, simply mix the parts and vector (4 uL of each). Heat a beaker of water to 95 C, and float the reaction tube in it, and allow everything to cool. Afterwards, it may now be necessary to centrifuge the tube briefly to move the liquid back to the bottom.
Colony ""b1"" [blue, yellow] - sequence read is of low quality but things seem correct.
Colony ""y2"" [yellow] - appears to simply be BBa_K216011 , the template for the initial PCR
Colony ""n4"" [plain] - sequence is unreadable.
The y2 colony is probably expressing a template for PCR which made it all the way through the various steps that came afterwards.
BioSandwich with Blunt-End Ligation Independent Cloning
This is expected to fail as Ligation Independent Cloning requires long overhangs at the end of each part, not blunt ends. No correct colonies were seen.
Colony ""bb1"" [blue] - seems to be BBa_J33207 followed by part of E. coli ferrous iron transport gene A.
Colony ""bw2"" [plain] - has spacerT7 followed by the stuffing.
Colony ""bw3"" [plain] - has RFC10 prefix followed by RFC10 suffix, as if XbaI and SpeI sites have joined in a normal vector.
BioSandwich with CPEC: Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning
Colony ""cby"" [blue, yellow] - there is a single-base deletion near the start of the PlacLacZ part, with no obvious cause. It is too early to affect expression. The last few bases of spacer1 are missing, as well as the first few bases of the EYFP part (9 bases total). This is explained by homology of ""tatgg"". Otherwise seems correct.
Colony ""cb"" [blue] - Normal until the end of spacer1, which is followed immediately by spacer2 and the stuffing.
Colony ""cw"" [plain] - spacerT7 is followed immediately by a second copy of spacerT7, after which comes spacer2 and a second copy of spacer2. Then the stuffing.
This gave some of the weirder results.

HOW CAN WE DEFINE COMPLEXITY?
Complexity is not always where we think it is. Simple dynamics can produce a complex phenomenology, as it happens for fractals. The structure can be apparently complex when its derivation is in fact simple. So how can we define complexity?
When we are talking about complexity, are we talking about the complexity of laws or about ontological complexity? In biology, one doesn't really talk about law, but more about functions. Is the identification of all functions the same thing as the formulation of physics laws? Let us consider for example the standard model of particle physics, in which gravitation is not included. One can say that this model is mathematically simple. A master student would be able to understand its theory. It is abstract, but not diabolical. On the other hand, its ontological furniture, that"

Project Description
The  burning  of  fossil  fuels  generates  greenhouse  gases  that  are  damaging  the  atmosphere  and  impacting  the  global  environment.  Energy  from  sustainable  sources  such  as  wind  and  solar  is  difficult  to  store  for  times  when  the  wind  is  not  blowing  or  the  sun  is  not  shining.
In  order  to  build  a  sustainable  energy  source  for  energy  on  demand  we  are  creating  a  system  using  living  organisms. E.coli will  be  engineered  to  synthesize  lactate  which  will  then  be  used  to  feed  a Shewanella biofilm.

Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Essays_-_-_TEXT.html," Biology in order to create this new field of highly-scientific engineering. The main focus of the field is in design and construction of things that can be modelled, understood and tuned to meet specific performance criteria. ""With Synthetic Biology, conceptual tools and language of engineering become the actual method for approaching biology so that engineering now is more than an analogy, as it was for genetic engineering"". [2]
In Synthetic Biology, BioBrick's are used and put together in order to make new and useful systems. BioBrick's are standard biological parts made of DNA sequences of defined structure and function. Theses small pieces of DNA are put together to make larger biological systems that can be used for a specific purpose. They have been described as DNA ‘Lego bricks’ that can easily be put together in any desired order. Each BioBrick is designed to be incorporated into living cells; most basically put, it is a DNA sequence held in a circular plasmid. Each of these DNA sequences are flanked by universal, precisely-defined, upstream and downstream sequences; however these sequences are not part of the BioBrick itself. The sequences contain restriction enzyme sites, so that parts can be easily removed from their plasmid backbone by the appropriate restriction enzyme and then ligated with another BioBrick. Because the restriction sites remain the same after every ligation, multiple ligations can be done to assemble many BioBricks together to form a fully functioning system.
Synthetic Biology arose from four different intellectual agendas:
A practical test of understanding is an ability to reconstitute a functional system from its basic parts, one can test how biology works by building models; therefore Synthetic Biology can give us a greater understanding of biological systems and how they work.
Biology can be seen as an extension of Chemistry, therefore Synthetic Biology is an extension of Synthetic Chemistry. The definition of synthetic chemistry is 'the formation or building of complex compounds by uniting the more simple ones. This subject field can offer chemical, non-organic insite to help develop systems at a molecular level. Molecular level experiments can lead to a better understanding of how biology works and the development of new systems.
Natural living systems have evolved to continue to exist rather than being optimised for human understanding and intention. Synthetic Biology has become interested in this agenda, as when we redesign natural living systems, it is possible to test our understanding of the original system and how it works. It could also be possible to design and engineer systems that are easier to study and interact with in order to gain new knowledge and insight.

Single Cell ODE Model for the Sensing Module
1 Overview
The ﬁrst module in our construct is the Sensing module. The purpose of this module is to respond to the concentration         of AHL in the cell and amplify the amount of AHL as a signal for further modules of the construct by using a positive         feedback loop. In this module, the most important species considered are AHL, LuxR, mRNA, and GFP. The parameter         in the simulation is the extracellular AHL concentration which diﬀuses into an initially AHL free cell.
AHL and LuxR are integral to the function of the function of the module, both being required to induce the pLuxR. Speciﬁcally, a (LuxR_AHL)2 molecule induces pLuxR by binding to a region in front of it on the plasmid.
pLuxR is involved in the transcription of mRNA, which in turn in needed for the translation of LuxI and         GFP. While ideally, the promoter would only function when induced by (LuxR_AHL)2, in practice it has leakiness         and still promotes transcription even in the absence of any AHL, which is problematic due to our usage of a positive         feedback loop. The eﬀects of this leakiness and how we chose to combat it shall be described momentarily.
The mRNA transcript is translated to produce LuxI and GFP. LuxI is a synthase for AHL, and completes the positive feedback         loop. GFP is used in this module as a reporter for the activity of the system as well as a proxy for the concentration         of mRNA.
In our later models, we will also model the effect os adding antisense RNA (asRNA). The binding of asRNA to mRNA to form double stranded RNA (dsRNA) can prevent it from being used to translate any protein. It also increases the degradation rate of mRNA when it is bound in dsRNA due to the presence of the Hfq binding site on"
Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," to rapidly   evolve Saccharomyces cerevisiae to improve its resistance to copper and cadmium   ions. The cre-loxp system utilizes the cre enzyme and the loxp site on the   chromosome to cause the gene to be replicated, inverted, displaced and deleted,   which is semi-rational changing of the chromosome structure. The modification of   the gene depends on the direction of the loxp site. When in the same direction, the   gene between sites will be deleted. On the contrary when in the reverse direction,   the gene in the locus will flip. The genes located on different chromosomes may   also be translocated. Based on artificial synthetic chromosome No.5 and No. 10, we   use the loxpsym site inserted between the genes of the chromosome to turn on the   recombination system through the cre enzyme. The difference between the loxpsym   locus and the traditional loxp site is that the special palindromic structure of   loxpsym locus will cause the possible structural changes of chromosomes. The   strains with the high concentration of metal ions will be selected under different   concentrations of metal ions. So that the biological treatment of heavy metal   pollution is more feasible.
Cooperate with the government and the Environmental Protection Agency
Visit the tailing in ShanXi Province
In the end, we brought our results to an iron ore factory belonging to Anshan Iron   and Steel Group in Henan Province and Zhongtiaoshan Nonferrous Metal Company in   Shanxi Province, hoping to find the source of pollution and deal with the pollution   from there. Their staffs told us that the main way of emissions in China was at present   through the discharging to the tailings.
We contacted the Shanxi Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau, the staffs   were very supportive of our ideas, so they sent a full-time staff to lead us to   Shanxi's largest copper mine, where we understood the existence of tailings. The   Tailings was a place that collected the sewage especially. Because of the high cost and   a long period of treatment, the EPA generally did not deal with it. However, it could   be harmful to the environment. So we hope that in the future we can utilize our   yeast here.
Tailings deal with heavy metals by means of physical filtration. The processing   intensity is not enough and there also exists harm to the environment. Generally   the Environmental Protection Agency will take over the pollution, then outsource it   to the heavy metal processing company to treat the pollution. At the same time we   were informed that if"

23-10-2010-Maya-Repressor group
Yesterday Sebastien transformed pIGR06 into a Salmonella strain to test whether the antirepressor works. Today I induced the pBAD promoter, which is infront of the antirepressor, by adding arabinose. After one hour I could see that the cells carrying the antirepressor-plasmid (pIGR06) lysed. This means that the antirepressor works:-)
We tried once more to verify pIGR12, but the bands we got had really weird sizes.
We also made the cells carrying pIGR03 and pIGR04 competent, and transformed pIGR05 and pIGR06 into these.
22-10-2010-Maya-Repressor group
So we haven't been writing in the log for the last days as we have been really busy working in the lab and writing on the wiki. But after having realized that the Antiterminatorgroup still writes the log, I decided to write a little update.
First of all we sent some stuff in for sequencing to find out whether we have mutations, as we thought we had. We got the results yesterday, and we found out that pIGR01, pIGR02, pIGR03, pIGR04 are not mutated. So the measurements we did on the biolector with these strains can indeed be trusted.
Finally we had success in verifying pIGR11 meaning that the antirepressor antO is ready for submission.
We also did a new round of ligation and transformation to get the pIGR05, pIGR06 and pIGR12 that we still haven't been able to verify. We changed the backbone in the pIGR05 and pIGR06 plasmids to pSB3C5, and this seemed to be a good idea because this time we got colonies that we could actually verify by PCR!!!!! :-) This means that we can prepare another biolector run, this time having all the planned constructs. But first we need to transform pIGR"

How to Achieve Stable Adhesion?
Bacteria adhering to polymer film is one of the most important parts in CACCI. In order to make bacteria bind tightly, we provide two possible and promising solutions to figure it out, one of which is coating bacteria with polylysine(PLL) and the other is to chemically covalent bind between bacteria and polymer film.
Strategy I: Coated with Polylysine
Polylysine refers to lysine homopolymers, whose precursor amino acid lysine is composed of two amino groups, one at the α-carbon and one at the ε-carbon. Either can be the location of polymerization, resulting in α-polylysine or ε-polylysine.
Figure 10: Polylysine
α-Polylysine, a synthetic polymer, is composed of either L-lysine or D-lysine. ""L"" and ""D"" refer to the chirality at lysine's central carbon. This results in poly-L-lysine (PLL) and poly-D-lysine (PDL) respectively.
Figure 11: The reaction of polylysine
As a matter of fact, α-Polylysine is commonly used to coat tissue cultureware as an attachment factor which improves cell adherence. This phenomenon is based on the interaction between the positively charged polymer and negatively charged cells or proteins. This polycationic treatment on bacteria has already been proved with successful results when conducting microscopy experiment previously.
Figure 12: The adhesion of bacterial to polylysine
As for E. coli, a gram-negative bacterium, whose surface is formed by lipopolysaccharides(LPP), which is negatively charged at physiological pH. The polymer chain of polylysine is positively charged and remains in stochastic globule conformation at pH under 12.0. Thus, polylysine would readily absorb to film we designed and gives a smooth coverage in a form of monolayer, containing tightly packed globule with average lateral dimension of 20 nm. Polylysine is biocompatible and should not affect bacteria. To get more information on our adhesion assay, please refer to Results-Adhesion assay
Strategy II: Covalent Adhesion between bacterial membrane and film with proper modification.
To achieve covalently adhesion, we decided to implement the parts from 2014 iGEM TU_Eindhoven, and the whole system including these parts:

Mentoring the iGEM team Wuerzburg
We consider iGEM not only as a competition but as a possibility to create bonds with a great community of highly motivated students. At the German iGEM Meet-Up in Marburg we were approached by the newly founded iGEM team Wuerzburg . As the Munich team is well established in the iGEM competition, we agreed on helping them with their first iGEM project.
Throughout the following months, we advised their team. We discussed their project and shared our knowledge on all topics. These were ranging from the competition itself to financing. After this great bonding, we decided to become their official iGEM mentor.
We focused our mentoring on:
Regular contact via Skype, E-Mail and WhatsApp
Guidelines on finding financial support (sponsors portfolio)
Professional appearance
Team contract
Solving technical issues during the InterLab study
Track selection
We met again during the European Meetup in Munich and tightened our bonds even further. In the future, we plan to consolidate our partnership.
Assessing Water Quality with iGEM Tec-Monterrey
After the initial contact via E-Mail, we decided to have a video call to further discuss about collaboration possibilities. We were especially interested in their human practice program, in which they compared the water pollution of several rivers all over the world, by photometrically testing its Nitrate burden. This is also interesting for us, because bacteriophages can be isolated from waste water and rivers.
Therefore, findings on the biological and chemical composition of open waters are highly relevant to us. Since iGEM Tec-Monterrey also wanted to include a German river sample to their data, we had the chance to start our collaboration right there. The Isar, the main river in Munich, flows right behind our lab, allowing us to take a sample. Due to some problems with the postal service, the team had trouble receiving all their samples. Luckily, we were able to test the samples with ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy in our lab using their experimental protocol. In return, the iGEM Team Tec-M"
Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Gan Introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," will become better and better at distinguishing them.
Therefore, the main goal of the forger is to make diamonds that are indistinguishable from the real ones, and the goal of the jewelery store is to try and tell them apart as accurately as possible.
This back and forth competition is the main idea behind Generative Adversarial Networks.
Using this analogy, we can come up with the architecture of a GAN.
There are two main components of GANs: the Generator and the Discriminator.
The diamond forger in the example is more formally known as the Generator Network. Such network randomly generates an output (fake diamond) from some initial values. As the Generator gets better after each round, it learns how to better shape the output so that the discriminator would have a harder time differentiating the generated output from the real one (or, in our example case, fake diamonds from the real diamonds).
On another hand, the jewelery store is known as the Discriminator Network.Just as the generative network tries to produce an output that is more similar to real output, the discriminator is trying to determine the differences between real and fake output as best as it can and learns from its mistakes.
Just like the forger‘s main goal is to create seamingly real diamonds, the ultimate goal of a Generative Adversarial network is to have a generative network that can produce outputs which are indistinguishable from the real ones.
Formal Introduction
Let us now explore GANs‘ architecture in terms of image generation. In this case, the Generator is used to generate real-looking images and the Discriminator‘s job is to identify if the image is fake or not. In turn, these two networks,  pitted against each other, are in a constant battle as one (Generator) is trying to fool the other (Discriminator).
The system input can frequently be a random noise, for example a Guassian distribution, and values can be sampled from this disribution and fed into the generator network. Consequently, from those values some kind of image is generated. Following the output of a generator, the discriminator network receives that image and compares it to the real images from a provided dataset.
If the discriminator network performs well, it will swiftly decide that the initially generated image is fake and so, the game will continue. Yet, this time the generator will adjust its parameters just a little bit and try again. Just like that, the two networks will compete and try to improve and outperform each other with each round. Eventually, the Generator will reach a level of sophistication in which the generated images will not be"

In this column we are going to present the description,experiment and result of our project
Abstract
When information flows through gene-regulatory networks, noise is introduced, and fidelity suffers. A cell unable to correctly infer the environment signals from the noisy inputs may be hard to make right responses. But there are so many “parallel circuit” in gene-regulatory networks where independently transcribed monomers assemble into functional complexes for downstream regulation. As we know, when we talking with two person at the same time, we could not fully understand them. But if things they talked about were more similar, we could understand their words much better. So that would tighter connection of monomers benefit the quality of gene-regulatory networks?
Inspired by these thoughts, we construct synthetic biology circuit by using split florescent proteins. And we add inteins to split florescent proteins to the make the connection tighter. Then, we quantitatively measure the capacity of these information channels. Computation and wet lab work are combined to optimize our understanding of such systems, and to interpret potential biological significance of reoccurring parallel designs in nature.
Description
From information theory to our project
As we can learn from Wikipedia[1], information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information which was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948. The theory has developed amazingly and has found applications in many areas. It’s not exaggerated to say that we can see the power of information theory all the time.
Based on this, we would like to explore something originally in biological pathway using information theory.
Our project has a close connection with two terms in information theory, mutual Information and channel capacity. And what are them?
In probability theory and information theory, the mutual information (MI) of two random variables is a measure of the mutual dependence between the two variables. More specifically, it quantifies the ""amount of information"" (in units such as bits) obtained about one random variable, through the other random variable. The concept of mutual information is intricately linked to that of entropy of a random variable, a fundamental notion in information theory, that defines the ""amount of information"" held in a random variable. You can understand it trough from the figure below.
Formally, the mutual information of two discrete random variables X and Y can be defined as:\[I\left( {"

Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues?
Researcher safety: Our lab is a relatively safe one, as the only organisms we use are E. coli and S. cerevisiae, which are considered level 1 Biosafety Containment Agents so are not pathogenic. We do handle Bunsen burners, chloroform and phenol. Therefore, the largest risks that are presented within the lab include potential fires or exposure to fumes. However, the chloroform and phenol are only ever handled in a fume hood so the risk of exposure to fumes is"

Welcome to the 2009 iGEM UC Berkeley Software Team Wiki.
Synthetic biology promises to introduce a new paradigm to the biological world. One which is less of a design science and more of an engineering discipline. In order to fulfill this promise, a set of core design activities must be made more amenable to design automation techniques. The first step requires identifying DNA sequences of interest and packaging them as ""standard parts"". Once these parts have been created, the next step is to construct composite ""devices"". Finally, devices must be physically created with samples in the lab. Each of these stages has a number of sub-problems and each is equally important in the overall design process. Our project focuses on the latter two processes, device creation and physical assembly. This web page has been designed to introduce you to our project so that you can not only learn more about our activities and use the associated tools but also contribute and collaborate with us! Specifically, our project is organized around the development of three tools:
Eugene - A domain specific language for the specification of biological constructs.
Spectacles - A visual editing framework for the design of composite biological devices and the assignment of physical samples to functional concepts.
Kepler Integration - Development of actors and automated assembly processes for the scientific workflow management system Kepler.
While each of these efforts is powerful in its own right, together they form the basis for a complete design framework. To accomplish this integration, the Clotho design environment and its core set of APIs have been revamped to accommodate these efforts. This not only makes the design process easy for today but paves the way to future designs.
We encourage you now to check out the site, play with the tools, and ask questions. Our intention is for this to be a community effort. We have worked with Stanford University , the University of Minnesota , the University of Washington , the Joint BioEnergy Institute , and Microsoft Research India to create a truly collaborative environment. You could be next. So think of a tool to create, a suggestion to make, or a problem to solve!

To fulfill the legal requirements of a manufacturing process, we streamlined Phactory to comply with the framework of the Good Manufacturing Practice. Moreover, we got the chance to visit their laboratories, where phages for therapeutic use are produced.
Belgium, France and the Netherlands allowed the magistral preparation for phage therapeutics as suggested by Dr. Jean-Paul Pirnay.
We received a sample of a therapeutic bacteriophage cocktail. (left) Necessary clothing for visiting the laboratories in the hospitals. (middle) Queen Astrid Military Hospital in Belgium (right)
Clinically Relevant Bacteriophages
It was of great importance to us to demonstrate that medically relevant bacteriophages can be manufactured with Phactory. We received the SEC-3S bacteriophage from the Queen Astrid Hospital as well as the CLB-P2 and CLB-P3 bacteriophages from the group of Laurent Debarbieux at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. These bacteriophages are specific for the E. coli strain O104:H4, also known as EHEC , which caused 53 deaths during an outbreak in Germany in 2011. As indicated in the microscopy images, we successfully assembled these medically relevant bacteriophages in our cell-free system.
We conducted a LAL-test and compared the results with magistral bacteriophage preparation regulations. According to these results, our bacteriophages are orally applicable. If we reach higher titers in Phactory, we can apply extensive purification protocols to allow for intravenous application of bacteriophage therapy.

Doctor's Appointment
The advance of the antibiotics crisis in our hometown was of highest interest to us.
To get an overview of the situation, we visited the university hospital Rechts der Isar of the Technical University of Munich to meet Dr. Friedemann Gebhardt , the head of the hygiene department. He is responsible for preventing the spread of drug-resistant bacteria.
Until recently, most of his patients had acquired their multi-resistant infections during travels to developing countries on other continents. This has changed and the problem has spread to Europe. The number of patients with infections caused by bacteria resistant against multiple antibiotics has nearly doubled in the last year, leaving Dr. Gebhardt very concerned.

Figure 1. Biologically synthesized nitric oxide (NO) is produced through Nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) in human. The metastable free radical nitric oxide (NO) is then released into plasma, where NO has a half-life of only a few seconds, and further transferred into nitrate (NOx).
Previous research showed that nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity is enhanced in IBD (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), so is the rectal nitric oxide (NO) concentrations[1-3]. Rectal nitric oxide (NO) has a short gradient distance but a sharp concentration peak at the diseased regions of the gut. It has been reported that, the average rectal nitric oxide (NO) concentration in normal people is ~60 ppb (60 nM), whereas in IBD patients is ~5,500 ppb (5.5 μM)[3]. These features make NO assessments to be a practicable method for determining the presence of an on-going inflammatory reaction within the gut.
Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) can release Nitric Oxide (NO) at a pathological concentration
There are several reagents that can release NO in aqueous solution. One of them is called Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a member of the NO-releasing drugs, which is originally used as a peripheral vasodilator.
In order to understand the kinetics of SNP releasing NO in LB, or say the environment where E.coli is cultured, we detected the concentration of NO in SNP-LB solution by Griess test (Figure 2,3)[4]. And plotted the Dynamic curves of different concentrations of SNP releasing NO (Figure 4).
Figure 2. The Griess test. When Griess reagent I (N-alpha-naphthyl-ethylenediamine) is added, the nitrites (NO2−) form a diazonium salt. After Griess reagent II (sulphanilic acid) is added, a pink color develops, and have a maximum absorbance peak at 540 nm.[4]
Figure 3. The concentration of NO released by SNP in LB medium were determined by Griess test. Add the Griess reagents to samples within 96-well plate and read the absorbance at 540 nm by the microplate photometer.
