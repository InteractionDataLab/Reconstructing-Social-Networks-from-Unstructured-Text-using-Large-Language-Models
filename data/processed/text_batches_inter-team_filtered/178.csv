HKU-HKBU,2009,Team:HKU-HKBU#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," our keen devotion, we have resolved and learnt from problems to problems. I love the days being in the team and the days spent with my teammates, making fun of each other, hard working together without sleeping. Now i just wanna finish our current and can't wait to see us beating up the other teams at MIT (if we were able = =).
To be honest, actually i never emphasized i am the leader of the compeition. As i am a person who don;t want to make the other people shoulder a lot of pressure and i don't want think i am the person with good leading skills.
I just think of myself being a normal member and try to do my best. I know i am not a good leader at all but anyway i feel very grateful for those who gave me support and forgave my wrongdoings during the hard times.  I know i have said a chunk of stuff and i know it is clumsy. The last thing i wanna say is that i am very proud that i have spent time with my friends pursuing a dream during my most busy summer, pursuing a goal that to undergraduate students seems so far away and demanding yet it is the sweetest ,remarkable and memorable dream i have ever had in my life time.
I just love you all!

2nd Year biochemistry and microbiology student. Was studying in UK for several years before coming back to the homeland and join the big HKU family. After spending a year doing nothing, skipping lectures (switched onto the “sleep” mood even do appear) and resting, I finally picked myself up to get some work done by registering to the iGEM team. Being the one who is responsible for the BIG fund-raising job, human practices activities and others wet lab experiments for our team. I must say that was the busiest summer I have ever had but also the one which I truly enjoyed.
It was an honor for me to work with many hilarious, “hard-working” fellow geniuses. Especially those weekly meetings that end at mid-night, meals time which we make fun out of each other and when the swine flu suddenly hit our lab. Many and many more memorable moments that we shared together throughout the past few months were totally awesome and enjoyable. Hope we shall get some good results this year and ROCK THEM!

Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," C end of the Gα subunit that originally interact with GPCR to be expressed in human body could increase the coupling efficiency. It’s also been suggested that interruption of the endogenous pheromone receptor ste2 in yeast of a mating type, as well as two modulators in wild type yeast, would increase the strength and signal/noise ratio of the reporting signal, as showed in fig 2. Modulator far1 can be activated by pheromone in wild type yeast, and traps the cell cycle; sst2 is another modulator, which catalyzes GTP that binds to Gpa1 to transform into GDP, thus negatively regulates the activity of Gpa1.
fig 2. Modified a-typed Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ste2, far1 and sst2 are knockout, five amino acids at C terminal are replaced with their counterparts in human G protein.
Four kind of histamine receptors have been described in human, HRH1, HRH2, HRH3 and HRH4, all of which are GPCRs. HRH3 and HRH4 has relatively higher affinity to histamine. In our project, as showed in fig 3, we try to equip Gpa1 modified yeasts with human histamine receptor HRH4 and EGFP reporter gene under control of Fus1 promoter, to give out dosage dependent signal output when incubated in solution containing histamine. A simple hardware was also developed to provide real time monitoring of yeast concentration and the strength of signal output in a quantitative manner. The hardware also contains a vibration module to prevent yeast cells from precipitation during incubation.

Preliminary experiments suggested that yeast could grow well in human serum. The ultimate goal of our project is to implement a novel allergen test method (fig 4): the tester collects blood sample, directly adds certain allergen into whole blood, separates serum by centrifugation, incubates engineered yeast cells in serum with and without serum treatment respectively, measures the signal strength with our hardware, then the test results can be read of from the screen.

Results: Figure 28 shows a well focused, not-magnified image of C. reinhardtii. It is clear from the image that several cells that were present within the area of the image were not detected. However, many, if not all, of them did not pass through the focus of the constructed hologram. Further, the cell count we obtained was only a factor of 2 different to that given by an lab-grade automated cell counter. Considering the minimally developed analysis software, this is a promising achievement that could likely be improved with time and better algorithms.
Figure 29 shows a 5x magnified image of C. reinhardtii. The diffraction patterns are misshapen (we expect circles, like in figure 28, but larger). This is due to the lens being slightly misaligned, which points to a weakness of the hardware's design. Perfect alignment is difficult to achieve when the levelness of component platforms must be adjusted by hand. It can be seen, from the figure, that some of the detected blobs are in erroneous positions and that some cells remain undetected. Upon counting manually, it seems that these two errors roughly cancel each other out. We conclude from this figure that the design of the hardware and software must be improved before industrial use is realisable, though this (and our other data) serve as proof of concept.
Figure 30 shows a not-magnified image of a slide whose contents is solely TAP medium. The diffraction patterns that are apparent are most likely caused by dust or imperfections in the slide. The count we obtained for this hologram was an order of magnitude higher than the equivalent result from the automated cell counter, but was an order of magnitude (or more) lower than that for other not-magnified holograms that we took, even the least populous. The conditions used for detection in this image were the same as for figure 28, showing that our uncertainty in a measurement like this is"

Project Abstract
Early disease diagnosis still represents one of the most crucial issues in modern medicine. Despite great advances in high-throughput technologies and the discovery of several hundred new disease biomarkers, we are currently still unable to detect diseases specifically and sensitively when they are most vulnerable, at the beginning. We want to develop a transferable, biological detection system for different diseases using HER-2, a breast cancer biomarker, for a proof-of-prinicple. Therefore, we created a novel class of chimeric receptors based on the bacterial osmoregulator EnvZ. We substituted a part of the periplasmic domain of EnvZ with an exchangable, but highly-specific protein binder, an Affibody molecule. Upon antigen binding, the receptor would trigger the OmpR signaling cascade leading to the production of quorum sensing molecules, which activate transcription of a fluorescent signal in a separated read-out strain. Taken together, this system could be a transferable method for biomarker detection.
Biomarker recognition
Presence of certain proteins in blood or urine indicates disease . Most of these proteins are too large to pass through  the membrane of bacteria without active transport. Thus, a bacterial assay to detect protein biomarkers must transport them into the cell or detect them with a receptor in the membrane. In this project, we wanted to construct a chimeric receptor for biomarker detection.
Background to the idea
An ideal system for detection of protein biomarkers is specific, sensitive, transferable and cheap. This means that an ideal receptor should bind to the target biomarker with high specificity and affinity. To make the system transferable to different biomarkers, it should be possible to modify the receptor to change its affinity. Furthermore, binding should trigger an intracellular cascade that is suitable for a read-out system.
With these aims in mind, we were inspired by Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), a proposed therapy for cancer. In their simplest form, CARs are fusions of single-chain variable fragments from monoclonal antibodies and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic parts of CD3 receptors. Treatment with CARs modifies T-cells from the patient to express receptors which are specific to a certain biomarker. These T-cells are then reintroduced into the patient to recognize and kill cancer cells. . If a suitable scaffold receptor exists in bacteria it may be possible to develop"

DEA
DEAs, or dielectric elastomer actuators, generally consist of thin elastic films coated with compliant electrode material on two opposing phases. That makes them flexible plate capacitors that deform due to Maxwell stress when applying a voltage across the electrodes. Since the elastic material is incompressible, applying said voltage causes the reduction of the film in thickness to result in an expansion in area. Stacking and bundling of multiple DEAs allows an actuation system to be adapted to different loading scenarios.Several materials are suitable for manufacturing DEAs. Electrodes can be made e.g. of metals, polymers, graphite or carbon nano tubes. Elastic dielectric materials in use for industrial applications are Polyacryl, Polyurethane or Polysiloxane. This project however focusses on the synthesis of a catcher-tag polymer as dielectric medium while using carbon nano tubes for the electrodes.
Manufacturing DEAs is possible in multiple ways. Thereby dipping, spin-coating and casting techniques are widely spread. For biomaterials, cartridges are more suitable for handling and dispensing the dielectric material. For the application of electrodes onto the elastomer, sputter and spraying techniques are widely used within the industry. Another option is the selective wetting process based on water-based solutions for when the polymer material is hydrophobic. References: F. Nendel, S.

MINT | Radhakrishna Sanka
A microfluidic description language generated as an output of MuShroom mapper and used as an input to Fluigi. This language is used to describe the features of the specified microfluidic device in great detail including specification of feature shape, size and spacing.
Netsynth | Prashant Vaidyanathan
Netsynth is a software tool that was originally built by Prashant Vaidyanathan to translate Verilog logic descriptions into wire and gate lists. Netsynth has been modified for use in Neptune through a collaboration between Shane McCormack (BostonU_HW Team member) and Vaidyanathan to produce output formatted for interpretation in the context of microfluidic design. MuShroom mapper (a tool build by McCormack) uses this output alongside a variety of other inputs to produce a MINT file output in the Specify stage of Neptune.
3DuF | Joshua Lippai
A CAD-like drawing web application. 3DuF can be used to manually draw a microfluidic design if the user wishes to bypass high-level specifications. 3DuF will then output SVG files (for CNC milling layers of the microfluidic chip) and a JSON file for later visualization and editing purposes. When used in the context of Neptune, 3DuF is leveraged to visualize the JSON output of Fluigi so that the user may control his or her microfluidic device intuitively through the Neptune interface.
MakerFluidics | Ryan Silva
MakerFluidics is an accessible, inexpensive microfluidic fabrication technique used to manufacture microfluidic chips. A user will use an SVG file to mill out both the control and flow layers of a microfluidic chip. Then he or she will use these 2 layers to sandwich a piece of PDMS and vacuum the chip to create a seal. Through Neptune, the user is encouraged to use this fabrication infrastructure to make their chip so that they may rapidly prototype many chips inexpensively for any iterations of their experiment and easily control their microfluidic system through the Neptune interface.
Microfluidic Application | Ali Lashkaripour
Explorations into the biological applications for Neptune’s workflow are spearheaded by Ali Lashkaripour. He designs and tests features to be added to our UCF repo as relevant primitives to chip designs for synthetic biological"

This page refers to the time before iGEM officially started (i.e the Wellcome Trust funding start date). Within, this time, we had many group meetings which became more frequent as the start day approached. We did not do any wet lab work in this time, only research and throwing around ideas.
Initial Planning (03/12 - 05/12)
In the early weeks of the project, we met up a few times a month to discuss the runnings of iGEM, what the project would involve and our commitment to the iGEM competition. We also read through and discussed other team's projects from previous years to find out what we were interested to do as a project this years.
In general these meetings were to prepare us for the official start of iGEM, so we understood what the competition was about, the scope of other projects and to get us to think about what kind of a project we wanted to do. We discussed the E.chromi project of Cambridge 2009, Edinburgh 2009's Landmine sensor, and many others.
Project Planning (05/12 - 06/12)
Closer to the start date, we decided we wanted to build a project based around the expertise of UEA and the NRP and learn from our predecessors. We realised that a plant project would not realistically fit within a ten week project if any mistakes were made or major challenges faced. After much consideration, we decided upon a project on NO (Nitric Oxide) sensing within a bacterial chassis.
We thought NO was particularly interesting due to the wide number of environments it is involved in and hence a NO sensor could be widely applied. Within these weeks we were fortunate to have a number of speakers, who were involved in the research of NO. These talks gave us a better understanding of some of the challenges surrounding the sensing of"

All members in our group have participated in the discussion of how to make our wiki more attractive and beautiful. Several styles have been discussed by us day and night, and finally we decided to use the natural style. Simple, cute, yet beautiful. And we even design a series of special icons for our wiki.
Moreover, we collected the photos of our experiment, including the results of experiments and the figures of our members. Despite various pictures we also recorded the process of our experiments and take notes on notebook. Near the end of our project we summarized our result and diary, and put them on our wiki.

Genomic DNA purification
Date: July 14th
Experiment done by: Pernille and Louise
Methods: We used a overnight culture of E. coli MG1655 cells
Protocols: GP1.1
Notes: We made four tubes with 300 microlitres of E. coli MG1655 cell media instead of 200 microlitres. In tube 1 and 2 we unfortunately added 800 microlitres un-diluted precipitation solution, in tube 3 and 4 we diluted the precipitation solution according to the GP1.1 protocol.
Results: The concentration of the purified DNA was measured by NanoDrop. Tube 1 and 2 did not contain any DNA which we had expected because of the high concentration of precipitation soultion. The DNA concentration in tube 3 and 4 were 28,38ng/uL and 19,4ng/uL, respectively. Tube 3 and 4 were afterwards pooled and saved in the freezer (labeled with white tag 1). The purified DNA was run on a agarose gel to check if it actual contains DNA.

Methods: The DNA purification was performed on an overnight culture of the E. coli strain MG1655 . Three samples of 400 microlitres of culture were extracted, centrifuged, the supernatant removed and the pellet was redissolved in 200 microlitres water
Protocol: GP1.1
Notes:
Results: Not a lot of DNA was detected with the NanoDrop. The samples yielded concentrations of 9,88ng/µL, 13,5ng/µL and 5,3ng/µL respectively. The gel showed 4 bands of DNA in each sample. The samples were located at 200bp, 950bp, 1500bp and >10000bp. The bands less visible in lane 3, which were loaded with sample 3, which also yielded the least concentration.

Eduardo Ramírez Montiel and Mercedes Vázquez Cantú were the two members in charge of the Interlab Study, and they did most of the actual work to acquire the measurements. Other people that should be credited are the remaining team members who also helped with this section. It should be noted that all persons involved consent to the inclusion of this data in publications derived from the iGEM interlab study.
The protocols began to be run on July 23th with the transformation of the biobricks. The next day a single colony from each of the selection plates was selected and inoculated in 20mL LB broth with the appropriate antibiotic. The tubes were incubated overnight at 37°C with 250rpm. Afterwards, a miniprep of the liquid cultures was performed and a glycerol stock was made.
On July 29th the restriction gels were run and all the parts purified except for the RFP. The next day another gel was made for the recuperation of RFP. On July 16th the ligations of D2-GFP, D3-GFP, D2-RFP and D3-RFP were done, and they were transformed the next day. However, no growth was observed in the selection plates. This protocol was repeated and finally on August 12th the D2-GFP ligation grew. The other ligations (D3-GFP [Amp] and D2-RFP [CAM]) were grown on September 4th. After this, the D3-GFP had to be cloned into a pSB1C3 vector but we weren’t able to do so before the deadline. Thus, a collaboration was made with the team UANL_Mty-Mexico. They gave us four D3"

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," BBa_K2165004 ) provided by iGEM16_Washington, we constructed this biosensor. To characterize this biosensor, strains of S. cerevisiae BY4742 containing the plasmid with an initial OD600 of 0.1 were grown for 24 hours in SC-URA medium at 30 degrees Celsius, and then were induced with copper sulfate. Samples in different copper concentration were tested with the fluorescent spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-2700) after 1, 6, 12, and 24 hours. This protocol was based on the experience used by Waterloo and Washington iGEM teams and amended by our team.
Fig. 4-2. The fluorescence intensity of CUP1p-yEmRFP biosensor with different Cu concentration induced
Fig. 4-2. The fluorescence intensity of CUP1p-yEmRFP biosensor with different Cu concentration induced
Figure 4-2 showed the relationship between fluorescence intensity with induction time and Cu concentration. With 0.1 mM CuSO4 induced, the fluorescence intensity is 2 times over a control with no induction at 1 hour. As time went on, the fluorescence intensity slightly reduced. Moreover, as the Cu concentration increased, the fluorescence intensity decreased, and when the concentration reached 1 mM, the intensity was close to the control group. This might be due to the higher copper ion concentration influences the transcription, expression and even growth of yeast.
This result will be useful for teams who will use the parts (BBa_K2165004) & (BBa_K2407012) to build an effective Cu-induced biosensor in budding yeast. We noticed that this result is a little different with works done by Waterloo team. It may be due to the differences between Cu ion’s concentration and yeast species. However, we both verified the possibility of building a biosensor based on CUP1 promoter in yeast.
This result was provided for modeling of this biosensor and try to find a proper function to accurately describe the response procedure. Click here to see more information.
PARTS IMPROVEMENT
The Cu-induced promoter CUP1 promoter is a previous BioBrick used by iGEM16_Washington, iGEM16_Waterloo, and other iGEM teams. However, the detailed characterization like what we did this year hasn't been shown on iGEM parts page. Moreover, this part hasn’t be improved by any means or in any way. Under this situation, we plan to work on this promoter to improve its sensitivity and response peak, reduce the"

Materials
Gel:
agarose
0.5X TBE
ethidium bromide
DNA Sample (Digest):
10uL DNA digest
5uL dye
DNA Ladders
Procedure
Making the gel
For most procedures, a 1% agarose gel is sufficient. If you need to separate smaller pieces of DNA fragments (<1 kb) you may wish to use a 1.5% or 2% gel. If you wish to separate larger fragments, you may wish to use a 0.8% gel.
A 65mL solution for a 1.5% gel requires 0.975g of agarose. Mix this with 65mL of 0.5X TBE buffer in a 125mL erlenmeyer flask.
Microwave in order to dissolve the agarose in the buffer. If the buffer is allowed to boil, it with froth out of the flask, so stop the microwave before this happens. Take the flask out after each stop and swirl it to mix. Do this until the agarose is completely dissolved. CAUTION: the agarose turns transparent, and so may appear to be dissolved when it is not. Bring it up to the light to make sure it is homogenous.
Add 1uL of ethidium bromide for every 10mL of gel solution. WARNING: Ethidium bromide is mutagenic, so take proper precautions. Wear gloves and goggles. Dispose of the tip in the ethidium bromide trash (yellow trash bag).
Allow to cool until you can touch the sides for 4-5 seconds without gloves.
Running the Gel:
Place the forming tray into the rig. For the smaller rigs, use red rubber stoppers in order to prevent the gel from spilling out of the tray. In the larger rig, tape the sides as shown below. The open end should face the walls of the rig, so that all four sides are covered. This is the ensure that once the gel is placed into the rig, none will spill out.
Pour the gel into the forming tray when it cools. If bubbles appear"

Education and Public Engagement
We have co-organized two public events together with other iGEM teams. The organizers of first event included 4 high school teams: HFLS_ZhejiangUnited, ASTWS-China, Worldshaper-XSHS and Worldshaper-Wuhan. The organizers of second event included 6 iGEM teams: HFLS_ZhejiangUnited, ASTWS-China, Worldshaper-XSHS, ZJU-China, ZJUT-China and Jiangnan.
Furthermore, we are establishing a synthetic biology club at Peking University Experimental School – Jiaxing, the principal has agree with our idea and provide a small lab for our experiments. We are looking forward to promoting the club as well as iGEM at school and having more new members join us.
We have created a social media platform wechat public account to publish popular science article of synthetic biology and our project research progress. Thanks to this platform, more than more people get to know us and support us, then benefited our fundraising. This year, we totally raised almost 30000 RMB which was definitely helpful.
First promotion campaign
On August 5th, our team held the human practice in Low carbon science and technology museum in Hangzhou to spread knowledge of synthetic biology to kids. There are 3 sessions within the activity, including DNA extracting experiment, game session, Q&A session. Children had to begin with the first session, and only those who finished the whole adventure could receive presents.
Picture1: The group photo with organizers from 4 IGEM teams
Though the activity only lasted for one day, our group members really worked hard in order to prepare the activity. We made a great success both in this human practice and the collaboration with other teams.
Picture 2: Our team member is introducing our projects to those parents.
Although the preparation was really challenging for high school students to achieve, we were enthusiastic about every difficulties we met, and gained precious experience within the process, making us more mature and stronger in organizing ability. Also, the failure of this activity had been thoroughly improved in the next human practice.
Second promotion campaign
Our team members have organized 2018 Shengxi"

Q7. What kind of material do you expect to get or share on iShare?
Now ""ishare"" is fully functional and 4 iGEM teams have already provided information of materials related to their project on the platform. We want to show iGEM HQ that this is a trouble solving idea. We hope in the future ""ishare"" could be presented on the upstream of wiki server and be put into actual use.

3. Collaborations and Conferences
This year is the second year of team Nankai participating in iGEM. We have been working with other teams more frequently than before. Tianjin University is our neighbor and intimate partner, and we share a lot on experiments, projects design and human practice. What’s more, during summer vacation, team Nankai had a meetup with team ZJU and team SYSU in Zhejiang University to exchange ideas on iGEM 2015.
Nankai University & Tianjian University
Until now, we have built up the collaboration with TJU, ZJU and SYSU. In the near future, we will further communicate with more universities and build up collaborations. We have the same wish for a better tomorrow! Let’s communicate and collaborate!
Meeting in Zhejiang University: team Nankai, team ZJU and team SYSU
What’s more, to promote team's public engagement, we showed up in the iGEM meet up held by Peking University this summer. Besides, we took part in the 3rd Symposium of Bohai-RIM Microbiology and presented our work to other participants.
During those conferences, we got precious suggestion from experts and other iGEM teams. In the meantime it has broaden our horizons on synthetic biology.

Software
Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

The communication started later with a 67-year-old woman who was diagnosed as mammary cancer 11 years ago telling her encouraging story about how she got out of depression and keep exercising for all these years. A 47-year-old attorney Ms Wei told the participants that she tried all means to treat the cancer but at last realized the psychotherapy is the most effective one. The intense situation in family and stress from work would only worsen one’s health. Now her wish is to live longer than her parents and witness her son get married. For another 69-year-old woman Ms Xiao, she’s far more optimistic than anyone else even carrying cancer. She organized a model team in which the members are all mammary cancer sufferers and performed all over the country. We were all deeply touched by her spirit and most significantly we witness the young cancer sufferers sobbing from laughing when hearing the story. There’s nothing powerful than an positive mind and tender than people’s care. The communication gave us a new angle to look at life as well as to introspect ourselves. For the patients we passed the hope of life and resolve the isolation and fear inside their heart. Now we’ve built the long term cooperative relationship with Shenzhen Cancer patient Mutual Aid Association to organize more interactive activities for cancer sufferers.
CCIC
Conference of China IGEMers Committee
Realizing the significance of team communications, SZU-iGEM this year joined the China iGEMer's Meetup in Peking University where we shared our project with other 30 teams all over China.It is in the communication that we are able to find out the flaws and raise the better way out. During the tea break we caught the chance to learn from other teams hearing their advices so as to further improve our project and experiment. Thanks for other teams'suggestions and we are thankful for the people who have given us favor and feedbacks.We are on the way to make a better world.
It will be continued...
It will be continued...
Human practice actually give us a chance to step out of the lab and fulfill our responsibilities for the society and an instant to introspect our lives. It is a start but keeping it move on would be the true human practice for all of us.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Alphabrick_-_-_TEXT.html," of using the Crisper/Cas9 system with Desktop Genetics and more broadly with Benchling, these software solutions do not have the extensive gene construct combination recommendation or patent notification that our platform has. Furthermore, these platforms do not interface with automated laboratories. These automated laboratories are partners of our software platform as our platform directs business to their way. Furthermore, currently widely used synthetic biology tools such as SnapGene and APE do not have the intuitive user interface that reduces barriers to entry for new synthetic biologists. The combined share ability and usability that our platform enables is unprecedented. There is therefore space for AlphaBrick in this competitive landscape.
Intellectual Property
Alphabrick’s intellectual property has thus far been protected by trade secrets and copyrights. We are working to obtain legally binding trademarks with the UK Intellectual Property Office for our platform through advice and mentorship from Accelerate Cambridge, the accelerator programme on which we have been accepted.
Our platform layout and written content is automatically covered by UK copyright protection law. Alphabrick has signed a series of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with all potential investors and mentors with which we have shared sensitive information about our platform and features. Alphabrick’s platform is also built using closed code and therefore trade secrets form a big part of our intellectual property protection strategy. Trade secrets give us a competitive advantage when it comes to protecting our algorithms because it means that we don’t have to publish and make public sensitive aspects of our platform. While common in the biotech field, patents in the software field are contentious and since the Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank software infringement case ruling, the software patent landscape has shifted considerably such that patenting in this field is rarely the best intellectual property protection strategy to pursue. This is very pertinent to AlphaBrick especially given the early stage of this startup and the large costs associated with engaging with                                     patent attorneys. By using trade secrets, AlphaBrick is however at risk if our code is discovered independently, if our platform is reverse-engineered and/if companies who later patent a similar technology take patent infringement actions. We have sought to mitigate the likelihood of these risks occurring by safeguarding our code using firewalls and working with Accelerate Cambridge to develop a sound long-term intellectual property strategy.
Pathway to Commercialisation
Alphabrick are progressing through the prestigious Accelerate Cambridge programme at Cambridge University’s Judge Business School to identify the best pathway to commercialisation of the software platform. By 2017, the initial funding obtained for the platform and founder resources are set to run out. Due to this, the team will be raising pre-seed funding in"
Freiburg_Bioware,2010,Team:Freiburg Bioware#NoteBook#Cuckoo Clock_-_-_TEXT.html," of utilizing Nicotiana tabacum (NT cells) as a model for the expression of higher plant genes for future iGEM competitions. NT cells are a faster, cheaper, and safer model than traditional plant transformation. These cells can therefore be utilized as a quick proof-of-concept test model before moving synthetic constructs into plants of interest. We also aim to produce an iGEM-compatible plant-specific plasmid, several stress-inducible plant promoters, reporter genes containing Kozak sequences (ribosome binding sites) and terminators that conform to BioBrick standards. Lastly, we hope to measure the induction of these stress promoters in real-time by performing a fluorometry assay in which stress will be applied to NT cells and fluorescent output by a reporter (GFP) will be measured to detail induction in real time. This method has a distinct advantage over microarrays since microarrays are only one ‘snapshot’ in time.

We continued as there was no response by adding 1 ml more and then by adding 2 ml more. We took 2 ml for sample in the end and another 2 ml for OD measurement where OD=0.1350. One hour after we took 2 ml of sample and then we spiked with 1 ml of NO2. There was no response after 12 minutes. Then we spiked with 0.5 ml of N2O and we show a big response.

NEB.CmR: NEB turbo cells transformed with pSB3C5 ).
NEB.Imm: NEB turbo cells transformed with the antitoxin plasmid ( BBa_K914001 inside pSB3C5 ).
Protocol
Grow overnight cultures of NEB.CmR, NEB.Imm each with antibiotic (Cm) and Col E2.
Centrifuge and resuspend in LB.
Prepare 5 tubes of 10ml LB and put 40uL of NEB.Imm cells into 4 tubes and NEB.CmR cells in 1 tube.
Incubate 37C until the OD reaches 0.2.
Put IPTG with different concentration in 3 NEB.Imm tubes (0.1mM, 0.05mM, 0.025mM).
Incubate again until the OD reaches 1.0.
Take each 0.5ml and mix with 0.5ml Colicin cells (saturated, saturated diluted 1000x, plain LB with corresponding amount of IPTG) in small 2ml eppendorf tubes.
Incubate for 30 minutes.
Dilute 10000x (100x then 100x) in MgSO4 e-2M.
Plate 20uL in Cm to kill the Colicin cells and leave the immune cells.
Note: 1ml of cells of OD 1.0 has 1e9 cells, so we expect if all cells survive we will get 1000 colonies at the end.
Results
In this experiment we expected to see more survival if we induce the cells with more IPTG and/or mix them with less Colicin cells. Given that from the previous experiment the immunity protein turned out to be independent to IPTG induction, we treated all the NEB.Imm data as the same. The results showed that the immunity protein can indeed protect the cells from saturated colicin. If we do not put the Colicin cells in the mixture, the numbers of survival cells of NEB.Imm (BBa_K914001) and NEB.CmR (pSB3C5) are almost the same. But if we put the Colicin cells, even very diluted, the NEB.CmR cells could not survive.
We noticed that the survival on the positive controls (mixture without Colicin) was somehow less than the one with Colicin cells. We guessed that the problems are

PRE PANEL
POST PANEL
During our panel, we explained the applications of our project and the importance of the extraction of significant pollutants from water. Heavy metals remained the most dangerous pollutant. However, interestingly “do not know” increased from 3.6% to 8.7%, which would suggest some participants may have left the panel feeling uncertain about which pollutants were most dangerous. Based on these results, our project aimed to focus on the pollutants that were most relevant to the public.
SURVEY:
The construction of a public survey had two specific goals: gauge public understanding            of synthetic biology and attain public opinion regarding the filtration of water            through the use of GMOs. The questions were written to test the hypothesis that people            with low knowledge of synthetic biology will disapprove of it by targeting two unique            pools of participants: first-year students and experienced synthetic            biology graduates. The questions were generated and influenced after reviewing articles which focused            on public perception and the avoidance of survey bias. Experienced synthetic biology            graduates were surveyed to acquire feedback from a population that is quite educated            about the world of synthetic biology. The population unacquitted with this topic were            also surveyed online. This resulted in data from the general public and 1st and 2nd-year            students at the University of Toronto. The data from this survey is intended to            provide insight to the questions and concerns society may have regarding synthetic            biology and our project. These questions were then incorporated into our            interview with experts on Syntalks, attaining the podcast’s purpose to educate            the public. SURVEY DISTRIBUTION: 36 respondents via Facebook. It is important to note that            this method of distribution may have resulted in bias and statistical significance,            due to the age of the population, similar education levels and the            small sample size. SURVEY RESULTS:
Description: Our hypothesis that people with low knowledge will disapprove synthetic biology was disproved, exemplified through 52 % of people who approved or strongly approved the ideas behind synthetic biology.
Description: The 36% of participants who needed more information to affirm their belief on this statement proves the essential need to educate the public on the benefits and risks of synthetic biology, not just its applications.
Description: 86 % of participants agree or strongly agree on the project's industrial and quotidian impact,"

The Science Fair
PINEAPPLE SCIENCE PRIZE is a scientific award held and supported by ZHEJIANG ASSOCIATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, ZHEJIANG SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MUSEUM and Guokr.com (a most-visited social network for sci-tech in China).
The SCIENTIFIC FAIR, as a part of PINEAPPLE SCIENCE PRIZE AWARDING CEREMONY, is a public science popularization activity aiming to generalize interesting and creative science&technology. This activity has drawn attention of enterprise, social group, laboratory and individual. According to the survey of the host, there were over 30 exhibition stands and the numbers of visitor had reached 500 per day.
We ZJU-China found it’s an awesome opportunity to make iGEM & Synbio attractive to publicity. We took the project of our 2011 team (i.e. the Rainbofilm ) and gave the publicity the concept and development of synthetic biology in plain tems. To intrigue the pubilcity of our stand, we demonstrated some little funny experiment such as extracting chlorophyll, and observing the movement of Paramecium. The most interesting thing was a board game we called “”,. This game was invented by our designer Xihan Li. (“Link here ”).

MIT,2013,Team:MIT#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html,"Therefore, some factor in mouse cell exosomes helps support hepatocytes in vitro.
Impact: Our Work as an Enabling Technology to Hepatocyte Research
We believe out exosome mediated protein export system can serve as an enabling technology for advancing research on the role exosomes play in hepatocyte survival in vitro. As the Bahtia lab gains more information about the RNA and protein factors that allow mouse exosomes to support hepatocytes, we can engineer sender cells to specifically export factors of interest. Our engineered exomoses can be used to determine which proteins are necessary to support the hepatocytes. Ultimately exosomes produced by our engineered sender cells could allow tissue engineers to culture hepatocytes without the addition of mouse fibroblast cells.
Impact: Our Work and the Development of Better Mouse Models
Considering the role the liver plays in human drug metabolism, animal models that exhibit humanized liver function are extremely important for drug testing. In 2011 the Bahtia lab created human ectopic engineered artificial liver (HEAL), by co-culturing hepatocytes and fibroblast cells that were then encapsulated with liver endothelial cells. The humanized liver was then transplanted into mice where they recapitulate numerous human liver functions. The humanized mice provide a model for drug testing (Chen, 2011). This model, however, could be improved if the artificial liver was made solely of human cells and did not need the mouse support cells. If we could treat the hepatocytes with exosomes containing the necessary protein or RNA factors, hepatocytes could be cultured without mouse fibroblasts and used to create artificial livers that mirror human liver activity more closely.
Requirements for Our System
Identifying our application space and gaining a better understanding of our market has helped to guide our future work. We have come to realize that our system must have three main components to be most useful:
We must be able to specifically target cargoes of interest to an exosome. We have demonstrated that we can specifically targeted proteins to exosomes; however, more research must be done to find a means of targeting RNA to an exosome.
Our exosomes should be able to target specific cell types.  Perhaps this can be achieved by modifying cell surface receptors on the exosomes, so only the desired cell types take up the vesicles.
Our exosomes carrying the cargo of interest would be even more useful if they were detectable. This would allow users of our system to easily verify the presence of exosomes when they are added to an in vivo system, like a mouse model, or and in vitro system, like a plate of cultured cells"

However, this system is not very well characterized yet, and it is a complex machinery composed of more than 10 proteins, so we did not plan to use it. However, since RIP is only a 7 amino acid protein, leaky release from the periplasm to the medium should be enough to obtain RIP in the medium [6].
RIP secretion following S. aureus detection: BBa_K2616003
In order not to produce RIP continuously but only in presence of S. aureus, we engineered a sensor device in our modified E. coli capable of detecting S. aureus and producing RIP after detection.
Our modified E. coli expresses under a constitutive promoter BBa_J23107 the sensor device of S. aureusagr operon. It is composed of agrA and agrC, and we took it from BBa_I746100 from iGEM Cambridge 2007 team. Staphylococcus communicate through a quorum sensing mechanism, which consists in producing and detecting signaling peptides called AIP (Auto-Inducing Peptide). If S. aureus approaches our system, AIP will be detected by the transmembrane protein agrC, launching the phosphorylation of agrA which then activates promotor P2 ( Bba_K1351037 , characterized by LMU-Munich 2014 team). Our RIP sequence fused to a signal sequence for periplasmic export is placed after promotor P2 and will consequently be expressed only if S. aureus approaches our biofilm.
NERVE GROWTH FACTOR (NGF) SECRETION: BBa_K2616000
Part description
We built a part which should permit to secrete proNGF directly in the extracellular medium using E. coli type I secretion system. We used an inducible promoter T7 in order to control proNGF production thanks to IPTG induction. We added an His-tag in order to purify it.
Secretion
Type I secretion system transports proteins in one step across the two cellular membranes [2]. It is composed of an inner membrane protein HlyB, a periplasmic channel protein HlyD and an outer membrane protein TolC. As every secretion system, secretion through this one too is mediated by the specific recognition of a signal sequence, which in this case are the sixty C-terminal amino acids of alpha-haemolysin HlyA.

Prediction 2050: Every data relating to In vitro immune system including manufacturing methods and financial records leaked to the public. Causes massive public backlash and eventual upheaval in the medical community and industry.'
I am an independent Chinese woman that don’t need no man. I am obviously rich, upper middle class. I had acquired the technology of in vitro immune system by breaking into a lab. Because of me, this technology is now widely available to the public. I work as a professional criminal. I don’t like the connotation of criminal as negative. For me, “criminal” means ‘crime-exposing”. I expose the crimes of corporations and labs.
I used to have a husband, but I got a divorce because he wasn’t needed. In my busy life, I can only focus on two things at once - child rearing and a job. I can’t handle a relationship and the time and effort it takes to make it work.
I am able to make a better living for myself and my child without the need of a man controlling me and telling me what to do. I lost my husband, but no biggie, I work hard to bring food to the table and a sizeable house my child can run around and play.
I am one heist from exposing multibillion dollar industries from lies they have been keeping from the public. My fortune is amassed from taking from the rich and and redistributing the wealth they did not deserve. My very own husband was a CEO that I needed secrets from. He was a means to my end. With his secrets leaked, I was able to wreck his company and leave him bankrupt.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{U_n}{n}=\frac{2c\delta_n}{c\delta_n-\delta^2_d}\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_n}}{\delta_n}+\frac{2(c\delta_n+\delta_d^2)}{c\delta_n-\delta_d^2}\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_d}}{\delta_d}
\end{align}
$$
For more derivation, we suppose that the distance between any fringes is a constant because the density of fringes is enough. So, we would get:
$$\delta_d\approx\Delta d\cdot\delta_n$$
In the formula, $\Delta d$is the distance between fringes. Continuly, we would get:
$$
\begin{align}
\delta_d^2 & =(\Delta d\cdot\delta_n)^2 \\
& = c\delta^2_n\cdot(\sqrt{n+1}-\sqrt{n})^2 \\
\end{align}
$$
Because the density of fringes is enough, the value of $n$ would be large. As a result, we could get $\sqrt{n+1}\approx\sqrt{n}$, so, the $(7)$ means:
$$\delta_d^2\lt\lt c\delta_n$$
So, we could simpilfy the $(5)$ and we could get:
$$\frac{U_n}{n}=2\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_n}}{\delta_n}+2\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_d}}{\delta_d}$$
Based on The Most Uncertainty and The Average of Principle of Uncertainty, if we want to $\frac{U_n}{n}\le 5\%$, we would assure that $2\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_n}}{\delta_n}\le 2.5\%$ and $2\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_d}}{\delta_d}\le 2.5\%$, that's to say:
$$
\begin{align}
U_{\delta_n}\le 2\cdot2.5\%\delta_n \\
U_{\delta_d}\le 2\cdot2.5\%\delta_d \\

iGEM at Sorbonne University
""iGEM at Sorbonne University"" is the name we gave to the presentation we made during the first meeting of the department of Molecular and Cellular Biology Masters with the new students. In fact, after discussing with the directors of the masters, we were able give a presentation about Synthetic biology and the iGEM competition and briefly presented SugaRevolution. . We also explained the principles and purposes of the competition and explained the skills that they need and will acquire during this adventure. To finish, we showed that our team offers a big autonomy because our project has been fully developed by us from scratch, but we are having a great support from our supervisors. this intervention gained the interest of many students who quickly contacted us to know more about our project and to ask us how they could join the team to participate next year in the competition.
Selling Crêpes
We promoted synthetic biology and our project at Sorbonne University by preparing and selling our succulent and delicious «crêpes». This first contact with the people on campus allowed us to make our project known by the students, the professors and the employees at the university. Through theses sales of ""crêpes"" we were able to discuss with professors who were interested in our project and in the iGEM competition and were very encouraging. And Claude the Chlamydomonas got so much attention from the people on campus especially during the football World Cup!

Reported kinetic rates were determined at 18°C. However, the optimal temperature for the reaction has been reported to be 45°C which is within the temperature range for optimal growth of M. capsulatus [3]. Therefore, the rate kinetics were adjusted to the temperature during in vitro measurement and the actual temperature inside the cow’s rumen. These temperatures were 42°C for M. capsulatus, 37°C for E. cowli and 40°C for in vivo modelling. Based on the reaction kinetics proposed by Arrhenius (see eq. 3) the rate constants for various temperatures are determined. Estimated reaction rates are shown in table 2.

The calculated rate constants are comparable to values reported in the literature [5]. Based on the reaction rates the experimentally achieved data (see our results page ) were fitted using the previously described Michaelis-Menten kinetics to estimate the initial concentration of the enzyme. The decrease of substrate concentration is described by eq. 4 and eq. 5.

The first lecture was presented by our advisor Tim Blomeier and offered the audience a good overview of the field of synthetic biology.
On June 5 Nicolas Schmelling , also one of our advisors, dealt with the various fields of application of genetic engineering in agriculture in more detail. He compared conventional breeding with genetic engineering methods used today and clarified the various definitions of synthetic biology, genetic engineering and breeding.
The third lecture was given by Dr. Christian Dumpitak and was titled in german: “Ich mach mir die Welt widdewidde wie sie mir gefällt.!? ...und was ELSA dazu sagt: Perspektiven auf Synthetische Lebenswissenschaften”. Dr. Dumpitak started his lecture by discussing aspects of the short movie “Who are the engineers of the future?” by Christina Agapakis & Patrik Boyle ( Ginkgo Bioworks ), USA 2010. After a short discussion, he gave us an introduction to the history of genetic engineering, its legal regulations and how it can be distinguished from synthetic life sciences. “ELSA” (or “ELSI”) stands for “Ethical, Legal and Social Aspects (or Implications)“ and is a concomitant research in modern life sciences. In the light of ELSA, he discussed potentials, risks and ethical views on synthetic life sciences.
The last lecture on 03.07. was given by our PI Dr. Ilka Axmann. She focused on genetic engineering methods that are currently used in microbiology. Her talk started with simple information about synthetic biology to help build a basic understanding. After that the newly obtained knowledge was applied to everyday objects, where the audience - with some help of PI Ilka Axmann - had to guess just how much genetic engineering has already influenced everyday life.
For us it is very important to give all interested people the chance to think about all possible aspects of synthetic life sciences. In this context it was a desire for us to be available for all questions after each presentation. Offering pizza and beverages many listeners came to us with interesting questions and discussion topics, which we had fun talking about in a small group.
The results of our surveys show that there are still some concerns and prejudices against synthetic life sciences among the population. Some listeners were surprised and sometimes shocked as to which methods can be used in today's agriculture and which safe methods are prohibited due to ethical concerns. As feedback it was often a relief to know more about the topic and to understand the background better.
Survey
Furthermore, we surveyed the listeners before and"

Enzymes
During our investigation we sought the perfect enzyme to degrade the gluten, and we found:
Prolyl Endopeptidase: The prolyl endopeptidase (PEP), is a class of serine-protease able to break peptide bonds following a PROLINE residue terminal carboxyl group. Were studying it its use as a therapeutic agent against celiac disease (CD), characterized by atrophy of the intestinal villi and inflammation. These reactions are attributed to peptides rich in PROLINE that are generated during the digestion of gluten of some cereals. This enzyme could be used as a nutritional supplement for individuals who suffer from celiac disease or during the processing of starches produced from cereals containing gluten. While it was a candidate for a possible treatment failed to meet expectations, because its activity is to a high pH, which is not suitable for an average digestive. Another reason was that degrades the gluten slowly, which would have resulted in a longer and inefficient treatment.
 
Kumamolisin As: It is the first known example of a collagenase derived from the family of the sedolisin. This operates at high temperatures and low pH levels. Its characteristics, together with those predicted are measured by comparison between a collagenase and a peptidase from serine, which are related to the enzyme preference, to thus Digest collagen as gluten.
KumaMax (G319S, D358G, D368H, N281D): It is a mutation of the Kumamolisin As, which is designed to digest way more efficient gluten, because that can work at pH levels much more lower than the original enzyme (a pH of 4.0) which is excellent for the average digestive system. It was created by the team IGEM Washington 2011 . Other advantages are:
It is resistant to high temperatures and acidity of the stomach.
It is heat stable, in others words, it is resistant to all changes in their physical and chemical structure.
It is easily repairable and creable.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," involves a great amount of multidisciplinarity and touches topics of chemistry  ( synthesis of our own  designed amino acid ), electrical engineering (design and construction of   our LED-Panel ),   synthetic biology, biosafety issues ( Biosafety   report ) and awareness of consequences of our own research  ( ChImp report ). Some of the scientists we contacted participated in our  workshop ‘ Expanding  of the Genetic Code ’. There, we received a lot of feedback for our project and obtained valuable information, but also  learned about ethical concerns regarding our approach to incorporate new bases. Prof.  Dr. Budisa from TU Berlin even allowed us to work in his lab to optimize the selection of the amino acyl synthetase.   We incorporated all insights by working with the general public and numerous experts in ethics and prepared a report about ‘Chances and Implications of an expanded genetic code’, where we draft guidelines for the handling of unnatural bases. Working with a foreign plant gave us the chance to learn about the laws and guidelines of the Nagoya protocol . Beside our main focus on expanding the genetic code, working with the general public has been an important part of our project.  In practice, we organized and held various events . At the 6th   CeBiTec students’ academy and the Teutolab, we taught the basic methods of synthetic biology and bioinformatics to people of all ages.   At the GENIALE, a science event with booths all over the city, we did exciting experiments with visitors and showed them how to conduct  experiment with every-day materials.  The industrial usage can be an important factor for the design of applications. We had the chance to cooperate with MERCK, Biofidus AG, BIBITEC GmbH and an attorney for patent law, where we presented our project and got important feedback with regards to our approach on the unnatural bases and our applications. The following sections highlight our interactions with experts and how they influenced our project. They not only shaped our project,  but also broadened our horizon on how to communicate and interact with the public about our future research in our coming careers.
ChImp Report
While synthetic biology offers solutions to many current issues, it has also been met with skepticism with regards to its responsible  use and implications resulting from its research. To assess chances and implications of an expanded genetic code in particular, we interviewed  experts from the scientific, philosophical, and religious fields. Furthermore, the public was asked for their opinions regarding this topics in a survey.  On the basis of our research, we developed practical guidelines for research projects concerning synthetic"
Edinburgh,2014,Team:Edinburgh#modelling#software_-_-_TEXT.html," got to work. We ran their antisense gene through our program and tried to predict how favourable their RNA was based on its secondary structure. We also worked out some suggested antisense genes they might make if it didn't (which required some modification to the program to get rid of the paired termini and, a feature that hadn't even occurred to us, to omit genes with illegal restriction sites). We would help them by proving optimal gene sequences for antisense, and they would help us by providing real world wet data to test our predictions.
Our predictions turned out to be somewhat grim – the antisense molecule UCL had selected looked somewhat tangled, and didn't cover the critical region. In a turn of events that was unfortunate for UCL, but somewhat reassuring from a software point if view, the antisense gene did in fact fail to knock down the target gene. This might not necessarily be because the antisense RNA was as folded as predicted, but nonetheless we took it as promising signs of the usefulness of our tool. Clearly many, many more tests would need to be done to confirm this as one data point is all but useless but still – data is data.
Predicted structure of UCL's antisense RNA
At time of writing UCL are still working on synthesising our suggested antisense genes, and if they get time, we will be very interested to learn how well they work.

Who We Are
Background

Who We Are
The UBC iGEM team is composed of ten undergraduate students under the guidance of six graduate and two faculty advisors. We are pleased to be composed of students from over eight disciplines and multiple years of study. This year we are fortunate to be based out of the Murphy and Hallam Labs located in UBC’s Life Science Center to conduct our wet lab research. Our summer goal was to build off the findings of the Smit Lab (also located at UBC) to develop a new enzyme display system with the application for biomass decomposition.
Background
Emerging scientists everywhere are taught in jargon that requires the structure of post-secondary education to understand and decipher the complex topics that arise regularly in every science field ranging from micro-processors to planetary science. Given this, there is no surprise there exists a large gap between the science community and the general public with the passage of information from primary research to that which a person would see on the news or in a magazine. Given this explanatory divide, we set about discovering what has worked in the scientific community in the past and who is currently having the most success in conveying scientific information.
Every scientist has been there, sitting at home enjoying dinner with your family or close friends and a news story arises on the television which is broadly related to the field of your study. Announced over the news is the next cure for cancer, miracle energy source that provides clean sustainable energy, or the discovery of a new planet that can sustain human life. However, as someone who is familiar one of the aforementioned topics, you’re left explaining why the discovery, yet still extremely exciting, still has to go through clinical trials,"

Measurement
It wouldn’t matter if our hardware was cheap, portable and easy to build if it didn’t actually work. We characterized it with LUDOX and fluorescein to ensure it wasn’t just making up the readings.
We used the interpreter to record the data from device. These readings were then exported and analysed to plot the graphs.
Optical density
Optical density measurements were taken using different concentrations of LUDOX. We made up a dilution series, with initial concentration 50µM and diluting by half each time. We used 6 dilutions. We used the same cuvette (washed with distilled water between readings) to avoid random error introduced by the differences between our cuvettes. We characterized our densitometer using Lee Filters’ - Fire (019) and Medium yellow (010) - and without a filter.
The readings for optical density are consistent with little variation between readings, except for LUDOX concentrations above 12.5µM. Above 12.5µM the readings began to decrease. We are unsure as to why this would happen, but this is clearly not caused by random error as it happened with all the filters.
Fluorescence
For the fluorometer function of our device, we used fluorescein to take measurements. We made up the same dilution series, with initial concentration 50µM and diluting by half each time but with fluorescein instead of LUDOX. We characterized our fluorometer using LEE Filters’ Twickenham Green (736) and without a filter.
The results are consistent and demonstrate the linearity of our fluorometer. The pipetting error in the dilutions is visible on the graph, as the distances betwen the points and the lines of best fit are similar both with the green filter and"

Scientific Milestones
Knowledge Transfer
Funding
Regulation
This roadmap outlines that without the implementation of a knowledge transfer strategy, there is limited confidence attaining in achievements under the other three key areas of the model. Scientific milestones would not be achievable without a sustained level of funding provided through other groups impacted by the prospective commercialization of these synthetic biology tools. Moreover, regulation of synthetic biology tools is influenced by the ethically themed perceptions created by both the scientific and non-scientific community.
The knowledge transfer strategy would be an interdisciplinary model that would impact the following stakeholders:
Natural and Social Scientists
Engineers
Industry Representatives
Non-governmental organizations
Non-scientific community (ie. hospital staff, hospital patients and members within institutionalized settings)
Decision makers (ie. potential investors)
Funding Agencies
Knowledge Transfer Strategy
In this context, knowledge transfer is the exchange of research knowledge between the institution producing the synthetic biology technology and their target end-user. The purpose of the knowledge transfer strategy is to develop a communication platform between all stakeholders to mitigate the unsourced perceptions, bias’ and stigmas against the field of synthetic biology. Moreover, it is better to develop an interdisciplinary team at the early stages of the technology development phases versus segregating the two communities until the technology is prospectively in its commercialization phase.
Method
The following are examples of methods that can be used by the synthetic biology industry in promoting tools such as the Staphiscope to its potential end-users (ie. individuals within hospitals and community facilities)
Development of an interdisciplinary network that consists of synthetic biologists, engineers, potential investors, and the general public
Sustainable dialogue between all stakeholders within the interdisciplinary network. This can be achieved through: Workshops that aim in exchanging information to individuals that will benefit from the application of the Staphiscope in either a hospital or community based setting
Educational materials that are specifically tailored to the different parties that could be impacted by the commercialization of the StaphiScope (ie. Hospital Microbiologists, Patients, and the General Public)
Incorporating the General Public and other stakeholders at the research phase of the technology development process. This results in a mutual benefit to both the institution as well as the end-user in that they are able to collaboratively discuss the ethical feasibility of the technology.
Use of knowledge broker- A knowledge broker is essentially an intermediary resource that assists in translating research knowledge to information that is comprehensible to a member that is not from the field of synthetic biology. An individual that has attained"

Building with Biology
Aa a 2016 Building with Biology Project recipient,we have held events to educate and engage the public in synthetic biology. The infographic we creatd summarizes are outreach through Building with Biology
We were honored to be among the 200 groups collaborating on the 2016 Building with Biology project, one of only three high school iGEM teams, where most were museums, community labs, and educational organizations. Building with Biology is a synthetic biology project funded by the National Science Foundation and led by the Boston Science Museum,  American Society for the advancement of Science, BioBuilder Foundation, Science Museum of Minnesota, and the Ithaca Science Center.
After reading of the program’s goal to create conversations between the public and those working in synthetic biology research, like us, we submitted a detailed application in March explaining how we would use the physical kits at public venues and at the local schools to create those conversations with the members of our community. We have used their well designed activities, and accompanying thought provoking guides to ask questions, spark debates, and facilitate conversations. With our Building with Biology Kit, we ran two public events at the Ashburn Public Library and the 2016 Loudoun STEM Day and held public forums in two high school science classrooms on genetically engineered mosquitoes.
Ashburn Public Library
September 10, 2016
To get a public venue to host Building with Biology events, we contacted a few organizations.Our local library was fully supportive. Advertised by them, we held our event on a Saturday afternoon. In a large room, we ran the following activities; Super Organisms, See DNA, Kit of Parts, Bio Bistro, and Tech Tokens from the Building with Biology kits and the popular Plasmid Bracelets activity from William and Mary iGEM teacher curriculum. The Building with Biolgy kit activities are shown below.
At the  two hour event, kids took their time at each station, enjoying the activities  while learning. It also gave us an opportunity to talk to parents; many expressed they did not know much about synthetic biology but were eager to learn. Being the first time we used the Building with Biology kits"

Within the greater goal of producing renewable fuels from solar energy, I’m working with the design and implementation of biological tools and systems in the photosynthetic Cyanobacteria. This includes transcriptional and post-transcriptional control, development of standard (BioBrick) plasmids and heterologous expression of hydrogenases (BioModularH2). Additional research interests include RNA-based regulation, GFP in vivo localization and biological model simulations.
Developing and advising team Uppsala-Sweden have provided me with lots of inspiration. The sum of all the late evenings and weekends the team has spent, their innovativeness - both in design and all kinds of problem solving, will surely help to inspire new students, and hopefully, the system and all the novel parts will find their way into the hands of the renewable energy teams of iGEM 2010.

A new colony was picked from the plate, but this colony was also already contaminated with phages.  Therefore, AP_dark_Ppsp_EL222-BR had to be transformed again into S1030 cells.
The same AP_dark_Ppsp_EL222-BR purification was used to transform S1030 cells by electroporation and cells were plated on Amp/Tet-plates. On the next day, a colony was picked and grown in 4 ml 2xYT + carbenicillin overnight. A glycerol stock was prepared, and the remaining culture was used to isolate and purify the plasmid.
The plasmid purifications were sent to GATC for sequencing. The sequencing results proved that the cells carry the right promoter in front of gIII. AP_dark_Ppsp_EL222-BR is further referred as AP_dark.
AP Testing
Cultures of S1030 cells containing AP_light and AP_dark were prepared and grown to an OD600 of 0.6 in 2xYT with carbenicillin. Then, this culture was split into 20 ml cultures and infected with 10 µl of either SP_Opto or Dickinson phage target_133 (titer: (~1015 PFU/ml) according to the following table:

0. Abstract  
Biosynthesis enables renewable and environment-friendly production of various compounds. However, present biosynthetic performances still await improvements to be cost competitive with petroleum-based chemical synthesis and suitable for large-scale industrial production. In order to achieve this goal, many approaches have been created, among which the Population Quality Control (PopQC) system is proved efficient. In our project, a PopQC system was developed as a plasmid based gene circuit in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 to continuously select high-performing cells in order to improve the yield of target metabolite, glutamate. In the presence of our PopQC system, high-producers stayed alive while low-producers were unable to survive. Consequently, the average intracellular concentration as well as the yield of glutamate among the population was enhanced, which finally led to the yield enhancement of poly-γ-glutamate, a high-value-added secondary metabolite.
1. Motivation  
Artificial biosynthetic pathways have enabled renewable, environment-friendly production of a variety of significant products ranging from simple fuels (such as ethanol, butanol and fatty acid derivatives) to intricate natural products (such as artemisinin, strictosidine, erythromycin, and so on). However, these biosynthetic processes are always criticized for being uneconomical for large-scale industrial production because of their relatively lower yield compared to petroleum-based chemical synthesis. Therefore, it’s urgent and important to create new approaches to enhance biosynthetic performance.
2. Our Choice—PopQC  
PopQC, which is the abbreviation for population quality control, is a new approach designed for biosynthesis yield enhancement based on non-genetic cell-to-cell variation. Because of some non-genetic differences, different cells in a single colony will have considerable variations in protein and metabolite concentrations. Therefore, in cell cultures there will be both high- and low-producers, and the intrinsic low-producers might cause suboptimal ensemble biosynthesis. The elimination of low-producers can lead to the efficient utilization of substrates and high yield of target products. Based on this, in our project PopQC was developed as a plasmid-based gene circuit, which continuously selects high-producers to optimize the biosynthetic"

Since we could not find a constitutive promoter BioBrick allow expression in mammalian cell, we amplified CMV promoter from pEGFP-N1 (Clonetech). To characterize this CMV promoter, we used CMV promoter – green fluorescent protein – polyadenylation sequence construct with pEGFP-N1 as positive control and GFP-PolyA in pSB1C3 as negative control. If the result shows that GFP is expressed and scatter around in cell, while negative control shows no GFP signal in cell, we can conclude that CMV is functioning.

UC_Davis,2016,Team:UC Davis#Interview_-_-_TEXT.html," were developed to protect human rights, pursuant to the United Nations Declaration of Universal Human Rights [8] and ignoring them can be very harmful, not just on a moral level, but also if your research is conducted without oversight, it may bar the entire work based on the data from publishing, and instigate disciplinary action from the university. [9] Some publications refuse to accept submissions containing research from studies without IRB supervision, and ongoing studies can be immediately halted by the institution. [10] Thus, even when the data being collected is from surveys which place the participants under minimal risk, this step of administrative approval is crucial to good scholarship.
An important note: IRB’s are not the end all be all for determining ethical experimentation—some very harmful experiments have passed this review. One well known example is the Stanford Prison experiment, where 24 students were arbitrarily designated as a prisoner or a prison guard, [11] and experienced significant psychological disturbance during the course of the experiment. [12] Dr. Zimbardo followed all necessary procedures for IRB approval at the time of the experiment, [13] including consent form which can be read here: http://pdf.prisonexp.org/consent.pdf . As a researcher, you will need to have an even broader appreciation for the ethical risks of your experiment.
One resource to help you consider these applications beyond the purview of IRB’s within the United States is the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. [14] You can find their 2010 report on Synthetic Biology here: http://bioethics.gov/synthetic-biology-report .
What Is Exempt from Review, and How Can My Team Comply?
Most surveys conducted by iGEM teams are exempt from full review by the IRB. Some procedures that will likely receive exemption determinations include: “anonymous surveys or interviews [and] passive observation of public behavior without collection of identifiers.” [15] The word exempt would seem to indicate that the principle investigator does not need to contact the Internal Review Board at all. This is not the case. What exempt means in this context is that the research will not require ongoing review. Once the protocols have been submitted, the IRB will issue an exempt determination and the researcher will not need to file any more information. But, even if this result is anticipated, the determination is CRUCIAL to the standing of the research.
Let’s go through the worksheet for receiving an exemption looks like at UC Davis. You can download the form in full here: http://research.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/HRP-312-WORKSHEET-"

PROGRAMMING SILK: CUSTOMIZING ITS PROPERTIES
Spider silk is a remarkable natural material, exhibiting an incredible range of strength and elasticity. Silk-weaving spiders can actually choose from a wide array of silks (such as dragline, capture-spiral, and egg cocoon silk), each having its own unique physical profile and genetic origin. However, one thing that’s common to all silk is that their genes are comprised of highly-repetitive modules. By comparing and the contribution of each type of module to the silk fiber’s physical properties, we can begin to understand how to create a collection of silk modules to build our own gene!
By genetically engineering the repetitive modules, and stringing them together in defined orders and ratios, we can customize the physical properties of the resulting silk fibers. Given the diversity that naturally exists across different types of silk, we can potentially assemble a massive library of silk proteins with an impressive range of strength and elasticity for a variety of applications. We plan on optimizing the compatibility of the iterative capped assembly (ICA) technique for the iGEM competition, creating a standardized method of assembling any highly-repetitive gene fragment in an efficient, user-definable manner. Having a library of silk gene blocks to choose from, and an optimized protocol for assembling them, we can optimize the selection and production of programmable silk with customizable properties.
Our platform for synthesizing silk is a scalable, eco-friendly solution to the needs of booming industries such as medicine and fashion.  Silk is a popular material for tailoring fine garments, and the ability to modify silk to meet any specification would be an extremely useful tool for textile companies. Silk is also of great interest within the medical field since it does not elicit a strong immune response, and is biodegradable.  Consequently, it has been investigated as a material for use in sutures, grafts, and implants.  These surgical procedures require materials with very specific properties, and the ability to easily modify silk would transform the medical field.
Working with silk on the genetic level gives us the freedom to modify the properties of silk fibers.  But why stop there? What if we could functionalize the silk by f"

The analysis was then optimized by using the germline resources from the gnomad, in order to consider the known sites of exome SNPs and Indels in the analysis.
Filter Mutations - GATK
Due to the lack of matched normal to perform the mutation calling analysis, there is a higher risk to select false positives in the pipeline. Some of these artifacts are generated by the presence of cross-sample contamination in the original                   FASTQ file and are due to sequencing technique. For this reason, it is important to reduce the large pool of mutations generated and filter them accordingly. This can be done by using GetPileupSummaries, CalculateContamination and FilterMutectCalls                   from GATK (v 4.0.9.0) package (McKenna et al. 1297-1303).
The data was first processed GetPileupSummaries, to summarize the reads that support reference genome and list of known allele sites. This can estimate the overall cross-sample contamination. The BAM files used prior to mutation calling                   were assessed against the hg19 human reference genome and two sets of known sites from the Gnomad Library only containing biallelic variants. The whole exome known sites (v 2.0.2) was filtered using GATK (v 4.0.9.0), SelectVariants to                   restrict the alleleles to only biallelic. The maximum population of allele frequency was set to 0.2 and the minimum mapping quality to 50. Furthermore, due to the interest in search on the whole exome sequence for the neoantigen variants"

While the light boxes we build are far from technical mastery, they are easy to use and fulfil their function while looking great. As the design uses a minimal amount of parts, it is very easy to build by inexperienced teams and can be greatly augmented if needed. Therefore the spirit of the modular approach of the iGEM competition is extended to the lab equipment as well.
In the most basic version, a single high-power LED will be powered by a constant current power supply. We used these , as the input voltage can vary between 100-240 V AC. This should be sufficient for most countries.  At this point the LED can be turned on/off by an usual switch.  We used this connection cable with an integrated switch for this purpose. Our current wiring setup:

The next step would be to add dimming functionality to the setup. We achieved this using PWM dimming. For a single LED or a series of LEDs that have to glow at the same intensity this can be done using this controller .

Since our own construct needs blue, red and far-red light sources that can be controlled individually, we needed four PWM dimmers. In order for costs to stay low we used an old ATX power supply as the primary power source. Since dimming and constant current supply we still needed we used a CC step-down buck converter, like this one , that could be controlled by PWM. We controlled the buck converters with an Arduino Uno unit, as this allowed for running set programs of illumination duration and intensity. The green LED was used as a working light, as our light-switches are not excited by green light.

Introduction to LSA
What's Sensitivity Analysis? The sensitivity of a system to its parameters may be determined using either global or local methods. We implement both of them into our code. Specifically, the global sensitivity analysis employed Random Sampling-High Dimensional Model Representation(RS-HDMR) algorithm to estimate the sensitivities of the circuit properties with respect to the circuit model parameters, such as rate constants, without knowing the precise parameter values.
Why Sensitivity Analysis? The models we use to describe a gene network are systems of ordinary differential equations. In the case of ODE models, robustness is generally studied in the context of parametric uncertainty via properties such as robust stability and response to perturbation. Although there is no standard quantitative measure of robustness a common thread in the literature relates robustness to parametric sensitivity. Parameters whose perturbation causes undesirable changes (either qualitative or quantitative) in some output identify processes with fragility The sensitivity information can then guide the selection of the optimal mutation targets and thereby reduce the laboratory effort.
Basic Definitions
Definition 1 Given an initial condition <math>s(0)=s_{0}</math> and a set of parameter values <math>p_{0}</math> , which together for a vector <math>q_{0}</math> ,the time-varying concentration sensitivity coefficients(or concentration response coefficients) are define as the elements of the <math>n\times(n+r)</math> matrix function <math>R_{q}^{s}(t)</math> given by
<math>R_{q}^{s}(t):=\frac{\partial s(t,q)}{\partial q}|_{q=q_{0}}=\lim_{\Delta q\rightarrow0} \frac{s(t,q_{0}+\Delta q)-s(t,q_{0})}{\Delta q}</math>
for all <math>t\geq0</math> The response coefficient defined above provides a measure of the difference between this ""perturbed trajectory"" and the ""nominal"" trajectory at each time t.

Under the RCRA, disposal without a permit is permitted in most states9. The law, however,  augments this freedom by specifying three acceptable avenues of disposal: elementary neutralization,  treatment in accumulation containers, and treatment as part of a disposal process or treatability study.9 Elementary neutralization is appropriate for handling chemicals that are hazardous only because they  are corrosive (pH < 2; pH > 12.5). Upon neutralization, these substances are safe to put down the drain  to any publicly owned water utility as long as the waste complies with their localized standards.  Alternatively, small quantity generators (< 100kg a month) may store waste in accumulation containers.  These entities have no time limit on how long they may collect waste but are required to dispose of  their waste at an approved disposal site once more than 1000kg of waste is accumulated. DIY and other laboratories are also permitted to experiment w/ novel ways to reduce waste without facing legal  liability by conducting in house disposal studies. Since products are not considered waste until  producer declares them as such, green thinking laboratories are encouraged to develop effective  methods for reducing the overall environmental impact of their operations.
Bioterrorism is the most controversial, serious, and difficult to regulate of three aforementioned  concerns. Doomsdayers are alarmed about the possibility of a catastrophic biological attack through  release of some deadly disease or virus. Recent publications in Nature and Science detailing ways to  create new variants of H5N1 influenza that are transmissible between mammals through the air12 exacerbate these fears. Similarly, reports of DIY scientists conducting dangerous experiments, like  atom splitting in a microwave or vaccine synthesis in facilities akin to “your mother’s spare  bedroom”13 do not inspire much confidence.
In an effort to quell concerns about bioterrorism, the DIY synthetic biology community has  outwardly divorced itself from the term “hacker” due to its malevolent public perception. As a brief  aside, a “hacker” is actually “someone who enjoys solving problems, taking things apart, building  things from scratch and prioritizes technical competence and aptitude over appearances or hubris.” 1214 Most hackers are benevolent creatures worlds part from the stealthy computer thief mainstream media  most frequently associates with the term. As a result, the DIY community continues to embrace hacker  as part of its identity.
Returning to topic, the Federal Government has also responded to concerns about bioterrorism.  In 2011"

TEAM
Meet our (crazy) team!
Hey everyone! We are MIT's 2016 iGEM team consisting of 12 students studying anything from biology and chemical engineering to writing and math. We are a fun-loving, cell-growing, biology-doing group of students that've all worked very hard this year to help further research in the field of women's health. We are excited to show you what all we've done, but first meet the MIT iGEM family!
The Team
Kathleen Brandes
Kathleen is a sophomore majoring in both electrical engineering/computer science and math at MIT. She is excited for working with many field experts during this year’s iGEM project to understand endometriosis and hopefully provide a better treatment option. She is interested in synthetic biology’s circuit-like approach to understanding biological systems, and hopes to apply what she learns from this research experience towards robotics work in the future. Outside of iGEM, she pole vaults for the MIT varsity track and field team and holds a leadership position for the Microbiome Club. She also enjoys cooking delicious desserts, photographing wildlife, and reading science fiction novels.
Damon Berman
Damon is a sophomore from New York majoring in biological engineering. Always trying to make other people’s lives better, he is excited to use synthetic biology to more effectively diagnose and treat a disease, and he hopes that iGEM will be the first of many projects of this type that he works on. A former cross country and track runner, he still enjoys running as well as playing basketball, badminton, hockey, and ultimate frisbee. He is also a brother of Theta Chi, where he serves as rush chair and risk manager and enjoys hanging out, playing video games, and watching movies with friends.
Liz Strand
Liz is a junior at MIT majoring in Biological Engineering and minoring in Chemistry. She is enthusiastic about this year's project in endometriosis because she's always wanted an opportunity to improve the lives of people inflicted with a chronic disease. Through iGEM, Liz hopes to gain knowledge in the many applications synthetic biology has with diseases"

The morning started with a gel checking the PCR products of the one BioBrick that didn't give positives yesterday . This gel showed one positive, but when I centrifuged the cells, they gave a red pellet. This indicated that the plasmid unfortunately was not the desired BioBrick, but the original destination plasmid, so we'll have to try again.

Yale,2014,Team:Yale#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," make something happen. What really got me going was when we started to get good results, Langer put me in touch with David Lucchino at the Sloan school, and we created a business plan that won competitions at MIT, Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge, and other universities. We started gaining momentum, and things got very interesting. When you're an entrepreneur, you're also a fund raiser, a writer, and a team leader, regardless of the academic field or industry. Of course its risky, but everything's risky. In the end, you get the skills that will make you flexible and valuable regardless of what you achieve.
We thought about applications as diverse as naval ships, water processing plants, orthopedics, and food safety.  A lot of the decision making for our strategy came down to cost and timeline for development, market size and margin for the product, and the duration of stability and activity required in a given application.
iGEM: How do you translate cool science into something viable?
CL: You have to go from a vision to the unmet need. We eventually licensed a technology I didn't invent, and that's okay. Many large companies suffer from, ""Not Invented Here"" bias, but as a small company, you need to put your ego to the side and lead the team to the best solution.
""Many large companies suffer from, ""Not Invented Here"" bias, but as a small company, you need to put your ego to the side and lead the team to the best solution.""
You also have to get technologists to think about the business issues. How does your technology address the business concerns and give you an advantage in the market? You say: This is how we're going to exploit this unmet need through business. Here's the unmet need, here's our solution, here's why we'll be the only ones to produce it, and here's how we're going to execute.
As one of my fellow board members said: ""I was a scientist and now I'm a businessman."" I think academia is about branching out and looking forward, but business is about having a specific target and finding the shortest path. So it's a very different mindset, but the business mentality is a learnable skill.
iGEM: Did you consult experts on the non-scientific aspects?
CL: Startups are brutal. You can't spend all of your money on lawyers and attorneys. You really have to make yourself an expert. You need to know the science, and you can't afford to have consultants do all of the work for you, so you need"

After meeting with Per, we got very interested the topic of ethics and regulations. This inspired us to write the safety handbook but also to propose a Work of Conduct. This is a document for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) on how to monitor and treat pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents, with a focus on antibiotics. We have through this document combined our collaboration with ISO, with our contact with experts within WWTPs to create a solution to the growing problem that is arising in water bodies around the globe. You can find the Work of Conduct here.
Safety Booklet (""How Safe is Your Project?"")
How do you stay safe in you iGEM project, and what do you need to think about when introducing your project to the world? These are things that our Human Practices team has thought about extensively, and it led to fruitful conversations with professionals. We have learned how to take the highest safety measures when developing our idea, and therefore we wanted to share our knowledge with future iGEM teams to ensure safe practice within iGEM. Therefore we wrote a booklet about safety, to create a safer world. Download it here .
Education and Engagement
Meeting and pitching Biotic Blue to Lars-Olof Eriksson, seller of the magazine Situation Stockholm
We met with Lars-Olof Eriksson who homeless in Stockholm. To get through each day, Lars-Olof sells the magazine Situation Stockholm , a ""news paper"" with the aim of getting homeless people on their feet again. Meeting at the Situation Stockholm headquarters to talk about homelessness, we got a great insight in parts of society that are often forgotten. We got to pitch our product Biotic Blue, and discussion arose on where it could be suitable to implement the idea. One interesting aspect of our talk was that Lars-Olof was the most political person that we met. We often came to talk about politics and the left wing parties, since they were close to his heart. ""You do not vote right if you are not voting for either the Left wing party, or the feminists"" he said. This struck us as something important, since they are so dependent on the way our country is ruled which we are not in the same extent. To learn more about how people think politically, we went to Almedalen. Read more about this further down!

1 Safety
1.1 Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, and/or environmental safety?
1.2 Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry, how did you manage to handle the safety issue, and how could other teams learn from your experience?
1.3 Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
1.4 Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices, and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, and/or environmental safety?
The researcher is not being exposed to any sort of biological element that would cause serious harm to him or her in anyway. The strand of E. coli being utilized in our project would not be resilient in the human body, should contamination occur. Thus, there is very little risk of infection from our bacteria. All other researcher activities use standard biological engineering and molecular biology protocols and methods that pose little harm to the researcher when proper safety precautions are observed. Some testing involving radiation is involved, but that testing would be done independently of our research group in a controlled facility.
Our project idea could actually promote public and environmental safety, if successful. Practical use of this project would help to ensure that radiation levels within a certain area is not within dangerous levels able to cause serious harm to a person. This helps to promote public safety such that people can be told to stay away from certain areas that have high levels of radiation easily.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry, how did you manage to handle the safety issue, and how could other teams learn from your experience?
Any new BioBrick parts for our team do not raise any immediate safety concerns, and so none are listed as such in the registry. However, should the idea behind our project become a reality, some concerns as to containment of our genetically engineered strains of E. coli should be addressed. If our bacterial dosimeter is to be used in the field proper safety and handling issues should be dealt with and are being factored"

These parts were ordered from iGEM HQ, except for CP8 as for this promoter the sequencing was inconsistent. The promoters were sent by iGEM HQ using Escherichia coli containing pSB1C3 with the promoter as insert. E. coli was grown and the plasmids with the promoter were isolated.
21 - 27 Juli
BioBricking the genes NisT, NisI, NisP and the combined genes NisF,  NisE and NisG gave problems with illegal restriction sites.
The illegal restrictionsite in NisI could be removed using the reverse primer as listed above. This primer contains a mutation needed to remove the illegal restriction site.
The other parts gave more problems, as these all contained multiple restriction sites. Therefore, it was decided to use Gibson assembly with primers containing mutations to remove the restriction site. By using Gibson assembly, the genes could also be constructed in pSB1C3 in one go.
The primers in the table below are denoted with the position of the  illegal restriction site that they should remove. Illegal EcoRI sites  are abbreviated with an E, XbaI sites with an X, SpeI site with an S and  PstI sites with a P.

Ethics
The international competition iGEM gathers each year together more and more teams (110 teams for the 2009 session) added to 18 Europeans programs, 70 industries, 10000 laboratories in the world which have all the same common objective: the construction of living systems, following the assembly principle of functional modules.
The emergence and the fast development of this discipline require reflection, to put a regulation system in place ready in the next 5 to 10 years for safe practices.
Thus at the occasion of the iGEM concourse, we realized this debate to think about ethic stake linked to synthetic biology.

However, there is indeed one matching since the two matchings are the same. The underlying reason is that the two chains of the template are equivalent: it makes no difference to the tree structure (Huffman code of each node) if they are exchanged. Hence, several equivalent chains should be matched to a certain set of chains in the species only once.
How to create products based on database description?
In MoDeL frame, products are composed of both definite parts and ST parts. The sources of ST parts are defined in component listOfTransferTable. It seems to be very easy to generate Chain-Node structure of products from reactants and mod modifiers based on the transfer table. However, it doesn't.
Consider first a template reaction with one reactant, A-B, where A and B are both NST parts. If it could be digested by a certain enzyme, the products should be A and B. In the real biological system, if there is a species with structure C-A-B-C, where the first part C and the last C binds to form a tree node. If we try to digest the A-B bond, the species would not be split into two pieces as expected because the two products as expected are connected by the tree node. To find products with correct structure, we design a three-step mix-trim-split algorithm to solve this problem.
Mixing, Trimming and Splitting. Three-step algorithm to generate products.
The first step is to mix reactants and products. The mixture includes all chains of reactants except for those which are matched for some template chain as well as all trees. It also includes all chains and trees of products. And now we have a mixed species with chains and trees from different sources. It is worth noting that chains and trees of modifiers will not be added into the mixture. The next step is to trim the trees. Trees with leaf nodes that are not defined in chains will be removed from the forest. The last step is to split the products out from the mixture. This is because the mixture may not be one standalone complex. In other words, some chains that are not connected with others via tree nodes should not be incorporated into other species. The final standalone split species are real products in the system.
We provide an example to illustrate the product-generating procedure. The reactant has two chains, A-B-C and D-E-F. A, B, C bind with D, E, F, respectively. The products are A and"
XMU-China,2016,Team:XMU-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," METU HS Ankara translate iGEM experiment protocols into Chinese. Besides, we contributed the spread of surveys of Exeter , Pasteur_Paris and Groningen by our translation. Among them, Groningen sent us a badge. In a word, XMU-China was making effort to push synthetic biology, an emerging discipline, to go further in China.
Software test and Modelling
We tested the software developed by SJTU-Software , which is expected to be an efficient tool for iGEMers, no matter for individuals or for teams. The software integrates calendar function, instrument appointment system into a social media. The function which impressed me most is its way to find the team nearby.
We also tested HFUT-China's software called BioDesigner Coral. They built it helping iGEM teams design and construct their device. Besides, BioDesigner Coral shows the relationship between genes, providing a reference of related genes. This function was expanded to the system recommendation, which provided a reference for the device designer.
Besides, we appreciate TecCEM for helping us in construct our Modelling . Because of the limited time, we got in trouble finishing our mathematical model. TecCEM gave a hand to us without hesitation once they saw the trouble in front us. Thanks to their assistance, our model can be shown on our wiki on time. They built the model to simulate the effect of sRNA towards pathogens. The first step was to
simulate the growth of the bacteria which produce sRNA. Multiplying a parmeter, the growth of the pathogens which was affected by sRNA can be shown. Finally, the growth curve of engineering bacteria should minus the curve of pathogens. On the basis of their effort, our project can be more complete and mathematically proved. Here, we sincerely thank them for their help.
Oxford
They sent us a BioBrick of great importance, the quorum sensing system of MRSA. Quorum sensing system was the key part in the detection of antibiotic resistance bacteria. With their help, our project can be more systematic and convincing.
EPFL
We had a skype meeting with them. They interviewed us about the drug-resistance. We show our project to them. With their spread, we found a new method to show our project wider by the collaboration, where we felt to be connected with more iGEMers. Sincerely thanks to their interview.

Auxotrophy assay
Figure 1 : As expected, the plate on the right shows that the tyrosine auxotroph strain is only growing in the presence of tyrosine whereas the AceK strain (non auxotroph) grows in both plates.
Two petri dishes are prepared as follows:
M9
M9 + tyrosine (0.05mg/mL)
TyrA- E. coli strain, purchased at the Keio collection, is screened on each dish. AceK E. coli strain is studied as a control.
The results are showed on Figure 1.
Photocleavage assay
Figure 2 : The cells grew only in the plate on the right which was exposed to UVA rays found in sunlight.
To assay the photocleavage of the o-nitrobenzyl tyrosine (ONB-Tyr), the previous experiment was adapted.
Two petri dishes containing M9 growth medium with ONB-Tyr were prepared. One of them was exposed to sunlight for 8 hours while the other one was kept in the dark. The cells were deposited on the petri dishes after its exposition.
The result is showed on Figure 2.
Fluorescence measurement
The cells used in this method are TyrA- E. coli transformed with the biobrick BBa_K577882. After transformation, the slightly reddish colonies are selected and their fluorescence is measured.
Figure 3 : Selection step of fluorescent colonies (TyrA- + BBa_K577882) on LB + Tyr 0.05 mg/mL. On the upper petri dish, no arabinose had been put in the medium, and on the lower one, arabinose (0.1%) had been introduced, making the expression of the RFP possible. Left - Seen with naked eyes. Right - Under Fluorescent Excitation (584 nm)
Tyr A- E. coli (not transformed), and BL21 E. coli are studied as negative controls. For each cell line,"

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,"We interviewed Michael Runold, a pulmonary physician, treating all kinds of pulmonary diseases but mainly COPD; Niclas Johansson, a physician in infectious diseases, treating mostly respiratory infections like tropical fever and COPD; Annika Hollsing, a physician in pulmonology and infectious diseases, treating mostly CF and asthma; Robert Dickson, a pulmonary disease and internal medicine doctor working with pulmonary diseases, specifically COPD and asthma; Pernilla Sönnerfors, a pulmonary physiotherapist for mostly asthma and COPD; and Ulrica Sterky, a children’s nurse and also the mother to a son with cystic fibrosis.
Questions asked to healthcare professionals:
What is your background?
What are the symptoms you check for when you have an appointment with a patient?
What type of medications do you prescribe/prefer to the different diseases/what exercises do you teach them?
Is there a gap in medication for cystic fibrosis, asthma, and COPD?
How do you treat patients who have problems with mucus?
Would there be a need for a medication targeting mucus?
Would you be open to prescribing a drug involving the use of a GMO?
If this GMO treatment was to be released, which type of device would be the most suitable?
The symptoms were very similar for all answers, such as cough, shortness of breath, tightness of the chest, breathing problems and mucus. The same goes for the prescribed medications, including for an example steroids, bronchodilators or antibiotics. The mucus targeting medications that were mentioned were DNAse, acetylcysteine, bromhexine, sodium chloride, mucolytics and extensive training on how to eliminate the produced mucus, but they all agreed that there is a gap in medications targeting COPD, asthma, and CF and they insisted strongly that there is a need for a medication specifically targeting mucus, especially as the ones today do not work for all patients. This was also encouraged by Pernilla, the physiotherapist that said:
""There is absolutely a need, it would be a great win for those that have a hard time moving the thick mucus upwards. If there was a good enough mucus targeting solution today, the patients would not have to visit me, there is definitely a need.""

Project Description
     Our project consists of a biological molecular device for detection of early stage chronic kidney disease using Cystatin C as biomarker and Bacillus subtilis as chassis. The genetic circuit being assembled is based on the outstanding project of iGEM 2010 Imperial College of London team (special thanks to the ex-iGEMer Christopher Hirst, who helped us a lot sending some important BioBricks). Part of our mission is also to improve characterization of the BioBricks developed in 2010 and to validate the molecular design as Cystatin C detection system. This flexibility of detection is based on a protease cleavage of a membrane protein which triggers the genetic circuit. Since any cleavage site could be designed, virtually any protease could be used as a signal for the detection. In our case, the disease biomarker will inhibit the action of Cathepsin S protease and the detection will be made indirectly and negatively - i.e. by the Cathepsin lack of protease activity and absense of the system output. We are on the way to assemble all the parts and properly characterize each part of our construction on time for the Jamboree. After completion we'll integrate the full circuit in Bacillus subtilis.
     To address a real world situation, we are working on the same principle and aesthetics of the well known devices for biodetection like pregnancy or HIV tests: easy-to-use microfluidic devices. The plan is to design a microchip able to store spores of the developed strains of B. subtilis and safely expose blood samples to our biodetection system, successfully containing the biomaterial and enabling a proper discard of the chip. A priori, the device output monitoring would require a fluorescence detector tool, but we also propose a naked eye output observation as a concept for future prospects.

Collaborations
We met all Dutch iGEM teams during a symposium in the first week of the summer break. Furthermore, we posted two offers on the NTNU-Trondheim Matchmaker, we helped the teams of Queens_Canada and Trieste with their computational models and we came up with 'tips and tricks' for new iGEM teams for the team of Cinvestav. Just before the Regional Jamboree, the Dutch teams will meet again during a symposium in Eindhoven, where every team can rehearse their final presentation. Some German and Belgian teams were also invited to this symposium. See our collaborations page .
Device
We made a working device and created elaborate software for it.
Model
A sensitivity analysis is performed to a basic calcium model , first used by the iGEM team of Valencia in 2009, so we found out which parameters are most sensitive. Furthermore, we made an extended calcium model , in which the kinetics of the calcium homeostasis, voltage-gated calcium channels and GECO proteins are taken into account. By combining these three characteristics, we created a model for a completely new system.
Our yeast cells
In the lab, we created three kinds of yeast cells , containing both the channel proteins CCH1 and MID1 and a red, green or blue GECO calcium sensor.
Challenge in working with yeast cells
By choosing a yeast cell as the basis for our project, we created a challenge for ourselves. Most iGEM work is done with E. coli and relatively few projects focus on yeast. Therefore less knowledge is available and few compatible BioBricksTM have been developed. On the other hand, it creates a greater opportunity for us to contribute to the Registry. Also, our project is focused on a system in which a respond to exogenous stimuli is important, whereas many previous iGEM projects focus on intracellular processes. Again, we hope we created new knowledge which is usable for upcoming teams.

ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"erson Institute for Cancer Research in the University of Manchester. He specializes in development and proliferation.
When he got to know that we wanted to fight IBD, he pointed out to us that Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), which is an important factor of his ongoing research, is a molecule that has the ability to promote regeneration of cells in the inflammatory regions. Prof. Lu introduced us detailed mechanisms of this growth factor and emphasized that in different human tissues, EGF will have different effects. Therefore, as a growth-promoting factor, EGF may bring about the risk of over-proliferation and even cancer. He reminded us that we have to pay great attention to safety issues.
In the end, Prof. Lu encouraged us to be ambitious and have a try. It turns out that this interview became the foundation of our project!
In our project, we chose intestinal bowel disease as our object of study. To have a better understanding of IBD and obtain the first view of the current situation of patients, we contacted two doctors and set up an interview with them.
One is Ge Wensong, who comes from Shanghai Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. The other is Zhang Shengyu, who is from Beijing Xiehe Hospital Affiliated to School of Medicine,Tsinghua University.
Here is the summary of the interview script. (Q= question, A= answear)
Q: Human diseases include not only intestinal diseases, but also many other diseases which threaten human health seriously. So what’s the reason that made you choose to do the research in the field of intestinal diseases?
A1: Diseases involved in gastroenterology are complicated. One of the most prominent disease is intestinal diseases. There are so many different types of intestinal diseases and a major part of them consists of inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal tumors. Studies of intestinal disease are the core research of intestinal diseases nowadays. Personally, I’m very interested in the field of intestinal tumor.
A2: There are three reasons:
Upon the development of social economy and the change of life styles, disease spectrum of digestive system also has been changing. For example, the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease is closely related to the the process of industrialization in Europe and America. And I antipate that intestinal diseases will be one of the most common diseases of digestive system in the 21st century in our country. And the obvious increase of the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease in our country in recent years proves this opinion.
During my years of clinical training, I truly understand the influence brought by intestinal diseases to our patients. For example"

Simplification
Although ODEs provide a thorough, precise description of the whole system, they contain too many equations and parameters which would act as a barrier for simulation and further analysis. A simplification of complicated ODEs is necessary. We simplify every single ODE according to certain appropriate assumptions. Finally, we came up with a set of DDE equations.
Assumptions we have made to deduct the original equations involve:
●Relatively faster reactions such as transcription reactions and binding reactions will reach to Quasi-equilibrium.
●Basal expression of protein is so meager that they can be ignored in modeling.
●Two series of Hill Kinetics equations can be estimated through a single Hill Kinetics equation.
●Protein which is translated from mRNA is proportional to corresponding mRNA in a previous time.
Consider gene lasR and luxR which are all constant genes, since AHL has a relatively low concentration compared to other substances, we assume that protein concentrations of PlasR and PluxR are irrelevant to AHLs. Therefore, concentrations of these proteins will reach to constant quantities. Moreover, certain mRNAs will also be constant. That is:
We have:
Then focus on compound LA1 and LA2. The binding process is far quicker than other reactions such as translation reactions, thus we assume that the compounds are Quasi-equilibrium:
We have:
Take the expressions to equation (6) (15), the functions are transformed to:
The transformed functions have nothing to do with feedback factors compared to original ones. Knowing that such feedback is essential for our system, we add additional feedback factors ka,kb manipulatively.
Then we want to come up a clear expression of A2c1,A1c2.They are generated by protein PluxI and PlasI, whose translation rate is much slower than the transcription rate. So we assume that certain mRNA is Quasi-equilibrium:
We have:
By ignoring the basal expression:
Knowing that protein PtetR is controlled by LA2 through Hill Function, we assume that concentration of mRNA is directly related to LA2:
