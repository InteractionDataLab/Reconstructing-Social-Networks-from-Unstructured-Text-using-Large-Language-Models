    LB medium for E.coli
    1）  Weight the component: 5g/L Yeast Extract. 10g/L NaCl. 10g/L Tryptone
           Note: solid medium: add 20g/L agar
    2） The above materials are fully dissolved by water.
    3） Sterilize the medium for 20 minutes at 121 °C.
    M17 medium
    M17 medium is the commonly used growth medium for L. lactis. This medium is commercially available without carbon source.
    Addition of carbon source for growth:
    0.5% glucose or 0.5% lactose (all strains can grow on glucose; for growth on lactose a strain needs the lactose operon)
    Media and growth conditions for Lactococcus lactis
    Lactococcus lactis vector pNZ8149 harboring lacF as food grade selection marker is selected for the ability to grow on lactose. The host strain L. lactis NZ3900 has all genes involved in the lactose fermentation on the genome, with a deletion of the lacF gene (Enzyme III of the Lac-PTS). The strain can grow on glucose, but in the presence of the lacF gene on a plasmid, it can also grow on lactose.
    A special medium that can be used for selection of Lac+ colonies is Elliker medium. On this rich medium all cells can grow, Lac+ or Lac-, but when lactose is added as sole carbon source the lactose-fermenting cells give yellow colonies.

Kyoto,2016,Team:Kyoto#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," and too dangerous to be used in our lab. NoVLP consists only of capsid proteins of NoV, and does not include the viral RNA. By scanning electron microscopy (SEM), it was observed that NoVLP takes a similar form to NoV. We also confirmed that NoVLP is recognized as the antigen by both the original antibody and scFv. Therefore, we expected that we can perform a highly accurate simulation of our Noro-catcher's activity against NoV, by using NoVLP.
2-5 Cellulose Binding Domain
Among numerous CBDs with various characteristics and binding affinity, we decided to use CBDcex for our Noro-catcher, as it was found on iGEM Registry thanks to iGEM Bielefeld 2012 . CBDcex binds irreversibly to cellulose [11].
CBDcex derives from the exoglucanase of a bacteria, Cellulomonas fimi. This bacteria is known for high cellulolytic activities, using cellulose as a source of energy. CBDcex (10.3 kDa) is a 100 amino acid long domain of an exo-beta-1,4-glucanase (47.1 kDa) [12]. CBDcex belongs to the Carbohydrate Binding Module family 2.
2-6 Development Stage for Noro-catcher's Functionality
In order to prove its practicality and functionality, we set four stages that our Noro-catcher should clear.
Establish bacterial surface display system for both scFv and CBD in E. coli
Observe the functionality of surface expressed scFv by its binding to NoVLP
Observe the functionality of surface expressed CBD by its binding to cellulose
Dual express surface expressed scFv and CBD in E. coli and observe the Noro-catcher's functionality
We organized our results in accordance to the above four stages.
3 Experiments & Results
3-1 Primary Stage: We successfully enhanced upon the surface display system INPNC in E. coli
1) Construction of enhanced parts for surface display
As a device for surface display system, INPNC and BclA are already made into BioBrick parts by past iGEM teams. For example, WPI-Worcester 2014 surface expressed YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) using BclA and observed it through fluorescence microscopy. Penn 2012 used immunofluorescence microscopy to observe surface expression of INPNC-HA tag fusion protein. The functionality of their parts are well described in their respective pages.

WEEK 10: 8/8-8/12/2011
8/8: This week I am continuing to try to create a composite part for our RFP, GFP, and BFP reporters. I decided to use a more commmon RBS B0034 and ligate it with all 3 genes which already have a terminator attached.  Also, I did a CIP reaction on J61100 and J61101 backbones which I then ligated with RFP and BFP.  In addition to these ""bottoms up"" reporter parts, I am starting a new project of cloning the TetR gene which will inhibit our pTet promoter.  I am using the biobrick part BBa_C0040.  Luckily we already have a frozen stock of it, so the part can be spread-plated as well as prepared as an overnight culture right from the stock.
8/9: The transformations worked well, especially with the new RBS, B0034.  Overnight cultures going in tonight.
8/10: Quantification of minipreps was decent, however when I did a restriction digest, cutting at X and P,  only one band appeared.  The uncut bands look around what they should be, but the fact is that I am not seeing an insert at all on the restriction digest reactions. "

yhjH
This gene codes for a phosphodiesterase which reduces the levels of c-di-GMP that are involved in cell motility (Ko and Park, 2000). The protein YcgR is able to bind c-di-GMP and act as a flagellar brake which consequently reduces motility (Paul et al. 2010). The mechanism that we would like to exploit is illustrated in Figure 5. Overexpression of yhjH should therefore result in lower levels of c-di-GMP and increase E. coli's speed by diminishing the ability of YcgR to act as a brake on the flagellum. The second messenger c-di-GMP furthermore plays a role in the regulation of biofilm development. Expression of yhjH on the other hand represses biofilm formation (Suzuki et al. 2006) which could also serve our purposes and induce swimming motility.
Fig. 5: The yhjH gene encodes for a c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase. The substrate, c-di-GMP, is a second messenger that binds to YcgR, a protein that functions as a flagellar brake and thus down-regulates the motor (A). We suggest that the overexpression of yhjH results in increased c-di-GMP degradation and hence in narrowed braking force. Due to a stronger rotation of the flagellum higher motility could be achieved (B).

Results:
Expression of yhjH under its natural promoter in puc18 increased motility in almost all of our assays on LB or Tryptone swimming agar (Fig. 4 & Fig. 6). Not only were the yhjH expressing strains among the fastest on these swimming agar plates but also usually the first colonies to start swimming. This might be an indicator that indeed biofilm formation was inhibited and the E. coli were able to spread faster. Compared to our other tested constructs we got the most reliable"
BIT-China,2015,Team:BIT-China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," pH Controller, is mainly applied in the field of industrial fermentation, which could keep the pH value of the fermentation in an artificial setting. Among the many types of fermentation, food fermentation can be the most direct impact on human health. However, in the face of food fermentation, the biggest potential risk of our project is the toxicity of acidic or alkaline products when regulating the pH of fermentation liquor. Consequently, we are committed to finding a simple, non-toxic and harmless substance as regulators from the beginning of the construction of our gene circuits. At present, only D-lactic acid catalyzed by ldhA may be toxic. But it is only used as a model gene. When used in the actual industrial fermentation, we will analyze factors including recycling rate and reaction among product, regulation acid and alkali since D-lactic acid is also an important fermentation products. At the same time, we have found the gene which could catalyze pyruvic acid to produce L-lactic acid. In the subsequent industrial practice, we will select those harmless genes to avoid these risks.
2.Feasibility Assessment[Collapse]
Compared to the traditional methods, monitoring and adding acidic or alkaline substances, our project constructed self-regulating system using synthetic biology, which is more conducive to solve the problems, such as long-term detection, maintenance of equipment and so on. We focus on the design of the earlier stage. According to HP information feedback from companies and universities, we could choose a variety of ways to apply it in the actual industrial fermentation, such as mixed bacteria fermentation, immobilization, etc. For different fermentation industries, we will apply the appropriate fermentation method to get the maximum benefit. Application of our project will greatly save the cost of testing, maintenance, and mechanical conditioning system, and also with the expansion of scale and time, the advantages of our project will be more obvious. Our customers will be able to obtain higher returns based on the actual industrial scale. If our project will eventually be applied to industrial fermentation successfully and efficiently, maintenance staff will be reduced, but at the same time, it will provide more opportunities for those who have the ability to design biological regulation system.
3.End-User Considerations[Collapse]
The main application field of our project is industrial fermentation, so it is necessary for us to contact with fermentation companies. Depending on our previous experience, we decided to communicate with COFCO Institute of Nutrition and Health. On the one hand, companies usually focus more on final efficiency of the technology, which is helpful for us to collect important information about how we can apply it better, but on the other hand, it"

METU-Ankara,2011,Team:METU-Ankara_-_-_TEXT.html," modelled the characterization of this part by planing two apart control groups.
One pair group for characterization was T7 promoter,RNA thermometer and GFP from upstream to downstream at 37C and the same device at 42C. The aim of this control group was to control any expression of green fluorescence protein at 37 C to check RNA thermometer dimer formation. We prepared a flask experiments and from protein formation to folding range we measured the spectrophotometer and fluoresence spectrometer readings. It is showed the dimer formation of RNA thermometer at lower than 42 C caused inefficient binding of RBS to DNA. That means we measured the GFP readings at two temperatures however at 42 C the expression was observed in higher level. As seen at OD:0.6 reading there is a dramatic difference in expressions.
Other pair group for characterization was T7 promoter with GFP at 37 C  and  T7 promoter,RNA thermometer and GFP from upstream to downstream at 42C. This control group was modelled in order to check and compare the expression levels of two devices. The expected result was to observe the similar readings. Because without RNA thermometer temperature switch off device express similar readings at 37C with RNA thermometer device at 42 C. In the data analysis we observed that there is deviation in readings between control T7 with GFP at 37C and to construct, T7 RNA thermometer and GFP at 42 C.
GFP Reading Data
Assembly Results
According our clonning plan, we planned to ligate the coding sequences of methane monooxygenase as subunits and to express the functional monooxygenase enzyme. Since we synthesized the long coding sequence we did PCR experiments with specific primers we extracted the parts in each the gel electrophoresis results gave validation for successfully synthesied DNA fragments, then we digested and ligated each part with related promoters and vector (pSB1C3) again gel electrophoresis data gave us validation to correctly digest and ligated form.
-The device parts control experiments
The synthesized methane monoxygenase construct was so long part that we had problems in synthesizing that we got genes so late. By the way the long sequence was divided into two sequences that one of the regions were splitted into two parts therefore we could not ligated the two parts of coding sequence due to unidentified restriction sites, and full construct unfortunately did not reach to us. The main methane interacting region of monooxygenase could not be expressed functionally.   We expressed the protein B and C of methane monoxygenase encoeded from mmo B and mmo"

KUAS_Korea,2018,Team:KUAS Korea#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," acknowledge the current status of Synthetic biology in Korea and hold an open seminar for all undergraduate students.
High school education session in Yeouido highschool
As a part of the effort to popularize synthetic biology, we arranged a mentoring/lecture session for high school students interested in biology and considering it as their future major. We mainly focused on introducing the concepts of synthetic biology and showing how they are applied in real-life situations. Synthetic biology is not yet a widely recognized field in Korea, and not many students have heard of it before. This is problematic since high school years play a vital role in investigating and deciding one’s own majors and careers. Therefore, we wanted to give these students a chance to learn about yet another aspect of biology, and share some first-hand experience as to how this field actually is from a researcher’s point of view. This way they will have some solid bases of facts and experiences on which they can decide their future, reducing trial and errors many students are going through.
The session was held in Yeouido high school, a science-priority school. Many of the participants were members of the biology club, although other students interested in biology were also present.The mentoring was mainly comprised of three parts. First, we had a brief introduction to our university and team to the students. Next, we followed up with the definition and various techniques of synthetic biology, along with some actual examples of the studies. Finally, we had an exercise on using KEGG and the RSBP to search for parts to build their own synthetic organisms from. We received questions during the session, and between each successive part of the lecture.
During the introduction, we explained the four departments in the college of life sciences & biotechnology, and how they differ from each other. We then talked about iGEM and our team’s activities related to it. We went over some of our previous projects, the Giant Jamboree and other efforts at studying and promoting synthetic biology.In explaining the concepts of synthetic biology, we started off with the scientific backgrounds that led to the establishment of the field and explained its progress in diachronically. Next, we introduced the concept of Biobricks, and the meaning it has in formulating scientists’ point of view in biology. We then showed some basic assembly methods in synthetic biology, and how this can be used to ‘build’ organisms using biobricks. We then went over some actual studies in synthetic biology, which includes PROP-Z, recombinant luminescent bacteria, and efficient biofuel production. There were students in the lower grades present, and some of them seemed to have trouble"
ATOMS-Turkiye,2014,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Background-Problem_-_-_TEXT.html," It is also distinct from heart failure, in which the pumping action of the heart is impaired. However, an MI may lead to heart failure.
Symptoms occur at the end of ischemic cascade
Heart attack is known in medical literature as coronary heart disease, or coronary artery disease, due to atherosclerosis, or the build-up of fatty acid as a plaque on the inner lining of coronary arteries. The plaque and resulting blood clots block the artery partially or completely, reducing the amount of blood that can flow through the artery to the heart. This cuts off the oxygen supply to part of the heart muscle.(2) If impaired blood flow to the heart lasts long enough, it triggers a process called the ischemic cascade; the heart cells in the territory of the occluded coronary artery die (chiefly through necrosis) and do not reproduce. A collagen scar forms in their place which also puts the patient at risk for potentially life-threatening arrhythmias, and may result in the formation of a ventricular aneurysm that can rupture with catastrophic consequences. A heart attack requires immediate medical attention. Treatment attempts to save as much viable heart muscle as possible and to prevent further complications, hence following the phrase ""time is muscle”.
Although the main symptoms of heart attack are well-known and described, some of these attacks can be mild and unrecognized. This results in the weakening and the loss of heart tissue, which may pave the way for more dangerous heart attacks that can end up with mortality. In many cases there are estimates as high as 64%, for individuals that do not have chest pain or other symptoms. These heart attacks that occur without any symptoms or with very mild symptoms are called silent heart attacks(3). At least one-fourth of all heart attacks are silent, without any chest pains or other symptoms. These cases can be discovered later on electrocardiograms, using blood enzyme tests or at autopsy without a prior history of related complaints, however all of these are late for an effective treatment. This latency in the nature of heart attacks obliges us to find a more effective prevention or solution method that can initiate the healing process instantly.
The Calm Before Storm
The treatment of ischemia includes the removal of the blockage. This, however, is only the beginning of the solution. So far, we are able to dissolve the clot ingredients with specific medications. However, the hypoxic tissue have adapted to such new severe conditions in order to survive by accelerating and multiplying energy providing pathways and oxygen dependent reactants. The absence of oxygen and nutrients from the blood during the ischemic period creates a state in which the rejuvenation"
SYSU-Software,2017,Team:SYSU-Software#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," However, each paper usually describes its design in the author’s own style and standard, which is usually hard to understand and absorb its design ideas for one’s own creative work.
“We all hope to stand on shoulders of the giant, but it's hard at this stage to combine or transfer the senior's ideas in order to form my own ideas.” Researcher Dong said.
How to trigger one's inspiration? What if our software could help people with inspiration? This ""Inspiration"" inspires all of us. However, it is a challenge for us, because “inspiration” is such an abstract concept, and is hard to measure and specify. But hope is still alive: several related previous works may create a new idea. To find out related projects and to guide users to a clearer direction, are what we consider to achieve in our software.
Thanks to the inspiration flashed across our mind, we decided to create an onomatopoeia ""S-Din"" as the name of our project and software, as it sounds like turning on a bulb.
Needs & Functions Integration
Here are S-Din's core functions we developed for users' needs.
Integrated database
In S-Din's database, we standardize a new data format for different types of data: parts, projects, keywords and papers. Based on this format, our database is integrated into a unity, and accessible to set up interaction network and analysis. The S-Din search engine and S-Din Design are both working under this standard.
Keyword Tree & Network Analysis
In order to stimulate one's inspiration in synbio work design, we tried the following explorations: The tree of words, and network analysis.
The tree of words: When you first enter the search engine of S-Din, you could search any word you like, or try selecting a word to explore more! When clicking, You will see the subordinated words. After few repeats, you will finally get the projects that you want. This function is designed to help specify your need, and help you understand your idea better.
Network analysis: This function is designed to help you find out potential relationships between two parts, projects or keywords. Sometimes the recommendation may be hard to understand, but perhaps it would open a new direction and lots of inspiration for you.
To learn more about these functions, check Gold Integrated page  for details.

Fault tree: How to choose the best strategy for our treatment ?
In the consequence tree, we consider here the Iron Coli as if it already produced the siderophores, and thus have iron under a chelated form. We imagine then, what Iron Coli may become after their action in the jejunum.
(1) Free iron needs to be chelated by siderophores to be internalized by bacteria. Thus, a higher concentration could favor any bacterial growth. However, the pathogenicity of harmful strains is characterized by the expression of a higher amount of siderophores, thus positively selecting them among others.
(2) If Iron Coli dies after it released its siderophores without internalizaing them after chelation, both pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains have access to the chelated iron. This should not favor one or another.
(3) In case Iron Coli survives, the expression of siderophores in the presence of iron is a suicidal behaviour if the ion comes to be in excessive amount. We hypothesize that the bacteria may lose the plasmids for its own survival because the selective pressure is lost. However, if the overexpression of siderophores appears as beneficial for bacterial growth, the strain has an advantage compared to the rest of the microbiome.
(4) As expected, mutations and genetic information sharing among bacteria are the main concerns for the patients and the general public. We can see through this fault tree that this scenario"

so by taking
$$t_{1/2}=\frac{ln(2)}{d_{GFP}}$$
from experimental curves, we are able to retrieve
$$d_{GFP} = 4.9 . 10^{-3} min^{-1}$$. For very low initial concentrations of initial AHL and considering degradation, we have
$$ \frac{d[GFP]}{dt}=\frac{k_{45}[P_{tot}][AHLi]^2e^{-2d_{AHL}t}}{K_{d4}K_{d3}}-d_{GFP}[GFP].$$
We find
$$ [GFP]=\frac{k_{45}[P_{tot}][AHLi]^2}{K_{d4}K_{d3}(d_{GFP}-2d_{AHL})}(e^{-2d_{AHL}t}-e^{-d_{GFP}t}).$$
This curve has a maximum at
$$ t_{max}=\frac{1}{d_{GFP}-2d_{AHL}}ln\big(\frac{d_{GFP}}{2d_{AHL}}\big).$$
This way we can find from experimental curves $$d_{AHL}=4,0.10^{-3} min^{-1}$$
This AHL degradation rate is alumped parameter between internal and external degradation rates, equivalent to
$$d_{AHLext}+\alpha d_{AHLint}$$
where α is the fraction of the volume occupied by cells in the whole culture. From that on we could find reasonable values for internal and external AHL degradation rates.
Finally the curves simulated by our model with these parameters fit the experiments quite well:

So, why dont we gather and see safety as a way to benefit eachother? Because not only will this open new doors for our future safety plans but will also increase the probability of reaching our aimed destinations. The Lyon jamborees is a great opportunity to form a platform where we can discuss our safety issues, what we have done to overcome them and the main parts that have challenged us the most.
After reading your abstract a few questions on the safety of your projects popped into our minds. If you are interested in forming a discussion platform, we would be delighted  receive your answers as this, on the day of the platform will enable your team to see how much progression was made with safety from today onwards.
We would be really grateful to read your questions on the safety of our project too J

Questions
1-) Does this protein have any effect on human or other living organisms health? Have you thought of it being possibly poisonous to them?
Their Response
  Dear ATOMS-TÜRKİYE iGEM Team 2013,
I am Stewart Humble, a member of the iGEM Grenoble-EMSE-LSU Team for 2013.  I was asked to give a quick informal overview and comparison with our project and my previous research at LSU to address some of the biosafety issues and questions that may arise for our team.
As an undergraduate at LSU, I performed my thesis work on the synthesis and cellular investigations of a specific photosensitizer that is a chlorophyll derivative called Chlorin e6.  My work concentrated on the applications of this photosensitizer in the clinical process known as photodynamic therapy (PDT).  PDT is used to destroy tumors, and involves three key components:  a photosensitizer, light, and tissue oxygen.
By modifying this derivative through the addition of positively charged amino acids (lysine), I was able to give strengthen its amphiphilic characteristics.  Amphiphilicity is a measure of the extent to which a molecule can behave in both a polar and nonpolar way.  This gives these molecules the ability to dissolve in the blood and also to pass through hydrophobic cell membranes.  After biological studies, I found that the molecular photosensitizer I constructed was very potent in terms of phototoxicity, which means that even at very low concentration there was destruction of the cancer cells.

LOGBOOK: JUNE
June 7th, 2018: Some Human Practices advances
We organized with the LISBP a participation to a european scientific event (ESOF) which took place from the 9th to the 14th of July. We were also brainstorming about the ethical aspects of our subject. We planned a demonstration at the primary school Belbèze Toulouse with a class of 9-10 years pupils.
June 14th, 2018: Gonna labwork now
We started a training session to learn the basis of molecular biology and decided of a timetable to manage the progressions of our subject. The first cultures of G. hansenii and K. rhaeticus were performed in tubes and boxes. We had to solve some format problem for the wiki. For the modelling, we had to seek the expert advice of Sophie Barbe that eventually joined our supervisor team. Calculations started too and we faced the problem of the stability of our linker.
June 21st, 2018: The wetlab begins!
The training session was over. We began the experiments. For the modelling part, the connections between CBM3a and the two other heads were complicated to analyse. We managed to model the CBM3a and streptavidin parts but the unnatural amino acid AzF was trickier to model. To solve this problem we replaced it with a phenylalanine which enabled us to have a good starting point for our reflection about the structure of Cerberus. We also worked on the definition of our wiki graphical aspects.
June 23-24th, 2018: Meeting with the new Montpellier iGEM team
We met the iGEM team from Montpellier during a weekend of collaboration and visits! This was their first participation to iGEM and we were glad to share our experience of the competition. At first we made an assessment of the functioning of our two teams to optimize it. We then decided to apply for joint funding from the Occitan region. We began a collegial and ethical brainstorming about their system.
June 26th, 2018: Collaborating with Asia
We encounter problems of electroporation with Pichia pastoris. After a think tank with the team, we find out that we have some issues with our concentration of antibiotic. We organized a"

The pigment takes a while to develop, around 36 hours compared to magenta's overnight development, but the colour is reasonably strong and is produced evenly by the cells. However, more time has been invested in the cyan pigment which is responsive to red light (see ""Planned Post-Freeze Work"").
Red Light Module output Brick with BglII and BamHI restriction sites
Ligation of Gibson
assembly parts showing
superfolder GFP
Restriction digest of
output bricks showing band
at around 950bp
Our output brick for the Red Light Module includes the ompC promoter which is specific to the protein OmpR . This is followed by an RBS and a restriction site for BglII and the coding region for a GFP . A second restriction site for BamHI follows, then a series of STOP codons to act as a terminator. The whole sequence is flanked by the iGEM prefix and suffix allowing the BioBrick to be used in 3A Assembly.
This BioBrick was built for us by IDT in their gBlock format. We designed the BioBrick to contain a central GFP that is split between the two gBlocks, thus acting as a marker for a successful Gibson Assembly.
As the image to the left shows, the two halves of GFP have been ligated together to form a complete, working protein in the successful Gibson Assembly of our output bricks. GFP is constitutively expressed within DH5α cells as endogenous ENVZ phosphorylates endogenous OmpR as a component of osmolarity sensing. Endogenous OmpR then binds to ompC. Thus our output brick is working as expected. In order to test whether the output brick can be implemented into the Red light pathway and ENVZ- strain should be used to avoid false positives.
A restriction digest was performed on four independent Gibson assembly products with BamHI and BglII to ascertain whether the restriction sites were implemented correctly into our brick. A gel electrophoresis of the digested parts showed two clear bands: plasmid DNA with ompC promoter and suffix at ~2300, and superfolded GFP coding sequence DNA at ~750. Both bands are in their expected position.
In order to insert a new part, we suggest following a standard primer based mutagenesis protocol to change the restriction sites to BamHI and BglII. Additionally when picking transformed colonies, screen for green fluorescence. These colonies' plasmids have ligated incorrectly. Colonies' plasmids that have no florescence should be miniprepped, digested and ran"
Tianjin,2015,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," is PET pre-incubation with Janus, which means adding Janus into plastics primarily, and then putting cutinase in the container after 24 hours. The third way is making Janus and cutinase into fusion protein, which is a novel work that could increase cutinases' activity radically.
Figure 11. Three ways of hydrophobin addition.
Furthermore, we develop comprehensive and innovative models on Janus-enhanced plastic enzymolysis. We make a good combinaton of thermodynamics and dynamics, and a novel kinetic model is built to better describe the enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis of PET by combing the Michaelis-Menten equation with the Langmuir equation. Meanwhile, we propose models to describe the effect of Janus into the hydrolysis system based on the hyphothetical elementary reactions using the result of self-asembling model and the novel kinetic model in the first part. Thirdly, to visualize the result of our modelling, we write a program using MATLAB which simulates PET degradation process. (Click here to see more about our models!)

This summer, we contacted with iGEM team SCAU-China and had a meeting with them. In the meeting, the members of SCAU-China shared us some experience about team building, doing experiments, building models and making wiki.   And we learnt about that in their project, rice was used as the material to produce astaxanthin, which was supposed to be an economic way to produce astaxanthin. They wanted to know what will be the cost of the astaxanthin and we also had an interest on this, so we proposed to make a comparison of the costs for astaxanthin productions in different method. Finally, we could find that rice could be a great kind of material to produce astaxanthin because it could lower the price of astaxanthin greatly and made astaxanthin more accessible to the public."

Potential KNR+petBD was amplified using AGP_KNR forward and petBD_INV reverse primers and an initial annealing temperature of 57 degrees C. Potential petBD+INV was amplified using petBD_INV forward and INV_AGP reverse primers with an initial annealing temperature of 64 degrees C. Gibson assembly was verified on 0.7% agarose gel at 13.8 V/cm for 60 minutes.
Results: No bands were observed for the PCR of the Gibson Assembly reactions. This indicates that either gibson assembly failed, or purification and PCR of the gibson assembly products failed. Thus, neither KNR+petBD nor petBD+INV were constructed via gibson assembly.
Enzymology
CL:This week we used the GC to analyze the fatty acids being produced by one of the BTE IQ cell samples (BTE13).  The fatty acids were extracted from cell supernatent using hexane and tested with a carbon disulfide solvent.  We used FAME standards ranging from C:8-C:19 as well as a C:19 internal standard for comparison.  Results proved positive as we were looking for C:12 FA's and there were C:8, C:10 and C:12 FA's present in the sample.  We suspect that the small chains could possibly be the larger C:12 chain being metabolized and we plan to further analyzed this data.  This was just a test or a pre-run and we did not use a negative control or test very many samples.  We plan to do a definite run next week on four new BTE samples as well as negative controls of wild-type IQ cells and a known concentration of a C:17 internal standard will be used for quantification.  Also this week we performed our third ethanol assay using the BioSystems Ethanol assay kit on 4 of the ADH/PDC IQ cell cultures.  We retrieved positive results for one of the samples (ACH/PDC17) with an ethanol production of 3.4mM.

BW:We thought to check the pH of BG-11 with casaminos to determine if this addition lowered the pH noticeably.  Whereas BG-11 has a pH of 6.7, after adding casaminos the pH drops to 5.7.  The pH of our media will be adjusted to 6.7 in future experiments.

(C) Streaked again after 6 days growth in SRF. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Conclusion: MG1655 E.coli are viable and grow on mixed waste alone. Therefore we have established that our chassis could survive in a mixed waste bio-reactor context, which is validation of our concept to industrially implement our system.
Waste conditioned media
These assays were designed to test whether our chassis, E.coli MG1655 strain could grow with waste conditioned media (WCM) over a period of 24-48 hours.  Waste conditioned media is a filter sterilised version of the waste media and was designed for several reasons; Firstly we were unsure whether mixed waste would be toxic to E.coli and hence a less concentrated version may be more suitable and secondly large chunks of waste would prevent accurate OD600 measurements and therefore we decided to filter out the largest chunks.

Conclusion: MG1655 transformed with either empty vector (EV) control or mCherry stress biosensor (BBa_K639003) vector are viable and can grow in waste conditioned media.

Membrane plasma that contain many of cholesterol just like mammalian cell membrane plasma, will not break because cholesterol intercalate between acyl chain in phospholipids. Because of this information, we can predict that Subtilosin A can disorientate phospholipids in cell that has no cholesterol or only a few of it. the other cell that has been known could be break down easily by Subtilosin A is sperm cell.
Recent studies shows that Subtilosin A can decrease mobility of sperm cell. Subtilosin A break down membrane plasma and coil tail of sperm cell. This protein also known that it doesn’t affect population of vaginal normal flora such as Lactobacillus. Not only this protein doesn’t affect population of vaginal normal flora, it also has antimicrobial activity to microbes that cause bacterial vaginoses (BV) such as L. monocytogenes, G. vaginalis, & S. agalactiae.
Because the antispermicidal activity of this bacteriocin, not affecting the vaginal normal flora and decreasing number of harmful microbes in vagina, Subtilosin A is the best candidate for contraception

The environmental dangers are thus very small, but this is something we should verify with more experiments and definitely not just wave aside.
Another danger of GMOs is to the people doing research with the cells, or the people processing the styrene we produce? Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be an opportunistic pathogen.(2) It could develop to be more dangerous as the human immune system has never been exposed to this novel pathogen which probably also has some antibiotic resistance genes for selective pressure. This is something that can only be limited through proper planning of the experiments and good laboratory practices. The biological danger to the people using our styrene however is zero as our production process sterilizes the product in the workup. Besides the biological dangers we also have to think about the chemical dangers as well, styrene is a molecule and exposure to it should be limited.(2) This highlights that we will have to think carefully about the safety precautions taken both in the lab both on handling the microorganisms as well as when working with and the molecules we produce.
Public Acceptance
Another thing that came up quite often during the discussions we had was public acceptance, and the importance of telling the public about what we are doing in the lab. There seems to be at least some hesitation in the public about the usage of GMOs for production of food and materials. At least part of this hesitation might stem from not knowing exactly what a GMO entails. An example that nicely illustrates this is is that when we tell people about our project, even naming that we are using modified yeast cells, they are positive, but as soon as we drop the word GMO there are people that are directly less assured of our project. We also noticed this during our various outreach events, a lot of people we talked to appeared a lot less negative towards GMOs after explaining what a GMO exactly is. We therefore deem it an import part of iGEM to tell the public of our project and hope to contribute in that way to getting rid of the ‘bad’ name of GMO’s. Important to realise here is that not all hesitance about GMO’s stems from ignorance, if people have objections because of for instance personal beliefs or religion, than that is completely valid as well.

At Pitch Night we had a bit more mature audience and it was great to see how they reacted to our idea. Most of them seemed very interested. A major achievement was also securing an exhibition/event of our own at the Heureka Science Center for a full weekend. We will be displaying our work and telling people about synthetic biology in a down to earth manner. The event will be held in spring 2015 and it will be targeted mainly for children.
In the beginning of September we had a chance to rehearse our presenting in front of the researchers of VTT. We got really good and constructive feedback. Important points we needed to consider were also brought up. Right before we leave for Boston we will also be giving our Jamboree presentation at a HYBER workshop, which will be a good rehearsing opportunity for us, as well as an opportunity to introduce ourselves to a lot of important people in the industry.

Finding Partners
There's no way we could have have done this alone. Finding the right people and support was crucial in building the story behind Aalto-Helsinki. As we are the first iGEM team from Finland, we did not have any existing support in the beginning. The very first thing, before even building the team, was to get the support of University of Helsinki and Aalto Unviersity. This includes lab spaces, mentors, advisors and financial support. The team leader contacted Pekka Heino and Ragna Rönnholm from University of Helsinki as well as Alexander Frey and Markus Linder from Aalto University. They were convinced about the project and provided us the necessary support to get started. Special thanks to our mentor, Markus Linder, who believed in us in the first place and covered our registration fee.
The second step was finding more financial support for the team. During the spring we had brainstorming sessions about fundraising and we spent long nights filling out applications to different Finnish foundations, organizations and ERASynBio. We also applied to AaltoES Summer of Startups, since we knew it would bring a great support on the Entrepreneurship track. During the spring we also connected with the Technical Research Centre of Finland, VTT. They promised to invest their expertise and special equipment"

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Labjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," Seidel (FRET-Expert of Bielefeld University) asking him about the linkers they use for fusing GFP for FRET.
Team Fungal and Plant Laccases: Isolating the plasmids BBa_K500000 , BBa_K500001 , BBa_K500002 , BBa_K500003 and BBa_K392014 . To be sure that in every plasmid contains the correct part we made a control restriction with NotI. It showed that all parts are on the correct hight in agarose gel.
Team Cultivation & Purification:
Another flask cultivation was made analogous to the one on 07/18 but at 23 °C.
Saturday July 21st
Team Cellulose Binding Domain:
Made primers for GFP_His (using BBa_I13522 as template)adding a C-termial His6tag for easy extraction
Jun.Prof Thorsten Seidel answered to the mail of yesterday and said that GFPs are easy to fuse and that they use linkers with four AS:
ccg gtc gcc acc upstream of the GFP
gaa agc ggc cgc downstream of the GFP; Which is will work fine, even with a proline in it's sequence.
We decided to use four linking AS also and chose to add a C-terminal Glycine-Serine-Linker ( BBa_J18920 ) to the cellulose binding domain, which would be four linking AS with the Freiburg-scar (Threonine-Glycine).
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
Since our PCRs didn't work and the Streptomyces laccases have more then 70% GC content we changed the dNTP concentration to 10 mM per base. Our gelelectrophoresis showed us that again S. goettingen has a product in correct length so we did again a PCR with same conditions. The rest of this product was cutted from an agarose gel and set ligation with the pSB1C3 vector and transformation. Because the isolated DNA concentration was to low the transformation showed no positive results.
Team Cultivation & Purification:
Culture from 07/20 was harvested and the cells were disrupted via sonication.
Sunday July 22nd
Team Shuttle Vector:
To get more amplicon from the part 5AOX1 K863200 an other Phusion PCR was done and the PCR product gel purified.
To get the tAOX1 fragment for the shuttle vector, we run a PCR with the KOD DNA polymerase as descriped in"
Wageningen_UR,2014,Team:Wageningen UR#overview#solution_-_-_TEXT.html," balance within the soil (Figure 1). Engineering a bacterial platform for biological control of F.oxysporum based on P. putida shows great potential. This soil-borne bacterium possesses already a moderate fusaric acid resistance [1] and naturally inhibits F.oxysporum to a certain degree [3].
Figure 1: The BananaGuard time line. After application, BananaGuard will detect F.oxysporum based of fusaric acid secretion, produce fungal growth inhibitors and destroy itself when F.oxysporum can not be detected anymore.
Application
The control of soil-borne pathogens by biological control is not a new idea and has been studied since the early twentieth-century [4]. For a long time commercial applications were thought to be not feasible but, in the last decades techniques for application progressed tremendously.
For BananaGuard, we believe that distributing the final product via drip irrigation is the best method. In drip irrigation a network of pipes is used that has emission points (drippers) delivering the precisely measured volumes of water into the rhizosphere. Distribution of growth substances, such as fertilizers, chemicals, herbicides and fungicides, have been shown to be successful before [5, 6]. In 2008, Boari et al.[7] showed that distribution of suspensions containing small particles via drip irrigation shows great potential.  When considering shelf live and transport as well as the fact that, in some growing regions, no mechanical irrigation is used, BananaGuard could be applied as dry products such as granules or powders as seen with comparable products [8]. Furthermore, these dry pellets can be stored for a longer time period. Since BananaGuard is applied as preventative measure, usage of more dilute suspension cultures applied over a longer time period or repeated application of the dry product is conceivable.
Application of BananaGuard could possibly be combined alongside the application of products such as fertilizer. Since farmers, generally, already supplement their plants with fertilizer or pesticides, this would only add a small extra step to their current practices.  The farmers can also grow the bacteria themselves with a minimal amount of materials and training, since P. putida is an easily grown bacteria as long as there is the possibility to work in sterile conditions. The bacteria can be harvested over a series of generations. However, new samples would need to be purchased to assure the quality of the product and to remove contamination that arise during harvesting.
Although the application would be simple, regulations concerning an engineered soil bacterium for bio-control are complex and different in most countries. With the current regulations in Europe, for example"
NCKU_Tainan,2017,Team:NCKU Tainan#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," to a mice that dig holes.” It means that “like farther like son”, heredity can not hide. We ask the children to think about this well known saying and explain what caused this happened. Later, we asked them to look at each other’s face, eyes, nose, mouth, and try to observe different traits. Sometimes they will come out super cute answer,  and will fight over wether this is a trait or not.
After basic introduction to heredity, we let the children to discuss in group about what is a cell look like and ask them to come up draw on the blackboard. Of course they can not draw it correctly, we just want them to think first before we tell them the answer.
WEEK FOUR highlight is absolutely the extract DNA experiment. Remember not to hand in the fruit to the children until given them all the instrustions, they want to play with the fruit so badly that they can barely take their eyes away from the materials. Nonetheless, this experiment can burn some of their energy by the first step if the experiment, smash the fruit into puree. They are like the beast finally came out the stage, making their every effort on hitting, smashing the fruit in the plastic bag. Even though we have warned them not to break the plastic bag for many times, they are still causing some trouble and spread the liquid out.
The most funny part is when we ask them to use the stockings to filter the puree and liquid, all of them were shocked and hesitate. Some of them are saying something like“ But this is my mom stockings”, “This stockings are expensive.”, others don’t want to get their hands dirty. After a little breakdown, they try their best to finish the task as a team, with a lot of screaming and laughter.
Finally is the last step of the last experiment of our program, hold the test tube for five minutes. In our imagination, this step should be quite and calm right? However these children actually fight for the right to hold the test tube, and one boy even decide to destroy the experiment because he didn’t get to hold the test tube. Anyway after many negotiation, every team have successfully complete their experiment.  Well done!
WEEK FIVE 06/01/2017
Time flies, it is the last week of our educating program! This week we are not giving lessons to them but play the “Jeopardy” with them. The question is from the lecture of past four weeks. Our main goal is not test their memory, but we want to know how is the learning effect in this mean, and a"
UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," test to verify which end of the monomer the cap was binding to ( 6/5/2015 ). If the cap bound to the C-end, there would be no problem as this end is not exposed to the C-cap at any time. However, if the cap bound to the A-end, it could compete for ligation with the AB monomer, which would limit ICA efficacy. We tested this by ""blocking"" one end of the CA monomer by ligating CA to BC or AB. Then, the capping oligo was added to the mixture and left to incubate. If a double band corresponding to ligation appeared, it would indicate that the UNMASKED sticky end was binding to the cap. The results of this test are shown below. In addition, we would test the initiator and terminator at higher concentrations.
Fig. 4 The BC+CA reactions with or without C-cap show no double band character at the 200 bp mark. The CA+AB+C-cap reactions exhibits a double band similar to the CA+C-cap reaction from 6/3/2015. AB+init exhibits a band at approximately 160 bp. CA+term exhibits a band at approximately 140 bp.
From these results, we can conclude that C-cap binds to the C-sticky end, and not the A-sticky end. We will be able to proceed with ICA as planned. In addition, the initiator and terminator work as expected.
With these results, we were able to confidently proceed to performing ICA. Throughout the summer, we were able to successfully use ICA to create a number of different constructs . These constructs were successfully cloned into Biobricks. The image below represents the cumulative work done using the REDESIGNED monomers, and demonstrates that we were able to substantially improve BBa_K1384000.
Fig. 5 XbaI, PstI digestion of spider silk MaSp constructs created this summer. The band at 2070 bp corresponds to the pSB1C3 backbone. The sizes of the digested insert are indicated on the right. All of these constructs were made over the span of two months using improved versions of BBa_K1384000 as monomers in Iterative Capped Assembly."
UT-Tokyo,2012,Team:UT-Tokyo#Project#H2 E.coli#System_-_-_TEXT.html," reactions in order to increase H2 production is the transformation of formate into hydrogen.
FHL complex and FhlA
Hydrogen is produced from formate by the formate hydrogenase lyase system (FHL), an intracellular membrane-bound complex, most of the components of which are produced by the hyc operon. Formate dehydrogenase H [5] , encoded by fdhF, converts formate to 2H, 2e, and CO2. Hydrogenase 3 (Hyd-3) [4] , encoded by hycE and hycG, is reported to synthesize molecular hydrogen from 2H and 2e. Electron transfer proteins encoded by hycBCDF, are thought to shuttle electrons between formate dehydrogenase H and Hyd-3.
This complex eventually catalyzes the following reaction [6] :
Formate + H+ ↔ H2 + CO2
Here is a simplified model of that complex.
We thought that increasing production of the FHL complex is the best way to boost H2 production. However, doing so by cloning genes of the complex and overexpressing them from a plasmid seemed challenging as the complex consists of a large number of sub-units. Instead, we decided to overexpress a gene fhlA involved in transcriptionally activating genes of the FHL complex. [1]
Additionally, it has been reported that the amino acid replacements E363G in FhlA increased hydrogen production six-fold, compared to native FhlA. [3] So we modified FhlA in the same way in order to further enhance H2 production.
Material and Method
To over-express fhlA, we decided to insert it into plasmid pSB1A2 with a RBS, a lac promoter and a double terminator. We also constructed a device in which hycAp, the natural target of the FhlA protein, promotes GFP expression in order to confirm that overexpression of fhlA results in expression from the hycA promoter, without having to directly quantify the amount of H2 produced.
Here is a model of the construct.
1.hycAp-RBS-GFP-d.term-pLac-RBS-fhlA-d.term: BBa_K778010
2.hycAp-RBS-GFP-d.term-pLac-RBS-fhlA(E363G)-d.term: BBa_K778011
First, we tried to clone fhlA by PCR using specific primers to the wild-type genome of E. coli.(Jm109"

ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#Tar_-_-_TEXT.html," modularity allows to restrict the target area of diversity generation to this region, consequently requiring       fewer mutants and resulting in a higher library quality, as the other regions are not varied and definitely remain functional.       Moreover, since modifications in the sequence of Tar ultimately result in changing of the motility [2,3], a simple assay can be designed. Differences in the chemotactic behavior are a rather convenient phenotype, since it physically separates       responding mutants from not-responding ones.
Template
We used BBa_K777001 as a template to optimize the protocol for library generation. The BioBrick contains the strong J23100 Anderson promoter and the tar gene, however it lacks an RBS. Imaging tethered ∆tar∆tsr bacteria responding to aspartate,       they can be seen modifying their spinning behavior, suggesting that the protein is, to some level, expressed and functional. Nevertheless, this BioBrick should not be used as a starting point for a stable expression of the Tar receptor. A good       improvement would be to express the gene under an inducible promoter and inserting a weak RBS.
Libraries Generation
Two types of libraries
The Tar receptor has already been modified with the aim of expanding its specificity to other small molecules. The three main approaches to achieve this are: swapping the sensory domain for the one of another species (e.g. Pseudomonas putida       [3]), mutations around the two ligand contacting sites (Goettingen iGEM team 2012) and random mutations over the whole sensory domain [2].       Since the first approach requires multiple iterations before tuning appropriately the cutting and fusing sites, we decided to base our experiments on the last two methods, that have the quality of a more straight-forward workflow.
As previously stated, to change the specificity of the Tar receptor, the interesting region to focus on are the first 189 amino acids on the N terminus. In particular, it is possible to identify the residues that localize in the ligand binding       pocket (Y149 to T154 and R69 to R73) [4]. We generated two types of libraries, one that only has mutated residues around the ligand binding sites and one that contained random mutations on the whole sensory domain.
Site-directed mutagenesis
To create a library with mutations at the ligand binding sites, we designed degenerated primers that anneal on the targeted sites in BBa_K777001. The oligonucleotides were designed to have an annealing region without mutations at the 3’ end,       either one or two NNK codons"
DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," in bite site tissue and later, gel immunodiffusion was used to detect venoms from common Nigerian snakes. The system was not sensitive enough to detect venom in serum and was of limited use.
Immunofluorescence has been used to detect specific venom in tissue samples, but not in body fluids. More recently, a single bead based immunofluorescence assay was developed with a detection sensitivity of 5-10 ng/ml with a 3 hour assay time. Immunoelectrophoresis was also used, but was found to be of limited practical use in routine venom detection assays due to precipitating bands between venoms and antibodies of closely related species.
Radioimmunoassay was used to detect venom in serum, but, although highly sensitive, the method was impractical in patients as well as being very expensive, requiring sophisticated reading equipment for measuring isotope levels, and having problems related to the short half life of the isotopes.
Detection of specific venom using the Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) or Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) has also been described. The sandwich technique was used, linking soluble antigens to an insoluble solid phase (microtiter plate wells), while keeping the reactivity of the immunological components. It consists of binding specific venom antibody to the solid phase and then adding test material containing venom antigen. The detection of the complex is then carried out, by using an antibody conjugated to an enzyme. Substrate for that enzyme is then added, with the amount of reactivity being proportional to the amount of antigen present in the sample. This type of tests can be used for detection and quantification of venom antigen in other body fluids and wounds. With optimization of these techniques, the total assay can be reduced to less than 3 hours, which is still not rapid enough for the clinician to decide on whether or not to treat the patient with antivenom [5].
The detection methods covered in this section share disadvantages that prevent them from being used in field clinics for detection of the specific venom in the victim. Furthermore, these methods carry additional challenges including cost: the use of expensive and elaborate equipment, the need for trained personnel, and most importantly, the assaying time.
These factors prevent the clinician from being able to use assays for the identification of the specific venom, making them rely solely in the clinical diagnosis for deciding if, and which antivenom is necessary for the treatment. This costs valuable time that can prove critical for the survival of the patient.

Virginia,2015,Team:Virginia_-_-_TEXT.html,"eriello et al., 2012). MVD is the leading cause of death among        T2DM patients in the United States, causing up to 65% of diabetes-related deaths, making it a huge target for diabetes treatments research (Deshpande et al., 2008). MVD        also frequently leads to other severe complications such as ischemia in the extremities        and blindness (Haffner et al., 1998).
Controlling Hyperglycemic Spikes
SHOW LESS
SHOW MORE
For many T1DM and T2DM patients, it has been shown that the regular        control and management of blood glucose levels prevents many of the vascular        complications of the disease, but most of the time control over glucose is difficult to        attain because the self-dosing insulin treatment system that a lot of moderately to        severely sick diabetes patients use is often hard to calibrate and use (Parkin et al., 2002).
Compared to sucrose-rich food, starch-rich food has been found to create less        fluctuation in blood glucose levels, and thus is beneficial to diabetes patients and        hyperglycemia patients. There is evidence that this flatter response caused by a starch       rich meal is associated with the slower rate of digestion of complex sugars versus simple        sugars (Jenkins, Wolever, & Jenkins, 1988). Thus, if some of the simple sugars are first        converted into complex saccharides inside the E. coli and then released back into small        intestine, a similar flatter glycemic response will take place, which will be beneficial to        the patients.
Our Devices

We have assembled one plasmid with genes that dictate a controllable level of simple sugars uptake and one plasmid to produce glucan and fructan from simple sugars and then lyse to release the complex sugars back into the environment. In essence, this microbial device runs on two genetic devices -- an uptake circuit and a polymerization circuit.

After further study, we learned that there have been cases in                     Kunming Botany Garden that people skinned the yew for money. And a sizable part of the old took or                     are taking yew medicines like yew wine and so on. There are also some people collecting yew wood                     chopping block, cups, and tea table.
Besides, we learned that the knowledge of yew mainly spread through leisure chatting or learn from                     families and friends. Some of its information comes from sellers, too. Among people from other                     provinces, some learned yew from internet or books, and some learned from sellers. So many yew                     production sellers play an important role in popularization of yew science and the information they                     provided needs to be standardized.
Interview with Hande company
Hande Biotechnology Corporation is a mature company with long history. As the first company in China                     to produce taxol, it drew our attention immediately. They focused more on the profit of taxol                     products and they are also playing an important role in yew resources protection. They now mainly                     use yew trees tissue as a resource of products. Once upon a time, they were drew into a dilemma for                     they were accused of using wild yew trees. The protective law being more and more perfect, this kind                     of problems will no longer cause a debate. They now have their own planting bases and will develop                     chemical synthesize method to make the production more profitable.

Yunnan academic of forestry
The interviews to Dr. Jinfeng Zhang from YAF and Dr. Jie Liu from KIB is mainly from scientific view                     to argue about exploitation and protection politics of yew. Dr. Zhang said that all the artificial                     yew forest need professional direct from academics or companies. And the taxol content in yew should                     reach a criterion, which need chemical methods nowadays to analysis, to ensure the subsequent                     product rate and quality. Our project can also be used in these analysis and may be more convenient.                     Dr. Zhang’s view about protecting yew is that artificial forest is so popular that we don’t need to                     constrain the yew productions in the market. What we should do is protect wild trees and now this                     work goes generally well. So this market should be left to market itself to be regulated.

The “human” part of designing an iGEM project
Current methods of chemical synthesis from petroleum derived chemicals have led to great environmental disruption and continue to be a strong contributor to global warming. It has also become increasingly clear during the recent decades that the raw material of this process, crude oil, is not a resource that is renewable within a viable timeframe. Biosynthesis of complex molecules and chemicals can be regarded as one of the most promising technologies capable of replacing current production strategies. Large-scale biosynthesis is already a viable industry: acetic acid, citric acid and ethanol are examples of chemicals widely produced using this process. Furthermore, complex molecules such as enzymes are almost exclusively produced using industrial fermentation.
Due to the promises that this field holds, it was clear that this is what our iGEM team wanted to focus on. An important part of the project is to consider how our project would affect society. To name a few, there are ethical, social and safety aspects to consider when attempting a biosynthesis-oriented project, our integrated human practices has been a major part of the design and formulation of our project. The following text covers some of these issues and how they were considered, discussed and dealt with during the design and development of the project concept.
Integrated human practices
Few areas of science have caused such an intense public debate as synthetic biology, especially for its application in the food industry. Though the scientific community at large agree that GMOs and the methods of synthetic biology can be used safely, the public debate continues. A recent letter addressed to the UN, describing the safety and need for GMOs, was signed by over 100 Nobel laureates spread across several scientific fields [1]. However, that is not to say that the debate should cease only because some people agree. On the contrary, it should be elevated and taken seriously by all. This discussion ought to be based on the facts, while arguments based on emotion and dogma should be put aside"

Thessaloniki,2018,Team:Thessaloniki#Model#dCas9_-_-_TEXT.html," affinities of the system to their right values with                     our characterization. That is, because even when trying to change the error                     by scanning different parameters and combinations of them, we weren’t able                     to correct the situation.
In order to find the root of this problem we had to think backwards. While                     plotting different component concentrations during simulations, we                     realised, that the repressor concentration was the same for different                     plasmid copy numbers and then we presented the problem mathematically,                     proving, that a constant repressor amount can not make the system’s output                     independent from the copy number. Below we present the proof of this                     statement.
Our goal is to minimize the error, between sfGFP expression for                                 low (cmin) and high (cmax) copy numbers, find the conditions                                 under which, the system is stabilized and to prove that this                                 cannot be achieved with a constant repressor concentration over                                 increasing copy number. For the gene of interest and the repressor                                 we use the annotatuon G and R respectively.
In our case, the gene expression of hill equation, has                                 cooperativity equal to one and the ratio of unbinding and                                 binding rate is equal to kD (dissociation constant) expressed                                 as

For simplification purposes let's consider that we have                                 constitutive promoters for the expression of dcas9 and sgRNA.                                 Dcas9 is expressed constantly by a medium value copy number,                                 cn, while sgRNA's copy number increases in the interval [cmin,                                 cmax], as it is located on the same plasmid as sfGFP is. Then,                                 the analytical solution on the steady state for sgRNA and dcas9                                 concentration is
with cn = constant and
The dcas9 and sgRNA binding has one-to-one stoichiometry, then                                 for each copy number when the reversible reaction reaches in                                 equilibrium, the relationship between the reactants and the                                 product R is

If for then                                 dcas9 acts as the limiting reagent for the formation of the                                 complex R, which by extension has a maximum concentration of                                 acn. Specifically its concentration is given below

1. Small Scale Trial
    a. Duration: About half year
    b. We will choose the production method for JACOB, e.g. as we learned from 永翰星港, the ""filtration"" of aptamers are still expensive, but aptamers synthesis is more economical. Nine sets of known aptamer (90np, 15 microliter, 100nmol/L) costs only about $135, and every set is sufficient for 250 microfluidic chips.
    c. During this phase we also need to rule out unknown influences on the device caused by switching to new assembly conditions, such as switching to fermentation flask instead of tightly controlled experiment chamber.
    d. During this phase preserving microbes will greatly affect the cost of production, and affordability is one of the most important characteristics of JACOB.
2. Medium Scale Trial
    a. Duration: 4-5 months
    b. When the production of microfluidic chip is resolved, how to prepare it for using will be on the agenda. Currently the chip we used for final packaging needs to be soaked in ethyl alcohol and acetone for about one hour, which pose a question for mass production.
We asked 博奥 mainly on how to control the cost of microfluidic chip production¬. From their experience we found that chips cost much more in the early development, but its cost diminishes quickly in later stages when mass production is reached, ranging from $0.1 to few dollars. However, there exist a conflict of material. In the iGEM version we picked optical cement instead of PMDS for its advantages of adequate solidification speed, feasibility, bio-inertia, and precision of altitude. However, PMDS production industries are much more matured. There is currently no companies offering mass production of optical cement microfluidic chips. Thus, we must decide the better material.

We found that our high school’s students share the same opinion about GM food as the general public. There is a basic lack of information about the mechanisms of GM food production and function, which leads to misunderstanding about the subject. After seeing the importance of promoting GM food, we collaborated with the school magazine Imaginist.
School magazine - Imaginist
We reached out to Imaginist, our school magazine, to discuss the legitimacy of GM food. In the October issue of the magazine, we presented a positive but objective opinion towards GM food. We argued that for different cases, where different GM food is designed according to various types of mechanisms, some mechanisms are rational and may lead to a reliable improvement of the product. At the same time, some GM food may result from random mutations. We need to examine GM food carefully before it appears in supermarkets, but advantages of GM food should also be acknowledged properly.
Club
Joining clubs and student organizations provides students the opportunity to work with their peers, explore complex issues not encountered in the classroom, and to be part of something larger than the seats they occupy in the classrooms.  We established iGEM club within our school in order to spread knowledge of genetic technology. We have organized two activities this year: knowledge lecturing and experimentation.
Many members of our club are unaware of basic molecular biology concepts such as applications associated with DNA, ribosomes, and the basic principle of the central dogma of biology. Therefore, we offered three lectures to provide a brief view of biology at the molecular level.
In the first session, we introduced the concept of synthetic biology. Beginning with the cell theory of Leeuwenhoek, we showed how human interpretation of living organisms changed and how we use biochemistry as a tool to understand organisms at a molecular level. We also incorporated the core concepts of bioengineering: modularization and standardization.
In our second and third meetings, our lecturers showed the whole process of a typical genetic engineering experiment, from obtaining the genetic sequences, to cloning:  building vectors, transformation, and finally identification. We wanted our club members to know how the common technology is used in genetic technology, such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), aids in understanding the purpose of our machine and its abundant usefulness. Since these concepts are abstract, we presented them through text, pictures, and videos. After each lecture, we provided a Q&A section, helping club members better understand these concepts.
After our club members had enough background knowledge, we arranged"

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," it as a leading centres in Europe for research. He noted that Scotland has a high number of iGEM teams for its size [five this year: Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, St. Andrews, Strathclyde]. He suggested that the various research institutions could come together to form a centre of excellence.
In terms of industry though, there are relatively few Scottish companies working in the area of synthetic biology. But there are a number of industrial biotech companies interested in biotech in Scotland.
He noted that industrial biotech is currently (mostly) based around using existing organisms, for example to do degradations or product modifications. He said there is a limit to what can be achieved with these organisms, and we will have to make greater use of modified organisms in the future. Synthetic biology will thus gain a more important position in biotechnology.
Yassen asked about regulation of synthetic biology.
Nicolas said it was a complex area. He wanted to focus on two aspects:
biosecurity
the ""ethical"" aspects
In terms of biosecurity, there are various bad scenarios, such as a ""mad scientist"", accidental release, bioterrorism, et cetera. The good news is that from the beginning the field has been looked at seriously by government agencies. For example, it was not by chance that the FBI sponsored the recent SynBio 5.0 conference. And scientists have been aware of these concerns from the beginning.
He mentioned that there is a lot of hype, and we must realise how research is actually done. He noted that universities such as ours had risk assessments and containment levels; and most organisms used are not dangerous and cannot survive outside the lab.
As for ""ethics"", he mentioned the view that changing organisms was ""the prerogative of God"". This is a sort of theological concern but still needs to be addressed.
He mentioned the rights of modified organisms. This is not a concern when dealing with bacteria. But what about a genetically modified dog, cat, or even primate? Suddenly important questions arise.
He said it was good that scientists have, from the beginning, looked at ""human practices"". They have invited other people (ethicists and the general public) to debate these issues. Synthetic biology conferences always seem to have parts dedicated to safety and human aspects.
Yassen wondered whether the sort of synthetic biology stories that make headlines (such as the creation of glowing pets) hindered more normal synthetic biology projects.
Nicolas said maybe. There is a lag between research and regulations. This lag must not get too big. For glowing pets, perhaps they don't mind, but"

The design and direction of our project were directly influenced by the feedback we received from both The Seabin Project and microbial fuel cell experts we interviewed throughout the duration of our project. (For example, The Seabin Project brought to our attention real-life factors typically unaccounted for in a lab setting, such as the variance in ocean plastic age; from there, we obtained plastic collected from a beach cleanup for experimental use. Moreover, after interviewing Professor Peter Girguis, Ph.D. we modified the design of our project, particularly the usage of the electrical output of our microbial fuel cell.)

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," HD device(Figure 2). It is clear that the finer PHB-co-HB powder was broken down better than the larger PHB particles, yet the required size range was still not achieved. More research would be done to improve the experimental procedure to achieve representative sizes.
Figure 2:Measured PHB-co-HB particle size distribution after sonication.
Week 17: August 21-25
This week, we ran PHB extraction experiments using sonicated PHB-co-HV from last week. After sonication, the PHB-co-HV granules were in 1-1.5 um range. PHB granules were allowed to settle for 48 hours before running extraction experiments.
Since we are still validating the HPLC method for PHB quantification, which is also a time-consuming method, we quantified the effectiveness of tested PHB extraction methods by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 600 nm wavelengths. The PHB suspension at the start of the experiments was visibly cloudy, hence we used a wavelength within the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. We then used absorbance readings to quantify the amount of PHB-co-HV that settled down as a result of PHB extraction method.
The following conditions were tested during PHB extraction experiments:
Centrifugation at 1000 rpm
Centrifugation at 3750 rpm
Centrifugation at 3750 rpm with addition of calcium chloride (CaCl2)
Centrifugation was performed for 10 minutes. Each condition had 3 replicates and we calculated the average absorbance. The results of the experiment are shown in Figure 3. Based on these results, centrifugation with addition of CaCl2 was the most effective method for settling PHB-co-HV at lab scale.
For the process on Mars, chemical coagulation and centrifugation, however, is not an ideal PHB extraction method because it would either require calcium chloride to be shipped to Mars or a separate process to extract calcium chloride from the Martian soil. Therefore, we plan to test electrocoagulation next week as an alternative PHB coagulation method. PHB-co-HV particles have a zeta potential of pH 3.5 resulting in a negative charge(van Hee, Elumbaring, van der Lans & Van der Wielen, 2006). PHB in suspension in water or supernatant (pH 5.3) can be coagulated by supplying positively charged ions. Literature has shown that dications (Ca 2+, and Mg 2+"

Santa_Clara,2015,Team:Santa Clara#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," a hands on research collaboration. Each has used the student driven collaborative research experience iGEM provides as a stepping stone to founding successful technology startups (Experiment and Mycodev respectively).
Despite the proclivity of iGEM projects to produce valuable technology and skilled research scientists the vast majority of syn bio projects are not supported after the iGEM competition. Sure, many schools have robust iGEM programs that provide students opportunities to do synthetic biology research every year (Heidelburg) and many of the most successful iGEM projects are continuations of previous years (SYSU Software 2014), but its still uncommon for groups of students to take on the technology they developed for the competition and focus its application to solving real world problems like unsustainable plastics recycling or waste intensive oil refining. Its as if most iGEM research happens in a vacuum. While iGEM has always been and will continue to be primarily a science education initiative designed in to engage more students in hands on synthetic biology research, the 2012 iGEM e class demonstrates that iGEM's student entrepreneurs and their technology are needed beyond the lab bench. Moreover, facilitating the transition from research project to entrepreneurial venture appears a natural extension of most university operations considering all the resources students need to continue their ideas are locally available on the same campus they frequent daily to attend class and study.
As academic corporate partnerships and the idea of applied research has come into vogue during the last twenty years, research focused universities have assembled all of the tools and infrastructure needed to become incubators for startups. They possess state of the art research facilities and equipment, esteemed faculty with experience in developing technology for industry, working relationships with corporate partners, networks of entrepreneurial alumni, technology transfer offices to provide guidance on intellectual property issues, and swaths of other students with the experience in ancillary business and legal arts needed to organize a startup venture.
Although seemingly immersed in an environment built for technology startup production, gifted science and engineering students still struggle to put all of these pieces together and lack the basic business and legal understanding needed to organize a technology startup. Of the seventeen students from eight programs we surveyed, no student indicated they had ever interacted with the school's technology transfer office despite the fact that most knew such an resource existed. Additionally, only one student indicated they had taken a course in entrepreneurship while we received no replies suggesting exposure to basic entrepreneurial skills was a required part of their science or engineering curriculum.
Being an entrepreneur is hard because it takes a tremendous amount of energy and involves working in a variety of different fields. As demonstrated by our survey, aside from a capstone senior design project or research"
Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"  Finally, it is not sufficient to simply rely upon plants’ evolutionary response mechanisms to oxidative stress as reproductive efficiency does not necessarily correlate directly to growth or crop production.  Thus there is a niche yet to be filled in optimizing this parameter.
HYDROPONICS
Hydroponics is by far the most logical first choice for implementing such a system.  First, the systems are highly engineered, so altering nutrient concentration, pH, or, in this case, oxidative stress, is standard for the industry.  Second, most systems are entirely dark so as to minimize algal growth, meaning that a fluorescence based reporter would have almost no outside interference.  Finally, when exposed to external stressors, plants will often time produce ROS themselves, further altering this balance [11].  In a hydroponic system, this is compounded by the vast number of plants packed tightly together in space.  Thus, hydroponics is the most logical choice of industry to begin with in terms of oxidative stress regulation.
CURRENT DETECTION
Currently, no method of oxidative stress detection and regulation is consistently employed as an industry standard.  Part of this is because research regarding the role of stressors in plants is relatively novel. The largest issue of this technology being adopted is simply a lack of awareness about the issue, plants regularly deal employ internal pathways to mitigate the amount of oxidative stress, so the concept of adjusting these levels artificially is new. Even if farmers wanted to optimize this parameter, they would be hard pressed to do so as current methods are expensive and lack spatial resolution. The best one could do with existing technology on the market today would be to buy a mechanical probe and add oxidants manually, with is both inaccurate and extremely inefficient in both time and cost.
FUTURE APPLICATIONS
The potential of Cornell iGEM’s novel technology extends far beyond increasing hydroponic yields in an industrial setting.  In the simplest terms, the ability to simultaneously sense, report, and mediate oxidative stress greatly facilitates research into the roles of ROS in multitudes of biological processes including but not limited to tumor angiogenesis, aging, and diseases from a medical perspective, as well as bioreactor designs and environmental pollution from industrial and environmental perspectives.
A potential direction that we considered was engineering a direct link between the emission of a fluorescent protein to the optogenetic promoter system.  If the emission wavelength of rxRFP is exactly the excitation wavelength of the optogenetic system, a feedback mechanism akin to quorum sensing could be developed, resulting in a highly sophisticated tool for bacterial communication.  In order to achieve this, one would need to alter the"

Emory,2018,Team:Emory#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,"Hey there, I'm Dennis, a second-year student majoring in biology while on the pre-med track. I am ecstatic in learning more about human anatomy. I was intrigued by iGEM due to its representation that a mashup of both fields of engineering and synthetic biology can create something wonderful.
I'm Annabel and I'm currently a sophomore at Emory College majoring in chemistry. I'm interested in research related to organometallics and syntheses of naturally derived materials. I enjoy reading novels and playing with cats.
Hi, my name is Pangsibo Shen. I’m from Shaoxing, China. I’m currently a junior at Emory college, double majoring at Biology and Art History. I have spent the past summer learning cloning technique with Dr. Matsumura and participated in the plasmid reconstruction. I love travelling and playing soccer. My favorite movie director is Quentin Tarantino.
Hi, I’m Brenda and I am a sophomore at Emory, double majoring in biology and political science. I have always been interested in the field of genetics and iGEM has given me the amazing experience to learn more about my field of interest in a laboratory environment. It has taught me things that normally would not be taught in a traditional classroom. iGEM is not only a competition but also a valuable opportunity to collaborate and learn from other like-minded peers. I look forward to integrating the knowledge I have gained from this past summer in my future academic journey.

Dr. Ichiro Matsumura was once an undergraduate at M.I.T. and subsequently became a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. He was an postdoc at UT Austin before he became an assistant prof at Emory. He studies mechanisms of adaptive evolution and believes that evolutionary theory is the ultimate instruction manual for synthetic biologists. Ichiro has served as iGEmory's faculty advisor since the team's inception 3 years ago. He has provided guidance, mentorship, a work space and materials to our team.
Emily Weinert graduated from Duke University in 2002 with a B.Sc. in Chemistry after working with Professor John Simon. She then joined Professor Steve Rokita’s group at the University of Maryland for her Ph.D. At the end of 2006, Emily began her postdoctoral work in Professor Michael Marletta’s laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. She joined the faculty of Emory University in 2011."
Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportBiosafetyBiosecurity_-_-_TEXT.html," build to express new forms of alerts against risks linked to technologies of contemporary life sciences. Biosecurity's reflexions focus on “biologic accidents”, involuntaries, and unexpected consequences of certain scientific handling. Through these “bioerrors”, for example, we can think about the involuntary release of a synthetic organism into the environment, or the unexpected production of toxins or pathogenic agents by an organism that was thought to be under control. Biosecurity is about risks posed by a malicious mind, a person who wants to harm. That threat is embodied in the “social part” of the bioterrorist. The “subjects”, centers of interest of biosecurity and biosafety are also what justified their common analysis. Health, regarding human, and environmental concerns, regarding “non human”, are at the heart of the ethical perspective we will perform. Biosecurity and biosafety are very present in the synthetic biology literature and that presence can be read under the light of M. A. Hermitte’s explanations about the fact that, in our society of science and technologies, both promises and anguishes are formulated at the same time (Hermitte 2007).
Both kind of risks can be divided and connected through two concepts : malice and failure. In the texts we studied, we found the main distinction between these concepts to be the identification of the person who is at the origin of the action (the scientist and the terrorist) and the nature of his intentions, his wills. We have to notice that failure is attached to scientific work and is opposed to the malice of the terrorist will. Intentions, errors or “harming will”, in ethical reflexion, are substitutes for other concepts that we usually use to distinguish “terrorist” and “scientist”. Thus, “knowledge”, “work” or other social aspects are not present here. We do not distinguish these cases by their intellectual and handling capacities but by their intentions. Even worst, the scientist seems to undergo, in that portrait, natural unpredictability and errors while voluntary procedure of the terrorist seems to confer him a better relation to knowledge, at least more efficient. Failure is related to the scientific handling while success is related to the terrorist perspective. That point is quite risky for the social perception of synthetic biology, “essentializing” the discipline in a dangerous light, success being easier when you want to hurt others. It also leads us to consider the democratization of knowledge in new disciplines of life science. That kind of insignificance of knowledge represents the fact that is not the main distinction anymore : everyone can have knowledge of the life sciences, it is not a"

Presenting all the information about the project and identifying the strengths and the weaknesses of it help establishing collabortions between teams and receiving feedback and help. In fact, during the time for questions, we received multiple ideas to incorporate to our project. One of the greatest ideas was given by Oscar from UPF-CRG Barcelona, which said that designing a mobile app to read the result of the sensor and connecting to the cloud to send the information about this analysis (restaurant, dish, date and result) could create a very useful network/database for the users of the sensor.
In addition, we presented to the other teams the opportunity to collaborate with us by replicating our PCR standardization process with the saliva of another celiac person. The iGEM UPF-CRG Barcelona team accepted to collaborate with us, as both teams are from the same city, which facilitates the communication and material exchange between us.
We also discussed how we could integrate our sensor with the sensor designed by OLM-Madrid. The experimental part of our project has been focused on the sensing element of the gluten sensor (finding a way to express the HLA-DQ protein of each user), whereas the focus of the OLM-Madrid project has been the design of a hardware platform for another sensor. Therefore, both projects complement. For this reason, both teams discussed how to combine the HLA-DQ protein obtained following our method with the hardware platform designed by their team. Basically, the protein should incorporate a sulfur group in the desired region in order to attach it to the conductive gold layer of the sensor.
This should be done in a way that the region which interacts with the gliadin peptide is exposed to gliadin molecules and not blocked by the surface of the sensor. The sensor would detect the binding of the peptide due to the change of potential experimented by the surface of the conductive gold layer. However, there are certain points which should still be checked experimentally, like the need for rinsing steps between two different usages of the sensor. Overall, we discussed an alternative to the gold nanoparticle visual detection method we designed and proposed here .
One of the most stimulating points of the Spanish MeetUp was hearing the presentation of other teams’ projects and getting new synthetic biology ideas from there. All the teams which participated in the Spanish MeetUp did a project of a very different topic. Hence, it was very interesting to see other applications of synthetic biology and how the iGEM competition is a perfect fit for very different kind of projects. The experts’ presentations were absolutely amazing. With them, we discussed important topics in synthetic biology like the"

uirR was put downstream of a B0032 RBS and was submitted as part K1725421. Future teams may find it useful to choose promoters expressing UirR different than the ones we have submitted. We ligated four promoters of varied strength (J23101, J23110, J23114, and J23114) as annealed oligos to uirR (the corresponding parts are K1725422, K1725423, K1725424, and K1725425). These parts can be tested in the future together with PlsiR upstream of GFP to determine in what way levels of UirR influence light response. To further make future work on this system easier, we have also submitted parts that contain the double terminator B0015 after the constructs with one of the aforementioned promoters and uirR (K1725426, K1725427, K1725428, and K1725429). Thus, an iGEM team which wants a BioBrick that needs to be more strictly regulated downstream of uirR can add it effortlessly.
Finally, we made four parts that are made of K1725426, K1725427, K1725428, or K1725429 attached to K1725401.By combining uirR that has a promoter and a terminator to PlsiR upstream of GFP, we provide accessible BioBricks for the further characterisation of the UirS/UirR/ PlsiR system via fluorescence measurements (K1725430, K1725431, K1725432, and K1725433).
Survivability
Introduction
As our final Glow in the Dark genetic circuit would contain a UV-A light sensor, we decided to test how UV-A exposure affected different strains of E. coli in order to decide on the most UVA resistant strain to use as a chassis. It is well known that prolonged exposure to high doses of UVA can be deleterious to E. coli, but strains might be able to withstand the dose of UV-A required to activate out UVA sensor (50µM/m2/sec).
Initial aims
We decided to use a survivability assay to choose a chassis strain. TOP10, DH5α, DS941 and MG1655 strains were our possibilities. UV light causes mutations, so the strain must be"

Over the summer, Yale iGEM member Ariel Hernandez-Leyva delivered a class for local high school students entitled:
New Pills for Old Ills: Antimicrobial Peptides and a Possible New Approach to Molecular Medicine
The course started by focusing on the history of antibiotics and anti-microbials and moved on to discuss the current issues with antimicrobial resistance. A possible solution to this process, anti-microbial peptides, was discussed and the biochemistry behind the peptides was explained. To conclude, we talked about how the science of synthetic biology could fit into an era of molecular medicine through a discussion of the production of anti-microbial peptides in bacteria for medical use.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-nuc_-_-_TEXT.html," first or the second attempt, the procedure was simply repeated without any changes.
Digestion and Ligation, Fourth Attempt [✔️]
pSB1C3-Nuc was successfully digested and the digested product was then also successfully ligated with previously digested backbone (pSB1K3) and T7. However, the analysis of the results were not convincing. A clear band (see arrow in Figure 1) at the expected size of approximately 800 bp but also a lot of other unspecific bands. The subsequent transformation in TOP10 was unsuccessful since there were no growth of colonies.

Unrelated samples on the gel were covered for clarity.
The decision was made to re-do the ligation, based on the ligation gel results which showed a lot of unspecific bands. Since the transformations in the previous attempts had a very low success rate compared to the expected results, the ligation product would be transformed directly into BL21(DE3) as well as in TOP10 to investigate whether the type of cell was a contributing factor. This is however not believed to be the primary reason for the unsuccessful transformations since the TOP10 strain takes up plasmids more easily than BL21(DE3) which is an expression strain.
Digestion and Ligation, Fifth to Seventh Attempt [❓]
Nuc and backbone (pSB1K3-T7-Esp as source) was successfully digested but no analysis was performed for the ligation product. Conclusions had to be drawn from further transformation in TOP10 and BL21(DE3) with subsequent inoculation in liquid media. Analysis of extracted plasmid from TOP10 cells showed indications of presence of Esp instead of nuclease, as in the second attempt. PCR analysis of plasmids from BL21(DE3) cells were negative. The contamination of Esp had now occurred for the second time and probably derived from the usage of pSB1K3-T7-Esp as backbone source, due to depletion of pure pSB1K3. The pSB1K3"
