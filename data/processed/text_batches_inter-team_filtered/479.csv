Oxford,2017,Team:Oxford#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"It would however be necessary to engage with other stakeholders, like governments, regulators and the entrepreneurial public on this. Towards this aim, we developed a policy proposal on the integration of our device into society, talking about the current political, social and economic landscape in Bolivia. To view this click the button below:
It was evident from our research and conversations with experts in the field that we would need the backing from the relevant governments, as in Bolivia for example, the treatment for Chagas after diagnosis is funded by the government health department.
We were reminded of the fact that there may be language barriers in this project and it would be important to try to ensure as best as possible that this does not affect our results. When we sent out a survey we asked for it to be translated into Spanish so that we would not be inadvertently selecting for participants. Louise also mentioned that biosafety, biosecurity and dual usage are the same word in Spanish so when writing policy proposals  we would have to be careful.
It was clear from discussion with both Michael and Louise that we must ensure that for ethical reasons if we are diagnosing Chagas disease in babies then there must be access to treatment. Currently in Bolivia if the child is 15yrs old then they can receive the treatment for free. We were presented with the problem that if you diagnose the baby then this indirectly gives you information on her serology status. However she will not necessarily have access to treatment. After some research we realised that the mother would most likely be in the chronic stage of the disease and so the best option would be to have a campaign for helping mothers to come to terms with this information and help in living with the effects of the disease. Because of this we wanted to consider the potential stigmatisation of the people involved which would primarily be women and the effects this could have on their livelihoods. From speaking to various experts in the area we were told that Chagas disease is a quite accepted disease and there is little stigmatisation around it as it is so commonplace.

Laboratory Notes
1. Construction of BcsA-knockout Enterobacteria sp. FY-07
In order to express cellulose in Enterobacteria sp. FY-07 in a controllable way, we should first knock out the BcsA gene in Enterobacteria sp. FY-07. Therefore, Enterobacteria sp. FY-07 will not produce cellulose under natural environmental condition.
Week 2 (2017.7.10-7.16)
To begin with, we amplified the upstream and downstream of BcsA gene in Enterobacteria sp. FY-07 through PCR. Next, we combined the upstream and downstream of BcsA gene by overlapping PCR and the overlapped PCR products were ligated into plasmid pTsk1. Then pTsk1-ΔBcsA was transformed into S17 and positive clones were selected.
Week 3 (2017.7.17-7.23)
We screened the selected clones using PCR and introduced pTsk1-ΔBcsA to Enterobacteria sp. FY-07 through conjugative transfer. The positive pTsk1-ΔBcsA transformants were cultured at 42℃ with chloramphenicol to select single-crossover clones.
Week 4 (2017.7.24-7.30)
We screened the single-crossover strains using PCR and then cultured right strains in LB medium and passaged every 12 hours for 4 generations.
Week 5 (2017.7.31-8.6)
We screened the selected clones using PCR and introduced pTsk1-ΔBcsA to Enterobacteria sp. FY-07 through conjugative transfer. The positive pTsk1-ΔBcsA transformants were cultured at 42℃ with chloramphenicol to select single-crossover clones.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,", defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter"

Wechat is a communication platform widely used in China. XMU-China published an article on Xiamen University official account, which attracted thousands of people to read it. In this article, XMU-China briefly introduced what is iGEM, what does synthetic biology do, what XMU-China has achieved in our gene loop experiments, etc. Not only students in Xiamen University, but also graduates and ordinary people were our readers.
QQ is the most used social software in China and all Chinese teams communicate with each other on QQ. With the group email system of QQ, XMU-China’s emails can be received by all Chinese teams. So, XMU-China issued questionnaires, collaboration information and  Newsletter on QQ. Also, XMU-China received many emails of other teams and found collaboration in this QQ group. In this way, there was no barriers of communication. All Chinese teams assist each other and make progress together.
Twitter is welcomed all over the world and XMU-China shares beautiful parts of life and experiments on the team account. The failure of a try, the joy of a success, the pleasure of a journey, all of which will be put on Twitter. This precious memory is the real meaning of participating iGEM.
Almost every team has its own Facebook page so XMU-China contacts with tens of teams on Facebook. We cooperated Newsletter, replied online messages, concerned about other teams’ update,etc. What else, we asked for gene parts from Oxford and accepted the interview of EPFL .

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

Plasmid purifications were made from the re-streaked ligation plates, the following mini-preps were made:
Mg03 + 1C3
nutR + 1C3
N + 1C3
The gel showed some irregularities as the sizes didn't exactly match, this needs to have a closer look.
A digestion was also made on RBS-N with X+P, this needs to be purified via pcr clean up tomorrow (23/09/10).
Once purified it can be used along with pBAD (E+S digested) and pSB4A5 (E+P digested) to construct pAT01 which should look like the following:
pBAD (E+S)
RBS-N (X+P)
pSB4A5 (E+P)
--> 3A assembly to create pAT01.
PCR duplicates were made today and will be ready tomorrow (23/09/10), the following plasmid backbones were amplified:
pSB4A5
pSB4A5
pSB1C3
pSB1C3
pSB1A3
pSB1A3
(numbering system here follows numbers written on pcr tubes)
- These need to be verified tomorrow (23/09/10) on gel to make sure they were in fact amplified, followed by pcr clean up.
2 extra pcr duplicates should be made of the following:
GFP+RBS
plasmid backbone pSB2K3
Another over night culture was made of Mg03 as a mistake was made yesterday and the wrong anti-biotic was inserted.
This needs to be plasmid purified tomorrow as well.

Safety
1.  None of our ideas raised safety issues inside or outside the laboratory.The ArtScienceBangalore team's work through videos, performances and outreach raises  awareness around these issues.
2. The Bench work was done inside the National Center for Biological Sciences(Bangalore) premises and strictly followed the safety protocols and guidelines set by the safety review board at NCBS.
3. The National Center for Biological Sciences, Bangalore has well equipped labs where bio safety is properly taken care of. Current facilities at the labs full fill the requirements of bio safety level-1 as mentioned in Bio Safety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (4th edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health, U.S. Government Printing Office Washington: 1999).There is an Institute level committee, which looks into the issues related to Bio Safety.
4. The ArtScienceBangalore team hopes to work with institutional researchers, the DIY community and environmental activists to implement a code of conduct and safety protocols for non-institutional synthetic biology. We have documented this work on our wiki and will present it at this year's jamboree.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

To build your own OD/F Device, all you have to do is order the required parts listed above, invest some time and have a little technical dexterity. This DIY aspect could also have a positive learning effect, for example, for students in schools, universities and other educational institutions.
Possible application of our OD/F device
In our cooperations with the Kaiser-Karls-Gymnasium and with NEAnderLab , one of our target groups already gathered first experience using our OD/F Device. This proves that our device is suitable for school everday life. When working with the schools, we got a lot of positive feedback from the instructors as well as the students.
In summary, in our OD/F Device, we see a piece of equipment to measure OD and fluorescence, two quantities regularly used in biology, that is open source and perfectly fit for low-budget instutions such as schools, universities, community labs and the biohacking scene.

Human Practices Student Outreach
In order to provide outreach to the community, it was important to speak with the next set of students entering college.  Northwestern University offers young, aspiring students interested in science into their Center for Talent Development program, or CTD. These students spend their summers enriching themselves in an intensive program to explore sciences of all types.
The CTD class the Northwestern iGEM team spoke with was a class were high school students that had an interest in biology. Before we spoke with them, they had already covered cellular transformations, and basic synthetic biology. This included transforming bacteria, running gel electrophoresis, and other similar lab procedures.
During the talk, the Northwestern team found that the students were very knowledgeable about the topic of synthetic biology, and even more excited about the prospects of iGEM. The duration of the talk was meant to be about the science behind bacteria transformations. However, the CTD students had already been exposed to these procedures. Instead, we focused more on iGEM.
The CTD students were able to grasp the science fully, and the remaining time was focused on the iGEM competition itself. From there, we talked about iGEM in a more discussion format. Time was spent explaining past projects to the class as well as the current project. Many of the CTD students were entering college soon, and expressed interest in joining their college's iGEM team. Those who were still in high school expressed interest in creating a  chapter in their school.
Overall, the trip to the CTD class was successful to promote iGEM in matriculating college freshman, and possible high school chapters.

Introduction to the Field:
In light of the increasing dependence upon petroleum-based fuels, renewable biofuels have emerged as a viable source of clean energy in the industrialized world.  Many biofuels, such as bioethanol produced from sugar cane, nevertheless contribute to green house gasses and require large-scale industries to maintain their production. Hydrogen gas on the other hand stands alone as a fuel that when reacted with oxygen in a fuel cell, results in the formation of pure water as its only byproduct.  The advantages of hydrogen gas over the current fossil fuel system include decreased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere as well as the lowest effective cost to society when coupled to solar powered sources (Veziroglu and Sahin 2008).
The lack of harmful byproducts produced from hydrogen fuel cells stands in stark contrast to the many different carcinogens and green house gases produced through the standard combustion engine. The iGEM team at UC Merced firmly believes that hydrogen gas is a viable alternative to petroleum based fuels, and that hydrogen gas can be utilized for a variety of industrial processes including hydrogen fuel cells for cars and fuel cells to power electric motors. In fact, the US Department of Energy published a paper titled A National Vision of America’s Transition to a Hydrogen Economy to 2030 and Beyond in 2002, foreshadowing the need for increased research into the nature of hydrogen as an viable alternative fuel source (US Department of Energy 2002).Hydrogen gas can be readily obtained from the widely available laboratory bacteria E. coli, which can be genetically engineered to produce hydrogen gas for industry.
The iGEM competition simplifies hydrogen gas production process through the use of BioBricks, which are double stranded DNA segments standardized for insertion into plasmids.  This system allows for better reproducibility as well as innovation since BioBricks with different functions can be placed adjacent to one another to improve or modify a microbe's function.  In our lab, we developed a BioBrick that enables E. coli to produce hydrogen gas more efficiently than before.  We hope that the combination of this BioBrick with others will allow E. coli to produce hydrogen gas from abundant sources of biomass such as cellulose.
Impact of iGem:

Tsinghua-A,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#fluid medium 1_-_-_TEXT.html," [Fig. 2], we can find C4HSL can specifically bind to RhlR and then the complex bind to Prhl so that TetR can be expressed. Then TetR can bind to Plux/tet and inhibit the expression of LacI.
By this circuit, we can see that even though C4HSL-RhlR can stimulate expression of LacI by binding to Plux/tet directly, its stimulation of TetR at the same time can counteract this effect and so warrior 1 won't response to C4HSL secreted by himself.
III Evaluation of orthogonality by model
Like in the orthogonality test of experiment part, gene circuit of two warriors is orthometric when the AHL molecules secreted by warrior I can just activate the promoter inside warrior II, but cannot activate the promoter inside itself and vice versa. Also, we use RFP intensity to indicate the level of LacI inside cell.
Therefore, we can know the orthogonality by looking at the change of warrior I's intensity as time with or without warrior II. (Because warrior II can just respond to C4HSL according to the experiment results, so it is accord with the orthogonality requirement and we do not consider response of warrior II)
IV ODE, parameters and its resource
V Original Parameter set of the model
TsinghuaA-Orthogonality_ODE.pdf
VI Results of model
1. Results under original parameter sets:
As stated above, RFP intensity is used to indicate the response of the warrior. So from this original parameter set and result, we can see that there is no distinguish between the response of warrior I without with warrior II, so orthogonality is not good. In the real situation, this means that the warrior I has high amount of LacI even without warrior II and thus almost no CmR. So it has no resistance to chloramphenicol and will be killed by itself.
But how could this happen? Intuitively, we may hypothesize that TetR actually not inhibit the expression successfully when its expression is activated by C4HSL-RhlR. So we may solve this problem by increasing the maximal expression rate of TetR. In the experiment, this can be achieved by changing the RBS after Prhl of TetR in warrior I.
(Fig. 4 RFP level inside warrior I with or without warrior II beta_(1AHL_1t )=6e3)

British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#Patent_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM teams knew as little about ""patents and stuff"" as we did. We then came up with a set of questions for other teams, trying to evaluate their existing knowledge, their self-assessment of their knowledge, and their desire, if any, to increase that knowledge. Some of us wondered if we'd see evidence of a Dunning–Kruger effect . After implementing our survey using Google Drive, we sent it to team Calgary for testing. They all took it, and verified it worked. Thanks, Calgary! We then sent an email to every team's primary contact , asking them to take our survey and pass it along to their team. We had great turnout, garnering 328 individual responses.
Best Respondents
Big thanks to teams Bielefeld , Bonn , Calgary , UC Davis , and Warsaw for having more than 80% of their team members, advisors, and instructors answer our survey! They represent the best parts of the iGEM community, helping others create knowledge without asking for much in return.
Demographics
These questions were relatively straightforward. We just wanted to know who was answering our survey! Happily, it looks like we got a reasonably representative sample of respondents.
Experience With IP
Unsurprisingly, the size of the ""Yes"" pie slice is almost the same size as the sum of ""Advisors"" and ""Instructors"" pie slices above, but let's look into that further...
While the bulk of respondents are still members with no patent experience, this breakdown reveals that approximately half of the responding advisors and instructors have patent experience and half don't.
Having a larger number of responses to this question than ""Yes"" answers to the previous one was perplexing. We expected those who indicated having no experience with patents to skip this question. A more sophisticated survey might have only revealed this question upon receiving a yes answer to the previous one.
This was a check-box poll, where respondents could select more than one box, and could also fill in a text field for custom ""Other"" responses.  Some of the ""Other"" responses included involvement with software copyrights & patents, research in patent databases, and being in the process of obtaining a patent.
Need a for Guide
The above graph displays responses from three questions. Note that respondent's median self-assessed level of knowledge is 3, while the median desired level of knowledge is 8 and the median level thought to be obtainable from a brief guide is 6. Respondents thought that a brief guide can get them a good amount of the way to their goal, and this reinforced our motivation to produce such a"

Engineering fungal mycelium to create viable building materials for Mars is not a small challenge. This project, which was inspired by conversations with Lynn J. Rothschild from NASA, and the Stanford-Brown-RISD iGEM team, whom we owe thanks to both for the inspiration and subsequent sparring on ideas, has relied on several scientific fields to try to tackle the problems we have found along the way. Being inspired by the idea of simple and cost-effective construction on Mars, our design focuses on the fungal aspect of how a cyanobacteria/fungal production system can be used to create building materials. As we explored this idea, we were presented with many problems to be solved and even more, questions to be answered.
The first and most pressing one, how does one cultivate a fungus on Mars? Moreover, which fungal species should we use? Can we determine and model the growth characteristics of our fungi? Is the strength of fungal materials determined by any distinct genes and is it possible to regulate these in a way that will make our materials even tougher? And not least, how do we make the system cost-effective? We set out to answer these questions to guide the creation of our final design.
Growing Fungus on Mars
Growing live fungus on Mars will be challenging as the environment on Mars is extremely hostile compared to Earth. In addition to the extreme cold, the atmosphere is very thin at less than 1% of the density of Earth’s atmosphere and consists of 96% carbon dioxide and virtually no oxygen (1). Moreover, our fungus needs organic compounds as a"

BIT-China,2015,Team:BIT-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,".4 Discussions with BNU-China
BNU_China for BIT_China
Click here to see BNU-CHINA's description of our collaborations.
○ Modeling
BNU-China mainly helps us to establish a model of substance changes during the pH regulation stage. Specifically, they build a model to link six chemical reaction processes together, all of which are controlled by switch in pH. With change in pH, main chemical reactions will change subsequently. We provided them the conditions and equations of each chemical reaction stage, and they are responsible for the realization of the equations and the whole regulation process.
The difficulty we BIT-China meet is how to connect the six groups of chemical reactions together with the switch in pH, how to identify the reaction time and the results of each chemical reaction, and how to draw an image to reflect the pH variation as function of time. Because some members of BNU-China are majoring in physics, math, computer science and chemistry, they have much experience in differential equations, application of MATLAB and designing computer programs. With these resources, they have helped us solve our problems successfully.
The description of variables are written as followed:

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#DailyNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"5 kb), we shall add the HMF pathway and dCas9 to the P. putida genome using homologous recombination.
Decision reached to optimize Superfolder GFP based on its superior post translational modification, ensuring that translation elongation remains the rate limiting step. Papers on codon optimization downloaded to Mendeley Desktop. New hypothesis for existence of rare codons developed: Perhaps they function as a molecular ""brake"" to slow down translation and prevent ""ribosome traffic jams.""
Tuesday, May 27, 2014
Inoculated LB broth with ampicillin and dCas9 plasmid from cryogenic storage; inoculated Lb broth with chloramphenicol and FTV vector from Ashlee's past experiment; streaked the HMF vector on a kanamycin plate.
Decided to use homogeneous ""leader sequence"" upstream of each variant GFP to ensure Ribosome Binding Site (RBS)library creates accurate range of translation initiation rate (TIR)
Wednesday, May 28, 2014
Emily and Ashlee made cryogenic storage of the dCas9 plasmid; plasmid prepared the FTV and dCas9 vectors; digested FTV vector; inoculated LB broth with a colony from the HMF plate for overnight growth and plasmid preparation tomorrow.
Optimized leader sequence from previous project for our use. Also explored options of creating novel synthetic leader as well as using first 60 base pairs of GFP mut3b. Met with Dr. Salis, decided to use a new synthetic leader. Created leader based on several design considerations. Ran RBS library calculator using a ""pre sequence"" of 20 bp upstream of RBS.
Thursday, May 29, 2014
Prepared plasmid containing the HMF pathway; inoculated LB broth with Lambda Red Recombinase plasmid from cryogenic storage. Ashlee, Emily, and graduate student Iman Farasat ordered primers for three plasmids that will be constructed via Gibson Chew-Back and Annealing Assembly, two of which will be inserted into the genome by homologous recombination.

While checking the plates from the DNA2.0 transformation, I also looked at the plates from the Gibson Assembly we did 7/5/15. Although the majority of them did not show any colored colonies, there were two blue colonies on the Bilzen Blue plate. There were several colonies on this plate that did not express any color, so it might be possible that these two colonies were successful outcomes of our Gibson Assembly from a month ago. I started a liquid culture of these two colonies and will check for color expression tomorrow.
●
In order to test the selected chromoproteins, I tried plating one of the colors in on of the wells in a 96 well plate, but discovered that the plastic of the 96 well plate was not good for conducting heat to the sample (the liquid culture in the well did not dry even when it was on the heating block for 10 minutes, something that typically happens). Thus, I returned to the idea of plating the chromoproteins on a glass petri dish.
●
In order to attempt to standardize the process of plating the chromoproteins on the petri dish, I first spun down the cultures (4500 rpm for 2 minutes) then decanted out the supernatant. Then, I spun the tubes again to further concentrate the cells on the bottom of the tube which allowed me to remove the remaining supernatant from the tube. Lastly, I resuspended the cells clumped at the bottom of the tube in 15 uL of DI water then plated 15 uL of the cells onto the petri dish. Because Cupid Pink and Prancer Purple had been studied in previous experiments, I moved on to look at ScOrange, AE Blue, and dsPink--these were the ones that were plated. The clumped cells of Cupid Pink and Prancer Purple were kept in a tube rack to study tomorrow.
●
A video from the temperature test of ScOrange, AE Blue, and dsPink was uploaded to the google drive. From this experiment, it appears that AE blue turns clear then dries purple (it also rehydrates to purple) when heated to temperatures above 70 °C. This color change was not rescuable, but the now purple AE Blue becomes clear when heated. dsPink does not appear to change in color in response to heat even to temperatures exceeding 90 °C. ScOrange (which looks yellow when plated as described) becomes a fainter yellow when heated then rehydrated.

Day 20 (24/07/14): 
This   morning we decided upon a constitutive promoter, a ribosome binding   site and a terminator that we wanted to transform. This is so we will   have these ready when our sequence for zingiberne synthase arrives. We also decided to transform limonene synthase (from the iGem kit), so we can practice doing the restriction digests and ligations.  
We   prepared chloramphenicol of the correct concentration, and then   prepared agar plates with chloramphenicol to grow our transformed cells   on.  
We then carried out the four transformations, using   parts BBa_J23108 (promoter), BBa_J1742111 (limonene synthase),   BBa_B0015 (terminator) and BBa_B0030 (RBS) from the plates in our kit.   We  plated each transformation twice and left to incubate overnight at 37°C. 
 
Day 21 (25/07/14): 
This morning we counted the plates of transformed cells that we had been growing overnight. 
BBa_J23108: 0 colonies, 0 colonies 
BBa_B0030: 0 colonies, 1 colony 
BBa_J1742111: 8 colonies, 7 colonies 
BBa_B0015: 2 colonies, 8 colonies 
As there was no real growth for the promoter or RBS we will retransform these next week. We will miniprep the limonene synthase and terminator transformations next week as well.

Day 22 (28/07/2014): 
Today   we found a new constitutive promoter and ribosome binding site to   transform. These are parts BBa_J23109 (promoter) and BBa_B0032 (RBS). These were transformed, plated, and left to grow overnight at 37°C.  
We selected a colony of the E.coli transformed with part BBa_1742111   (limonene synthase) and part BBa_B0015 (terminator) and inoculated   these in LB. These were also left at 37°C overnight to grow ready to   carry out the miniprep tomorrow.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html,"binant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system"

Labcourse: For Middle School Students
Background & Instructions
Remember our middle-school member? The little girl, Annie Kong, had an unforgettable summer holiday in our lab. After joining us, she learned more about our project and had a great time learning basic experimental operations. She said she could learn faster while doing experiments and she was inspired by us when she saw us working hard for this goal! This result encouraged us a lot!
Before entering a lab, young students might regard science as mysterious and difficult. This is true among many young students.
Labs, experiments, and scientists...the things shouldn't be mysterious for the public and the young. Science is a way of thinking, while experiment is a way to corroborate our hypothesis. We want to change the stereotype by opening our lab to the public.
Also, for middle school students who were going to enter high school this autumn, the biology course would be new to them. They are more curious than other people. So we had the idea to open our lab to middle school students.
To do such work, you just need to have your own lab or the permission to open it. Prepare a lecture and make sure that there aren't any mistakes. (We asked our teachers to examine it.) The most important thing is to tell the public that science is never mysterious.
Our Work
So we held a course in our lab to introduce more middle school students to biology, especially synthetic biology. We taught basic operations to improve their manipulative ability, and gave a lecture to widen their field of vision. There was also an exam! We asked them to imagine the possibilities of SynBio and solve several easy problems using the operations they've learned.
They told us the examples we introduced were really fascinating and they were more ready to study biology in high school! Two young girls were envious of Annie Kong and ready to be a member in iGEM 2017 when they knew"

UConn,2018,Team:UConn#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," for microbial electrosynthesis.
Peter Gunther
Peter Gunther is a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Connecticut and works as an economist. After learning that he had provided an economic analysis on a grant in 2010 that funded a biofuel facility, we set up an interview over phone. He recommended that we compare costs to see if BASSET is commercially viable. He suggested that we take a look at gas or liquid emissions and any effort in maintenance and collection. He brought up an important point that we should see whether the product would be used as an additive to gasoline or a substitute, like ethanol, and if it would be more or less efficient or cost-effective. Ultimately, we lacked enough data at the time to perform any of the analyses he recommended, but we received valuable insight into what we need to focus on when we continue the model.
Dr. Richard Parnas
Dr. Richard Parnas is a professor of chemical engineering who was involved with the Biofuel Conversion Experiment. Dr. Parnas gave insight into the big-picture view of our project, advising us to consider the economic viability of the biofuel that could be produced from our system. This would include considering our system if developed far into the future: what inputs would need to be provided to , and what outputs (both expected and from potential side reactions?) could come from our system? He also gave advice on the status of our team (as a growing group) - we should recruit more graduate students with experience in synthetic biology or applied design. Though this has been a point of growth for our team over the past year, we realized his point, that more guidance would be useful.
Dr. James Stuart
Dr. James Stuart is an analytical chemist who founded the Biofuel Testing Laboratory in the UConn Center for Environmental Science and Engineering in his retirement. We requested to interview him due to his vast knowledge of biofuel production and companies in the area. Dr. Stuart told us about the companies in the northeast area that went into biodiesel production as a green alternative to petroleum following government programs supporting successful biodiesel plants. In contrast from our biofuel production, these commercial plants used waste cooking oil as inputs to create a fuel which, when combined with petroleum, can act as a more environmentally friendly diesel fuel. Dr. Stuart’s role in this field was to put the biodiesel through a series of tests to ensure it met government-created standards. Although our biofuels are neither meant to be biodiesels nor commercially produced at this point, Dr. Stuart’s tests gave us insight on certain standards that biofuels should meet.

We have also had difficulties finding a source to obtain our Subtilisin savinase gene, so we may need to order the Subtilisin savinase gene as well. We emailed Dr. Grose the sequence that we need, as well as possible costs from several companies.

Meeting with David went well, though he did not have too much additional information that Caroline had not already provided to us.  It appears that no one really knows where the placement of the binding sites for each promoter should be.  He did convince us that Cell-ID is a necessary approach for our project.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#SynFlo_-_-_TEXT.html," by vortexing: the BioBrick cube is placed on top of the plasmid, then the two are shaken together while the color drips into the plasmid. Then, just as a biologist would pipette, mix, and eject the newly-infused plasmid onto the waiting biological vessel, SynFlo allows the user to place the now colored plasmid cube next to the awaiting E. coli cube and then flip the plasmid cube as if pouring or pipetting into the E. coli.
Deploy modified E.coli
Finally, users can deploy their E. coli to the testing environment by placing the E. coli cube on the Microsoft Surface and flipping the cube. The tabletop application is implemented on the Microsoft Surface SUR40 device using the Microsoft Surface 2.0 SDK. The communication between the Sifteo cubes and the SUR40 is implemented using Client-Server communication between the Surface and Sifteo applications.
Users can then interact with the E. coli by adding tangibles to the surface that represent different environmental toxins; the modified E. Coli sensitive to particular toxins will respond by changing their color. Touching the E. coli results in a color change as well.
Results
We conducted preliminary user studies involving observations of 18 high school students from the Upward Bound program, who had some exposure to science but were unfamiliar with synthetic biology. The students were shown a 15-minute presentation that provided introduction to synthetic biology, followed by a demo of SynFlo. Then the users interacted with the system. We observed that in general, users picked up the Sifteo interaction very quickly and found the Sifteo and tabletop interaction especially engaging and fun. We also noted that while interacting with the SynFlo system, users reflected on the connection between SynFlo and the synethic biology concepts discussed in the presentation.

Human Practices
Within the context of our project, we chose to target a problem close to home- preventing contamination in beef products. Our goal is to detect enterohemorrhagic E. coli in beef products and minimize outbreaks. To deal with this pervasive problem in the beef industry, we consulted and worked with key ""steakholders"" at crucial points of the development process. These conversations shaped our entire project and are the foundation of our human practices. Our methodology toward human practices was to tailor our detection system to the end users of the system. We made the following achievements in our human practices:
Informed design : Input from four key industry stakeholders was used to redefine our project. Through these conversations, we assessed management of E. coli in the current industry and refocused our energy to build a novel tool for management of this pathogen prior to slaughter. We used input from these stakeholders to ensure that our system is easy to use, cost effective, and ultimately feasible for its application.
Biological and user safety : Our final prototype is comprised of in vitro protein components from recombinant bacteria. This design alleviates concerns over escape of synthetic organisms into the outside environment. We also thought about the sensitivity requirements for differentiating E. coli shedding in beef cattle, particularly with regard to false positives and false negatives.

BBa_K1886000
Device
pluxR->luxS
luxS is controlled by pluxR promoter. luxS is a kind of DPD synthetase, which could produce DPD (4,5-dihydroxy 2,3-pentanedione) under the cooperation of Pfs enzyme. DPD exists widely in Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria as the signaling factor for quorum sensing, in order to complete the information transfer process within different kinds of bacteria.
BBa_K1886001
Device
AHL single-cycled oscillation pluxL-luxR-pluxR-luxI(LAA tag)-pluxL-luxR-pluxR-aiiA(LAA tag)
This circuit is composed of the constitutive promoter -- broken Ptet and membrane protein cph8. Under dark conditions, protein cph8 could transfer its  phosphoryl group to intracellular protein ompR (ompR is native protein carried by E.coli), and this process could be inhibited by 650-nm light.

Device
AHL,DPD double-cycled oscillation pluxL-luxR-pluxR-luxI(LAA tag)-pluxL-luxR-pluxR-aiiA(LAA tag)-luxpR-luxS
Two molecules of luxR binds with AHL (catalyzed by luxI), and this compound will promote the activity of pluxR. pluxR controls the expression of gene aiiA , encoding the enzyme which degrades AHLs. And all of these form an"

Public speech for iGEM
Time: May 20th 2015
Location: Science Building SA236
Participating member: team members in XJTLU-CHINA, staffs in the department of biology, students interested in synbio and iGEM.
Purpose of this event: we hope more people could know about iGEM competition and have an interest in synthetic biology. Also, we hope for support and permit from our university.
In the beginning, Jodie introduced synthetic biology and iGEM competition. She talked that: ‘Synthetic biology is the design and construction of new biological parts, devices and systems and the re-design of existing natural biological systems for useful purposes. Also, Synthetic biology is the engineering of biology. This engineering perspective may be applied at all levels of the hierarchy of biological structures – from individual molecules to whole cells, tissues and organisms. In essence, synthetic biology will enable the design of ‘biological systems’ in a rational and systematic way’ It gave general information about synbio to some biology freshmen and students from other department. She also talked about iGEM, the main process during the competition, and modern biological technologies used in iGEM. This was the first time professors in biology department know about iGEM and realized its importance.

Next part in public speech was introducing several projects in previous iGEM competition. Teammates displayed ‘This is not a lemon!’ project from Paris Saclay, ‘E. Grätzel – Solar BioEnergy’ project from TU-Darmstadt, ‘Membranes from Bacterial Cellulose’ project form Imperial, ‘Magnetic E. coli’ project from Berlin, ‘Engineering a synthetic microbial consortium’ project from Braunschweig University of Technology. All people were surprised about those creative ideas and work from undergraduates. Dr. Meng said these project were amazing and beyond his image. He was hard to believe biology students can finish such excellent work, while maybe scientists could not have those great ideas. Students were also interested in these projects; thereby we gave them web linkages"

Wageningen_UR,2012,Team:Wageningen UR#CASconference_-_-_TEXT.html,", 10 teams were present. 8 teams from Germany and the UCL (University College of London) team also applied for poster presentations. The whole experience was the single best team building activity that we could imagine. On Monday morning, we had to wake up at 3:00 AM to start our 800 km trip to Munich in our cosy student car caravan. The road trip took us through the German country to the Bavarian region, famous for its nice life styles and how our German team member quotes “where you can enjoy REAL beer”.  It was a beautiful day and the trip was filled with jokes, laughter and enthusiasm to our little working trip.
Presenting our poster
Upon arrival we installed our information stance and started the educational part of our trip, listening to the talks. It was inspiring to hear how diverse the synthetic biology world was, and we had a lot of new ideas from different fields that we found attractive. After the first sessions it was finally up to our poster to attract people to our projects. It was great to see what kind of elements were found interesting about our poster, a real help for determining what should be on our final poster for the jamborees. We learned a lot from the comments and questions, and had an overall good feeling about the poster presentations.
In the evenings, it was of course the moment to get to know the other iGEM teams. And what could be a better place than one of the traditional Beer gardens that Munich has. The iGEM team of Munich arranged a big table where all the teams could join. Wageningen_UR spread the team to integrate with the other teams, to learn about their projects and of course to get familiar with our fellow iGEM teams. We had a lot of fun, and we have taught the other teams some nice Dutch student games. We all enjoyed the evening until late.
The following days were filled with the same programme. It was a great mixture of learning, laughing with our team members, learning how to present our work, building a great team spirit and meeting other teams. We are definitely looking forward to meet the teams again and to see how far they have come in the competition, and if they still know the Dutch games. We are sure that this 3 day conference was a just a minor teaser about what we will encounter at the jamborees, with a big learning experience. We are looking forward to exceed this experience at the actual jamboree(s).

ITU_MOBGAM_Turkey,2013,Team:ITU MOBGAM Turkey#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA sequence that encodes GST is transferred into an expression vector in order to produce recombinant fusion proteins. GST tagged fusion proteins involve a GST protein attached to their N-terminus. GST tag provides higher expression rates and solubility to the recombinant protein that is fused. Moreover, detection of the protein is possible due to the substrate of GST, glutathione (GTH). (3)
Methods
Expression and characterization of Intrinsic Factor (IF) protein was aimed in this module of the project. For this purpose, Gastric intrinsic factor (gif) gene that encodes for intrinsic factor (IF) protein was chosen.
First of all, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is going to be performed for both amplification of gif gene and addition of restriction enzyme digestion sites (BamHI and XhoI).  Then, PGEX-6P1 expression vector will be digested by BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes and the resulting sticky ends of the vector will be ligated with the sticky ends of gif gene.
Second, after the completion of insertion of gif gene into the vector, expression vector will be transformed into the E. coli DH5alfa strain. Then, bacterial growth will be achieved in order to express GST-tagged intrinsic factor protein.
Third, intracellular IF protein will be isolated and expression of the intrinsic factor protein will be confirmed by SDS-PAGE.  Following with the confirmation that IF is successfully expressed, IF protein will be isolated by using affinity chromatography. In this process, GST-tagged IF protein will be purified with the help of its affinity to bind to GSH containing supporting matrix. After the purification of GST-tagged If protein, its purity will be confirmed by applying another SDS-PAGE. If desired purity was achieved, cleavage of the GST-tag will be performed by using the specific protease.
Finally, characterization of the intrinsic factor protein is going to be achieved. The characterization process involves the binding of vitamin B12 to the intrinsic factor protein.
Result
For purification and characterization of recombinant GIF protein,  GIF gene has been amplified via PCR with primers that are designed with BamHI and XhoI restriction recognition sites. Amplified gene products and PGEX-6P1 were cut with BamHI and XhoI. Then, a ligation reaction was set up for GIF and vector. After transformation of ligated products, plasmids were isolated and were cut with BamHI and XhoI for validation (Figure 1).

Inside of the handbook was included a little section where the participants were able to write the obtained results in each practice and themselves could interpret them using the information studied in the workshop, as well as a section of questions that allowed us as instructors to know their weakness and explain the doubts later. We could observe that the use of the handbook with protocols and the experimental practice suring the training workshop were very useful to the participants, because they could develop the ability of working in the molecular biology and genetic engineering and they learn to take important notes to a efficient work in the laboratory. Notes that showed that they were understanding the calculus of the enzymes in cuts and ligations, the gels results, fragments size expected, notes about the bioinfomatics programs, Internet data or books that helped to the participants to obtain a critical mind with their experiments and achieve to formulate their own conclusions.

“Science communication is vital to our quality of life. It helps everyone understand the problems that we face, and shares the ideas and solutions that can improve life for us all.” – Chris Hadfield.
Aims
Many great ideas in science often don’t come to light if they are not well received or understood by the public, which is why education and engagement is such a vital part to science. We have worked to close this communication gap between our research and the public by taking part in numerous outreach activities.
When designing our activities, we considered discussing the science underlying synthetic biology to inspire and encourage curiosity from school students. We also wanted to inform the public on the great applications of synthetic biology and our project with the intentions of beginning a dialogue between us and those with differing backgrounds and opinions.
Workshop Engagement and Education
Dr Egg Adventures
The event was part of Australia’s National Science Week 2017, with our project aptly relating to this year’s theme being ‘Future Earth’.
Our team members collaborated with a group of game developers and artists from Dr Egg Digital, as science consultants for a game testing and puzzle planning event. Led by Dr Catherine Fargher, the concept of the video game was based from her successful theatre show Dr Egg and the Man with No Ear and chapter book publication.
A class of 8-12 year olds from the Queenwood School Catalyst Program were audience to an age appropriate lecture led by the Macquarie iGEM team on the basics of synthetic biology and its applications, and the possible future prospects of our project in renewable energy. The lecture spurred the creativity of the children who then brainstormed game puzzles and character scripts for the Dr Egg Digital game that is being designed to incorporate the national school science curriculum for grades 3-8. The resulting ideas from this collaboration will be incorporated into this educational videogame that is set to be released in February 2018.
Impressed by how this event engaged their students, Queenwood School shared information of our iGEM team and the community outreach we have participated in on their social media channels and their school publications.
Thanks for your AWESOME work yesterday! Lindy the main teacher from Queenwood said she has never seen them so engaged.”

Protocol
Resuspend the pelleted cells in 250 µL of the Resuspension Solution. Transfer the cell suspension to a microcentrifuge tube. The bacteria should be resuspended completely by vortexing or pipetting up and down until no cells clumps remain.Note: Ensure RNase A has been added to the Resuspension Solution.
Add 250 µL of the Lysis Solution and mix throughly by inverting the tube 4-6 tines until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear. Note: Do not vortex to avoid shearing of chromosomal DNA. Do not incubate for more than 4 min to avoid denaturation of supercoiled DNA.
Add 350 µL of the Neutralization Solution and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times. Note:It is important to mix throughly and gently after the addition of the Neutralization Solution to avoid localized precipitation of bacterial cell debris. The neutralized bacterial lysate should become cloudy.
Centrifuge for 5 min to pellet cell debris and chromosomal DNA
Transfer the supernatant to the supplied GeneJET spin column by decanting or pipetting. Avoid disturbing or transferring the white precipitate.
Centrifuge for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the column back into the same collection tube.
Add 500 µL of the Wash Solution (diluted with ethanol prior to use) to the GeneJET spin column. Centrifuge for 30-60 seconds and discard the flow-through. Place the column back into the same collection tube.
Repeat the wash procedure using 500 µL of the Wash Solution
Discard the flow-through and centrifuge an additional 1 min to remove residual Wash Solution. This step is essential to avoid residual ethanol in plasmid preps.
Transfer the GeneJET spin column into a fresh 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add 50 µL of the Elution Buffer to the center of GeneJET spin column membrane to elute the plasmid DNA. Take care not to contact the membrane with the pipette tip. incubate for 2 min at room temperature and centrifuge for 2 min.
Discard the column and store the purified plasmid DNA at -20°C.

After the 6 incubation at 30oC the amplified DNA product was analyzed in agarose gel. Intensive dark RNA band at ~ 1kb correspond to IVTT reaction kit RNA (tRNA, rRNA and etc.).. L and HR correspond to GeneRuler 1kb and High Range DNA Ladders.
In order to show, that the CAT-Seq workflow for activity recorded DNA library preparation is working, two experiments with different starting DNA templates and no reference nucleotides have been carried out. Two populations of 10pL biomolecule synthesis droplets housing IVTT reaction components, substrate nucleotides and circularized Esterase gene or a pUC19 (control) plasmid were generated. After the incubation in 37oC for 3 hours the droplets were reinfused into the droplet merging device. At the same time droplets, housing MDA reaction components without the reference nucleotides(5mC) were generated at ~2 500 000 droplets per hour. The merged droplets were collected and incubated at 30oC for 6 hours. After that, the amplified DNA was extracted using Ampure beads and analyzed on agarose gel. Because no reference nucleotides were used, the only source of cytidine nucleotides in the reaction were substrate nucleotides. However, these nucleotides cannot be incorporated into the DNA, unless the synthesized biomolecule catalyses the conversion, in this example the hydrolysis, of substrate nucleotides. 17 fig. DNA band migration results conclude, that:
Substrate nucleotides are stable and are not affected by any of the components in the CAT-Seq workflow as there is no DNA product when pUC19 template is used (17 fig. 2 well).
Biomolecule of interest is being synthesised in the 10pL droplets and indeed catalyzed the hydrolysis of substrate nucleotides, as DNA is amplified after the merging because a band is visible (17 fig 1 well).
The amplification of DNA concludes the viability of droplet electrocoalescence technique and proves that catalytic information initially stored in 10 pL droplets is carried to the DNA during the amplification, because these nucleotides are incorporated in it.

Microscopic image of G. lucidum mycelium, taken by team member Leo Penny and advisor Lynn Rothschild.
The mycelium is then able to grow and completely fill the plate. An uncontaminated mycelium culture is characterised as completely white, with a fluffy texture. To prevent contamination, all procedures were formed under a sterile laminar flow hood. Below on the left (Figure 1) is a contaminated plate of mycelium, while on the right (Figure 2) is a photo of a well established culture.
Figure 1: Contaminated plate of mycelium.
Figure 2: Well established mycelium culture.
Once a culture of mycelium is well established, pieces of mycelium may be extracted from a single source plate and transferred to other plates of PDYA. This reduces the potential for contamination of mycelium plates as it reduces the chances of bacteria from the live fungus to be transferred onto the plates of PDYA.
Two forms of Ganoderma lucidum were grown; one was the monokaryon, and the other was the dikaryon. A monokaryon is a fungal cell which has only one nucleus. In contrast, a dikaryon is a fungal cell that has two genetically distinct nuclei, although they are allelically-compatible. These two species were provided courtesy of Perez. Based on the analysis done by Perez’s lab the dikaryon variant grows at greater speeds and produces composite materials with greater strength. The monokaryon was grown in addition to the dikaryon as it was easier sample to isolate a sample as it was grown in a petri dish, while in contrast the dikaryon first had to be grafted from a live mushroom that was gifted to us.
Substrate Tests
To further investigate the potential for using mycelium to grow materials and structures both on and off planet, the growth of mycelium on varied substrates were tested. Noteworthy substrates with exceptional material and environmental promises are yard waste, sawdust, used ground coffee beans, and other forms of food waste. Even more importantly, the mycelium successfully grew on lunar and martian regolith simulant with minimal nutrients added in the form of PDY. Below is a table of all the various substrates that the Ganoderma lucidum mycelium was grown on with attached images.

√Best Experimental Measurement

Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer

Plan and method
We set the concentrations of α factor as 0umol/L，1 umol/L， 2.5 umol/L， 5 umol/L，10 umol/L，15 umol/L. We sampled 5ml culture liquid of each of them at 0、4、8、10、12、14、16、18、20、22、24、26、28、30h respectively after shake culture. Afterwards, the red fluorescence intensity was measured in microplate reader (584/607) which was calibrated by pure liquid medium. We set red fluorescence intensity/OD600 as Y-axis and time as X- axis for the coordinate system.
Results and discussion

Abstract
     Ionizing radiation and radiation pollution is an important environmental problem that not only affects those working around radiation facilities, but those dealing with the aftermath of widespread nuclear disasters such as those at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor or the Chernobyl reactor. Penn State’s team project will focus on using a genetic circuit introduced into E. coli bacterial cells, in order to rapidly detect and report the presence of harmful ionizing radiation. We are working to develop a robust and reliable biosensor which utilizes the lambda phage lytic-lysogenic switch coupled with a fast-acting reporter capable of producing an easily visible effect. We believe that the final construct may have the potential to rival current radiation detection methods, such as digital dosimeters.
     Our hope is that the basis of our biological dosimeter system will prove to be an effective genetic system capable of detecting harmful levels of radiation and relaying it to those working in the field or affected area. We envision our system not only being useful in such applications, but also being capable of further expansion and evolution through the expanding field of synthetic biology.
Overall project: Bacterial Dosimeter
Radiation of one form or another is a constant presence throughout our every day lives. Radiation, or the transmission and absorption of energy over a given distance, has proven an invaluable technology useful in applications for everything from heating our food to diagnosing and treating diseases. Some forms of radiation, however, can be detrimental to the human body, as they are a common cause of such diseases as radiation poisoning and cancer.
All types of radiation can be divided into two categories: non-ionizing and ionizing. Non-ionizing radiation (consisting of radio, micro, infrared, and visible electromagnetic waves) contains less energy and has a relatively small effect on living organisms that has only recently been studied. Ionizing radiation, however, contains a much greater amount of energy capable of ionizing atoms which can lead to harmful effects on living tissue. This category of radiation encompasses alpha and beta decay as well as neutron, X-ray, and gamma radiation.
Our project focuses on detecting the degradation and damage of DNA associated with ionizing radiation. The initial proposed design is shown below. It consists of two parts: a sensor"

In order to determine if the neontaingen candidates can be presented in the surface of of antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells, which are the precursors of the immune response, the neoantigens need to have a high binding affinity                   to the MHC-I complexes on the cell surface. This MHC-I complexes are specific for cytotoxic cytokine releasing CD8+ T cells, that can target and lysate the tumor cells. In order to shortlist the best neoantigen candidates, the neoantigens                   etracted can be rank according to their binding affinity to MHC-I complexes. This was performed using netMHC (v 4.0)(Andreatta and Nielsen 511-517). The FASTA file containing the candidate neoantigens was input and 8 to 14mer peptide                   len gth was selected to obtain the widest library of neoantigens. The species/loci chosen was the standear HLA supertype representative. To test the system only alleles of class HLA-A were selected, including HLA-A0101, HLA-A0201, HLA-A0301,                   HLA-A2402, HLA-A2601. The options to sort by predicted affinity and save output in XLS format, were also selected in order to be able to easily postprocess the neoantigens. The results of the analysis can be found in the Ginga Github.
Additionally, to netMHC Ginga also includes the support to mixMHCpred, a software that adds mass-spectrometry analysis of the MHC-I alleles to improve the prediction of MHC-I-peptide binding (Bassani-Sternberg M et al.). However, this                   is currently under development.
Rank Binding Affinity - neoSearch
Although, netMHC can sort the peptide sequences by their ranking affinity this data is difficult to organis. Furthermore, sorting the peptides according to their binding affinity and not the parent sequence that they originate from is                   currently not possible. neoSearch sorts the XLS file from netMHC and returns the ranked neoantigens in a CSV file that can be easily read and processed to create high throughput therapeutics. The final expected results of the pipeline                   can be found in the Ginga Github and a brief summary of the results can be found in Table 9.

The sorted file was outputted in the compressed BAM file format to reduce the size of the library and simplify the analysis, later in the pipeline. The headers of the processed BAM file can be found in                   the table below (Table 2). Additionally to this main headers the file contains between 39 clone contigs that were not able to be placed in any specific part of the gene (ChrUN) and 20 additional chr_random tables that contain data related                   to sequence that is known to be in a particular chromosome, but could not be reliably ordered within the current sequence (Ken et al.). Furthermore, the remaining 9 tables that were not correctly aligned correspond to different haplotypes                   in the chromosome. Normally, the reference sequence can only display a single haplotype per chromosome, so alternative haplotypes are contained in this file (Ex. chr6_apd_hap) (Ken et al.).

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,". fumarate is produced and consumed within the TCA cycle). In stark contrast, the flux    towards fumarate in photoautotrophically cultured Synechocystis is coming exclusively as a side-product    of anabolic reactions within both purine and urea metabolism. The fumarate that is released in the latter two is then re-assimilated through the TCA cycle (which is actually not really working as a cycle then) via the activity of a class II fumarase that converts it to malate. Fumarase is encoded by the gene fumC (slr0018) and, as first revealed by FRUITS, independent model simulations using a variant of iJN678 in which fumC is silenced, indeed predict production of  fumarate with a Y p/x of 0.848 mmol gDW -1 .The prediction that a fumC deletion results in growth coupled fumarate production was subsequently tested experimentally. How this was done and the results obtained are reported here.
Conclusion
The modeling framework applied here has allowed us to select a suitable product (fumarate) and devise a strategy to align its production with biomass formation. The experimental validation of the main predictions made here is an important step towards achieving one of our overall goals - '' to create stable and robust photosynthetic cell factories''. To make it explicit, this modeling exercise predicts that:
A fumC deletion strain of Synechocystis forcibly makes fumarate
The rates of production and growth are stoichiometrically coupled (i.e. faster growth implies faster production, and vice-versa)
This results in phenotypic stability
Finally, it is important to note that all these predictions have been done for cells cultured photoautotrophically in the presence of light. We did perform FRUITS also using iJN678 but now under darkness using glycogen consumption as the carbon and energy source (i.e. simulating chemotrophic growth). We were curious to see whether there would be something interesting related to fumarate there, or potentially, to identify other interesting targets. Unfortunately, this did not yield many new compounds besides the ones we had already picked up before, except for 3-Phospho-D-glycerate. Although the predicted Y p/x is very tempting (184.4 mM.gDW -1 - not a typo!), this comes at the cost of a drastic drop in growth rate.

MODEL RESULT
Figure 1. Intracellular Model with large amount of Dox and active CRISPR system from minute zero-th to 1400th
(a) Cas9 is continuously being transcript, thus a logarithmic growth of mRNA molecules of Cas9        (blue line, mRNA-Cas9) is observed. Counterbalanced by natural degradation rate, the total count of        mRNA-Cas9 reaches a stable population and switches to a plateau.
Cas9 Protein (green line, pro-cas9) total count is keep at zero, due to immediate conversion into CRISPR complex.
(b) gRNA (blue line) total count grows logarithmically and reaches a plateau due to natural degradation.       The size of gRNA is 7 times smaller than Cas9, thus it is transcript much faster than Cas9. Thus the CRISPR        complex (green line, Cas9-gRNA) is much lower in comparison with the blue line.
(c) This figure shows the huge starting amount of Dox (red line, Dox) for this simulation 10e11. Dox is not        regenerated and only goes down due to natural degradation and binding with TetR protein (green line, pr-tetR) to        form Dox-TetR Complex (cyan line, Dox-tetR). All the other amount are too low in relation to Dox, thus harder to        observe in the figure.        (Go here for a better look at mRNA of TetR, TetR protein, and Dox-TetR Complex)
(d) Yellow Fluorescence Protein (green line, pr-YFP) go through a logarithmic growth, reaching a peak,        and then degrades. Total count molecules mRNA of Yellow Fluorescence Protein (blue line, mRNA-YFP) observes a        much higher logarithmic growth and then degrades really fast as the transcription is stopped by the YFP-DNA cleaving       of CRISPR Complex.
