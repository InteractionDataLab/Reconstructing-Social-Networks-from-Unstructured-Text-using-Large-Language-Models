UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Design
Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar"

A significant component in validating the accuracy and precision of our ElectroPen was understanding the repeatability of results. The TASTaipei and UGA teams were instrumental in proving our ElectroPen works in the real world. Both teams were not only able to successfully electroporate E. coli cells, but also obtained results similar to those from the trials conducted by Lambert's own team. We are very grateful for the collaborations between two iGEM teams without whose time and efforts we could not have proven our Electropen hardware.  Thank you TASTaipei and UGA!

Once verified, the constructs were mini-prepped and transformed into the testing chassis- a strain of E. coli that would better withstand the testing conditions- MG1655 (DE3).
Experimental Design
Two primary sets of experiments were run on the testing constructs, one utilizing fluorescence readings and the other with isothermal titration calorimetry.
The fluorescence readings were divided into segments. Both had measurements taken from aliquots of liquid cultures on plate reader at zero, two, four, eight, and twenty hours. Five milliliters of M9 minimal media were grown up for one set of fluorescence readings, the constructs were tested with 2, 1, and 0.5 mM of the respective ligand. Fluorescence measurements were normalized to the fluorescence of a negative control in media, BBa_R0040 per unit of OD630 of the assay relative to that of the the media. This set of readings were meant to test the sensitivity of the riboswitch regulation to the concentration of the vitamin.
The other set of fluorescence readings was where the constructs were tested with 0 and 0.03 mM of the added vitamin. These readings were meant to establish a clear difference between the riboswitch in the presence of the aptamer and without.These readings were normalized to the blank media.
Isothermal titration calorimetry was done on the riboswitch constructs after in vitro RNA synthesis. The binding constant of the RNA to the ligands was measured. These experiments are ongoing."

HUMAN PRACTICES SUMMARY
We used Human Practices research to guide and better understand our project. We contacted professors, engineers, researchers, companies, and wastewater treatment plants to compile information for our final constructs and prototype designs. Our Human Practices are separated into three categories: Research, Outreach, and Impact.
RESEARCH
To understand how people view nanoparticles, their usage and current regulations, we gathered public opinion from our local community. We sought advice from researchers in the fields of nanotechnology and environmental science to learn about how nanoparticles impact the environment and our lives. Lastly, we contacted nanoparticle manufacturers, waste collectors, as well as wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in both urban and rural settings to learn about current practices and possible future applications.
Water System Services
WWTP - Dihua Wastewater Treatment Plant
In order to learn firsthand about the effect of nanoparticles in WWTPs, we visited the Dehua WWTP (迪化污水處理廠). Here, we were given a tour around the plant, and were able to ask questions to the managers and people that work there. They confirmed with us that the current facilities are unable to remove nanoparticles from wastewater mainly due to their small size. In addition to this information, they kindly provided us with samples of sludge, effluent water, and the polymers they add during wastewater processing. Throughout the year we visited and talked to the Dihua WWTP several times about where and how our project could be implemented in their current system. These conversations and visits played a huge role in shaping our construct design, prototype design, mathematical modeling and overall purpose for our project. (Whole team activity)

Introduction
This year, we developed an application, Biocampany, a software that is installed on the chat software WeChat (a software used by almost everyone in China). Our applet integrates the advantages of WeChat. So, you don’t need to download another app. While using our software, you can also chat with friends, play mini games and so on. It is a new-concept and convenient software that can be used regardless of the system’s mobile phone. Besides, promoting a new application needs lots of work while WeChat is already a systematic and successful software. That’s why we put our application on WeChat platform instead of making an individual application.
For education and public engagement:
It’s a corridor and for the public to contact iGEM and synthetic biology.
For iGEM and synthetic biology education, we uploaded the post about knowledge of synthetic biology and information about iGEM regularly. People can gradually have a comprehensive understanding of iGEM and synthetic biology.
For iGEM teams, iGEM teams can post their projects to our applet. People can subscribe the projects that they are interested in and give the teams suggestions in comment section to improve or modify the projects.
It’s also a tool that make people participate in the iGEM project directly. People can send the sample for the project or iGEM teams can distribute some models to the public and ask them for help. If you are really interested in the project, you can even give the project a little bonus to support them or pay a visit to their lab.
Meanwhile, we did more education and public engagement work with our application.( click here to see detail )

Problem
How can we quantify promoter activity?
When characterising promoters today it is done by proxy of protein. This can result in unwanted variations caused by translation and folding efficiency or excess cellular stress. Another important issue is the lack of a standard for measurements of fluorescence as most characterisations are done using fluorescent proteins such as GFP. As a result, most characterisations are done in relative units making it complicated or impossible to compare measurements between labs, strains and growth conditions. READ MORE
Solution
Spinach RNA allows us to measure RNA concentration using fluorometry
The Spinach RNA is an aptamer, which can bind to DFHBI to create a fluorophore that resembles GFP in spectral properties. This provides a way to easily quantify RNA concentration and allows promoter activities to be calculated in units Polymerases Per Second. The possibility of measuring promoter activity in absolute terms will enable researchers to share and compare results obtained in different labs, and better characterise the function of promoters. READ MORE
Results
We have developed a method that can be used to measure absolute promoter activity
Using RNA transcribed in vitro we created a standard series which can be used to determine the concentration of Spinach given a fluorescence intensity. We also designed an experiment to determine the degradation rate of the Spinach RNA in vivo. Combining these two experiments with the growth rate and fluorescence of a Spinach-expressing culture it is possible to determine the promoter activity using our derived formulas or our online calculator.

BaKillus - Engineering a pathogen-hunting microbe
Increasing bacterial resistance to classical antibiotics remains a serious threat and urges the development of novel pathogen-killing strategies. Exploiting bacterial communication mechanisms such as quorum sensing (QS) is a promising strategy to specifically target certain pathogens. The major aim of this project is the introduction of a genetic circuit enabling Bacillus subtilis to actively detect, attach to, and eventually kill Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Initially, we will introduce the autoinducer-sensing two-component systems of S. aureus and S. pneumoniae into B. subtilis to create a pathogen-detecting strain. By utilizing QS-dependent promoters, we will then trigger pathogen-killing strategies like the production of antimicrobial peptides or biofilm degradation. As a safety measure, a delayed suicide-switch guarantees non-persistence of genetically modified B. subtilis in the absence of pathogens. We envision the use of BaKillus as a smart, cheap and simple-to-use medical device for diagnostics and targeted treatment of multiresistant superbugs.

Degredation of TCE with novel metabolic pathway with soluble methane monooxyengenase and haloalkanoic dehalogenase
Trichloroethylene (TCE) is volatile organic solvent that has been used in dry-cleaning fluid and as an additive in paint removers, adhesives and spot removers.1 According to the EPA and the International Agency for Research Cancer (IARC), there is definitive evidence of TCE causing kidney cancer, and limited evidence for its correlation with liver cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Acute exposure to TCE of between 17-85 ppm can cause central nervous system depression with symptoms including ataxia, short-term memory loss and long term oculomotor dysfunction.2 According to the Agency for toxic substance and Disease Registry (ATSDR), TCE has been found in at least 1,045 of the 1,699 National Priorities List sites identified by the EPA.3
Trichloroethylene was initially developed by the Imperial Chemical Industries in Britain as an anesthetic to replace chloroform, but was soon replaced due to patients developing cardiac arrhythmias and hepatotoxicity. TCE found some use as a dry cleaning solvent, but was replaced by tetrachloroethylene in the 1950s. The compound found its greatest use as an degreaser for metal parts. In the United States, TCE was used heavily by both military agencies and NASA as way to clean engine fuel systems, including the F1 rocket engine which was used to in the Saturn V rockets of the 1960s and 70s.4
In 2001 the EPA proposed stricter regulation of TCE, setting off an interdepartmental argument with the Department of Defense, Department of Energy and NASA. After some political maneuvering, the EPA withdrew its risk assessment. Since then, the US military has sharply reduced its use of TCE and total US consumption of the solvent was ~100 tons as of 2006.5 The state of North Carolina is home to seven trichloroethylene spill sites, including Camp Lejeune US Marine Base - which some consider the largest contamination site in"

She said that this idea as well as the needleless vaccines would have a huge potential. However, another visitor argued that there is a huge need for treatment of antibiotic resistant skin infections in western countries, whereas a vaccine patch would be desirable for developing countries. Considering the conclusion drawn from our meeting with Lily Frank that ethically, it may be saver to choose an application relevant to Western countries, the skin infections application may be preferred.
Insights
We learned about the existence of some useful ethical frameworks.
A fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of synthetic biology both across society and globally is an important task of scientists working in the field of synthetic biology.
Follow-up
We decided against using our living material for malaria-sensing or vaccines-delivery in third world countries.
We explored the ethical frameworks recommended by Lily and used them for an ethical discussion  of our work.

June 18, 2018. Kick-off Safe-by-Design Challenge: Skype with Korienke Smit and Niek Savelkoul (RIVM)
On the 18th of June, we had a Skype call with two representatives from the RIVM to get started. They had reviewed our proposal we had sent them in advance . This resulted in a lot of useful feedback from their side. After the meeting, we were very excited to get started on the safety challenge!
Insights
For Human Practices, it is better and more feasible to focus on (safety) aspects related to our project than on general policy/legislative topics.
Think of safety issues related to all stages of the project. Thus, not only patient safety (end of the chain), but also the production process.
Follow-up

Building with Biology
July 29, 2016
While hosting the iGEM Regional Meetup at Missouri S&T, iGEMers from University of Nebraska - Lincoln and Washington University in St. Louis joined our team in putting on a Building with Biology event for the Rolla community. We invited families to participate in a variety of biology related events from designing a superhero and extending those ideas to designing a super bacteria to matching certain qualities to different types of microbes. Children were encouraged to consider in depth ways that synthetic biology could affect their lives and ask questions of iGEM members to expand their knowledge.
National Engineers Week
February 26 and 27, 2016
iGEM members traveled to St. Louis Science Center and joined organizations from Missouri S&T and other area universities to showcase STEM fields to younger children.  Our team brought cultures of photosensitive bacteria with different designs created in them and bioluminescent bacteria glowing both red and green. Team members explained the manners in which bacteria can be both beneficial and detrimental to our health. One of the members even had the chance to involve a family by communicating with them in Spanish.
Visiting Professor from Missouri State University
January 29, 2016
Dr. Tomasi visited iGEM to present to our team and other department members about animal energetics and hibernation of bats. He was able to highlight the potential dangers of bats continually awakening from hibernation which is often caused by infection with White Nose Syndrome. He even brought a bat recently captured in a building at MSU for us to meet!
Newburg Children’s Museum
August 25, 2016
iGEM was asked to attend the grand reopening of the Newburg Children’s Museum, a museum located about 20 minutes from Rolla, Missouri. This museum gives children a safe and flourishing place for them to come after school and learn. We brought a interactive game where kids could learn the parts of a gene in bacteria and create an operational gene with floor puzzle pieces.
Bat Day
April 29, 2016
Students of the iGEM team organized and orchestrated an on campus Bat Day to inform our fellow students about iGEM and about White Nose Syndrome. This day was complete with trivia, bat fact handouts, prizes, carnival games, and cookie decorating.

SCUT-China,2015,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," in the study. Here, the iGEM modeling group wants to use some of the existing models to establish the mathematical model to describe the process of the transfection and gene combinations of Lentivirus in the cells.
5.1 Macro mechanism
In order to explore whether Lentivirus has a time delay like HIV in the erosion of the cell, we first make a hypothesis. We assume there is a time delay between the initial Lentivirus invasion susceptible cells and the subsequent infection of the virus. Because the Lentivirus can not produce new virus particles, so when we analyze the whole process,we should avoid the generation of new virus particles. Therefore, according to the research results of Perelson、Bonhoeffer and Xu Rui, we have integrated to establish the model of Lentivirus’s transfection with time delay:
Among them, healthy cells (also known as susceptible cells) x(t) produce with constant input rate,d represents the death rate,
represents saturated infection rate, healthy host cells are exposed to the virus particles after infected with bilinear infection rate of βxv into infected cells y(t);α>0; Infected cells’ death rate is a; The removal rate and initial amount of dissociative virus is μ and k; τ represents the time of virus’ invasion into susceptible cells to susceptible cells infected until death. Assuming  m represents the production rate of infected cells(not dead), e-mτdenotes the survival probability of the infected cells from time t-τ to time t (1/m represents the average survival time of cells infected but not with infectivity).
figure.12
In the case of other constant unchanged, we take different τ (τ=15,5,2.5,1,0.1) and use dde in MATLAB to solve the delay differential equations. From the image above, there are no changes of images with the changes of τ, but always overlap. Thus, we conclude that based on the establishment of Delay Lentiviral Transfection Model, Lentivirus does not have a time delay, which is different with HIV. As to whether Lentivirus completely has no time delay or it has other special properties, further studies need to be done in the future.
5.2 Micro mechanism
There is no conclusion on the study of Lentivirus, but because Lentivirus is gene therapy vectors which are developed on the basis of HIV-1, so we can simulate the process of cells infected by Lentivirus according to the process of HIV-1 infecting cells and some of the characteristics of Lentivirus. As Lentivirus belongs to RNA virus and the RNA virus’ coat protein contains the reverse transcript"

""Ant Army is an inovation to protect your trees and other plants.It uses pheromones as an effectiv weapon against any kind of animal which could possibly destroy your harvest!""
Christian Kieschnick
Product Description
'Ant Army' can be paired with a variety of garden plants to be defended. When attacked by parasites, leaves start emitting a messenger substance that will be recognized by the ants and will alert them to fan out for rescue.   If you want to enjoy your garden undisturbed by the ants, the 'Ant Army' homing function will come in handy. Simply press a button on your remote control and the habitat will release a messenger substance summoning the ants home immediately. In colder regions, the habitat will be kept at tropical temperature to ensure the ants' well-being and optimal functionality.   The autumn version of the product comes with an upgrade that turns 'Ant Army' into a useful helper for keeping your garden clean and tidy. Litter and dropped leaves will be recognized and collected into piles.
Technical Description
Our ""Plant-protector-set"" contains: 1x ant colony with the 'Ant Army' box, 5x food capsules + 4m hoses (can be ordered according to your own specifications), 1x feed pump with 5 connections (extra remote feed pump controls and capsules can be ordered), 1x 5L bucket special honey, 1x phytomon controler with remote control, batteries and power supply, 1x phytomon capsule, 1x collection command capsule, 1x swarming command capsule. The Set includes an ant colony and is a compact and handy product which can be used for any kind of trees and bushes. It should be noted that the product is placed centrally in the tree crown. Before you remove the transparent protective film from the ant's entrance portal, you should put the food capsules on the end of the tree branches. 5 capsules are the minimum required for a medium-sized fruit tree. Don't forget to install the food hoses on the food capsules. After cutting hoses to the desired length, fill to the top with honey using the feed pump provided in the kit. After this is done, install the ant-controller. Take the tube from it and tack it in the trunk of the tree. Then reconnect the controller"

Ethics Workshop and Team presentations May 29th 2009
Today I attended the Ethics workshop which was organized by the Alberta Ingenuity Fund (Our Platinum Sponsor). The ethics workshop was held at our university on May 31st. It was an excellent opportunity for more members of our team to meet the members of both Alberta and Lethbridge teams. At the workshop, we were given valuable insight on the exploration of ethical issues with the help of Dr. Gregor Wolbring and Ms. Lori Sheremeta. Each team was able to introduce their respective projects, and the ethical issues surrounding each project were discussed. We were able to discuss the following elements and concerns regarding each project in:
Economics
Ethics
Environment
Legality
and Social Issues.  While discussing all three projects, we were able to come across similar themes in what we would want to explore. These themes included looking at biosafety and patenting of processes/genes. Teams were also able to help each other determine what critical points should be explored, and how such issues should be approached. Students were coached on exploring ethics as a comprehensive look at all issues, displaying both pros and cons.
In addition to our own projects, we also examined a number of successful teams from last year and analyzed what the requirements are for the ethics component of iGEM, and what could be explored further this year. The ethics workshop was valuable preparation in outlining exploration of ethics for each project, and the feedback gained from Dr. Wolbring, Ms. Sheremeta, and all of the students provided an excellent starting point.

Result section for AHL signaling system model
At the beginning of this week, we were able to make a nice animation from our simulation, using a built-in function called “manipulate”. Our simulation is quit powerful and we believe we can extract more information out of our model. As a result, we designed new ways of representing results, such as “Rule Charts” and “Rule Patterns”. Rule Charts are bar graphs that show the distributions of the rules throughout the simulation. Rule Pattern is an array plot that shows in each step what rule was applied to what membrane using different colors. I also had three meeting this week. The first meeting was with Lindsay members. The second meeting was with Dr. Jacob and Afshin discussing features of our model, and the last meeting"

3. Investigation
We hoped our human practice work can influence more ordinary people. So, above all, we should realize other people's opinions on transgenic food. Because of that, we made a questionnaire about GMO.
The data we've obtained in questionnaire is showing below:
The respondents' proportion of men and women is approximately balanced. The age level mainly locates between 18 and 25. What's more, the respondents have a Bachelor degree or a higher degree.
The main content
Question 4: Do you know what is genetically modified (gm)?
Analysis of the Q4: 4/5 of the respondents have a certain understanding for ""GM technology"", 1/5 respondents don't understand this technology or even don't know about it. This suggests that the ""GM technology"" is received by the majority of respondents.
Question 6: Will you eat gm food?
Analysis: About a third of the people can accept genetically modified (gm) food. 17%  people determine not to eat genetically modified food. All of these suggesting that the public acceptance of genetically modified foods is raising.
Question 11: Is transgenosis beneficial or harmful in your opinion?
Analysis: Most people have a skeptical attitude to genetically modified (gm). For respondents, genetically modified (gm) is an emerging technology. The public don't understand thoroughly enough about the gm, so they cannot hold a certain attitude to it. We should strengthen the propaganda of genetically modified (gm), and let the public know more about the specific meaning and connotation.
Question 12: Will you use gm products(non-food)?
Question 13: Have you ever heard of skin care products that contain astaxanthin?
Question 14: Will you choose a skin care product or a health foodstuff that contains astaxanthin (gm)?
If new genetically modified foods were put into market, about half of people can fully accept. While the acceptance of gm products(non-food) is even higher. However, our people do not know much about astaxanthin product at present, so we should enlarge the propaganda. Our astaxanthin product will have a larger market if it's a skin care product.
According to the data we've got from investigation, we can see that most people are holding a neutral opinion on development of GMO, so it's possible that we can help them to learn more about transgenic and dispel their qualm, thus making more people accept GMO products. So as to reach this aim, we designed a series of interesting activities.
5. Spreading knowledge to"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," each transformant were selected and grown in LB+Chl, then washed and diluted to an OD600 of 0.05 in 100 ul media. Transformants were analysed in quadruplicate, with bacteria and media pipetted onto the plate using a pipetting robot for maximum accuracy. Once set up, the plate was incubated at specified temperatures in a plate reader with double orbital shaking, taking readings every 10 min for 24 h.
Temperature
Growth in Test 2 was affected differently in LB and SOC (Fig 3). In LB, there appears to be a slight increase in max OD reached as temperature increases, however at an alkaline pH the device appears unable to grow well in higher temperatures. In SOC, there is no distinct pattern in how temperature affects growth, but max growth is improved as pH is increased, suggesting pH and temperature have a combined effect.
Figure 3 Max OD reached by Test 2 in (A) LB and (B) SOC media over 24 h at 31C, 37C and 43C.
Fluorescence levels were affected differently at different pH levels as temperature was increased (Figure 4). 37C appears to be optimum temperature for both media, as there are decreases between 37C and 43C at all pH levels apart from pH 7.20 in LB media. However, we can see a dramatic increase in overall max fluorescence levels in both LB and SOC when pH is increased to an alkaline level.
Figure 4 Max fluorescence reached by Test 2 in (A) LB and (B) SOC media over 24 h at 31C, 37C and 43C.
For the overall FL:OD, in LB media 37C was the optimum temperature, but in SOC a higher temperature appeared to be more favourable. In both media, the exception was seen at an alkaline pH, where FL:OD increases with temperature in LB, and 37C was optimum in SOC (Figure 5).
Figure 5 Max FL:OD reached by Test 2 in (A) LB and (B) SOC media over 24 h at 31C, 37C and 43C.
pH
Growth was affected significantly by changes in pH, which can be seen in figure 6. In SOC media, a distinct increase is seen in max OD as pH increases. In LB media the opposite is seen, where as pH increases, max growth decreases.
Figure 6 Max OD reached by Test 2 over 24 h in (A) LB and (B) SOC media"

Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM this year because I thought it sounded like a lot of fun! I love exploring the unknown, and coming up with wild ideas that might just work. That's what drew me to iGEM, the idea that we really might be able to come up with something crazy and get it to work. That's why I joined iGEM!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I was actually hoping to meet a bunch of awesome and nerdy people who shared my interest in molecular and synthetic biology. I'd say that was a success.
What inspires you:
The infinite. People have always talked about limitations. How things can't be done, how they are impossible. I think the impossible, the unobtainable, has always been more of a challenge, something I aspire to. Like a sweet aroma it calls me, always has and always will. One day, I want meet the impossible, the infinite, the endless.
Hobbies:
Well right now I'm learning ballroom dancing! It's actually a ton of fun!!! :D

The science of Golden Rice
“What is the golden on Golden Rice?”
Compared to the non GM-rice the amount of β-carotene (provitamin A) in the Golden Rice is higher. Without genetic engineering methods the genetic variability of non GM-rice is too small to increase the content by conventional breeding techniques to β-carotene. In the β-carotene biosynthesis three enzymes are essential: phytoene desaturase (PDS), ζ-carotene desaturase (ZDS), ζ-carotene cis-trans Isomerase (Z-ISO)  and carotene cis-trans isomerase (CRTISO) . The breakthrough of reconstitution of the carotenoid pathway in the grain and mdash in rice grains in 1999 (see table 1) was so essential for the advancement of the project. Naturally the rice plant produces in the leaves the enzymes PDS, ZDS and CRTISO .Compared to that the enzymes in the rice grain (endosperm of the rice) are down regulated. So the GM-rice in contrast to the Golden Rice is white due to the non building of the yellow -gold colored β-carotene in the rice grain. Figure 6  shows the engineered carotenoid pathway in grains of Golden Rice which leads to the golden color of the rice.In contrast to the non GM-rice they inset dissimilar genes to get β-carotene in the rice grain. The first used transgene encodes a plant phytoene synthase: NpPSY (from Narcissus pseudonarcissus) accelerates the reaction from GGPP (endogenously synthesised geranylgeranyl-diphosphate) to phytoene (colorless carotene with a triene chromophore) . To get phytoene to all-trans-Lycopin the three enzymes ZDS, PDS and CRTISO were replaced by bacterial phytoene desaturase (crt I) (from Pantoea ananatis; previously known as Erwinia uredovora) which leads to conjugation by adding four double bonds. NpLCY (from Narcissus pseudonarcissus) were used to react all-trans-Lycopin to β-carotene. From these dissimilar three genes (NpPSY, N"

Finding:  The flow of the pump was too small and the flow was blocked badly in tubes.  Each tubes had different resistance to water, thus the flow in each tubes was  different. While blasting air through tubes, an upright tube would   make air pass easier. Also, the flow should  not be too fast, otherwise the beads will rush to one side and plug up the  tube.
Fluorescence  Test:
Since  the analytical result from kinetic curves we had taken on last Sunday, we  lowered the level of inducer concentration once again. But curves of  fluorescence measurements in this time show something different from last ones.  There are still remarkable fluctuations of parallel samples. These phenomena  might result from the unstable and nonairtight environment in the SpectraMax M5  that obviously decreased the volume of Basal Medium.

We have complied information of synthetic biology in four East Asian countries/regions and one South East Asian country. We believe that this novel approach will help the reader to have more holistic and unbiased view of synthetic biology all around the world. We also had time to share our experience and thoughts to various different people through presentations. We already had a semi-formal meeting with SUSTC and CUHK iGEM teams. We have also prepared three more presentations, two for HKUST students, and one for the general public in Hong Kong.

NEEDS FINDING
Our iGEM team was inspired by Stanford Byers Center for Biodesign, an organization that leads in medical device design. Their biodesign innovation process was created to ensure that devices are created to address real, observed needs. We decided to adapt their process for synthetic biology and use it to identify and develop our project idea.
COMMUNITY OUTREACH
We began by hosting a biodesign workshop to attract new members and introduce them to the needs finding process. Ross Venook, the director of engineering at Stanford Biodesign, helped us put together a presentation and set of activities to lead participants through the fundamentals of biodesign.
The workshop was also an introduction for the independent study that we ran in winter, in which students applied the biodesign principles to find needs that might be addressed with synthetic biology. Kara Rogers, a lecturer in the bioengineering department, worked with us to create curricular materials and teach the course. The materials and student work for the independent study can be viewed here.
DEFINING OUR PROJECT
In spring, our independent study reduced to the students who would be participating on the team over the summer. We started by reviewing the previous quarter’s work and choosing one need area for our focus. We were most interested in needs related to the microbiome, but talking to grad students who study mammalian gut microbiomes made us realize that working with anaerobic bacteria is difficult without a specialized growth chamber. To avoid those challenges, we shifted our focus to plant microbiomes. Cannabis was a plant of particular interest to our group, so we decided to look for needs relating to the cannabis microbiome.
INDUSTRY INTERVIEWS
In the early stages of our research, we conducted interviews with people whose work was relevant to our project. We spoke to cannabis growers and a consultant for cannabis businesses; we also talked with the founder of Confident Cannabis, a company that provides software for cannabis testing labs. One"

In the graph it is shown that the bought laccase TVEL0 which was used as positive control is able to degrade more than 90 percent of the used substrates. None of the bacterial laccases are able to degrade ethinyl estradiol without ABTS but estradiol is degraded in a range from 16 %(ECOL) to 55 % (TTHL). The original concentrations of substrates were 2 µg per approach. (n = 4)
The measurements were made to test if the produced laccases were able to degrade different hormones. Therefore the produced laccases were inserted in the same concentrations (3 µg mL-1) to the different measurement approaches. To work with the correct pH value (which were measured by the Team Activity Test) Britton Robinson buffer at pH 5 was used for all measurements. The initial substrate concentration was 5 µg mL-1. The results of the reactions without ABTS are shown in Figure 28. On the Y-axis the percentages of degraded estradiol (blue) and ethinyl estradiol (red) are indicated. The X-axis displays the different tested laccases. The degradation was measured at t0 and after five hours of incubation at 30 °C. The negative control was the substrate in Britton Robinson buffer and showed no degradation of the substrates. The bought laccase TVEL0 which is used as positive control is able to degrade 94.7 % estradiol and 92.7 %  ethinyl estradiol. The laccase BPUL (from Bacillus pumilus) degraded 35.9 % of used estradiol after five hours. ECOL  was able to degrade 16.8 % estradiol. BHAL degraded 30.2 % estradiol. The best results were determined with TTHL (laccase from Thermus thermophilus). Here the percentage of degradation amounted 55.4 %.

This was hoped to be in the form in pigment production. We envisioned explosions of pigments similar to fireworks and that we could combine differently coloured pigment explosions to manipulate the overall colour output. Needless to say this idea was inspired by 2009 iGEM champions Cambridge and their rainbow of pigment production Biobricks. Our spin on the idea was to produce a lightning fast response- as speed of pigment production generally isn’t so immediate. Adapting this idea we became fixated with the scenario of capturing a colourless intermediate (by tethering it to a protein scaffold) which upon activation of an enzyme was process in one step to a coloured product. It became quickly apparent that in order to achieve such a fast response as we desired we were going to need to bypass the traditional steps of transcription and translation. These were believe to be the most time consuming steps in our system; synthesis of the enzyme. We went through a spell of trying to think of a way around these steps focusing on utilizing protein engineering.
A major breakthrough was when we stumbled across the idea of split proteases . In this scenario we would have a pool of pre-made enzyme present in the chassis which would be activated by the transcription and translation of a very small protease (TEV). This would act as an amplification step and maximise our output. We followed up on this idea and contacted some of the main names behind the papers, we were fortunate to build up a correspondence with Prof Neel Ghosh in particular who assured us that the kinetics of his split coiled coil protease system were adequate for our system. Whilst the mechanism of fast activation of an enzyme seemed to be taking off we needed to define the source of the coloured output.
We toyed with all sorts of possibilities; phycobilins, fluorescent proteins, but kept encountering the same problems; either the pigment was in such a form that it couldn’t easily be modified (by us e.g. tethering it to a scaffold or rendering it colourless by mutation) or the glow response was too slow. When we discovered GFP had been split we were quite confident this would be a suitable output. One main criteria for our system was a stark colourless to coloured change. It was gradually deduced that using split GFP would in fact generate too much background fluorescence such that the change would be hard to detect. This is due to intrinsic and inherent affinity that the split GFP segments have for each other- they would be in an equilibrium of intact and separate parts, which means we couldn’t use them in our system as they would fluoresce even without"

Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP."

Fitting of the figure S4 from Bonnet's paper with the model 1. The assumption is the fact that the degradation of the dimer of Bxb1 is neglected with respect to the dimerization reaction rate.
By considering reasonable order of magnitude for other parameters present in the lumped parameters, we find that the value of the dissociation constants are both of the order of 10-4. This order of magnitude is not surprising at all, as we know that the binding of integrases to DNA is very specific (which is underlined by the low value of the dissociation constant of this reaction) and that integrases are more stable as dimer than as monomer.

Diffusion Experiments
Monday, 25th August
Now that we tested the different constructs for leakiness, dose response and cross talk, we are investigating in the diffusion rate of AHL. Therefore we designed a chip with chambers connected by channels of different length (see figure). In one chamber we added a strain containing a regulator and a sensor plasmid, to the second chamber we added AHL or an AHL producer strain. As soon as AHL is diffused to the former chamber it induces sfGFP production on the sensor plasmid. The time it takes until we can measure the sfGFP signal and the length of the channel gives us information about the velocity of AHL diffusion.
PDMS millifluidic chip used for diffusion experiments
Three main experiment designs were tested and modified: the agar-design, the liquid-design and the beads-design.
For the agar-design we filled the chamber and channels with LB-agar or in a second attempt with agarose only. Subsequently, we punched a cylindric hole in each chamber. The capacities were filled with regulator/sensor strain culture or AHL/AHL producer strain culture, respectively. After 3 to 4 h at 37 °C we could observe an increase in the sfGFP signal. Since we used comparably high concentration of AHL in our first attempts, we could not detect a delayed sfGFP signal for chambers connected by a longer channel. The experiment will be repeated using lower concentrations. However, conducting the experiment using the agar-design, we encountered a"

Favorite Parts.
The iGEM Team Heidelberg 2014 had built a new biological system for the iGEM community integrating split-inteins.   Intein splicing is a natural process that excises one part of a protein and leaves the remaining parts irreversibly attached. This great function allows you to modify your protein in numerous ways.
Creating a toolbox including all great functions and possibilities of inteins, we need a new standard for the scientific world of iGEM. This standard, the RFC of the iGEM Team Heidelberg 2014, allows us to easily and modulary work with split inteins.
Our favorite Parts represent the basic constructs of our toolbox – the Assembly and the Circularization construct, which are both tested in many methods and applications.
In the following we present you BBa_K1362000 , the construct for circularization, BBa_K1362100 and BBa_K1362101 , the N- and the C-construct for assembly. Take a look and visit the Partsregistry to read the associated documentation.
Circularization Construct. BBa_K1362000
BBa_K1362000
This part is an element of the Team Heidelberg 2014 intein toolbox and can be used as described in the new RFC[i]. The purpose of this tool is to provide an easy way to circularize any linear protein. While conserving the functionality of their linear counterpart, circular proteins can be superior in terms of thermostability, resistance against chemical denaturation and protection from exopeptidases. Moreover, a circular backbone can improve in vivo stability of therapeutical proteins and peptides. Using this part, Xylanase, lambda lysozyme and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) were successfully circularized.
Assembly Constructs. BBa_K1362100 and BBa_K1362101
BBa_K1362100
This intein assembly construct is part of our strategy for cloning with split inteins. Inteins are naturally occuring peptide sequences that splice out of a precursor protein and attach the remaining ends together to form a new protein. When splitting those intein sequence into an N-terminal and a C-terminal split intein one is left with a powerful tool to post-translationally modify whole proteins on the amino-acid sequence level. This construct was designed to express any protein of interest fused to the Nostoc punctiforme DnaE N-terminal split inte"

 Enhanced mechanosensitivity by gas vesicles expressed in mammalian cells
Addition of synthetic lipid microbubbles improved the responsiveness of cells to low-power ultrasound.
Gas vesicle-forming proteins were expressed in mammalian cells where they improved sensitivity of cells to ultrasound.
Combination of the ectopic expression of the mechanosensing bacterial channel MscS and gas vesicle-forming proteins sensitized cells to mechanical stimulation.
 
For activation of mechanoreceptors TRPC1 or MscS, a high-power ultrasound wave (900 Vpp) is required. Our aim was to improve responsiveness of cells to respond to the lower power of ultrasound as this would increase the selectivity, avoiding stimulation of endogenous channels and prevent cell damage. We decided to test gas-filled lipid microbubbles, since it has been reported that microbubbles can amplify the ultrasonic signal

.
Further explanation ...
Microbubbles are small gas-filled lipid vesicles which are used as contrast agents in medicine. Their size is in the range of micrometers. They work by resonating in an ultrasound beam, rapidly contracting and expanding in response to the pressure changes of the sound wave

Synthetic lipid microbubbles.
(A) Schematic of a cell with an increased sensitivity to ultrasound stimulation in the presence of microbubbles. When exposed to mechanical stimuli the microbubbles contract and expand, resulting in activation of mechanosensitive channels on the cell membrane.                                                 (B) Mixed size distribution of lipid microbubbles was obtained. Stabilized lipid microbubbles were prepared by sonication and detected by microscopy.
Properties of microbubbles for example rigidity, are affected by the composition of the lipid membrane and the gas core. We prepared our lipid microbubbles from a mixture of DSPC:DSPE. Before sonication we added gas perfluorohexane (as described in the Protocols section), which facilitates compression and expansion of the microbubbles upon ultrasound stimulation (

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,". Dr. Peters from the VU medical center expects that as soon as the dominating bacterial strain is exterminated, other bacteria may become dominant. Thus, to effectively and permanently sterilize a wound, continuous adaptation of the medication may be vital. This would be achieved through the integration of a quorum sensing construct which regulates the production and secretion of a variety of bacteriocins.
A second argument for the integration of sensor, was provided by the burn wound specialists we talked to in the Maasstad Hospital burn wound center. Current diagnostic techniques require cultivation of a wound sample.  In the approximately four days taken by the diagnostic process, severe burn wounds are treated with systemic antibiotics. This procedure contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance, and, worse, is not always effective. By equipping our gel with a sensing system and a wide variety of bacteriocins against bacteria commonly found on (burn) wounds, we can avoid the diagnostics period. Instead, we will produce the appropriate medication on the spot, tailored to the patient, before a medical doctor could have made the correct diagnosis. This way, we make optimal use of the living bacteria we integrate into our hydrogel. Eventually, quorum sensing may also be adopted to prevent overcrowding of the gel and infiltration by foreign bacteria.
To regulate the production and secretion of our bacteriocins, we may use quorum sensing (QS). This is a microbial communication system based on chemical signaling pathways essential for survival in hostile environments. Intercellular signaling pathways regulate metabolism, growth, biofilm formation and other essential functions. Once reaching a biochemical threshold, a quorum sensing cascade may be activated, which regulates the activity of certain genes (42). We will benefit from QS pathways by regulating each effector gene by a quorum sensing construct.
Below we propose two example QS systems we could use as inspiration to regulate the secretion of lysostaphin and pyocin S5. Before implementing them, we will however need to review two aspects. Generally, when testing a QS-system, we must be aware of crosstalk. When different bacterial strains establish a co-culture, their QS systems may intervene. Receptors may be sensitive not only to the targeted ligand, but also to ligands of closely related strains (43). It will thus be important to check our sensing system only responds to the targeted malignant strains, and not to related benign strains.
Furthermore, we may want to consider the use of an irreversibly activated promotor or a transient promotor with a long persistency. Usually, QS-regulated promotors get activated once the ligand threshold is reached (43). This"

Genomic DNA of cultured Plasmodia
Our primers were first established with synthetic DNA templates. Apart from that we urged to figure out if our primers work for the detection of real Plasmodium DNA. We did not want to work with the parasite itself to exclude the risk of infection. This is why we reached out to laboratories who work with cultured Plasmodium who could provide us extracted DNA that we could use for our experiments. This led to collaborations with the Center of Infectiology and Parasitology in Heidelberg (AG Portugal) and the Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of Tuebingen (AG Kreidenweiss) who provided us genomic DNA of their cultured Plasmodium strains."

Group 5 - Enzymatic activity and Sporeshampoo
The focus of this group lays on the confirmation of the enzymatic activity of our spores. To show that the GST is correctly expressed by the spores a GST-assay is adjusted to the use in a plate reader. Another application of the spores would be for a (anti-dandruff) shampoo, so this is tested by washing a GFP-coated surface with different detergents and our construct and measuring the fluorescence.

Cochlear implant: Only for patients with neural residue; high cost; long-term risk (damage for different hearing frequency range, especially for frequency below 1000Hz)
Medication: Normally use traditional Chinese medicine; long treatment cycle; unclear mechanisms; less effects, only used for short-period hearing loss.
Operation: Not recommended. Less effects; high risk; high cost; potential to cause sequela.
Thus, we started to think that we can use genetic methods to change mini-structures on ear cells to see whether there may be effects expected to shade light on several kinds of hearing problems in future.
Objectives
Our Human Practice plan set out 3 central objectives:
Improve awareness and understanding of Hearing loss
We educated people with synthetic biology concepts in a multi-dimensional manner. We are well aware of that education is the only way for us to try to change the life for children living in hunger and poverty. We taught pupils and middle school students in rural areas about synthetic biology, iGEM and our project. We hope our teaser of the world well beyond the boundaries of China may give them the power and vision to fight for a better life.
Our team member Zhenming Yu is teaching synthetic biology and iGEM to students in Liangshan, Sichuan.
We also gave lectures to high school students attending Summer Camp in SUSTech.
Investigate social reality of Hearing loss
After learning from many specialists, we designed and distributed questionnaires and booklets for investigation, spread, science popularization and call on awareness, which addressed the importance of our project.
More importantly, we tried to organize commonweal activities and cooperate with accessibility smartphone app developers to further improve our human practice.
Our collaboration with the developers of the accessibility app ""Deaflife""
Increase our own social reach and personal values
By organizing our Human Practice activities, we harvested new knowledge, which played crucial roles in improving ourselves as well as our project. Furthermore, we spare no effort enhancing the social awareness on the caring of people with hearing loss from different aspects. We hope that we"

Clearly the results indicate that no activator was made.  However, because it took a long time to set up the apparatus before imaging, it is quite possible that some bands were missed.  Will re-run this gel once more.
**Mistakenly ran a gel of the promoters in place of the activators.  How foolish!!!  Will definitely have to run another gel for the activators separately.  Note that the results we saw for this gel are basically identical to those observed for the promoters previously.

Under århundraden trodde alkemister på existensen av de vises sten, en mystisk substans som inte bara skulle kunna omvandla oädla metaller till ädla, som silver och guld, utan även kunde uppfylla mänsklighetens yttersta önskningar: föryngring och odödlighet!
Trots att de vises sten aldrig funnits så har jakten på den drivit alkemister att testa otaliga ämnen och deras interaktioner i sina laboratorier, och på så vis bygga upp en gedigen kunskap som numera återfinns i vetenskaper som kemi, metallurgi och farmakologi .
I tjugohundratalets forskningsdrivna värld har vår tro på de vises sten bleknat. Trots det är vi, nu som alltid, fortfarande på jakt efter lösningar som inte bara kan hjälpa människan att leva länge och sundare, utan också att hitta lösningar på dom ekologiska problem som vi själva har förorsakat. I motsats till tidigare tror vi emellertid numera inte på att leta efter magiska ämnen gömda någonstans i naturen, utan att vi istället skall låta oss inspireras av naturen och på det sättet skapa nya verktyg för att aktivt ta itu med utmaningarna i vårt samhälle.
Låt oss ta dig med på en resa där du kommer att möta en ny klass av molekyler som har potential att revolutionera syntetisk biologi: icke-ribosomala peptid syntetaser . Vi kommer att lära dig hur man frigör deras enorma potential för att generera helt syntetiska peptider med specialanpassade funktioner, t.ex. för återvinning av guld från elektroskrot .

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," and co-construction processes. For example, how to distinguish the “Synthia” project from the Venter Institute, the bacteria which is not yet materially designed but already patented, from the question of the artificial life and the theme of intellectual property?
Social and technical stakes are also commonly involved in the necessity to define who is going to have decision making power in the field. What position will be obtained for the one who succeeds in the decision on standards? What dynamic permitted Venter and his Institute to be a major actor in the field of synthetic biology if it isn't by his participation in the race of the Human Genome Project? Both elements have to be regarded together, as in biosecurity and biosafety concerns and proposals : technical, legal, institutional, etc.
However, asking “who decides?” is nonsense if we do not, in the same way, talk about the people and practices concerned and involved in the decision and its consequences : practitioners, students, patients, States, populations, etc. We hope to make something like topography of these actors.
Synthetic biology, facing these debates, both feared and loved, questioned by others field of science, non scientists, institutions, politicians, NGOs, is kind of “forced” to rule, decide and pick its practices, actors, norms, regulations. That “need” of form seems to indicate the relative youth of the field. These decisions, not yet taken, these rules not yet settled, still permit the existence of numerous divergent and conflicting initiatives. That plurality won't disappear with new regulations, but, markers of differentiations will be built and sides will have to be chosen. That youth is also visible through the nature of the stakes formulated: contemporary figures of risks, opensource's questions, DIY experimentation, etc. We will try to put into light how that youth can modify the potential development of the regulation of the field.
A. What form for what life science?
One of the most fundamental stakes about governance will be about standards. Constitution of standard is both technical and strategical for actors, by the essential part standards could play in the constitution of a community and its habits, process in production. Thus, the movement to determine norms of production will determine uses, actors who will organized themselves through it, tools (lets think about BioBrick™) and the form of the following standards (which will be build regarding the previous). Decisions about standards are strategic : the one who will succeed in imposing the norms will be a fundamental actor of the science production.
1) Why standards?
The initiative of a standardized biology can be read in numerous perspectives, answering"

     1.Training for iGEM
The iGEM program requires the interdisciplinary abilities. To approach this purpose, we designed a series of trainings including computer programming, biological experiment skills, etc. (The following photographs illustrates the process) The collegiate team from Zhejiang University provides an opportunity which shows us how the biological experiments run.
     2. Pre-research of project
We distributed questionnaires and conducted survey in order to learn about the current knowledge of local peoples towards cultural artifacts in Hangzhou. The following diagrams are analyzed by the data. According to the data, the current situation of protection and renovating towards cultural artifacts and synthetic biology does not have bright prospects. The lack of attentions in civilians can cause the enormous negative effects on research and the practical usage, so we organized a series of activities to publicize the cultural artifacts in Hangzhou, the synthetic biology.(more details in Publicity)
     3.Publicity
(1)To acquaint students synthetic biology, our team’s human practice group publicize this subject several times during the summer break in our city including the danger and benefits of transgenosis food that was familiar and relevant to the citizens.  Furthermore, we upload the basic synthetic biology knowledge in our school’s official website for months and update the latest information or the experimental knowledge at a time period.
(2)We hold a presentation in our school to introduce the iGEM to our successors. It consists that the general ideas of iGEM, the specific parts which are totally different from the biology competition in China, the judgements, also Q&A section and the advantages of taking this competition. Our team leader Andrew Luo gave an excellent lecture.
(3)As we mentioned before, to introduce local citizens the importance of cultural artifacts in this city,  we sent out the specialized post cards with 7 different kinds of landscape seals and our team seal in order to publicize our project and the local artifacts protection at the same time.

They also provided us with their own hardware and filler (Fig. 5, 6). This greatly reduced the amount of our work. We had some technical problems while building their aeration tank, and the instructor from Nanjing-China tutored us with great patience through mobile phone.

Unfortunately, their hardware is not compatible to our project. They used Bacillus subtilis as a chassis organism last year, which naturally forms biofilm. What is more, they also transformed a biofilm protein into the bacteria, so their engineering bacteria grew well on the plastic fillers. However, we used E. coli throughout our project that does not generate biofilm. As a result, our bacteria cannot attach to the fillers after 10 hours’ incubation in a shake incubator.                         Although we were not able to use the device provided by Nanjing-China to test our design in real condition, we greatly thank them for advising us on building our own hardware.

Many ideas grow better when transplanted into another mind than the one where they sprang up.
-Oliver Wendell Holmes
We collaborated with other iGEM teams in three different ways-
Wet lab work for team IISc Bangalore: Data collection for machine learning
All India iGEM Meet-up at IISER Pune
iGEM groups on social media and Whatsapp
IISc Bangalore Collaboration
Their team was trying to build a precise and time effective way to measure the cell count of yeast cultures. They wanted to collect a huge amount of data to train a ​machine learning algorithm that they had designed for counting these cells. Collecting such huge amount of data means growing hundreds of yeast cultures,collecting samples every hour and then imaging it under the microscope on hemocytometer. It is a tedious task to be done alone by a team.  Thus, with this collaboration our team was expected to generate images for the algorithm to analyze by monitoring one growth curve for Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
An introduction to machine learning that team IISc Bangalore has designed can be found here
We were asked to follow the following protocol-
Mentioned below is the protocol that we followed in which we have made certain modifications to the above protocol-
DAY 1: Primary Inoculum
In a sterile hood, inoculate a colony of ​S.cerevisiae ​in ​5 mL ​of ​YPD/YPAD​( 2 replicates).   (Since we didn’t have the lab strain of ​S.cerevisiae and this experiment needed only quantitative data for the machine learning algorithm ,we used common baker’s yeast for the culture.) Comment-This was something exciting!
Incubate the culture at ​30⁰C,​​overnight​, at ​180 RPM​.

In September, we invited some of the students, YAN Wumo, GE Qiuchen, and HAN Yutong, in The Second High School attached to Beijing Normal University (SHSBNU), who were willing to participate in the iGEM contest, to join our weekly group discussion and practice some basic molecular experiments techniques, such as plasmid extraction and gel electrophoresis. In the process, they have made great progress in gaining primary knowledge of synthetic biology, as well as in the elementary experiment manipulation. We have also motivated them to seriously consider ethic issues related to Synthetic Biology, what they could do in the future to benefit the society.

Project Description
A repressor is a protein capable of binding DNA to a specific DNA binding site called an operator. The presence of a repressor bound to an operator prevents the access of the RNA polymerase to the adjacent promoter and in turn shuts down the expression of one or several genes that are transcribed from the concerned promoter. This negative regulation is called ""repression"". The activity of a repressor can be modulated via several mechanisms; for example, a repressor can interact either with an inductor (in this case it detaches from the operator to allow transcription), or with a co-repressor (which binds to and enhances its final fixing to the operator for further decrease of the transcription).
We propose to design a system in which the transcriptional expression of a gene (or of an operon) is repressed within a given temperature range. Such a system could be used to detect whether cells have grown within a defined temperature range. It could also be used to constrain the cell viability within or outside a set temperature range.
To create the above described system, we propose to design a repressor which is present and active only within a temperature interval. How to restrict the activity of a repressor to a defined temperature range? We propose to use i) a RNA thermometer that allows the repressor translation only above a certain temperature (T1) and ii) a thermolabile repressor that would be inactivated above a given temperature (T2). With such a system, the repressor is expected to be active between T1 and T2.
Control by repression: lambda cI

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#HeavyMetals_-_-_TEXT.html," nickel sensor show a trend that differs for that of the other sensors. There is no indication for a working sensor in vivo (Figure 3 and 4). There is a fluorescence signal, but it decreases in the first five hours. After reaching a minimum the fluorescence increases slowly. Additionally, there is no difference in fluorescence as response to various nickel concentration. Nickel could influence the cells and thereby caused a precipitation, which could result in decrease of fluorescence.  With this sensor no production of sfGFP via fluorescence level change could be detected. Therefore, this sensor is not suitable for our approach. Due to this observation, no in vitro data using CFPS were taken.
To summarize
With this sensor no production of sfGFP via fluorescence level change could be detected. Therefore, this sensor is not suitable for our approach. Consequently, no in vitro tests were performed. To create a working sensor based on this concept further optimization is needed.
To summarize all
We have characterized heavy metal sensors for arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, mercury and nickel. The results for our nickel characterization indicated that the constructed nickel sensor is not suitable for our test strip. The sensors for lead and chromium showed great potential, as they showed responses to chromium or lead, but require further optimization. Copper, our new heavy metal sensor, worked as expected and was able to detect different copper concentrations. The already well-characterized sensors for arsenic and mercury were tested as well. While the arsenic sensor worked well in vivo, it requires some omptimization for the use in vitro. Mercury showed that a fully optimized sensor works very well in our in vitro system and has the potential to detect even lower concentrations than in vivo.
And what about the date rape drugs?"

SSBE conference
We were kindly invited by Prof.Maerkl (one of our advisors) to participate to the annual meeting of the Swiss Society for Biomedical Engineering (SSBE). We gave a talk there ( download the presentation) and presented a poster (download the poster ). We also met the ETH Zurich team, the other Swiss team, and discussed our respective projects. They also gave a talk.
Overnight culture of pGL4.30 backbone plasmid
Protocol: Prepare Plasmid Extraction (culture for Miniprep)
Select and number colonies on the plates.
Prepare tubes of LB medium with the correct quantity of antibiotics (100 µg/ml for Amp, Spc or chloramphenicol).
Amp can be found in the -20ºC freezer at Ecoli, labeled as ""stock"". It is 100 µg/µl, or 1000x.
The tubes to be used are the 14 ml round bottom found in front of the iGEM drawers (Falcon). Culture with cap in the first step (loose) and close to the second step after culture.
Touch each colony with a clean pipette tip and put it in a tube.
Put in incubator.
5 colonies picked from old Amp plate and added to tubes with 10 ml of LB-Amp overnight. 10 ml was actually too much.
Bioreactor: plate for light intensity test
24-well plate given to workshop (CHH) to drill the cover with holes for the LEDs and the wells with 12 mm holes.
Bioreactor: cell culture absorbance test
Absorbance of cell cultures checked with Nanodrop.

UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," our scaffold design.
Engaging with the public
The symposium emphasised the importance of engaging in multidirectional dialogue to obtain the views of the public, with Matthew Kearnes being a particularly strong advocate. The panel speculated about which interest group drives the conversation behind the viability of a synthetic biology tool, with the importance of community engagement as a recurring consideration.
The speakers touched on how saturating the general public with scientific jargon can be isolating but highlighted the need for scientists to address the natural speculation and fear that the public can have, referencing Monsanto as a case study. From there, the speakers urged our team and the audience to provide the community with appropriate channels for consultation as part of the bioethical due diligence for a project. This will give the public greater access to decisions and information about a certain technological development.
This emphasis on including the general public in conversations about synthetic biology and the development of associated technologies, struck a chord with our group. Taking this concept of transparency and greater access to information, we wrote up an article on our project for the non-profit society, Synthetic Biology Australia (SBA). We also gave presentations to academics in our school and students from an arts and social sciences background, to ensure we were presenting our idea to individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds. We also focused on engaging in open dialogue whenever we could get the chance, which meant our team was exposed to different perspectives on whether our project has a place in the wider community.
Commercialisation
Carl Stubbings, one of the panellists, also ensured that the commercial reality of science was presented in conjunction with the ‘scientist’s view’. He spoke about how any technology has to have a market need and a reason for adoption. The panel discussed how without an identifiable need in the community, even the most brilliant new technology would not be used. As a result, our team realised how important it is for scientists and engineers to go out into the community and not just look for ethical issues, but ask if people think the technology is valuable.
By highlighting the importance of a tool or product to have a defined marketplace need, the iGEM UNSW team was inspired to start looking more into the commercial viability of our scaffold system. Through our commercialisation work we were able to focus on a model enzyme pathway that would enable us to better illustrate the value our scaffold could provide to industry and research. The points brought up by Stubbings were part of the process that led us to taxol side chain synthesis, from which point we could use modelling to illustrate just how effective our scaffold could be.
Our understanding how our scaffold system would appeal to consumers was"

After 12h of cultivating the S. cerevisiae is growing quite well. There is a tendency that the brewing yeast strain 34/70 is not capable to grow sufficiently in autoclaved (e.g. proteinfree) medium. Since the 34/70 was stored at 4°C over 5 days, directly used to inoculate the medium (no preparatory culture) and we only used 1ml to inoculate with (compared to 5ml of the preparatory culture of S. cerevisiae - because of obvious differences in opacity of the inoculation media) there is not yet a conclusion to be drawn. We decided to incubate for another 24h at least.

Macquarie_Australia,2016,Team:Macquarie Australia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," modified E. coli from ultraviolet radiation UV A, B and C rays.
The inside of the Perspex layer was laminated with clear Mylar on the sides and aluminised Mylar on the roof and base. Aluminised Mylar was used to reflect the light back through the cells allowing them a second chance to absorb the desired wavelengths. Mylar was used as a key material as it provides a smooth internal lining for the tank, making it harder for the cells to adhere to the sides thus decreasing the risk of biofilm formation.
Waste and Refill
It was important for us to keep in mind that everyday people are not trained to handle bacterial cells and that it's more than likely they will be in a less than sterile environment when handling the cells. This led to the design of 2 main features that permit the user to replace their cells and media without the need for manual handling.
The first is a detachable autoclave that is powered by a Fresnel lens. When it is time to change the cells you simply attach the autoclave drainage pipe to the bottom of the bio-chamber and drain the contents inside.
The second is a refill system which consists of sterilised media (LB and other essential nutrients) and our freeze dried E. coli cells. The refill system simply screws into the top of the bio-chamber which causes the primary and secondary seals to break, releasing the new cells into the bio-chamber and suspending them in media.

The Aachen 2017 team was trying to collect Na + efficiently in their previous project, but because there was no assay method or detailed data on the Wiki, we contacted them and asked for advice via e-mail.
We were worried about how to measure the amount of Na + uptake of yeast, so team Aachen suggested their assay method. Their method was to cultivate yeast in a salt-containing medium and measure 1 or 2 ml of the separated supernatant after several hours in the culture.
Unfortunately, their method requires expensive equipment so we couldn't use the method directly but referred to it for the last assay. Furthermore, according to their modeling, they advised that the peak of Na + absorption by yeast is 6 hours, and advised to divide measurements by the culture OD in order to measure uptake between different yeast strains. Their mentoring was truly encouraging and helpful. Thanks to their help, we were able to launch an improved project.

3) 6th Asia Pasific conference
We went to Taiwan and attended the 6th Asia Conference. We were very inspired by the presentations and posters from teams all over Asia. Also, it was good practice for us our own presentation and poster. At the conference, other iGEMers gave us valuable advice on our projects which was very helpful. After the conference, we have continued to exchanged opinions through SNS.
4) Meetup with Gifu
We met up with Ryo Niwa, Leader of Team Gifu, who came to visit us in Kyoto. We discussed the current situation of Japanese iGEM teams and shared detailed progress of our projects. We discussed how to meet the criteria and gave advice to each other. In addition, we informed him about how we secured lab space and how we are conducting experiments. Ryo also advised us that an important point to make an iGEM project successful is to take in adequate food and sleep. There are very few teams in Japan, but we encouraged each other to do our best. It was a very unique and meaningful meetup.

Fermentation is carried out under two conditions. In this first phase growth is carried out as a batch until  glucose is depleted, and will take approximately 13 [h]. After which, cells will be grown to high densities in a   fed-batch. One hindrance for accumulation of high biomass concentrations is the formation of inhibitors as   acetate. By restricting the carbon source this formation can be reduced greatly, which can be viewed in   figure 5. The figure describes the experimental results presented in the research paper used for estimates.   The inoculum is scale linearly as in the case of the substrate. Therefore the same cell concentration is kept   and the time will not be affected. The fed-batch and induction will be discussed further below. Reference: L. Yee and H. W. Blanch.

We linked BBa_K1755301 into pSB1C3 and transformed the new plasmid into E.coli BL-21. Then we detected the concentration of riboflavin through measuring the absorbance under 444nm and found that riboflavin production basically response to the change of metal ion concentration as it present a linear relationship with Cu2+  concentration, which indicated that BBa_K1755301 can work as we anticipated.

We connected BBa_K190024""CueO+RBS"", as a, with BBa_1755002""ribB CDS+B0014""to get BBa_K1755302.  The former part is a sensor and the latter is a reporter.
1.2.2  How does it work
CueO can express periplasmic copper-binding proteins, CueO , a multi-copper oxidase for detoxification[1], which belongs to CueR Regulon gene and can be regulated by copper-responsive transcription factor CueR, too. CueO can oxidate Cu+ to Cu2+ and decrease the toxicity of copper[3, 4]. On the CueO promoter, CueR protectes -41 to -17 on top strand and -42 to -19 on bottom strand to repress the expression of CueO[1]. And it can be derepressed by Cu2+, too. So the CueO promoter can sense the concentration of copper and linkage it with the production of riboflavin.

Public Engagement
Tec-Chihuahua strongly believes that what´s most important about a project rather than the lab results, it is how transcendent it can be at the local, national and international aspect. None of the work is fully complete until results are shared and explained. Nevertheless, in Mexico, for people to understand the impact and benefit of our project, the society must first be aware of what biotechnology and synthetic biology are. Therefore, our public engagement consists in giving outreach about these subjects at everyone's understanding; looking to boost or initiate discussions within the public in general. To achieve these Tec-Chihuahua worked intensely on two projects.
TecChMUN
TecChMun is a national event organized by a student group of the same name and takes place inside the facilities of the Tecnológico de Monterrey at Chihuahua, Mexico. This edition, the event is celebrating its 20th anniversary and, with the intention to have a more realistic approach, it has combined forces with iGEM´s Tec-Chihuahua to seek realistic, innovative perspectives for problem-solving.
Mission
The student group of TecChMun from Prepatec Campus Chihuahua, together with the support and collaboration of professors, iGEM´s Tec-Chihuahua and executives, focuses on the simulation of a United Nations model for students to roleplay delegates of different countries at UN committees while addressing current problems. The group seeks to promote problems solving techniques among participants through the simulations within the model that subsequently generate sensitivity and empathy for the daily problems they face in their life. At the same time, we intend to create global awareness in them.
Objective
To conclude in a realistic and efficient resolution of one of the presented conflicts in order to create awareness among participants making them agents of change.
Who is it for?
The people we seek to impact are mainly students in the third and fifth semesters of high school. However, as part of the 10th anniversary, we are looking"

It appears that there is very little difference in changes in FURt and iron (II) ion concentrations. We tested many ranges and values, but nothing gave any sensitivity unless it was unrealistically extreme (and certainly not in the range of values we could use for FURt and we would test for Fe).
However, it did point something out to us that we had not considered before: the RNA polymerase does not transcribe plasmid 1 then plasmid 2 - it does them both at the same time. This is shown by the amilCP mRNA concentration graph. Because there is no LacI present, there is nothing inhibiting the transcription of mRNA so it is transcribed very quickly. Then, as LacI concentration builds up, it inhibits amilCP mRNA transcription more and more until transcription is equal to degradation (turning point). As transcription inhibition continues to increase, there is a net decrease in amilCP mRNA concentration.
Although our model is testing in vitro values, it appears that the lack of sensitivity is shown in our in vivo lab work too, suggesting it is not necessarily a mistake in the model, but rather a problem with our construct. That being said, we contemplated the idea that there was something wrong with the model, so we checked back over the constants to confirm their values. After clarifying them, we decided to try a different code.
Euler Method
We programmed our own ODE function using the the Euler method instead of using MatLab's preset ODE function to see if that made a difference. MatLab uses an iterative method to find each value of the amilCP after a small time period dt, then repeat up until a specified tmax This is the code we made to represent this model:

Glasgow,2014,Team:Glasgow#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," by an average sized desalination plant can range from £1500 to £3100 and for a similar sized plant to do the same but by using membrane technology it would cost £750 to £2575. A slightly cheaper alternative as opposed to desalinating seawater is desalinating brackish water which contains less salt. But however, this is still costly.
We surveyed public opinion about Synthetic Biology and its possible use in desalination at a number of events. The results are summarised below.
Along with asking individuals about their opinion on the use of GMO, we asked them about their level of knowledge of synthetic biology. 58% of individuals rated their knowledge of synthetic biology as a 3 or less, on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 1 being never have heard of the term and 10 being have a PhD in it). This correlates with comments from these individuals that they felt they didn’t know enough to make a decision on the subject. There was also comments raised about moral and ethical issues with GMO i.e. that we shouldn’t be messing with organisms like this. Although participants of this survey appeared to understand why we would use GMO as a way to feed the worlds’ increasing population.
Agriculture
87% of the worlds’ freshwater supply is used in agriculture. This is rather essential especially in dry areas where without the human intervention of watering the crops, they would not survive in these environments.
Individuals appeared to be more agreeable to the use of water cleaned by bacteria for agricultural purposes.
Drinking Water
When asked about how they felt drinking water cleaned by bacteria, individuals were unsure about it. If the water were to be used for drinking purposes, the water would have to be cleaned to a higher specification. The lack of certainty among individuals seemed to be on the whole attributed to lack of information and knowledge about GMO and synthetic biology. Another determining factor appeared to be that the level of efficiency will be the same as that of current methods.
Household
Every individual in the UK uses on average 150 litres of water per day, with only 4% of this being used for drinking water. Therefore, every day each person in the UK uses 144 litres of water for other household uses. This includes activities such as showering, clothes washing and flushing the toilet. To put this in perspective, the average individual uses 52, 560 litres of water per year. So on average the UK population would at an estimate consume 23.4 billion litres of water on household uses per year.
Considering that only 11% individuals disagreed with the use of bacteria"

4 of the 5 enzymes are not well characterised before, so we could't find enough kinetic data from the literature. The only well-characterised PUR degradation enzyme PudA is used in the model as an illustration of all PUR degradation enzymes. The model will be more complete when the kinetic data of the other enzymes are defined. The finished PUR degradation model is shown as below:
There are two compartments which represents cells and the culture from left to right. The ""cell"" compartment contains the gene expression module whereas the ""culture"" compartment contains the degradation module. The ""secretion"" block that connects two compartments is the secretion module.

WHO ARE WE?
Welcome! We are Iowa’s 2018 iGEM Team – a group of 12 undergraduate students at the University of Iowa,             pursuing studies from a variety of disciplines, including biology, engineering, anthropology, chemistry and more.             We have come together to compete in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition.             We are a second year team from the University of Iowa who are excited to compete in this world renowned synthetic biology             competition.
Although we are working with faculty advisers from four different departments here at UI, this project             is primarily student-driven and will demonstrate the excellence of Iowa research and the potential of             Iowa undergraduates on an international scale.
About the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition
iGEM is an international synthetic biology competition where student teams, from across the world, work             during the summer to build a microbe that carries out some sort of ‘programmed’ function (something that the             specific microbe would not normally be able to do). iGEM was founded at MIT in 2003. Last year, 340 teams from             around the world entered the competition, creating microbes that can sense atmospheric carbon monoxide, clean             up wine stains, convert sugar into biofuels or medicines, and much more. These teams ranged from Pakistan,             Kenya, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and dozens of other countries. Last year, the competition expanded to Iowa – we             had the first team to ever compete in this competition from the state. Teams and projects are entirely             student-initiated and driven, and the tasks that students undertake gives undergraduates the chance to explore             synthetic biology through independent research. The competition provides students with an opportunity to             develop academic and organizational skills and promotes the values of integrity, good sportsmanship, respect,             honesty, celebration, cooperation, effort, and excellence.
About Synthetic Biology
Synthetic biology is a maturing scientific discipline that combines science and engineering to design and             build novel biological functions and systems. This includes the design and construction"

The amount of great iGEM projects through time shows how important it is to work together and use previous projects and ideas to make new projects. This is exactly why it is a gold medal requirement to help another iGEM team, and why we have talked to a lot of other iGEM teams about our own and their ideas. To this end we have chosen to help two other iGEM teams with their projects. We attended a meet-up in London on the 1st and 2nd of September with a lot of UK iGEM teams and it was great to finally meet some of the other teams in the iGEM competition. This YSB (""Young Synthetic Biologists"") meet-up was organized by SynBioSoc, supported by the Wellcome Trust and UCL and we want to thank them for allowing us to participate as the only non-UK team. We received important feedback on our project, poster and presentation and it was interesting to hear what the other teams had been doing. Our collaborations with other teams can be seen below.
