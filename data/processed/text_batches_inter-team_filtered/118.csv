UNITN-Trento,2012,Team:UNITN-Trento#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"etic acid at 1:1:1 ratio. When heated at 90 degrees Celsius the color changes to a pink/purple in about 2 minutes; the more intense the more Cysteine there is.
My first try is after 4h of induction, using 1025, 1035 and empty NEB10b. After 10 minutes only one sample is intensely pink.
From our understanding of the pathway, only 1035 in MOPS A (with glycerol) should be induced. We make this assumption and joy. But, turns out it was 1025 in MOPS B (with Glucose). We begin to ponder, and come to the conclusion that our assumption was obviously wrong. The induction in glycerol or the absence of glucose alone provides the cell the ability to highly express the protein, which may impair growth (as growth curves suggest). The higher OD in glucose, in      contrast, could be the cause of the pink color of cultures in it: the basal transcription or the one not favored by glucose presence might be sufficient to produce enough Cys. I should investigate more and retry the test on the cells left to grow overnight.
The results the day after seem confirming our hypothesis: the lighter pink is the induced culture in 1035, the other follow.
Another attempt to get the Gibson’s to work: I try to add DpnI to the PCR products already made last time, then purify and use the Master Mix and so on as before.
We were planning to run a modified TSI assay, so I adapted the normal TSI recipe to our MOPS medium. It should allow us to see the characteristic black spots of the sulphate reducing bacteria! I also transformed a plasmid with superfolder GFP under the control of pBAD promoter, to see if there is some basal expression since I wasn't able to see any signal at the fluorimeter with the normal GFPmut3b. With maximum sensibility I still had no significant signal: I'm pretty confident that if there is basal expression, it's really low!      Turned out that lots of transformations are contaminated, so we took every precaution throwing away our competent cells: me and Giacomo headed to the research centre to make some new ones.
Contamination continues to persecute us: this is the plates’ turn. And of course I threw away my ligation product of K731660 again; as it was not a priority I decided to stop trying to construct this part, maybe I will start from the beginning in the future if I have had time.

Value proposition
Antibiotic resistance among pathogens causing life threatening infections is rapidly increasing. Ineffective antibiotic treatments are in the worst case detrimental. The rapid detection of, for example, MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in hospitals is essential to guide crucial decision-making. For the patient this means a safe treatment and healthy hospital environment. Hospitals have to be enabled to fight the challenges MRSA poses. Even in the case of a more innocent bladder infection, on-site disclosure of viral or bacterial pathogens can be very beneficial to avoid the frustration of patients, that typically comes with missing treatment success. By rapidly and simply detecting genetic material of pathogens, such generic problems can be solved.  However, current detection methods for viral infections require highly specialized equipment and trained personnel and cannot be used in case of emergencies. In addition, these methods are time consuming and often indirect via antigens. An indirect detection is the distinguishment between for example viral infections caused by the Zika and Dengue virus ( Trafton 2017 ; Grandien 1996 ). CINDY Seq is the direct RNA-based detection tool that offers a solution for rapid, cheap and direct detection of genetic material. This allows to detect potential pathogens which have not caused an immune response yet. Patient treatment can thus begin already during the incubation period of the pathogen. CINDY Seq saves time and enables users such as doctors to provide rapid and specific service. It facilitates ad-hoc decision-making and reduces costs on ineffective treatments and complicated protocols for detection. Therefore we aim to develop CINDY Seq as a versatile detection tool for relevant genetic material and expanding the impact beyond the scope of this iGEM project.
Market analysis
The worldwide market of in vitro diagnostics (IVD) is predicted to grow 5,3% annually until 2021 ( Mordor intelligence ). This amounts to a net increase in market value of more than 22 billion dollars ( Mordor intelligence ). The specific market segments we are addressing are molecular tests for infectious diseases as well as microbial and viral tests. These market segments are expected to grow above average compared to the overall IVD market growth, where molecular test for infectious diseases experience vastest growth of up to 9% annually ( Kalorama information ). Generally the profitability of players in the molecular diagnostics field lies between 15 and 20% ( Roche Half Year report 2017 ). The key factors to successfully enter the IVD market are the integration of our unique technique within other techniques, and its capability for rapid and versatile diagnosis at the molecular level"
TrinityCollegeDublin,2015,Team:TrinityCollegeDublin#Malaria_-_-_TEXT.html,".” “…Sanofi is a European company so it’s easier for them to make SSA even if it’s expensive but we felt this can be done faster and cheaper especially in factories in India and China, …50% of what Sanofi charges.
Having also interviewed Chris Paddon, who was project leader for the semi-synthetic artemisinin project at Amyris, we got to know of the importance artemisinin has on the fight against malaria:
Artemisinin is the only available, effective, relatively cheap, antimalarial. Given in combination with other antimalarials for 3 days. At the moment there is nothing close that can take its place. Hopefully there will be further developments in the fermentation and the chemistry and the supply chain in the next decade.
He also commented on the significance of trying to get E.coli to produce precursors of artemisinin as it has previously been unsuccessful due to limited technology/information available at the time:
Artemisinin is a medicine for the developing world so we had to develop a highly efficient process. We took the knowledge that had been gained of Artemisia… and assembled all of this knowledge into E.coli but that proved to be untenable so we moved it into yeast.
E.coli grows faster and if you can get the dehydrogenases to get working you may be able to produce artemisinic acid in ways that yeast cannot. So any results that you guys generate will be useful.
Current statistics on Malaria control and prevention: The current package of core interventions – namely, vector control, chemoprevention, diagnostic testing and treatment – has proved to be highly cost-effective and needs to be further expanded in order to save more lives. During the past 10 years, vector control interventions increased substantially in Africa.
In 2013, 392 million ACT courses were acquired by the public and private sectors in endemic countries – up from just 11 million in 2005. In 2014, approximately 214 million long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) were delivered to endemic countries, a main escalation from the 70 million bed nets that were delivered in 2012. Due to such measures being taken, the malaria mortality rate was reduced globally by 47%. In the under-five age group, mortality rates have declined by 53% globally, and by 58% in Africa.  Initially, 55 countries were on track to reduce their malaria case incidence rates by 75%, in line with World Health Assembly and Roll Back Malaria targets for 2015. 64 countries were on track"

On Thursday June 16th, the iGEM Pasteur team attended a ""Jeu à débattre"" hosted by the association, ""arbre des connaissances"". This was a debate practice or round table discussion where several synthetic biology innovations were made available to a few villages. The inhabitants had to decide the pros and cons of acquiring them, considering environmental, economical, and health benefits. Our role was to advise the players during the game and to moderate a little debate about synthetic biology and the ethical and moral questions it raises. We also addressed patenting aspects,  as viewed from the point of view of French and US Law.

How reliable is your kill switch?
Addressing biosafety is an important issue for synthetic biologists              and concerns surrounding synthetic organisms escaping out of their controlled environment, has prompted research into novel bio-containment methods. Many iGEM teams that require their genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to be released into the wild, use kill switches (inducible genetic devices that cause cell death) to justify their projects and address concerns about the harmful effects GMOs can have in the environment. Unfortunately, kill switches are poorly categorised in the standard registry of genetic parts and there is a distinct lack of quantitative data on their suitability as bio-containment methods, thus preventing them from being used with confidence.
No containment systems created in iGEM are robust: they lack the above quantification and are mostly one mutation away from failure.
-Sara Aguiton and Claire Mayer, iGEM
Our project seeks to: investigate the efficacy and efficiency of different types of kills switch; to quantify their robustness after several generations; to compare the stability of these devices once integrated into the genome vs when carried on a plasmid.
What is a ""kill switch"" ?
Through a series of interviews and questions, we are trying to identify what really is a kill switch? What do university students understand as a kill switch and how does that compare to academics or those working in industry? The purpose of this is to elucidate whether a kill switch can reliably be used as a biosafety measure or if it is misclassified.
Human Practices
Our Human Practice section focuses on two key areas: improving public engagement and education, and equality and diversity. We hope to tackle the lack of education of synthetic biology in the UK and overseas by highlighting what a small team of university students can accomplish with limited resources and limited time. It is our hope that this would encourage larger companies and the government to invest more in synthetic biology education, seeing the potential benefits that the field can have and how it can encourage students into all core science subjects.
For public engagement and education, we are targeting both secondary school students and university level education. We want to highlight that there are potentially endless applications of the field, due to its interdisciplinary nature, as well as uncover why synthetic biology may not be as positively received as we would like.

Most of the patients are holding certain expectations for new therapies. However, obviously, aside from efforts to promote the efficacy of new therapies, the cost of drugs needs to be abridged if we expect to apply the updating research to clinical treatment, which may indicate the direction of our future work.
At the same time, we are very moved to see that, Ms. Guo, who was suffering from cancer, still concerned about the promotion of cancer therapy. Indeed, there exists criminals who exaggerate the new therapies with excessive or false propaganda, thus hampered the promotion of new therapies. We should also keep working to support the promotion of tumor therapy and the elimination of false advertising.
filter_dramaEducation and school workshop
Team NJU-China tried to introduce synthetic biology to people through various ways. This year, NJU-China planned to arouse adolescents’ interest towards this new field of science by organizing lectures for high school students. After the discussion, the students were taken on a tour to visit the laboratory. Through these activities, we successfully presented the basic information about iGEM and synthetic biology to the youth.
Figure 13. Our instructor is introducing our lab to high school students
On Aug 20th, we held a lecture to the participants of a biology summer camp held by Nanjing University, who were high school students from all over China. The presentation consisted of an introduction of iGEM, synthetic biology and our project. Most students showed strong interests in our project and iGEM. The aim of the lecture was to let students have better understanding of the applications and benefits of synthetic biology. We believe that giving presentation about iGEM to high school students, we, college students as well as iGEMers, can inspire them to think deeper about how synthetic biology can change our lives. After the talk, the students were taken on a tour to visit the laboratory where our experiments were taken.

Modeling yet to be done
The overall goal of modeling the system would comprise of the following: a fully developed kinetic model of the system starting from initiation  of radiative exposure to the cleavage of catechol or x-gal and the subsequent expression of  color.  With a fully developed model and known data from testing, future devices could be made with varying sensitivities, which could be accomplished through varying the RBS strengths of the Pr promoter.

Bacterial Dosimeter Cost Analysis
The purpose of this report is to emphasis the monetary cost per device that it would cost to produce such a device for sale and compare against major competitors already in the market of selling dosimeters.
When buying our bacterial dosimeter, there are two kinds of cost associated with the device: fixed cost and variable costs. The fixed cost occurs when buying the tray because the tray can be used over and over again with a new tray put in after every use. The variable costs are the cost associated with buying the individual trays per use. Additionally, the cost of catechol must be factored into the equation because it is required to show the results of the dosimeter.
Equation 1: Cost on User for Using our Bacterial Dosimeter to Detect Radiation
Cdosimeter = Ccase + ( N*Ctray) + Ccatechol
Cdosimeter = Cost per Bacterial Dosimeter Ctray = Cost per Tray Ccase = Cost per Case N = Number of Trays Ccatechol= cost of catechol per use
Equation 2: Cost of building each individual Case in the Dosimeter
Ccase = V*Cplastic
Cplastic= Cost per cubic meter of plastic V = Volume of Plastic
Equation 3: Cost of building each individual tray in the dosimeter.
Ctray = Cecoli + Cgellan + Cplastic
Cecoli = Cost of Growing the Bacteria Cgellan= Cost of Phytagel™
Taking the price of the gellan gum (PHYTAGEL™) in bulk, the average cost would be that of $1,003.20 USD for 5kg of powder.  At this price, it would cost approximately Considering that the dimensions for one sheet of gellan gum in our model has the dimensions of 0.035m x"

Measurement
There have been a huge amount of repressive parts available in iGEM parts registry. However, no matter how much efforts you made to create approximately the same conditions using the information given by the literature to test these parts, there is still an unignorable difference in efficiency between tested parts and the parts described in the literature, due to the inevitable difference of cultivate conditions, equipments and so on. Therefore, there is a huge need to create a global standard to normalize all the data created from different labs on the earth.
Especially for those repressive parts using fluorescent proteins such as GFP as expression level readout, the better the repressor performs, the weaker it is for us to observe the fluorescence strength. Hence larger experimental errors may occur. Although every team will use their own relevant control groups to test their parts, we still lack a control group as a global standardization to help us visualize the difference in the performance of these repressive parts. Simply speaking, even the smallest differentiations such as different promoters or RBS (Ribosome binding site), will have a huge affect to the result of the fluorescence detection. Considering high similarity between synthetic biology and engineering, a unified standard is of great importance to be established.
In fact, we have already had a very standard and globalized measurement instrument —— InterLab. iGEM has been pursuing InterLab experiment for decades, yet few teams have used InterLab data properly. The experiment plasmids offered by InterLab has provided an excellent control group for GFP, hence the expression strength of experiment plasmids under different living conditions can be roughly classified by expressing standard InterLab plasmids with different strength.Since the InterLab control system has been standardized to all iGEM labs around the world, different labs can use this system as well, to have an accurate comparison about the strength of the same or even different expression systems.
For our optimized repressive part pT181, when we tried to compare it to the previous version submitted by team Kyoto, it was unavailable for us to learn what they had used as control group to test the inhibitory effect of their version. Hence we were unable"

CAROLINA ELIZONDO
We are sincerely thankful to Carolina for being our mentor. She has helped us in many things like troubleshooting our results, finalizing our project idea, preparing our presentation for the Giant Jamboree  and so on. Thank god for Skype and Gmail, we were showered with her constant care and support. We are definitely looking forward to meeting her at Boston.
SHREENIDHI K.S.
As our advisor, Shreenidhi was responsible for giving the day to day instructions to the team along with keeping a check on the work done. We also called her a walking calendar because she was the one most responsible one amongst all of us who reminded us of the deadlines and made sure that we stayed on track.
SRIRAM KUMAR
Also an advisor, Sriram mainly dealt with trouble shooting our results during the course of the project (hence called the handy-man of the team). He was also responsible for some serious brainstorming sessions that helped us to eventually finalize our project idea.
WETLAB
Although all of us worked hard day and night to complete  our project,  Vijay, Shravan and Sai Shyam were in charge of planning the work schedules well ahead and ensuring that everything runs smoothly. Rakshana and Roja on the other hand never failed to ensure that we were all adhering to the lab rules. They made sure that the lab was always kept tidy.
HUMAN PRACTICES
The human practices team was led by Preethi who diligently worked hard herself but made sure that the other HP team members - Akash, Ramya , Srimathi,  Veenah, Marcia and Nishka worked even harder. They were responsible for organising  Biofair and various workshops that helped spread awareness about iGEM, synthetic biology and our project. Apart from this, this team also managed the collaborations.
INTERLAB STUDIES
Completing our inter lab study was not an easy task. The perseverance of Sreya, Ashwin, Saranya and Vasavi helped us finish and submit our results on time. They were in-charge  of managing the inter lab studies and worked very hard, never once minding the stone wall that they kept encountering again and again.

Degradation and Dilution
The concentrations of each species in the  model is affected by it’s degradation (inherent to the molecule) and dilution  (due to cell growth). While these processes are completely unrelated, they have  the same net effect: Decreasing the concentration of the species[7]. Therefore,  we represent the two rates as a combined degradation/dilution parameter in our  model. The promotor of hox gene is constitutive, so we assume only the  degradation/dilution of Gfp mRNA and Gfp.

Thursday, 15 September 2011
Lilia prepared pSB1C3 backbone from distribution KitPlate in linearised form and also transformed it DH5alpha. If the transformation works, minipreps on pSB1C3 will be done tomorrow.
4x1L of LB-agar were prepared and should be autoclaved by tomorrow in AI. LB-kanamycin plates are ready and will be brought to BM.
Nadine tested 5 colonies on each Gibson assembly plate, but with no results... So Gibson need to be done again, this time purifying the TetRs before. She also digested the Plac biobrick fragment with EcoRI and PstI.
Friday, 16 September 2011
Lilia made colony PCR on muTetR variants from the 2nd batch of biobricking: TetR_Biobrick_f &_n primers and EPFL taq polymerase were used.
The same PCR on plasmids from the first batch of biobricked mutants gave an unexpected band at higher MW than what was expected. Same for each of five mutants.
The pSB1C3 biobrick backbone was linearized by PCR with the pSB_prep_2Eb and pSB_prep_3P-1 primers, but the PCR failed - there is no plasmid band in the second well on the gel. It was also transformed into DH5alpha on CM LB-agar plate, but that failed because pSB1C3 in incompatible with DH5alpha cells.
Nadine ligated the Plac biobrick into pSB1C3 and transformed. She also purified the TetR genes with Gibson extensions, sending them for sequencing after having done a new Gibson reaction. The Gibson reactions were also transformed, hoping that this time it will work.
Second attempt to PCR tetR mutants with BioBrick primers yield in PCR product for all the mutants we have:
We will now digest and ligate it to the pSB1C3 backbone!
Saturday, 17 September 2011
Nadine made colony PCRs on the Gibson assemblies with TetR mutants and on Plac-biobrick ligations. For the Plac-biobrick, all the 5 colonies tested seem to have the Plac insert.
Doug made all the graphs of Nadine's platereader experiments. We still have some platereaders left to do: J61002 Ptet-RFP wil be done tomorrow and hopefully the TetR mutants"

What can we learn from the interactions between iGEM teams and the public?
Since the beginning of this century the public is more and more involved in the innovation of emerging technologies. Organisations organise for example public debates, science cafés and focus groups (Veen, te Molder, Gremmen, & van Woerkum, 2012).  Public engagement is seen as a way to increase trust in science (Dijkstra & Gutteling, 2012) and as a way to decrease public’s exaggerated hopes and fears of emerging technologies like synthetic biology (Schmidt et al., 2009). To improve the interaction between scientists and the public several studies are conducted to understand how scientists see the relation with the public. Results show that scientists still talk about one-way communication, not about dialogues (Cook, Pieri, & Robbins, 2004; Davies, 2008). Studies also show that scientists appreciate the opinion of non-scientists but still prioritize scientific information (Mogendorff, te Molder, Gremmen, & van Woerkum, 2012; Motion & Doolin, 2007).
Scientists are concerned about this prioritization and argue that the concerns of the public about impacts of the emerging technologies are not discussed when talking about the technology. There is only attention for the objective, neutral and factual or “hard” impacts (Swierstra & te Molder"
Groningen,2017,Team:Groningen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," for using the system to obtain new spacers. However, without pre-programming the reporter with complementary spacers, there won't be a change in fluorescence. Future experiments could be incorporating this with the tracrRNA production and/or a signal sequence. Ultimately, this would also help towards incorporating all the designed elements of this project into a single organism.
Lactis toolbox
With the lactis toolbox, we hope to increase the possibilities for iGEM teams to work with L. lactis in the future. Beside the physical additions of the new promoter, we also tried to obtain essential information on working with such an organism in situations with little experience. Most of our student team members did not have experience with it and although it is a bacterium, it behaves vastly different then a model organism like E. coli.
Construction
The first addition of this lactis toolbox is the new nisin inducible promoter in a biobrick format. The construction of this went quite fast, as a positive colony was quickly identified and the first round of sequencing analysis confirmed appropriate incorporation of the promoter. However, from there the work got a lot harder, as it involved working with the actual organism instead of L. lactis compatible DNA. There was quite a steep learning curve in techniques like transforming L. lactis and obtaining enough DNA for this procedure. This was all quite different from what we were used to. In our experience knowing all the little details of the protocol really had a large impact on our results. Even after all the practice we still had a low success rate in these transformations.
Experimental validation
Nevertheless, we obtained the biobrick for the nisin inducible promoter and we were able to validate this part by constructing an expression vector based on the native vector where the part was amplified from: pNZ8048. This native lactococcal plasmid was used as backbone to integrate the coding sequence for GFP behind the promoter. This enabled us to obtain data on its inducible character. This was done by inducing the cells with various amounts of nisin once the cells were in the exponential growth phase (OD600: 0.5-0.6). The graph below shows the expression of GFP over a time period of 6 hours. The values shown are a ratio of GFP emission over the absorbance at 600 nm to correct for varying growth rates.
This graph shows that the best expression of GFP was achieved with a nisin concentration of 45 ng/µl. Besides that the concentrations of 10 and 80 ng/µl seem to work sufficient, which suggests that there is a"

Berlin,2014,Team:Berlin#Project cn_-_-_TEXT.html," such as the Hybrid Plattform, as well as EU advisor Markus Schmidt and his Biofaction AG. Supported by the Hybrid Plattform, we organized a science and design workshop event on the 8/9.08.2014. During this event we conducted a series of short presentations about synthetic biology, as well as about prototyping and speculative design. Participants from different backgrounds designed and constructed interactions, which deal with the idea of a biological modularity. The resulting interactions addressed currently debating issues about the future of syntheic biology applications. Surpisingly the participants focused on topics like performance enhancement, transhumanism, alternative materials and housing as well as standardiziation. By explaining the basic principles of synthetic biology and approaching synthetic biology with a limited complexity synthetic biological speculation became easily accessible and reached wide variety of people.           In the beginning of September, we collaborated with the artists and scientists from the c-lab collectiv (UK) as well as the Artlaboratory - a berlin bio-arts space. In the Synthetic Biology Workshop artists and other people were introduced to synthetic biology and performed their own cloning experiment. The whole event came to an end in Berlins first Science Café event for synthetic biology organized by the iGEM Berlin Team. During this event, we had speakers from different backgrounds and we discussed chosen aspects of synthetic biology with participants openly over drinks and food. The artist Ping Lui from Cologne presented his speculative design of an oracle based on magnetotactic bacteria. Rüdiger Trojok, a infamous German biohacker presented his current project, Howard Boland shared his bioart projects and former iGEM involvement with us and Johann from our team gave a short presentation about iGEM and our project. These events were designed to have a high impact on the German understanding of synthetic biology and were a major success in Berlin.           One of the current major issues in synthetic biology is the laws and regulations concerning patents. iGEM generally refuses patents and promotes the idea of open source biology. However, as the success and applicability of synthetic biology depend on industry investments, there has to be a compromise in policy regulations. To discuss this topic in detail we teamed up with patent lawyers from the Adares Patentanwältekanzlei as well as Biocommons (Creative Commons license model for Synbio) activist Rüdiger Trojok to discuss patenting and fundamental principles of intellectual property.
In summary, we used art events and practical workshops to confront the German public with issues of synthetic biology. Furthermore, our project of creating a remote control for E. coli bears various practical"

Evry,2013,Team:Evry#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," refer to many different research activities. Nonetheless, the iGEM competition could be perceived as a dangerous path towards biotechnological alienation because its objective is to develop synthetic biology in itself: the means are the end. The usual answer to that critic highlights the fact that many propositions of iGEM teams seek to solve environmental problems or diseases: synthetic biology is not a science without conscience 3 ! Though, the goal of the competition is to develop and promote synthetic biology by fun experimentation of its possibilities. In comparison, the Solar Decathlon, an architecture competition, “challenges collegiate teams to design, build, and operate solar-powered houses that are cost-effective, energy-efficient, and attractive 4 .” Here the objective is clearly environmental and human: the technique (solar energy) is only a way to achieve it. Thus, if the iGEM competition was an architecture competition its objective would be formulated: “here are some brand new building materials whose possibilities are unknown, have fun!” Curiosity is a powerful motivation, but when dealing with unpredictable biotechnologies, first it is necessary to determine the objective we try to achieve. The intellectual process should be “we want to do that, is SynthBio a good way to succeed?” and not “could SynthBio do that?” or “let's try to make a living thing do that, it would be fun!”
It is ethically relevant, because the risk is then to create unnecessary products with uncertain biotechnology. We have to remember that we are not yet aware of all the consequences that synthetic biology could have on us and our environment. The team was confronted to this ethical problem when most of the hæmochromatosis patients who answered our survey told that they were satisfied with their treatment. We then had to ask ourself if it was really useful to research an unnecessary treatment using genetically modified bacteria that could have emerging proprieties.

For them to do well out of it, that is for the production to follow its course, another product must be produced – a product squared – and it must be inserted between the product and the human being: this product is called “need”.

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

Dr. David Lovley and Dr. Derek Walker
Making improvements on a device as complex as an MFC is not a clear-cut process. We could not test all the ideas we came up with during the brainstorming phase of our project, so we contacted an MFC expert, Dr. Lovley. Dr. Lovley was incredibly helpful and, when we explained our project ideas, he put us in contact with Dr. Walker, an ex-iGEMer himself. Part of our project originally involved expressing Geobacter sulfurreducens pilA in Shewanella oneidensis and increasing their conductivity by adding more aromatic amino acids to the structure. Dr. Walker made it clear, however, that these approaches were unlikely to be successful as there is uncharacterized missing molecular machinery to permit Geobacter PilA insertion into Shewanella and previous studies have failed to show improved conductivity with aromatic amino acids. This led us to the realization that we had to pivot, leading us to look into rMFCs and the cymA system.
Collaborations
MIT
This summer, we were mentored by the MIT iGEM team in making and using electrocompetent cells, making chemically competent cells, Golden Gate Assembly, and organization of the team. As a longstanding, experienced team, MIT has more experience in designing experiments and getting their projects from start to finish. Initially, we were struggling to get competent cells that would take up our parts. After speaking with MIT at the NEGEM meetup, they shared a useful protocol that, once used, yielded extremely competent cells that we used for the entirety of our project. In August, we were invited back to MIT, where we learned about chemically competent cells, Golden Gate Assembly, and general running of the team. We used the protocol and advice on chemically competent cells for our lambda red recombineering procedure, in which we had to transform cells multiple times with different plasmids to knockout two genes. This proved extremely important in our project as, without the knockouts, our MtrCAB system would have competed with other naturally-occurring pathways in the E. coli, decreasing its efficiency and effectiveness in the project. Additionally, MIT explained their work using the Universal Acceptor vector backbone with specifically-designed insert segments for easy assembly using Golden Gate. Although it was too late to use this for this year’s project as our parts were already ordered and partially assembled, we will be able to use this information, along"

Home-Made Cell Extract Achieves Phage Titer Comparable to the Commercial System
We determined the concentration of phages assembled in our cell extracts P15 and E10, which had the most promising   results in our cell extract quality control. We compared our extracts to the commercial extract (myTXTL) and saw a similar performance.
All in all, our extract has the same phage assembly potential as the commercial cell extract. Moreover, lyophilization, which makes   the cell extract better storable, does not reduce the efficiency of bacteriophage assembly. We concluded that phages could be assembled on site in a durable lyophilized cell extract.

Bacteriophages Can Be Assembled Independent of the Living Host
Phactory has the ability to assemble various bacteriophages, in a bacteria-independent manner. To underline this feature and demonstrate universal applicability, we assembled a variety of different E. coli phages, both DNA and RNA-based.
The successful assembly of all phages was confirmed by plaque assay and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, DNA encoding for NES and FFP phages was used to perform assembly of these phages in our cell extract. However, we were not in possession of the respective host bacterial strains and therefore could not demonstrate successful assembly.
Pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella, pseudomonas and staphylococcus are prone to develop multi-drug resistance and pose an urgent or serious threat (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013. Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance.). Therefore, to fulfill this medical need, phages specific for these bacteria should be assembled"

Overview
Biosensors are ubiquitous tools in modern life sciences. They offer a robust, rapid and cost-effective method of monitoring the presence of a target ligand through implementation of a selective recognition element and a biotransducer component that recognizes the ligand-bioreceptor interaction and subsequently generates a measurable signal. Due to the variability of both components, a huge range of biosensors with varying functionality is offered today as diagnostics tools [1]. Biosensors can roughly be divided into two categories – single-shot analysis tools, such as pregnancy tests, or long-term monitoring analysis tools, as used in pollution monitoring [2]. One type of long-term monitoring biosensors that is commonly employed in environmental and biomedical screening processes is whole-cell biosensors, as they allow exploiting the natural machinery of the cell [3]. With the emergence of advanced recombinant DNA technology and rapid high-throughput sequencing and synthesis of DNA in recent years, expression of heterologous and novel pathways in well-characterized chassis has been made possible [4] [5] [6]. Thus, biological receptor elements can be employed with minimal variance in situ.
As evaluated in the project description , a prevalent obstacle in the engagement against microplastic pollution lies in the cumbersomeness of detecting the plastic particles. With the discussed benefits of whole-cell biosensors in mind, we set out to realize such a biosensor for efficient detection of microplastics. Expanding on the groundwork laid out by the 2012 UCL iGEM team that recognized the viability of approaching the detection of microplastics through indirect means, a logic AND-gate will be constructed and implemented in Escherichia coli, responding to the input of two molecules associated with plastic particles found in water – plasticizers and organic pollutants [7] [8] [9].

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Design1_-_-_TEXT.html," individual C. elegans during manipulation.
Fig2. Our optical design of protein and devices
Why is the platform important?
Along with the development of neuroscience, more and more techniques have been used to study the behavior psychology. However, the original platform of the behavior psychology research, Skinner box, is not suitable for modern researches because its “black-box” model cannot reveal the changes in the organisms during the process of their learning new ability. Meanwhile, the former research of learning ability based on C.elegans were more focused on chemical signals. These can demonstrate the existence of the learning behaviors but seems untenable, since the residues of the stimuli are hard to erase. Thus, if we aim to study the learning ability associated with neuroscience and behavior psychology, we need to develop a new platform which allowss us to explore the internal mechanism. Compared to the traditional methods, light stimulation is more easily to control and more reliable for the following data analysis.
That is why our project is so important.
It employs the optogenetics and neuroimaging to record the change in each neuron during the formation of new ability, so we can know what happened exactly inside the brain. Moreover, the application of microfluidics in our platform allows us to combine the process among ability-training and neuron-activating, and makes the research becoming easier to carry out.
In the future, our platform can also be applied in different fields, such as the simulation of the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The BCI can help the paralysis patients obtain the ability to move and operate things. But the signals from the human brain is too complex and difficult to deal with. If we can decipher the neuronal signals during learning progress when the patient’s mind interacting with the computer, it is possible to simplify the network and build more connections between them.
We are now using our platform to study the alcoholism by trainning worms to be addicted with alcohol and then study the neuron networks during the formation of this behavior. Hope one day we can figure out the logic networks of alcoholism and help to treat more serious social problem.
What is MiniMos?
The miniMos transposon is used to carry transgenes into the C. elegansgenome by the means of inserting a transgene into a modified Mos1 element (miniMos). The miniMos transposon can carry the inserted transgene (together with a selection marker) into the genome where insertions are generated directly by injecting worms. It will take approximately 1 week to get the result. The insertion site is random and can be identified by inverse PCR on the strain.
The miniMos system contains "

Circuit Testing
We have determined that it is necessary to characterize our parts in order to guide the construction of our device.  Precisely because our system is so complex, we need to ensure that we understand  the correct parts in our smaller circuits before moving on to the system as a whole.  In such a case, we have outlined a few critical tests to demonstrate the proper functioning of our parts.
We ran a test of our LexA activator and inducible reporter on the confocal fluorescence microscope, and saw mCherry in the nucleus and YFP in the cytoplasm as expected:
The mCherry is tagged onto the LexA activating transcription factor, and so is localized to the nucleus due to the SV40 NLS ligated just before the terminator.  The YFP is generated by mCYC+LexA binding sites on a construct containing Kozak+YFP+ADH1 terminator.
This strain contains the following parts: BBa_K165068  pGAL1+ LexA activator BBa_K165078  LexA activator reporter (LexA binding sites+ mCYC1+Kozak+YFPx2+ADH1 Terminator)
It was grown in media containing 2% galactose and 2% raffinose.  Raffinose is used as a neutral sugar that provides a carbon source while neither inducing nor repressing the pGAL1 promoter.
Inputs
Our proof-of-principle design incorporates the use of inducible promoters that respond to varied levels of chemical input.
pMET25 is a repressable promoter that responds to levels of methionine from 0-500 uM. pGAL1 is an inducible promoter that responds to the concentration of galactose between 0 and 3%
pGAL1 normally has an all-or-nothing response, and is thus not tunable. Christina Smolke of Caltech published a paper investigating the dynamics of the Gal"

Besides, we collaborate with Jilin_China to make sure that our BiFC can work in different labs. To our credit, the outcome is more than fruitful. Click here to learn more about it.
Through these experiments, we fully demonstrate that our BiFC system works and prove the improvement of BBa_E0020 is a success. And BBa_K2886004 & BBa_K2886005 can used as labels for interaction of two target proteins and the location of two proteins in subcellular level, tremendously expanding the usage of the original part and equipping iGEMers with another powerful tool for biological visualization.
BBa_K2886007
BBa_K2886007 encodes VEGF-165 with His9 tag. VEGF is a big family including lots of types. VEGF-121 was firstly introduced to iGEM by Slovenia in 2012 (BBa_K782061) and then was improved by SYSU-CHINA in 2017 (BBa_K2298001). VEGF-165 was also firstly introduced to iGEM by NYMU_Taiwan in 2012(BBa_K896922). However, there is no detail in the part wiki at all except for the part name, and actually we find this part using registry blast. This year, Fudan-CHINA makes new improvements to VEGF-165 to make it more useful and accessible to enrich the choices of iGEMers.    We perfect the description of VEGF-165 to make more iGEMers can know about and search for VEGF-165 expediently. And to test our STEP system, we need a large amount of VEGF-165. However, buying VEGF from companies will be really expensive. The average price of 1mg VEGF-165 is as high as 10,000 yuan (nearly 5000 dollars). Thus, we decide to construct plasmid and express VEGF-165 by ourselves. We design a sequence coding VEGF-165 followed by a 9×His tag and then entrust Sangon Biotech to synthesis it totally on the backbone pET28a.

Help High School IGEM Team
In order to better understand the problems faced by the high school iGEM team and to verify the feasibility of our high school iGEM guide (You can find it on our Human Practices - Silver page ), we have maintained close contact with the two high school iGEM teams (GDSYZX & GZHS-United).
Offer Basic Experimental Training Courses
Considering that the iGEM teams in high school has little experimental basis, it is very difficult to participate in an academic competition such as iGEM. We offered a two-day basic experimental skills training course for the 2018 high school iGEM team GDSYZX to help them better complete wet experiment tasks in the competition.
This course includes:
1.Explain basic synthetic biology concepts
2.Teaching basic molecular experiment skills
·Explain the principle of experiment
·Experimental operation guidance and practice
·Extracting red fluorescent protein particles
·Prepare agarose gel & agarose gel electrophoresis
·Heat-shock transform
·Flat line
·Result observation and analysis
3.Exchange experience of project and team building
In addition to conducting basic experimental training, we closely follow up the progress of the follow-up experiments of the two teams’ projects(GDSYZX & GZHS-United),held a project meeting to share the progress of our project. We put forward some follow-up suggestions for GZHS-United.
(We also offer a similar course for Guangdong Country Garden School, prompting an iGEM team. Detailed information are avaliable at Public Engagement & Education page )
Help High School Team Complete Interlab
We learned that the high school team GZHS-United encountered equipment and laboratory problems when completing the interlab task. Thus, we offer aid as much as we can to help them with these problems
These help include:

The first clinical trial was conducted by Rogers et al. to cure urea cycle disorder by introducing the gene for arginase using Shope papilloma virus. The result of the trial was negative. They later found out that was so because the Shope papilloma virus genome actually does not encode an arginase. Despite a string of negative results during clinical trials, gene therapy received great attention from many scientists until the death of Jesse Gelsinger. In 1999, Jesse Gelsinger, an omithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency patient, took part in a gene therapy clinical trial at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. High doses of adenovirus were administered and Gelsinger’s immune system responded instantly. He died because of multi organ failure. This case was very important in the study of gene therapy because Gelsinger became the first patient who showed that viral vector for gene therapy can cause death to the patients (Wirth, Parker & Ylä-Herttuala, 2013).
Currently more than 1800 approved gene therapy clinical trials have or are being conducted around the world. Cancer is the most common disease being investigated for gene therapy, being the topic of over 60% of clinical gene therapy trials worldwide. In 2003, China made history by becoming the first country to approve the commercial production of a gene therapy method.
Methods
In general, there are two categories of gene therapy: germ line cell gene therapy and somatic cell gene therapy. The difference is whether the genetic materials inserted will be passed on to the next generation. In somatic cell gene therapy, genetic material is not passed down while the genetic material is passed down in germ line gene therapy (Wirth, Parker & Ylä-Herttuala, 2013). Both of these methods require a carrier called a vector that can transport the new gene into the desired cell (Handbook, 2013). Adenoviral vectors, retroviral vectors and naked plasmids have been used most for gene transfer vectors in clinical trials (Wirth, Parker & Ylä-Herttuala, 2013). When virus vectors are used they are modified so that they won’t infect the subjects. Different types of virus vectors can produce different outcomes. For example, if retroviruses are used as vectors, the genetic material gets integrated into the subject’s genome. If adenoviruses are used, DNA is introduced into the nucleus of the cell, but the DNA is not integrated into the genome (Handbook, 2013).

Integrases don't seem to switch the terminator at the moment, maybe because of a mutation that we found in their sequence.

Integrase parameters
Friday, August 29th
In order to predict accurately the experiments we designed, we defined two different strategies to retrieve parameters for the integrase system.
As we did not find these parameters on the web, we used the data given by Bonnet et al.'s paper ""Amplifying genetic logic gates"" [9] . The figure S4 is particularly interesting, even if it does not give any information on the dynamics of the system. We modeled and wrote the equations corresponding to Bonnet's experiment.
At first, we try to fit the dynamic parameters of the system with only the steady states values.  To fit the parameters with the data, we first try to use a minimum search for the difference between the data and the parametric function. Then, using these first approximations, we tried to do a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to find a more suited curve. As these two methods are strongly prior dependent, we planned another step of screening in order to have meaningful results. However, our knowledge on the parameters, the number of data points compared to the high number of parameters did not give any meaningful results.
We then decided to simplify our system :
We consider that Bxb1a and Bxb1b have the same behavior. Therefore, they don't appear as differentiated in our system anymore.
The paper uses the tet system to induce their system. This was modeled explicitly before. We approximated this part to a Hill function, which takes leakiness into consideration. The parameters for the Hill function are the result from a study of an other iGEM team UCSF from last year. Please visit their page for more information. The same biobrick is indeed used in their work and in Bonnet's paper.
We consider that the dimer of the integrase and the binding to DNA were at quasi steady-state.
As we tried to fit the steady state, we obtained two different models, depending on which assumption we made. As these two models fit the Bonnet's curve well, we used them both to derive more precisely the dissociation constant of the dimerization reaction and the one of the DNA binding reaction. Each of them appear in one of the lumped parameters we fitted.

2.0 P(3HB) production from 3HB monomers▼
In module 2, the main objective is the bioplastic recycling. We have a detailed explanation of the P(3HB) synthesis model and the optimization in P(3HB) production yield. Our synthetic pathway of converting monomeric 3HB to polymeric P(3HB) is described in module one . In MAPLE system, both glucose from mixed waste and 3HB monomers are the inputs to produce P(3HB). In this section, we are going to introduce a customized metabolic model that consisted our synthetic pathway with a metabolic model built by Angela Dixon. [16] The combined metabolic model can predict the P(3HB) production with both 3HB and glucose as sources.
Introduction of the metabolic model
The metabolic model predicts the interaction of our pathway with endogenous pathways. In synthetic biology, an ideal system is fully orthogonal. However, if the synthetic pathway uses some metabolites from the metabolism pathways, the metabolic fluxes (the rate of conversion between metabolites) will be affected. If the cell is overloaded by losing too much metabolites, it would either reject the synthetic pathway or burn out. As for the optimization of PHB production in our MAPLE system, metabolic analysis need to be carried out to estimate the effects on the cell metabolism from increases in the PHB production.
Methods
We altered the metabolic model by Angela Dixon in her paper “Predictive Mathematical Model for Polyhydroxybutyrate Synthesis in Escherichia coli”. [17] The metabolic model is built in Simbiology, which is an extension in MATLAB especially for biological system. The model consists two metabolic pathways: Glycolysis and TCA cycle. The reactions in the metabolic pathways are defined by ordinary differential equations and kinetic parameters. The model also contains a synthetic pathway that produce P(3HB) from acetyl-coA. The pathway consists three enzymes which are PhaA, PhaB and PhaC.  The reasons we chose this model:
1. The model is based on ODEs instead of FBA (flux balance analysis), which is a common method of metabolic analysis. However, FBA cannot determine the real time concentrations of the metabolites whereas it can be done by models with ODEs.
2. Only single gene deletion or addition can be performed in FBA. More than that"

Besides, most parts in registry are compatible in Azotobacter and it is of safety level group 1. One more important thing is that it can conduct homologous recombination for stable genome integration,  which is a critical process we need in our project.
Magnetosome Island Genes - Everything Required for Magnetosome Formation
For the synthesis of magnetosome, it is strictly controlled by a group of genes clustered in the magnetosome island (MAI). MAI comprise of four operons, namely mms6, mamGFDC, mamAB and mamXY operons [5]. The actual size and organisation of the MAI might differ between species, but the operons seems to be highly conserved within the MAI [2].
Through genetic mutants, researches has shown with the deletion of mamAB operon would lead to non-magnetic phenotype, showing the importance of mamAB operon as minimal requirement for magnetosome formation and other important functions such as membrane invagination, iron transport, and magnetite biomineralization [7].
In the bacteria Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense, the mamAB operon consists of 17 genes, namely mamH, -I, -E, -J, -K, -L, -M, -N, -O, -P, -A, -Q, -R, -B, -S, -T, and -U.
Biogenesis of Magnetosome
Now let's look at the biosynthesis of magnetosomes as a multistep complex process.
Figure 4: Overview of Magnetosome Formation
First, the inner membrane of the bacteria swells outwards for vesicle invaginations. The following step is to sort magnetosome proteins to the mangetosome membrane (MM) to perform specific functions in the transport and accumulation of iron.
After protein sorting to the MM, the next step is iron uptake.  The need to import iron for magnetite production makes MTB differs from other bio-mineralizers. Iron transporters in the MM   would pump Fe2+/Fe3+ into the vesicle.
Additionally, mamM, mamB, and mamH were suggested as additional iron transporters for magnetite biomineralization. As the concentration of iron ions increases inside the vesicle, biomineralization occurs [8].
The process of magnetite biomineralization is tightly regulated through specific conditions such as: pH and the concentration of iron within the vesicle. It was also"

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," a one-to-one map between the “initial” states and the equilibrium states.
\[                 (c_{m,eq}, c_{p,eq}, c_{h,eq}) = f(c_m,c_p,c_h;K_1,K_2,K_3)                 \]
Now we are ready to expound the differential equations given in the beginning.
The first equation describes the phytoextraction process. The change in the imaginary “initial” concentration of heavy metals ($c_m$) is only affected by the absorption of the plant, which is assumed to be proportional to its actual concentration in the soil ($c_{m,eq}$). $r_a$ is the absorption rate of the plant.
Similarly, the change in $c_p$ is only related to the degradation of the actual available proteins in the environment ($c_{p,eq}$) and the new proteins produced by the engineered PSB. $r_d$ is the degradation rate. In the protein production part, since FAFU designed two parts, one for surface display and one for secretion, we also have two possible terms to describe them. For display, one PSB is only able to display a fixed amount of proteins in its lifetime, therefore the main source of protein production is the reproduction of PSB, hence the $a_1\frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t}$ term. For secretion, PSB is constantly secreting proteins, hence the $a_1’\frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t}$ term. However, we only have done the simulation for the display version.
The third equation is about the change in pH. In our simulation time period, we only consider the effect of PSBs’ secreting organic acids. $r_h$ is the acid production rate, which we have taken as a constant.
The fourth equation is just the ordinary logistic growth model with a varied carrying capacity $K(c_{h,eq})$ for the PSB (whose population density is $m$) in the soil. Assuming temperature and other relevant conditions are constant, we see it as a function of acidity. It is a quadratic function with respect to $\text{pH}=-\mathrm{lg}c_{h,eq}$ obtained from fitting experimental data in the literature. It reaches its highest point $K_{max}$ at $\text{pH}=6$ i.e. $c_{h,eq}=1\times 10^{-6}$ and decreases to $0$ at $\text{pH}=2."

Ethical, Legal, Societal, and Environmental Issues
What's in a Name?
During the Human Genome Projects, issues ""beyond the bench"" went under the category of ELSI: “Ethical, Legal, Societal Implications. However, this name was critiqued by social scientists who pointed out that implications implies a “downstream” model of social engagement; it suggests that we do the science first, then think about the implications later. This model neglects the fact that social values are present in the practice of science from the start, whether we choose to acknowledge them or not: for example, in the kinds of questions we choose to pursue and how we go about our research. The name that was later used in synthetic biology and iGEM, “Human practices,” suggested a move to integrate thinking about issues “beyond the bench” with laboratory practices, being more reflexive about these issues from the start and allowing them to shape the way we work. However, “Human practices” sounds anthropocentric – it doesn’t reflect our concern for nonhumans (animals, the environment). We aim to work from a framework of co-production: the idea that science and other sectors of society mutually constitute each other (Jasanoff 2004). Our work and our organization as a collaboration between community labs is already motivated by concerns ""beyond the bench,"" so even ""Policy and Practices"" felt too restrictive for the broad scope of issues we discussed. We decided to call this section “Ethical, Legal, Societal, and Environmental Issues,” with the understanding that these issues are woven into the fabric of our work.
Ethical and Environmental Motivations
Factory farming often entails treating animals less well than most of us would like, and it is likely that providing better alternatives will decrease demand for traditional products and thus decrease the number of poorly treated animals. We acknowledge that the cost of yeast-based production of cheese protein makes it unlikely that it will pose a threat to traditional methods in the near future. At first, it is more likely that this method will provide an alternative for those with dietary restrictions, whether ethical, religious, or health-related. But over time and with continued work, we believe it has the potential"

We interviewed Mr. Brown about our methods to clean NPs in WWTPs and how to achieve our goal of implementation. With his expertise in the field of wastewater treatment, he provided us some suggestions as to how we could turn our project into reality.
For example, we asked him if there were differences between rural and urban plants that we should take into consideration when thinking about implementing our project. He responded that the biological processes used for treatment remains the same regardless of facility size. This helped us think about and design our final prototype, which can potentially be used in both rural and urban treatment plants.

To learn more about the applications of NPs, we visited a nanotech company that uses silver NPs to make various antimicrobial products. The researcher and manager of Apex Nanotek, Chery Yang, introduced us to their main product, which is antimicrobial nanosilver activated carbon. Pure activated carbon, commonly used to treat sewage and industrial exhaust, is prone to bacterial growth. To overcome this problem, they integrate crystallized nanosilver into the activated carbon for their antimicrobial effects. One of their products is a showerhead, with nanosilver activated carbon filters to kill bacteria when water flows through the showerhead.
We tested the product by comparing SEM images between tap water and filtered water from the showerhead. The showerhead decreased the number of bacteria and larger particles from tap water! However, we also observed the release of NPs from the filter, which will flow into wastewater. (Interviewed by Christine C., Kelly C., Yvonne W., Chansie Y., and Justin Y.)

The image on the left shows a tap water sample under the SEM, in which we observed some bacteria (round objects that are approximately 1 μm in diameter). The SEM image on the right shows that water filtered by the showerhead contains less bacteria, as the showerhead uses embedded nanosilver antibacterial filters.(SEM images: Christine C. and Florence L.)

Antioxidants like GSH play an important role in the detoxification of ROS and reactive oxygen species by directly acting as electron                  donors, changing the unbalanced electron state of the free radicals and turning them into less harmful substances or affect                  them indirectly by getting in the way of the expression of free radical generating enzymes (Lü et al., 2014).

We’ve inserted the gene GSH, our basic part 2, to pSB1C3 backbone and transformed it to DH5 alpha. After plasmid isolation,                      we’ve checked the orientation with GSH specific primers and expected to see a band of 225 bp.

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental"

Nothing pertaining to our province could be found, so we looked to Ontario and the United States.  The concise guide to U.S. federal guidelines, rules and regulations for synthetic biology outlined the rules pertaining to field tests and indicated that in cases where organisms are going to be released into the environment, the EPA (environmental protection agency) requires a TSCA (Toxic Substances Control Act) Experimental Release Application (TERA) to be completed 60 days before the trial begins and the APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) requires a permit or notification.  Although we specifically designed FRED to not release the microbes but rather to contain them, the prototype is too much in its infancy to remove it from the lab and be absolutely assured that it won’t be released.  What we did instead, was took our prototype without bacteria in it to collect a water sample in a nearby river in Calgary.  The video of this experience can be found below.
Putting our Killswitch into OSCAR - Can we use our Auxotroph with the Petrobrick?
In fact it's better! The glycine auxotroph will be used as a second layer of regulation with our kill switch in the event that our bacterium is capable of escaping the bioreactor.  However in order to ensure that the glycine knockout we are using does not compromise the production of hydrocarbons and we can continue to see the high yield of hydrocarbons as predicted with our flux balance modelling, we performed an experiment to look at the relative amount of hydrocarbon production as in the flux balance analysis model.  As seen in the figure below, using the glyA knockout greatly increased the output of hydrocarbons much higher than in the wild type E. coli strain.  This was extremely exciting showing that our system could not only be safe, with a second layer of control for safety, and an increase in output.
Figure 4: Relative production of hydrocarbons per cell as discussed in the flux balance analysis section of our wiki.  Wild type E. coli TOP10 cells were incubated with minimal media 1% glucose (Negative) or 50:50 LB:Washington Production Media (Positive). Additionally, the glyA knockout was incubated in minimal media in the presence of glycine.  Production of C15 hydrocarbon was standardized to OD600 measurements and normalized to the positive control.  Surprisingly, the glyA knockout greatly increased the amount of hydrocar"
Columbia-Cooper-NYC,2012,Team:Columbia-Cooper-NYC#Columbia notebook 1_-_-_TEXT.html,"New AFM was added to replace the old liquid layer in the petri dishes containing bacteria. The cells were first separated using a centrifuge, and then put back in solution in 1 mL of fresh AFM, then transferred back to the petri dishes. There was a lot of brown precipitate in our pellet, much more than there were cells, that we couldn't separate, so we added it back to our dish for minimal loss of cells.
Aug 16
See Aug 15. Additionally, the copper pieces had a dark brown layer building up on its surface within the solid media where they were exposed (not covered by nail polish).
Aug 17
The same procedure for replacing the AFM from 8/15 was used for all but one of the dishes containing cells. The copper pieces from this dish were extracted from the solid media, cleaned, and then massed. This process was repeated for one petri dish not containing bacteria. On average it was determined that the copper in the petri dish with bacteria lost more mass on average than the pieces without bacteria. From this data, the surface area of the exposed copper, and the known density of the copper, we attempted to measure the depth of copper etched as well. The rest of the dishes were returned to the incubator.
The liquid media in the bacteria dishes was an orange-brown (precipitate buildup), while the liquid media in the dishes without bacteria remained clear.
Aug 18
See previous day. Even more etching had occurred in both cases, with the biological etching system proving to be the faster system yet again.
August 19 - August 25
The last of the copper pieces from the last experiment were massed this week. A new set of experiments were started, making use of the fact that the hybrid setup (a layer of liquid AFM over the copper pieces preserved in solid media)  from last week was effective in etching. We wanted to test how thin we could make the layer of liquid media so that etching would still occur. See our Data and Conclusions Page for a summary of our data.
Aug 19
See procedure for August 17. Four petri dishes were returned to the incubator (two bacteria, two without) at the end of the day. The copper pieces in the petri dish with bacteria that were matched lost, on average, about four times as much mass due to etching as the pieces in the dish without bacteria.

Waterloo,2012,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html,"If there are specific individuals in-charge of these events make sure they are aware of not only where to find the appropriate equipment needed to show the movie on campus but also the process involved in the rental. There are very strict protocols that need to be followed in regards to electrical equipment being rented at UW. Get in touch with media doc. for more details for UW.
Another thing to keep in mind is that University of Waterloo is only allowed to show licensed movies/videos on campus. Feds is usually a great help in this process. They tend to have a huge list of movies available for you to choose from and in most cases the movie you want to show will be included in that licensed list. If not try and get in touch with one of the Feds executives or clubs manager to see if they can assist you in getting a license to show that movie on campus. The movie however will be rented from the closest store.
One last thing to be kept in mind is, if your group plans on serving food at this event, make sure to follow the steps similar to the ones listed above for the food event.
LABORATORY EVENT
Community Brick Available for Protocol
The purpose of this event was to educate science students about the basic and complicated lab techniques that are required during their undergraduate years here at Waterloo.
This exercise followed a similar pattern to our ESQ exercises, however are made more directed towards first and second year students.
Since this activity is very hands on, laboratory safety protocol is very important to follow. Each student that wants to participate in this activity must have their WHMIS certification before they show up for the event.
For activities like this only a lab space can be used to perform the experiments. Therefore it is crucial that you get an instructor’s permission to his/her lab space. With regular lab sections utilizing the lab space for a minimum for 3 hours per section, time is very critical. In most cases this even will have to be held when a specific lab is over for the term.
Details of the experiments being performed must be discussed by the instructor before anything is agreed upon. These details should include, the time and date of your event, what kind of experiments the students will be performing as well as what kind of equipment will be provided to them and if necessary what kind of equipment is required by the instructor of the lab to provide for us.
Costs of the equipment and materials being used will also have to be calculated just in case there needs to be a charge placed on this.
Keep in mind that lab spaces are not entirely meant for a large group of students. Prior to deciding on the exact date and time"

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," initial protein numbers. The behaviours are sensitive to initial numbers.
It is obvious that such a difference can influence the attractor of this system when we plotted the time response diagram and phase trajectory diagram for the three proteins ($x_1, x_2, x_3$) (Fig. 2). We presented two potential attractors: a fixed point and a limit cycle. If the attractor is a fixed point, the gene expression is easy to converge to a steady state which means the oscillations die out. If the attractor is a limit cycle, the oscillations are stable. We simulated the oscillation by scanning different initial protein numbers to further illuminate the difference between these two attractors. The oscillation behaviour is sensitive to the initial state when the attractor is a fixed point. So we cannot make sure that we will observe the oscillations in this situation. But the oscillation behaviour is robust when the attractor is a limit cycle.
Another question arose: Whether the attractor results from the relative promoter strength or the absolute promoter strength. To find out the answer, we scanned a range of promoter strength and constructed a index named relative amplitude $A_r$, \begin{equation} A_r=\frac{2\cdot(max(x_1)-min(x_1))}{max(x_1)+min(x_1)}. \end{equation}
This index was calculated when the simulation time approached the infinity ($t=120000\ min$). So if the relative amplitude approached 0, we concluded that the system was attracted to a fixed point.
Figure 3. Results of parameter scanning. The left diagram and the right diagram are the same results from different point of views. The colorbar indicates the relative amplitudes of different simulation results. The blank regions reveal that there is a fixed point attractor in the parameter space. The colored regions imply that there is a limit cycle attractor in the parameter space.
The simulation results reveal that there is a critical surface between these two limit states (Fig. 3). An attracting limit cycle emerges as the absolute promoter strengths increase, which is consistent with the previous result (Strelkowa and Barahona, 2011). They also assumed that the promoter strengths for all genes are identical and constructed a lumped parameter $c$. The parameter $c$ is the strength of the repressive coupling, which is calculated by \begin{equation} c=\frac{\beta_1\cdot K_{tl}}{K_R\cdot K_P}. \end{equation}
They found that there is only a fixed point $p"

Executive Summary
Synbiologica Ltd. is a group of scientists from the University of Lethbridge who are developing a robust, modular sensor called Biologically Enhanced Assay in Real-time (BEAR) used for the highly specific detection of hormones. Current methods of hormone detection are expensive and time consuming.  Synbiologica’s device builds upon current detection methods while incorporating new techniques from the emerging biotechnology field of synthetic biology to provide an inexpensive hormone diagnostic device.  The ability of BEAR to reduce costs and time for hormone diagnostics will further scientific knowledge and innovation for improved health and ultimately benefiting the research, agricultural and medical communities.
Today, much of the research on how hormone levels affect the behaviour of an individual is done by monitoring the concentration of a particular hormone at specific times and relating it to characteristic behaviours. BEAR is designed to detect hormone concentrations with high accuracy in a fraction of the time taken by conventional detection methods, such as ELISA kits. BEAR will mediate the trade-off between a rapid and accurate test. BEAR is designed to be a modular system, meaning the user will be able to use the system to detect different hormones as they desire.
Synbiologica’s current competition includes companies who produce and sell hormone detection kits and devices that use monoclonal antibodies, as this is the primary method of hormone detection. In 2008, the four-year market projection for both therapeutic and diagnostic monoclonal antibodies was valued at $56 billion. Research-oriented hormone detection kits make up a portion of this market. BEAR is more advantageous to monoclonal antibodies because it will provide a fast, real-time test at a fraction of the cost.
Synbiologica’s initial research and development will begin in research labs at the University of Lethbridge. The company plans to use resources at the University, such as the Technology Transfer Office and the Industry Liaison Office to assist the company in market analysis,"

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#NahumNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," a lot of useful commentary that made me think in ways I had not before. The new perspectives were extremely useful. Afterwards, I listened to the presentations from the other  “mini-teams” and was amazed at just how refined the presentations were for just one week of work. Today is also my birthday (seems like we have one everyday…). My labmates bought me cake and cookies and we feasted before heading home. It was great!
Jun 12: BU
Today we were at BU working with their iGEM wetlab team. They gave us short explanations of things they were working on and we game them short explanations of what we are working on. Discussions with the BU team was extremely useful because it gave us our first opportunity to bounce some of our software ideas off of people actually working in the lab. Plus, we got free pizza for lunch! We also spent some time organizing a few social events for our teams and possibly more of the Massachusetts teams including laser tag and ultimate frisbee!
Jun 13: Brainstorming
Brainstorming at Wellesley
We were back at Wellesley today with the BU iGEM team and a representative from Agilent Technology. We had our first of two days of brainstorming today. Each one of the Wellesley “mini-teams” set up a station in one of the larger rooms at Wellesley and had everyone rotate around these stations. At each station, individuals had the opportunity to ask each “mini-team” questions about their project and propose some new ideas. The BU wet lab team helped us ground some of our ideas and realize what was actually useful and what was superfluous. The representative from Agilent Technology was able to provide us with a lot of input on the technical feasibility of a lot of the things we were working on. The brainstorming session answered a lot of questions but created even more. We have our work cut out for us!
Jun 14: Brainstorming: Part II
Today was day 2 of brainstorming. We had Natalie Kuldull, a biological engineering lab professor at MIT, come in this morning to help us out with the electronic lab notebook. She provided a unique perspective on the electronic lab notebook as a professor. She introduced ideas of administrative controls versus student controls as well as mechanisms to provide oversight over the work that students may do in the lab. After our brainstorming session, the entire team met to isolate specific topics that we need to do additional research on. I will be doing some additional research on digital pens and styluses as well as doing some research on some of the"

Motivation for the UCSF iGEM 2012 Project
Our motivation for this year’s project was based around being able to engineer/modify organisms so that they could exist in symbiosis and work together to produce a compound. Being able to do this would, hypothetically, allow a decrease in metabolic burden towards a single compound-producing organism, eliminate the need for negative feedback, and enable modular pathways to be possible. If a successful method for doing this was discovered, it would for example, revolutionize the way industry produces expensive drugs and molecular products.

I am from Edmonton though grew up in the small town of Vermilion.  There I never would have thought this would be the path I would eventually end up on, but one thing lead to another and here I am.  I am taking my Bachelors of Science in Neuroscience, and find it a very exciting field, with a great cross application to Synthetic biology.  I enjoy camping and hiking in the mountains, I love skiing both downhill and cross country, and have coached youth cross country ski in past years.  I had heard about iGEM prior to arriving at the U of L, and was very eager to get involved.  It has been an extreamly interesting year and I have learned so much.
Ben Vuong
I was born and raised in Lethbridge for the whole span of my life. I have just finished up my first year and will be entering my second year at the University of Lethbridge majoring in Biochemistry. This is my first year with iGEM, and I am looking forward to the knowledge to be gained from the members of the team. I plan on pursuing the career of a Veterinarian after finishing up my undergraduate degree at the University of Lethbridge. Badminton is one of my favourite activities to do. I enjoy listening to contemporary R&B music as well Hip-Hop such as Ne-Yo, Chris Brown, Claude Kelly, Frankie J and Lupe Fiasco.

This conundrum                         stopped us from reaching any further into the experiment. At this time, Prof. Xu suggested us to                         separate the two enzymes into two steps. (see figure 2) After listening to his suggestion, our                         team worked together and produced our new experiment plan with a two step reaction instead of                         one. In this way, the end product will not be transformed back into CDCA, and the mass                         production of USCA proves to be successful. As well as enhancing the biopharmaceutical effect of                         UDCA, we also aims to reduce the production cost. When we were designing the experiment, we                         included the usage of cofactors: NADH and NADP+. However, the cost of cofactors can be immense                         if they are not regenerated. After hearing about our problem, Prof. Xu suggested us finding                         enzymes to help with the regeneration of cofactors. With his suggestion in mind, we eventually                         employed GDH(Glutamate Dehydrogenase) to regenerate the cofactor NADP+, and LDH(Lactate                         Dehydrogenase) to regenerate the cofactor NADH. Carefully answering our questions and giving us other valuable information and cases about our topic, Prof. Xu used his actions to encourage us                         in refining our experiment and to give it a try.
Outreach
Contact with Local Hospital and Patients
In addition, we contact local patients from Xuanwu hospital who suffered from liver cirrhosis to                         discuss the curing effects and prices of various UDCA-contained medicines in the market to                         determine our direction. Through our interviews, we understood that current UDCA medicines in                         the market are unaffordable for patients with average or below average income in long term                         treatment. Also, medicine which price can be accepted by the patients has relatively weak curing                         effect. In order to solve this problem, we consulted experts from doctors from Xuanwu Hospital.                         She reported that UDCA has a large pharmaceutical application. As well as UDCA’s usage in                         dissolving gallstone, its efficacy in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing                         cholangitis (PSC) as an adjunct to medical therapy has been well established. Newer indications                         include its use in the management of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, post liver transplant                         rejection, graft-versus-host disease and acute viral hepatitis, where it not only relieves                         symptoms of cholestasis but also arrests ongoing hepatocyte necrosis.

Notebook – Protocol – 4. DNA Purification
Spin column based purification was used. The kit is Gel/PCR extraction kit (Nippon Genetics). Protocols from the kit were followed by adaptation because we have no high speed microcentrifuge, but only a 6,000 rpm small microcentrifuge. All steps were done at room temperature.
DNA Purification from Liquid Samples
1. Into a clean, sterilized 0.5 ul polypropylene tube, add PCR products : buffer GP1 = 1 : 5 (e.g. 40 ul : 200 ul). Vortexing.
2. Load the samples onto the spin column equipped with collection tube. Centrifuge for 6,000 rpm; 1 minute. Discard the flowthrough.
3. Add 600 ul of GP2. Centrifuge for 6,000 rpm; 1 minute. Discard the flowthrough.
4. Centrifuge for 6,000 rpm; 5 minutes to dry the column.
5. Replace collecting tube with clean, sterilized 1.5 ml size polypropylene tube.
6. Add 30 ul of GP3. Incubate 2 minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge for 6,000 rpm; 5 minutes.
7. Obtain the DNA as the flowthrough.

Duke,2018,Team:Duke#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," cancers. For example, Cabazitaxel has been shown to be stronger against Prostate cancer than docetaxel. [13] These modified taxol molecules have enhanced properties such as reduced toxicity and the potential to be taken orally, addressing two large barriers that are often come across during clinical trials. Though synthesizing taxol from plant tissue culture would produce more natural compounds with less toxic side effects, the process is long and arduous while the disease to be treated is time sensitive. It is much easier to make derivatives because we know more about E. Coli metabolism and biosynthesis mechanisms than plants. And though more patient input in the drug development process is essential, this method of production will enable clinical trials while the ecological perspective may be slowed by politicization, saving precious time.  The ability to produce a wide range and volume of taxanes will ultimately open up the potential of the unique abilities of microtubule stabilization of taxol, allowing rapid clinical trials to broad applications. This stabilization reduces out-of-pocket spending and overall spending on taxane-derived anticancer drugs by providing more and cheaper alternatives.

今回は前半に梅野先生のお話があり、どのようなプロポーザルを目指していくのかということと、 どのようにしてプロポーザルを実際に作成までつなげていくかという話をしていただきました。
今現在あるパーツを使って、組み合わせることで遺伝子回路ができていきます。 インプットやアウトプットよりもそれらをどうつなぐかということが重要です。 シンプルであっても面白いアイディアができるのが一番なんですが。
後半は事例研究でした。 目次にある4人が話しました。
やはりいきなり読んできてというのは、なかなか難しいのかもしれません。 よくわかってないまま話すという感じになってしまいした。  やり方に問題がありそうなので、何か工夫をしていこうと思います。

We are changing the pelB secretion tag to OsmY-fusion partner for better secretion
As seen in the Western Blot results, some of the enzymes designed for secretion were not secreted. These proteins may have been stuck in the periplasmic space. Thus we are optimising enzyme secretion by building a new construct with OsmY BBa_K892008 fusion for secretion. OsmY is naturally secreted from E.coli and will carry our PUR esterase enzyme with. Once in the culture medium, we think that the enzyme is going to be functional in the fusion form but we included a TEV site in between the domains that can be cleaved by TEV protease if needed.
The linker sequence we have designed between the domains is T G S E N L Y F Q G S (ACCGGCAGCGAGAACCTGTACTTCCAAGGCAGC) and includes the 7 amino acids of the TEV site as well as 4 other amino acids for flexibility.
This construct will be a substitute for BBa_K1149010 and BBa_K1149008 biobricks which are the PHB depolymerase PhaZ1 and ProteinaseK with the pelB seretion tag.

This method efficiently separates organic and inorganic phases to get rid of any unwanted salt contamination. Moreover the final yield is much higher than with column purification, which mostly reduces final concentration considerably due to column occlusion by contaminants.
Cloning into pSB1C
All of our experiments were PCR-Based. For this reason, we had to clone our sensors into pSB1C for iGEM-Submission only and were selecting two strategies to reach this goal:
Cloning of our PCR-Product into pGEM®-T Easy vector and subsequent insertion of the insert to pSB1C via Not1-Restriciton sites.
Amplifying our PCR-Product using tailed primers introducing the restriction sites SpeI and XbaI. Direct insertion into pSB1C
Methods: For TA-Cloning 5,5 uL of PCR-Product, generated by Phusion PCR according to our SOPs, were incubated with 0,5 uL Units GoTaq® Flexi DNA Polymerase (5U/uL) from Promega, 2ul dATP (2mM), and 2uL GoTaq® Flexi Buffer (5X) for 30 minutes at 70°C. Ligation was performed over night at 4°C using T4-Ligase (M180A Promega) at a molar vector:insert ratio of 1:1 and transformed to ultracompetent DH5a-Cells (NEB). Positive clones were identified by colony PCR using a primer annealing to the T7-promoter as forward-primer and two reverse primers annealing to lacZ. These primers worked well for sequencing the switches already and thus we decided to use them again.
