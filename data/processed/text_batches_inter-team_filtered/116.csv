Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#EricDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," achieves greater yields in yeast than the citrus valencene synthase. Furthermore, the product specificity is relatively high, while production of byproducts is low Beekwilder et al. (2014) .  The valencene synthase was also chosen because of its robustness towards pH and temperature changes Beekwilder et al. (2014) .   Our modelling approach revealed that for optimal yields an overexpression of valencene synthase is necessary because of its slow conversion rate (Model) . This is why we chose the strongest promoter of the yeast toolbox (Dueber Toolbox) for this attempt.
Figure 7.2:ValS lvl.1 PTS1 plasmid
Figure 7.3: The structure of valencene, an intermediate of nootkatone
The intermediate valencene is then converted into nootkatol by a P450 monooxygenase as well as into small amounts of our desired product nootkatone.  The P450 monooxygenase we chose for this project was taken from the bacterium Bacillus megaterium. In this  case it is not only a simple P450 monooxygenase, but an entire P450 system, consisting of a soluble P450 fused to a cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) enzyme, making an additional reductase obsolete De Mot et al. (2002) .     Unlike eukaryotic P450s, which are mostly membrane bound, this prokaryotic BM3-P450 is located in the cytosol facilitating an easier transport into the peroxisome, as membrane integration of proteins is a more difficult task to achieve than import of cytosolic proteins Girvan et al. (2006) .   BM3 normally catalyzes the hydroxylation of long chain fatty acids Narhi et al. (1986) , which in our case could inhibit the conversion of valencene. For that reason we used a mutated version of BM3, which is called AIPLF. This variant is an enhanced version of the BM3 AIP version, which has a ten times better substrate oxidation rate for valencene than the wildtype BM3 and produces less byproduct when valencene concentration is saturated. Additionally to previous named benefits the AIPLF variant with 5 point mutations in the active side has a significantly lower binding affinity towards long chain fatty acids and therefore increase the transposition rate of valencene.

При том, что мир органической химии уже сформировался, органические молекулы последнего поколения претерпели значительные изменения. Они организовывались в пространственно ограниченные структуры и самовоспроизводились со все возрастающей скоростью. Вскоре количество свободных органических строительных элементов стало ограниченными, и становящиеся все более сложными структуры начали активно конкурировать за ресурсы и пространство.

Overview
The model
Simulations
The behaviour of the system (the single-substrate mechanism) can be described with four ordinary differential equations (ODEs).  Each component is described by a simple rate term for each of the four species involved in the mechanism. The rate term is a direct consequence of the application of the law of mass action.
We adopt the following notations for the kinetic rate constants involved in the single-substrate mechanism
The Enzyme Mechanism
In substrate binding, 1 molecule of Enzyme (E) binds with 1 molecule of Substrate (S) in a reversible reaction to form the Enzyme-Substrate complex (ES).  From an experimental point of view, this step is blind: we are unable to measure this step. In catalysis, the Enzyme-Substrate complex (ES) produces the unchanged enzyme (E) and the product (P) in an irreversible reaction. This is the step that can be measured experimentally. When [S] becomes high enough, the second step of the enzyme kinetics becomes the rate determining step, controlled by k3. (link to simulation results)
Equation 1: Rate of change of Enzyme
Equation 2: Rate of change of substrate
Without MM assumption
Equation 3: Rate of change of enzyme-substrate complex
Equation 4: Rate of change of product
With Michaelis-Menten Assumptions
Consider the enzyme mechanism again:
From the model, we want to derive an equation that describes the rate of enzyme activity (amount of product formed per time interval) as a function of substrate concentration.
Consider equation 4: the rate of product formation. This equation is essentially useless as we cannot measure [ES] experimentally, therefore, to correctly determine d[P]/dt, we need to solve for ES in terms of the other quantities.  Therefore, we need to make some approximations as mentioned previously. (hyperlink to assumptions part) At steady state, equation 3 is reduced to:
When this result is used together with equation 4, a new differential equation for rate of change of product is obtained:
Equation 4-MM: New rate of change of product
Michaelis-Menten assumption:
The Michaelis-Menten (MM) assumption is a simplifying assumption that is commonly made with enzymatic reactions. It"

USP_UNIFESP-Brazil,2016,Team:USP UNIFESP-Brazil#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," impact with our work, we organized a hands-on open workshop on making open hardware equipment for biotech. The event was organized in partnership with University of Sao Paulo (USP) Synthetic Biology Club, USP Free Hardware group, USP entrepreneurship nucleus and the agrotech company Lotan, founded by former iGEMers. This partnership made the event possible and the company even adopted some hardware made, the Seletora Centrifuge, the Transilluminator Tabajara and one Electrophoresis Chamber. The rest of the equipment produced in the event was either given to the participants at  purchase cost or  was directly used by our team to develop our project. More than reaching out to the entrepreneurship community and former iGEMers, we had also a participant from USP-EEL-Brazil 2016 iGEM team, which travelled 200km just for the event!
The microcentrifuge and the other equipment we’ve built costed a great deal less than a commercial one, but the most important part is the autonomy and freedom that having these Open Hardware pieces promotes. The experience on making these equipments will surely guarantee that this culture will continue, not only among our team members, but among all the students that have attended our workshop. These students with different knowledge backgrounds, from biology to humanities to engineering, also are helping to build a community, wih insights that are making the Open Hardwares more functional, practical and accessible!
Fablearn
The brazilian edition of the FabLearn Conference was held by the University of São Paulo (USP) and the Stanford University during the 9th and 10th of September, 2016, at the campus of USP. We presented Seletora Centrifuge and Electrophoresis System using digital fabrication techniques. The conference gave us the opportunity to share experiences in research and education based in the “learning by doing” principle. We talked, for example high school students who built a syringe pump using Arduino and were planning to build a centrifuge as well in a really insightful meeting.  We perceived a great interest from teachers, professors, high school and undergrad students who also encouraged us to provide a repository with our designs and projects so they could reproduce the devices themselves. This acceptance reveals that the practical impact of our project goes beyond research, transforming education and learning.

Undergraduate Team Members
Morgan Baltz
I am a senior in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering with a research background in protein engineering, so for me iGEM is an opportunity to explore a new facet of chemical engineering research. After leaving UT Knoxville, I plan to obtain my PhD in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.
Katie Lutes
I am a senior in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, with an Honors Biomolecular concentration and a minor in Biological Sciences. Although I am originally from Kentucky, I now call Knoxville, Tennessee home and Rocky Top will always be home sweet home to me. After graduation, I plan to pursue a PhD in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and continue with my love of research. I hope that iGEM will give me both technical experience and fun memories from my undergraduate career.
Genesis Minter
I’m a junior in Chemical Engineering with a Biomolecular concentration. My interest in chemistry is what initially drew me to this field, but I find the various biological applications the most engaging. (After all, the intricacies of the genetic code beat steam tables any day). To me, iGEM is a new and exciting way to connect with the scientific community on a global scale, something I see myself continuing to do as I work towards a career in research.
Akshitha Yarrabothula
Hi! My name is Akshitha Yarrabothula and I'm a Senior in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from Birmingham, AL.

Northwestern,2013,Team:Northwestern#future_-_-_TEXT.html,". In the future, the arginine deiminase system may be isolated and linked to a dual-state pH-inducible promoter to combat pH fluctuations in the oral microbiome.
MIT’s 2008 iGEM team, Team BiOGURT, succeeded in producing p1025, a small peptide that competitively binds to the same receptors found on the dental surface that S. mutans uses to colonize the mouth. In the presence of p1025, fewer S. mutans cells were able to bind to hydroxyapatite (synthetic teeth).
Any one of these systems, or all three of these systems in series, may be linked to our our dual-state promoters to produce a powerful yet precise system which continually combats oral decay at a steady, tunable basal level, and only fights at elevated levels when this basal level is incapable of maintaining healthy pH levels on its own.

1. Mix the following reagents for PCR amplification, each reaction of 50 µl and we did one negative control where we did not put the template DNA. We also use 2 different buffers because we figured that our gene sequence has a high GC%. Master-mix reaction mixture (4X):
• Nuclease free H2O 134 µl
• 5X HF/GC buffer 40 µl
• DMSO 2 µl
• dNTPs 4 µl
• Forward primer (10 µM) 5 µl
• Reverse primer (10 µM) 5 µl
• Template DNA 6 ng (2 ng/reaction)
• Phusion Polymerase 2 µl
2. Run the PCR reaction with touch up program, where we run 7 cycles with the temperature of the primer without the overhang and another 30 cycles with the temperature of the primer full sequence.

Sept 1-7
BioBricking officially starts. All protocols established, including Double and Multiple Digestion of DNA, Fast Digestion of DNA, and Reaction Set-up for Digestion of Multiple DNA Samples. Our specified Restriction Enzyme Digest Protocol is created based on the protocols listed above.
Ben sequence verified the new modified plasmids and tested them. They did not fluoresce so designed new primers for swapping out the promoter, which was the original suspect. He started cloning later in the week and sent in for sequence verification.
Sept 8-14
Caroline continues on Biobricking.
Richard continues the acetylene reduction assay to test nitrogenase activity of JM109 and WM1788 under known optimal conditions.
Ben gets back the sequences for swapping the Ptet promoter. Only the positive control was successfully changed, as some of them had a few deletions and mispriming. He ran an experiment to test for the fluorescence of the new pTet and found that it fluoresced. Ben also started design of primers for biobricking the light repression mechanism, and the newly functional positive control.

Design
The suicide switch module requires a high level of combinability regarding to its components. We therefore designed every new part in RFC10 or RFC25 standard.
Production of the toxin SDP and the immunity protein SdpI
By the activation of the QS-dependent promoter PQS,  BaKillus produces the Cannibalism Toxin SDP (Fig. 1A). For evaluation purposes we cloned the sdpABC operon under the control of inducable xylose promoter Pxyl (Fig. 1B) into a ∆sdpAB and a ∆sdpC mutant strain of B. subtilis W168.  The construct was then tested by spot-on-lawn assays on B. subtilis W168 and B. subtilis W168 ∆sdpI mutant lawns.
To ensure a co-regulated production of the immunity protein SdpI we used the native promoter of the sdpRI operon PsdpRI which is accesible for RNA polymerase in the presence of extracellular SDP. Between the promoter and the immunity sequence sdpI we inserted the binding site of fsrA namely sdhC’ (Fig"

Summary
Designing educational activities around synthetic biology is difficult because this field is new and interdisciplinary[1]. Professional parlance may lead to public misunderstanding and estrangement since the public lacks authentic awareness over this novel subject. As students become active members of the synthetic biology community, they navigate both inside and outside the Ivory Towers. CPU_CHINA focused on bridging the gap between iGEM community and the general public with three methods:
1. Social interactions to broaden our community
2. Activities on campus for knowledge spreading
3. Engaging other iGEM teams and experience exchange
Social interactions
We causally interviewed some people just on street to get a grasp of their awareness of synthetic biology. They provided some interesting opinions, for example on relevant security and ethical considerations. We have to point out that most of them holds a positive view towards this fields future.
Please click here to see more details.
Please click here to watch the video.
Then, we tried to talk about synthetic biology in a TEDx speech in a simple way, which attracted nearly one hundred people. The speaker (team leader)’s vivid talking successfully inducted the audience into the world of synthetic biology.
Activities on campus
Then, to widen the impact of our project on campus, we organized an Innovation Experiment for College Students study group based on our RNAi system and three junior students joined to learn our project. They were able to practice some experimental techniques such as molecular cloning.
Please click here to get more details !
The school club of CPU iGEMers--CPU Bio-X Club continued its mission as the only biology club at China Pharmaceutical University. We held nearly twenty professional lectures this year and most of them were synthetic-biology-related. We also organized a fun school-ranged sport event--Surviving the BioValley during which all our schoolmates could have a better understanding of synthetic biology in the form of a game.
Please click here to know more about BioValley .
Engaging other iGEM teams
Engaging with other teams for more ideas and techniques is essential in iGEM. We have been pleased to attend the Nanjing iGEMers meetups and the 5th CCiC . Apart from these two meetups, we are friends with NAU-CHINA, Nanjing-China, CSU_CH"

Luckily, one of our German team members was in Tübingen at that time. She met Miriam, who is in charge of the InterLab study of the iGEM Tübingen team. The team was not sure, if they had troubles with performing the transformation or if the settings of the plate reader for measuring the fluorescence were incorrect. Miriam showed her their raw fluorescence measurement data and also the petri plates from the transformation. After comparing their plates with ours, it was clear that their transformation was successful. From this it follows that their settings, probably the gain of the plate reader was wrong."

Technion Israel iGEM High School Team 2015
This year, we mentored a group of high school students who are participating in the 2015 iGEM High School track.  This is the first year ever in which Israeli high school teams are participating in the iGEM competition.
In order to give the high school students an introduction to synthetic biology and genetic engineering, we put together an introductory course in order to teach them the basics.  Following the introductory course, we helped the team with the brainstorming process for their project and helped them as mentors.
“When I started studying at Technion, I didn't really know what I was getting myself into with Biotechnology.  I had no idea what that was or that it even involved genetic engineering of any kinds.  As a high school student, I was never exposed to the idea of genetic engineering, much less the possibility of doing it on my own! We've all heard the cliche that children are the future, but high school students are right on the verge of having to make the important decision of which life pathway to follow, making it a critical time to get exposure to as many fields as possible, including synthetic biology.  We went from seeing a group of high school student more interested in computer programming than listening to use, to seeing the team develop a complex and impressive genetic circuit.” - Yael
Naseeb Saida, one of the high school student who participated in our program, reviewed his experience:
“Taking part in iGEM and participating in such a great and incredible competition had given us a unique opportunity to work as real scientists and learning how to start a new whole idea from nothing, making it a new working system.
iGEM was a very challenging competition which demanded hard work from us trying to get the best results we can, At first it wasn't that easy to deal with the responsibility of learning many new things, to be able to start a new idea in a field that we knew nothing about.  However, the Technion students' team was right next to us, helping us in many different ways, enabling us to skip the hard difficulties we faced in our first steps. Their presence next to us the whole way"
Vanderbilt,2015,Team:Vanderbilt#Project#Sequence_-_-_TEXT.html," in vitro, we initially tried methylene blue. The advantage of methylene blue is that it releases oxidizing radicals in response to exposure to light, which would allow precisely timed oxidation exposures. Unfortunately, we found the presence of methylene blue interfered with electrophoresis in our samples, so we transitioned to a protocol based on the Fenton reaction, which utilizes trace amounts of iron (II) particles to catalyze the conversion of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into oxidizing radical species.
Just as with our highly-modified assay for detecting UV DNA damage, we had to demonstrate the same three conditions were true for the oxidation assay we developed. At a dose of 50 μM  H2O2, we had very good results, showing the conversion of supercoiled plasmid to a nicked form. As with extreme amounts of UV irradiation, we found 500 μM H2O2 will produce damage severe enough to convert plasmids to their nicked form without FPG incubation.
After validating our protocol, we began experimentation on our mutation-optimized sequences. With our RFP sequences, both control and optimized, we saw a third band present that was not visible in the original validation of the assay. Based on established information on the relative motilities of relaxed, nicked, and supercoiled DNA, we theorized that the newly-appeared top band represented plasmid in a relaxed conformation. Since the RFP plasmids were extracted in parallel, but the plasmid for the initial validation was not, variation in the negative control case of no mutagen and no enzyme would be expected. In line with this assessment, the relaxed plasmids behave as expected: they exactly parallel the intensity of the supercoiled plasmid, being converted like the supercoiled plasmid is upon oxidation and enzymatic treatment.
For quantification, we quantified the ratio of the intensity of the nicked band to the supercoiled band. The relaxed band was not included for the data reported below, although because it parallels the supercoiled bands, factoring it in does not greatly alter our results. Samples with less oxidation would have a lower ratio, since they would retain more supercoiled plasmid while having less plasmid converted to nicked. The same trends are seen when quantification is instead done looking only at decreases in the intensity of the supercoiled conformation.
Due predominantly to a low sample size, the reduction found in the RFP with minimized oxidation hotspots was not significant (two-sample t-test: n"

Unfortunately due to time constraint we were unable to aquire the non-HBCD incorporated polystyrene sugar to use for further tests.

UCLA,2016,Team:UCLA#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," the subunit level cleavage was disrupting the formation of the full cage.
These results thus demonstrate that specifically through the addition of a targeted enzyme, we were able to disassemble our protein cages, exposing the inside of the cage to the environment. The enzyme did not affect the wild type cages, thus it was only through our designed introduction of the cleavage site that this was made possible.
We thus show the concept that any similar proteolytic cleavage site could be added in place of the thrombin cleavage site we used, allowing for targeting of other enzymes. Additionally, the cage may be loaded with drug molecules which would be exposed only when in presence of the targeted enzyme to disassemble the cage."

Gel Purification
Reagents
Membrane Binding Solution
1 mL per each g of gel
Membrane Wash Solution
1200 uL
NF water
15 uL
Protocol
Weigh a microcentrifuge tube for each DNA fragment to be isolated and record weight
Use a UV lamp to excise the DNA fragment of interest in a minimal volume of agarose using a clean scalpel or razor blade
Transfer the gel slice to the weighed microcentrifuge tube and record the weight
Subtract the weight of the empty tube from the total weight to obtain the weight of the gel slice
The gel slice may be stored at 4°C or at –20°C for up to one week in a tightly closed tube under nuclease-free conditions before continuing purification
Add Membrane Binding Solution to the gel slice
Vortex the mixture and incubate at 50–65°C for 10 minutes or until the gel slice is completely dissolved
Vortex the tube every few minutes to increase the rate of agarose gel melting
Centrifuge the tube briefly at room temperature to ensure the contents are at the bottom of the tube
Once the agarose gel is melted, the gel will not resolidify at room temperature
Transfer the dissolved gel mixture or prepared PCR product to the SV Minicolumn assembly
Incubate for 1 minute at room temperature before centrifugation for 1 minute and discarding supernatant
Wash with 700µL of Membrane Wash Solution, centrifuge for  1 minute, and discard supernatant
Wash with 500µL of Membrane Wash Solution, centrifuge for 5 minutes, and discard supernatant
Centrifuge 1 minute with the microcentrifuge lid open to allow evaporation of any residual ethanol
Transfer SV Minicolumn to a new microcentrifuge tube
Add Nuclease Free water directly to the center of the column
Membrane should be completely covered with nuclease-free water

$$ K=\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}=\frac{(NR_p-[RL])(L_t-[RL])}{[RL]}=\frac{\frac{(NR_p-RL)(L_t-RL)}{{(VN_A)}^2}}{{\frac{RL}{VN_A}}} $$
Replacing $RL$ as $x$, we can have follow function
$$ x^2-(NR_p +L_t +KVN_A)x+NR_pL_t=0 $$
The solve of this quadratic function are
$$ x_{1,2}=\frac{NR_p+L_t+KVN_A\pm \sqrt{{(NR_p+L_t+KVN_A)}^2-4L_tNR_p}}{2} $$
According to the limitation $RL \lt R$,we remain this solve to calculate the concentration of ligand-receptor compound in the testing system.
$$ RL_t=x_1=\frac{NR_p+L_t+KVN_A- \sqrt{{(NR_p+L_t+KVN_A)}^2-4L_tNR_p}}{2} $$
Now we simply use the expectation of the activated histamine receptor in each cell,which is defined as $ERL=\frac{RL_t}{N}$ to approximate the reality.This figure below demonstrates the  relation between concentrations of histamine and the activated histamine receptor.

First, we took a glance at the input time series (activated histamine receptor) and the transcription fact (ste12active) which is the output of MAPK cascade.
In this figure, the degradation of activated histamine receptor (RL) and the output of signal transmission (ste12active) is demonstrated. We are surprised that the system -- GPCR and MAPK in series connection has a function of pulse broadening. This function is because the amplification of MAPK cascade, which ensures the output transcription factor is stable while the input is really low. Thus, this part of the cascade ensures the"

Determinate the DTT concentration making roGFP2-Orp1 completely reduced.
We added three different concentrations of DTT, 0.5mM, 3mM and 5mM. When DTT was added, the                         roGFP2-Orp1 should be reduced and the fluorescence ratio R should decrease.
Figure.5 Relationship Between R and DTT Concentration
(After Codon Optimization)
Figure.6 Relationship Between R and DTT Concentration
(Before Codon Optimization)
As shown, when the concentration of DTT was 3 mM, the fluorescence ratio R was no longer                         decreased with the increase of the DTT concentration. At that time, the cells were in reduced                         state completely.
Characterize roGFP2-Orp1 protein expression before and after codon optimization.
To exclude the influence of individual differences, we made cell be in the same state of redox                         by adding 5Mm DTT. In that case, roGFP2-Orp1 proteins were in the complete reduction state.                         Fluorescence intensity can characterize protein expression and we used fluorescence / OD600 to                         approximate the expression protein of roGFP2-Orp1 in single cell.

Therefore, the codon optimization improved the roGFP2-Orp1 protein expression successfully.

ALA - aminolevulinic acid
CPIII - coproporphyrin III
PPIX - protoporphyrin IX
After generating our theoretical ALA-protoporphyrin model and ALA-Mg-protoporphyrin model, we needed to test them experimentally.  Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), one important precursors in the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway, is also utilised in the production of heme in E. Coli. Ferrochelatase (encoded by hemH) is the last enzyme in the heme pathway, and responsible for the conversion of PPIX to heme. Therefore, by creating a dysfunctional ferrochelatase, we expect to interrupt the heme pathway, and thus push more PPIX into our chlorophyll pathway. For our experiment, we developed a mutant hemH E. coli strain that would theoretically be incapable of producing heme, and generating more PPIX instead. We visually observed the conversion of ALA to PPIX through a colour change from creamy to red. We also quantitatively assessed our experiment through spectrofluorescence.
Aim
To measure the production of protoporphyrin IX and Mg-protoporphyrin IX based on the parameters of our models.
Method
We produced four liquid cultures, one comprised of the mutant hemH E. coli strain, one with hemH and our Mg-cheletase plasmid , on with the hemH mutant, Mg-chelatase plasmid and IPTG, and the last as a control with competent DH5a E. coli cells. For each E. coli , we had ALA concentrations of 0mM, 2mM and 5mM as well as four separate tubes for removal on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 resulting in 45 tubes total (Mg-chelatase plasmid + IPTG had only 5 days). When the cultures had an optical density of approximately 0.8, we added components following the table below:

Our story – founding iGEM Stockholm
Our journey started in January 2015, when 18 students from two universities and 12 countries banded together to combine biomedicine with bioengineering. Right from the start, we knew that if we combined the engineering of KTH, Royal Institute of Technology, with the biomedicine of the Karolinska Institute, we could do something truly unique. Since then, the power of diversity has been the core of our team.
We found four excellent supervisors, two from each university. At this point, we still had no lab and no money, and iGEM was still an unknown concept in Stockholm. We only knew that we wanted to work on the problem of detecting disease biomarkers at an early stage.
We started raising support. We met with university faculty, advisors, student union officials and company representatives. We pitched iGEM, synthetic biology and our project to students and professors. We held workshops at high schools and got in touch with media to raise awareness of synthetic biology outside academia. Our efforts paid off, and we managed to secure the  registration fee from KI and a lab space and equipment from KTH. To bring the team to Boston we kept pitching to companies and university faculties over the summer and also started a fundraising campaign. Our project was also featured on the front page of Karolinska Institutets website!
After securing the lab and registration fee, we could finally start developing the project. In April, we decided to work with protein biomarkers and to use intrinsic bacterial signal cascades for signal amplification. We spent the rest of April and May meeting on evenings and weekends to research different possibilities. Throughout the summer, we adapted the scope to our results and kept evolving the project. Our hypotheses, experiments and parts are described on the rest of this wiki.

From early on we knew that we wanted to collaborate with other teams around the world. During the spring we got in touch with as many teams as we could. Our first partner teams were Uppsala, Aalto-Helsinki and Pasteur Paris. We organized a Nordic meet-up with Uppsala for 60 students from eight teams, iGEM chairman Randy Rettberg honored us by attending the conference. With Aalto-Helsinki and Pasteur Paris we have discussed the need for digital collaboration platforms for iGEM. Later we got in touch with even"

InterLab section is the biggest interlaboratory studies in synthetic biology starting from 2014 launched by iGEM. We were invited to participate in the Fourth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study as an 2017 iGEM team and finished all the experiments and measurements in early July.
As a half-engineering discipline, synthetic biology requires reliable and repeatable measurement, and that is the aim for the Measurement Committee of iGEM. By developing a robust measurement procedure for GFP, it enables people to directly compare measurements to debug engineered biological constructs.
In the fourth InterLab, we used a clear and precise GFP measurement protocol offered by the Measurement Committee and followed the steps. All the results have been submitted to the committee on time, which will contribute to the analysis and improvement on the protocol.
Detailed InterLab experiment data is shown here .

Basic orthogonal memory modules
This part is a combination of existing memory devices. In one time period, only one of these orthogonal devices in this part are ready to work. And each device only correspond to this time period, and respond to the inducer in this time period. We choose integrases to build this part. In the above animation, except Time 1 and Time 3 which serve as recording interval, Time 2 and Time 4 are corresponding to IntA and IntB respectively. Of course, any orthogonal memory devices can be used here with similar design.
Results
The orthogonality of the integrases
Overview
We have to ensure the orthogonality of our integrases because it is required for building sequential memory structures and basic orthogonal memory modules. Five serine integrases were obtained from the start of our project. They are phiBT1, Bxb1, phiC31, phiRv1 and TG1. We designed and conducted the experiment based on PCR, which implied good orthogonality between each of them, except for the crosstalk between phiRv1 and attB/P sites of phiC31.
Methods
Two plasmids are adopted in this test. Before conducting our experiment, we made competent TOP10 expressing transcriptional factors, which had already transformed with pUC19-LacI-AraC high copy plasmid(Fig.4 a). On the testing plasmid, all five attB and attP pairs are aligned together(Fig.4 b). Some notices of this alignment are listed here: 1. attB/P of one integrase are in opposite direction; 2. There is no nucleotide between former attP and latter attB; 3. Primer pairs(Fig.4 c) are designed to determine by PCR whether each attB/P has been inverted by the integrase. One of the five integrases is also expressed using PBAD controlled by L-arabinose. We tested each"

Automatic Modeling Database Language
We use a database to store all the information we need in modeling. In order to realize automatic modeling, we construct the database in unified format and make it machine-readable. Every component of database has its specified attributes and values, which makes the format of the database a unique yet standard database language. We call it MoDeL : Modeling Database Language by picking out characters from three words. MoDeL is based on XML language, which makes it flexible and extensible.

Introduction of MoDeL based Automatic Modeling Algorithm
Development of Modeling Database Language (MoDeL) aims to provide a platform that enables separation of work between modeling and data constructing. Users could obtain dynamic behaviors of various quantities and other properties of a biological system as the output of iGame while they know nothing about details of modeling and the reaction network. Previous modeling and simulation tools require users to construct the network themselves, which is very hard even for professional researchers. iGame has no such requirements and users are only required to input data about the initial environmental condition of system. Hence, modeling is a task that is performed to find all reactions and species in the system.
To complete the final network from initial environment conditions, we first break up the task to several parts:
(1) Setup initial conditions and environmental parameters read from the input file.
(2) Species produced are inserted into a list in the order of time. For each species, we search the database to find template species which could be matched to this species in structural pattern. If not found, then go for the next species.
(3) For each template species we found, we continue to search template reactions containing this"

Click on the different sections to learn more about our modelling efforts and remember to refer back to the above diagram to help understand how our ODE models                   reflect the phage life cycles.
Summary
Adapted a lytic model from literature to represent our initial plan for SBRC phage (no induction model).
Adapted model to include prophage induction
Determined all equilibrium points of temperate phage models and relevant stability conditions.
Estimated SBRC phage decay rate after noticing correlation between decay rate and burst size in a previous phage study.
Determined other SBRC phage and C. difficile parameters from our experimental data and a literature search.
Investigated and compared models analytically and numerically to determine which best suited our purpose.
Proposed a model for the correlation between phage concentration and induction rate. Although this model is not influential for SBRC phage, it should be noted by other teams studying different phage.
The main analytical result of our modelling work was the derivation of a condition that determines whether effective temperate phage therapy treatment can occur when prophage induction is allowed:
$\frac{(b-1)k_a}{d_P}>\frac{u}{c(u-q_0-d_X)}.$
Our estimated parameters satisfy this inequality so provided our antisense RNA and dCas9 contructs are effective at suppressing toxin production in lysogens this should lead to a stable population of non-toxigenic C. difficile and SBRC phage which would help to prevent reinfection. We also noticed with our induction model that initial phage dose is less crucial to effective treatment. This is particularly important since we gathered from Dr Cath Rees that high phage titre, are difficult to produce and would lead to a costly therapy. Therefore, the ability of our phage to be effective at a low initial dose should lead to a more affordable treatment. From these results we decided to allow SBRC phage to undergo prophage induction at its natural rate instead of preventing induction as we had initially planned.
Lytic phage model
Phage therapy that has been used to date has focused on using lytic phage to kill pathogenic bacteria. In this section we based our model of lytic phage-bacteria interaction on the delayed differential equations proposed by Campbell before adapting these equations in order to model a temperate phage.

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," also sfp and abrB genes for Sfp and AbrB proteins.
This system is a gene-regulatory network, where two different states are possible:
Formation of a naturally toxic bio-surfactant through sfp gene, which has antimicrobial properties that prevents the recolonization of the surface. The surfactant used is surfactin, whose production is activated by the sfp gene. This is the COAT option.
Establishment of a positive biofilm by the inhibition of the main biofilm repressor gene abrB. This is the STICK option.
Figure 2: The two possible states, surfactant formation for the top operon or biofilm formation for the bottom construction.
LacI and XylR proteins are called repressors. They bind to their respective promoters (Plac and Pxyl), thus preventing RNA polymerase binding. So proteins under the inactivated promoter are not produced.
There are also two inducers in the system: IPTG (isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) and Xylose (monosaccharide of the aldopentose type). In the absence of these inducers, both constructions are inhibited. If only one of them is present, the corresponding inhibition disappears and the associated construction is expressed.
Xylose Induction
IPTG Induction
For example, in the presence of Xylose, XylR proteins will form an enzymatic complex with their Xylose sugar. Thus, the inhibition of Pxyl caused by XylR binding will disappear, resulting in an enhanced production of Sfp, AbrB and LacI  proteins. Sfp production induces surfactin production, and AbrB production involves the repression of the formation of the biofilm. Eventually, LacI production will inhibit XylR production, so there will be stabilisation of Pxyl activation.
In opposition, in the presence of IPTG, LacI proteins will bind to their ligand, and Plac promoter will be free. So XylR proteins will be overproduced, limiting Sfp and AbrB productions. Thus, there will be no surfactin in the environment, biofilm formation can begin.
Aim of the model:
With this model, we pursue two main objectives :
1) Verify the design of the biological system, to be sure that the toggle switch is functional;
2) Predict the behaviour of this biological system depending on the presence of inducers to give usage guidelines for its industrialization.

Ethanol Production Parts
To optimize ethanol production in our EtOH strain, we wanted to overexspress the pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase B(adhB) enzymes in order to maximize the amount of ethanol being produced. The iGEM registry contained the part BBa_k1122676, made by Edinburgh in 2013. This part was compared to another plasmid containing pdc/adhB, donated by Dr. David Neilsen. The results indiciated that the BBa_k1122676 was the better ethanol producer, making it the key component of the EtOH strain. Registry page: BBa_K1122676
 
 
Fatty Acid Production Parts
In order to maximize the amount of fatty acetyl-coenzyme A molecules being produced in the fatty acid strain, two enzymes were targeted for overproduction. The first was the thioesterase A (TesA) protein, which takes the fatty Acyl-ACP produced from glycolysis and produces free fatty acid chains. The part BBa_K654058 codes for the TesA protein, but it did not have the required components for controllable expression. In order to do this, a promoter and an RBS were planned to be added upstream of this coding sequence. The RBS was successfully inserted, but we were unable to insert the promoter in time for the part submission.
Part Submitted: BBa_K1502000
The second part  This enzyme is coded through the four acc genes, labeled accA through accD. This parts were isolated through PCR replication using different primers. accA and accB were ready for part submission, but the accC part had two Pst1 sites within its sequence and the accD sequence contained an EcoR1 site. By using gene splicing thorough overlapping sequences (SOEing), the EcoR1 site on accD was removed. This means that the accA, accB, and accD parts were submitted to the registry.

As positive control for the infection process, we infected cells with pGreen-puro virus with which we previously demonstrated a visible expression of GFP and Puromycin resistance. As negative controls, cells were centrifuged with regular medium (no viral vector).
Results:
Wells which had cells that survived the process in them were transferred to bigger wells to grow and then RNA was extracted for qPCR analysis. We didn't manage to distinguish GFP expression in any wells that were infected with the IκBαM vector but as it was known that the expression is very weak, we went through with the following analysis. BV2 cells that were infected with pGreen-puro were GFP positive with high efficiency of infection so we concluded that the virus production and and infection were done properly in the technical sense.

One question we discussed in the seminar was about the pH value of the bandage. Wedecided to produce hydrogels in which the pH can be adjusted to the suitable value as different pH values can have different effects on various wounds. Of course, there are many more unansewered and unknown questions about the bandage before ChiTUcare could be produced and launched, but thanks to diagnost-x Berlin we were able to clarify some of the morst important onse.
Educating future iGEMers
German school Stockholm
During our stay in Stockholm with five of our team members, we had the opportunity to visit the local German school. There, we spoke to final year students about iGEM and synthetic biology as a field of study. Our goal was to engage in a conversation with them rather than just telling them about our experiences. We wanted to learn more about their thoughts and what they imagined biology to be. For this purpose, we designed an interactive presentation.  Even though it was still early in the morning, the students were eager to learn more about our work and readily responded to our questions. Especially towards the end, we had a great discussion about ethics in biological work. Unfortunately, it was cut short due to time reasons.  For us, it was great to see how younger people, yet uninvolved in science, perceived biology. It taught us that the students are willing to learn more and seek further education. We feel that it is our responsibility as young scientists to teach and inspire them to pursue this eagerness to learn. We want to thank Mrs Delp for giving us the possibility to have this informative and constructive session with her students. We really enjoyed it and learned about how to modify our lessons for other schools.

The experience in Stockholm taught us that we should focus more on including the students into our presentation, and to arrange enough time for discussion. On the 18 of October, three of us went to the Johanna-Geissmar Gymnasium (high school) and gave a lesson in two classes of senior students. We conducted a fifteen-minute presentation about who we are, what iGEM is and then showed them our e-learning platform CloneCademy .

Exeter,2014,Team:Exeter#iLOVCharacterisation_-_-_TEXT.html," The decrease in fluorescence caused by increasing photon energy to the maximum available to the TECAN is marginal compared to increasing the exposure time. Keeping the photon wavelength at 449nm allows for any photo-bleaching effect to be measured over a greater range of emission.
Figure 7 shows the fluorescence decrease of iLOV and GFP as a function of photon exposure time. Values are expressed as a fraction of the initial fluorescence measurement. The fluorescence decreases as exposure time increases flattening off at 0.955 times the initial measurement. This flattening is probably the results of the experimental method. As multiple wells where measured, increasing the exposure time also increased the recovery time between exposures. Using a single well for each experiment would have reduced this systemic error but would not have removed it.
Little difference in the loss of fluorescence between GFP and iLOV is seen in figure 7. The fluorescence of GFP appears to flatten out at a higher fraction of the starting fluorescence than iLOV, this may be because GFP is a larger protein and so has a area to dissipate energy over.
Figure 7 suggests that the loss of fluorescence is proportional to the amount of energy put into the system. The protein must dissipate this energy at some rate. As such a better parameter to change with regards to observing photo bleaching would have been the intensity of the photon source. In the future this would mean using a laser source.
Figure 7: The florescence decreases with exposure time plateauing after around 25 ms. A higher intensity source of phtons (A laser) would be needed to reduce the fluorescence further. There is little difference between iLOV and GFP for these expose times.
Figure 8 shows the recovery of GFP and iLOV after a 40ms exposure to 449nm photons. 40ms was the maximum exposure time that could be programmed on the TECAN plate reader. The maximum exposure time was used for this experiment as only one scan of its duration was needed, further scans exposed the proteins for just 100 $\mu$s. Both GFP and iLOV can be seen to be recovering from the extended exposure, however there was a large deviation amongst the measurements and the correlation was weak. Only five reads where used to measure the fluorescence in an attempt to limit any additional bleaching.
The true recovery rate of iLOV and GFP cannot be determined from the experiment. This is because the recovery rate could not be measured independently of additional photo-bleaching events. By t = 5:02 the fluorescence of iLOV and GFP had reached the lower limit of the bleaching effect seen in"

3.1 Chez Protein Causes Different Motility in CL1
We constructed an overlapping extension fragment and purified it (Figure 1A). Its partial function as a reporter is certified by the observation under the fluorescence microscope (Figure 1B). As you can see, no matter the vector with a GFP reporter we constructed or the official CheZ generator (BBa_K819010) can complement the swarming ability of CL1, CheZ lacking strain of MG1655, at a certain degree. This experiment proves the function of CheZ on swarming assay on the one hand. On the other hand, the swarming ability of complementary strain can’t fully recover to the degree of wild type or the wild type introduced with our constructed vector. We suspect that it is due to the poor survival ability of the knock-out strain .By the way it will support the future work of quantifying. （Figure 2）

3.2 Relationship between Promoter Strength and Swarming Ability
Because the swarming ability of neither CheZ mutant nor CheA mutant can reach up to the level of the wild type, and there is a balance between swimming and tumbling which controls the size of swarming rings, so, to better proof the practicality of our project, we tried to use different concentration of CheZ to investigate the best condition of swarming ability.

    Considering this design principle, we designed the gene circuit of warrior I and warrior II as follows.(Fig.2)
Fig.2 Improved gene circuit
    By combining the experimental data(See details at Orthogonality test ), we can find C4HSL can specifically bind to RhlR and then the complex binds to Prhl so that TetR can be expressed. Then TetR can bind to Plux/tet and inhibit the expression of LacI. By this circuit, we can see that even though C4HSL-RhlR can stimulate the expression of LacI by binding to Plux/tet directly, its stimulation of TetR at the same time can counteract this effect and so warrior I won’t response to C4HSL secreted by himself.
III Evaluation of orthogonality by model
1.Definition of gene circuit's orthogonality
    Like in the Orthogonality test of experiment part, gene circuit of two warriors is orthogonal when the AHL molecules secreted by warrior I can just activate the promoter inside warrior II, but cannot activate the promoter inside itself and vice versa.
2. Evaluation of gene circuit’s orthogonality in our model
    Here we use RFP intensity for simplicity (More details why we detect RFP intensity but not OD600 directly in the model can be seen at Fluid Model ) to indicate the level of LacI inside cell and thus its intensity inside each bacteria can be used as a relative measurement of the killing effect of warriors.
    Therefore, we can know the orthogonality in real time by measuring the change of warrior I’s RFP intensity with time with or without warrior II. (According to the experiment results,warrior II can just respond to C4HSL , so it is in accord with the orthogonality requirement and we do not consider the response of warrior II)
IV ODE, parameters and its resource
Note: This is part of fluid model to help us solve this specific problem. There are also small changes in part 6 to adapt to our experiment results. Detailed explanation can be seen at Fluid Model. Subscript 1 indicate warrior I, subscript 2 indicate warrior II. AHL1 is C4HSL and AHL2 is 3OC6HSL.

Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,".  Discovered some interesting patterns in fluorescence.  Saved all plate reader results in the Plate Reader folder on the iGEM computer.  However, it was quite apparent that we did not use enough cells in each well.  Our reasoning for this is that the graphs for plain media as compared to are almost identical.  To correct this problem, we propose adding more cells to the   We also discovered that the YPD we use in our lab has a significant amount of fluorescence in approximately the same range as EYFP.  Of course, we do not plan to use this media from now on, but it is quite good to know this.
Another important point concerning media is that the dropout media we have been using apparently contains glucose as its carbon source.  This presents a problem for all constructs that are under the control of the pGAL1 promoter (including all of our activators) because glucose very strongly represses the activity of this promoter.  It may also explain some of the results we saw today, seeing as all of the reporters specific to repressors are actually under control of the pGAL1 promoter.  We had originally been under the impression that all reporters were under control of the mCYC promoter.  However, while this would explain why we do not see any difference between the YFP of wells with transformed yeast and the YFP of wells with just media, it does not explain the same observation for mCherry.  Thus, we still maintain that we did not use enough yeast cells per well.

We: Can we lose weight by just stop eating anything? 
Coach: Yes. But, I must say that if you stay in the condition of hunger for too long, the cell in your body may gradually reduce the consumption of energy. Thus, as long as everything is back to normal, your weight will bounce back rapidly. So, to sum up,   how to maintain is far more important, and also, far more difficult.  
We: We’ve heard of some activists on weight losing. They even take methods such as liposuction and gastrectomy. What’s your opinion?
Coach: Fat will still accumulate after liposuction, and gastrectomy is an irreversible harm to our body. To be blunt, I’m on the side of disapproval.

Nutritionist
Motivation : When visiting the fitness coach, he suggested that we also consult a nutritionist, assuming that the answers agreed by different professions may be somewhat different. Based on the recommendations of the fitness coach, we found a nutritionist from Cheng Ching Hospital, hoping to get the answer that is beneficial to our project.
Highlight :
Processed sugar intake accounted for a person's daily calories required 10%
Excessive diet can hurt the body
The amount of calories required for a day minus about 400 calories is the most appropriate calorie needed for dieting
Fat is also one of the main causes of obesity
Note the control of blood sugar
Conclusion :
After this interview, we found that the point of discussion nutritionist and fitness coach stand are similar in many ways : for instance, going on diet should not be excessive, controlling  food and drink is important. These are complementary to what we want to do. This interview also let us adjust our project in order to support the public in pursue of a healthy and better life.

Cost/Benefit
The true benefit of using microalgae for antibody production is the          lower fixed cost of facilities.
CHO facilities, on average, cost around $200M for 80,000L. A similarly          sized algae facility at 15,000L would cost an estimated $1.3M. With          economies of scale, algae production facilities become significantly          cheaper. $1B would be a 14 Billion Liter algae farm (5,500 acres)          according to one techno-economic analysis [ 10 ].
The biggest challenge for microalgae will be improved productivity.          Because of fixed and variable costs, microaglae will not need to be 100%          as productive as CHO's (extremely unlikely in the near-term, given the          amount of research and time invested in CHO's), however, they will need          to improve 1-2 magnitudes over current levels. CHOs are far and beyond          the most efficient antibody producers, with some strains now exceeding          grams of product per liter of culture media. Furthermore, they are          entrenched in the industry: 61 of the 90 therapeutic proteins produced in          mammalian cells come from CHO's (Rader, 2015. Bioprocessing Journal).          Furthermore, of the 174 recombinant FDA approved drugs on the market,          only one is made by plant cells (Elelyso from carrot cell          culture).
An encouraging number is maximum biomass. Microalgae can quickly reach          high densities, with some culture conditions allowing biomass in excess          of 10g/L. With a higher cellular density, and significantly larger scales          for the same investment, microalgae may soon contend with CHO's.
Sources: Facility Volume vs Cost , Productivity , and Cell Density
Approach
Northeastern 2015 set out for the highest protein expression possible. The rationale for this approach was to counteract the typically low nuclear expression levels of heterologous proteins in C. reinhardtii. Therefore, the designed novel plasmid used pPsaD , a very strong promoter. While it was possible to make all the parts, the Gibson repeatedly failed.
We then shifted towards adaption of a plasmid from the Chlamy Collection: pOpt_mVenus. By surrounding the first promoter with the iGEM prefix and suffix, we created an iGEM compatible protein expression pl"

SynBioSS
The entire software suite can be found via the SynBioSS home page , or the Registry . The software suite is open source that runs on Windows, Macintosh and Linux. It does not require command-line programming and thus facilitates the modeling of biochemical reactions.
Future SynBioSS version
A detailed, draft specification for the next version of SynBioSS can be found here . We discuss a new database of models for all BioBricks.

Introduction
What is SynBioSS good for? Going from a BioBrick number to time profiles of probability distributions of molecules. An doing this quickly: users enter BioBrick numbers and the software pulls DNA sequence information from the Registry, then builds a network of reactions that represent all the biomolecular interactions, then simulates the network of reactions in time and generates probability distributions of molecules, such as GFP.
SynBioSS is made of three components: Desktop Simulator, Designer, and Wiki. The graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the Kaznessis lab have been developing the algorithms for stochastic simulations of gene regulatory networks. They have packaged those with a user-friendly GUI in SynBioSS Desktop Simulator.
Over view of the SynBioSS workflow from Hill et al. (2008).
Designer and Wiki are developed entirely by iGEM team undergraduate students (really, the graduate students don't know Python, PHP, or Javascript). Last year we developed the first version of these tools, which were stand-alone. This year we are developing and documenting SynBioSS Designer and SynBioSS wiki as new technical standards that support the design of BioBrick Parts or Devices, the construction of BioBrick Parts or Devices, the characterization of BioBrick Parts or Devices, and the analysis, modeling, and simulation of BioBrick Parts or Devices. This is occurring thanks to the connection with the BioBrick database. We are writing all kinds of scripts to fetch useful BioBrick information from the database to any user's desktop.

Because the colourful drawings are eye-catching and make the message which we want to deliver more comprehensive.
Video on promoting iGEM and introducing our team members
CUHK iGEM 2015 Let it Clone
Another video was produced aiming to promote iGEM in a more fun and interesting way. The reason behind this video was that we have realized not only does the general public lack the awareness of the existence of such a competition named iGEM, even our friends and families who have higher education in the field of Science and Engineering. Therefore, we chose the very well-known and popular Disney song among all ages - “Let it Go”, and changed the lyrics producing a parody called “Let it Clone”. The parody of the song “Let it go”, from the Disney movie “Frozen”, helps to highlight the friendly and fun “iGEM attitude”. With such a catchy song it is very easy to get the lyrics with the useful information into people’s heads. In addition, with this entertaining outlook, it would ignite people’s interest and curiosity toward iGEM. The names of all team members, instructors and professors are also shown in the last part of the video. Some members even sang and danced in the video aiming to gain more viewers from the public. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch8mYyFWF4I
3. Facebook page
We have also created a Facebook page of our team in order to post latest news from our team, like videos, photos, et cetera. This is to attract people to pay more attention on our team and the iGEM competition. Through posting photos and comments, it helps to bring this competition closer to people. Because the more chance they are exposed to it, the less strange they feel towards this technology and it assists on bringing a friendly image of synthetic biology. The eye-catching icon on our Facebook page was designed by one of our team members, which integrates our project with the iGEM 2015.
4. Workshop
As our target group is the younger generation, we have invited secondary school students to attend a one-day workshop held by our iGEM team on the 4th of July. This workshop was called “A day as a scientist in CUHK”, targeting students of F.4-F.6 from various Hong Kong secondary schools"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," or an EIS in some circumstances.
Safety
To ensure that our design was safe and good for the world we considered the following safety aspects.
Chassis
The chassis, which we chose, are all non-pathogenic and were selected within the design stage to minimise the risk, these were all strains of E. coli.
E. coli
The strains of E. coli we used are DH5-α and BL21-DE3, these strains are within safety group 1, like most E. coli strains these present the lowest level of risk to humans. Research commissioned by HSE (Chart et al. (2000)) showed that these lack the pathogenic mechanisms usually present within hazardous E. coli strains.
Cell-Free
From the perspective of safety, aspects of our project were advantageous due to their cell free factor. Within cell-free systems, random mutations and dissemination are not as likely. This utilizes cell extract for transcription and translation. Sonification and centrifugation steps remove the cell membrane. This makes them suitable for use outside of the lab, however in line with Newcastle and iGEM’s ‘Do Not Release’ policies, this was not carried out.
Arsenic
As we produced an arsenic biosensor, to characterise this biosensor arsenic is needed. In order to use arsenic, specific safety forms needed to be filled out within the lab, these COSHH forms detailed the use and possible hazards involved. For this, we had to assess the health risks and precautions, and provide the appropriate protection with reduced exposure. Our lab has appropriate ventilation and fume cupboards that can be used. The use of arsenic on the small scale that we needed was allowed within our labs. Arsenic is a groundwater contaminant of major significance to public health. Arsenic can also get into the body via ingestion and absorption, for this reason it is not used as a fine dust as it can be breathed in, which can cause serious health hazards. The health hazards related to arsenic range from irritation to internal bleeding for short term exposure. As arsenic was only used for characterisation, longer term effects did not need to be considered. The risk to team members working with this in the lab is set to as low, as 'reasonably practicable' , as it is with every hazardous compound.
Formaldehyde
Sarcosine Oxidase was used to transform glyphosate into formaldehyde so that existing biosensors can be used to sense formaldehyde, and therefore also sense this glyphosate. The concentrations produced when characterising BBa_K2205003 were detected at a minimum concentration of"

HEK293T cell line cultured in 10 cm plates was co-transfected with the CMV-VP64 or Timp1-VP64 vector and 2nd generation Lentivirus helper plasmids. Positive infection control viruses were produced in co-transfection with pGreen-puro vector and 2nd generation Lentivirus helper plasmids. 48 hours later, viral medium was extracted, filtered and used to infect cells.
The C3D30 cell line was infected with the virus immediately after extraction in 24 well-plates using the spinfection method. As positive control for the infection process, we infected cells with pGreen-puro virus with which we previously demonstrated a visible expression of GFP and Puromycin resistance. As negative controls, cells were changed with fresh regular medium (no viral vector). Also, another control was to infect with all vectors an easy to handle cell line HEK293T.
Results:
Six days after infection, selection began with 2 µg/ml of Puromycin , changing medium every other day. GFP was seen in HEK293T infected with pGreen-puro vector with low efficiency suggesting that the virus production was not fully successful. No GFP was noticed in C8D30 wells that were infected with the same virus.  Eight days after the selection began, all the control cells had died, meaning all surviving cells in the infection wells, had been successfully infected.

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

     1.Training for iGEM
The iGEM program requires the interdisciplinary abilities. To approach this purpose, we designed a series of trainings including computer programming, biological experiment skills, etc. (The following photographs illustrates the process) The collegiate team from Zhejiang University provides an opportunity which shows us how the biological experiments run.
     2. Pre-research of project
We distributed questionnaires and conducted survey in order to learn about the current knowledge of local peoples towards cultural artifacts in Hangzhou. The following diagrams are analyzed by the data. According to the data, the current situation of protection and renovating towards cultural artifacts and synthetic biology does not have bright prospects. The lack of attentions in civilians can cause the enormous negative effects on research and the practical usage, so we organized a series of activities to publicize the cultural artifacts in Hangzhou, the synthetic biology.(more details in Publicity)
     3.Publicity
(1)To acquaint students synthetic biology, our team’s human practice group publicize this subject several times during the summer break in our city including the danger and benefits of transgenosis food that was familiar and relevant to the citizens.  Furthermore, we upload the basic synthetic biology knowledge in our school’s official website for months and update the latest information or the experimental knowledge at a time period.
(2)We hold a presentation in our school to introduce the iGEM to our successors. It consists that the general ideas of iGEM, the specific parts which are totally different from the biology competition in China, the judgements, also Q&A section and the advantages of taking this competition. Our team leader Andrew Luo gave an excellent lecture.
(3)As we mentioned before, to introduce local citizens the importance of cultural artifacts in this city,  we sent out the specialized post cards with 7 different kinds of landscape seals and our team seal in order to publicize our project and the local artifacts protection at the same time.

By forming a structure from rods and linkers, and connecting them to gears, motors and some transmission chains, we finished our first version. The mechanism could print circular shapes, holding a needle fixed while moving the platform on which the ink was extruded.
In order to let the bacteria ink come out of the needle, the K’NEX printer was coupled to a syringe pump. The syringe pump is able to extrude the bacteria ink with an adjustable speed. The adjustability of the speed proved to be essential: if the extrusion speed is too high, the printed line becomes non-continuous. If the printing speed is too low, the printed line becomes too broad. Our challenge is therefore to make the perfect combination of the speed of the printhead with the speed of the syringe pump to get an optimal printing result.
Biolinker - Specifications
This first printer version was good for initial testing, but of course our goal is to make a printer which can print in all three dimensions! We therefore started building our K’NEX printer 2.0, also known as the BIOLINKER. For this version, we required a considerable amount of K’NEX pieces. But instead of buying them, we were lucky enough to find many enthusiasts that were willing to donate their toys for Science!
We started building the X and Y dimensions. By utilizing motors to rotate a gear mechanism that drives a belt for X and Y axes individually, we could move the printing needle in either of these dimensions. Afterwards, we added the Z axis by using a similar gear mechanism to move the platform on which extrusion is done. Moreover, each axis movement has two speed settings characterized further down in the page. We added this by switching the transmission on either a larger or a smaller gear, much like the mechanism found in a bike. Our final design was finished!
After testing and optimizing this design, we decided that it is good enough to make it our final version! You can see in fast forward how the printer can be built in less than one hour, if all steps are known and pieces available.
So we had our prototype, but was it any good? In order to find that out, we contacted the iGEM team from Groningen (NL) and asked for their help. They agreed to test our methodology of 3D printing bacteria by using our Biolinker prototype and even took it one step further by using a different bacterial strain, B.Subtilis. They succeeded at using our prototype and our methodology was also compatible with their strain. You can find the extensive report of our collaboration here.

Undergraduate
Hi! I’m Kristi and I am a fifth year student at the University of Lethbridge. I am currently in my last year of my undergraduate degree in Biochemistry. This is my first year as a advisor for the High school team and my second with iGEM. I love working in the lab and passing on experimental and theoretical knowledge. I hope to continue on with a masters in the upcoming year. A random fact about me is that my favorite scientific discovery to date is CRISPR-Cas9.

Hello! I am super pumped to be a part of the Lethbridge High School team this year. I am the Primary Investigator and it has been amazing working with all these awesome young people. I studied RNA modification enzymes in graduate school and love STEM outreach. This year’s iGEM team has continuously impressed me with their dedication, knowledge and creativity. I especially loved the music recital they organized. I hope you enjoyed learning about our project!
Dr. Hans-Joachim Wieden
Secondary PI
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.

Pathway optimization
gene knockout
In order to amplify the intensity of the signal, we need to knock out some genes in yeast, including ste2, sst2 and far1 which exist in the endogenous mating pheromone response pathways in yeast and respond to the mating signal and transduction of downstream signal.
Gene
Function
ste2
The GPCR of yeast pheromone receptor is Ste2 protein, which is an important factor during yeasts mating.
sst2
Sst2 protein is a phosphatase catalyzing GTP and producing GDP which will inhibit the release of Gγ、β subunits. Gene knockout of sst2 can improve the pheromone GPSTP.
far1
α factor is an active factor of the yeast pheromone GPSTP, which can cause the yeast cell cycle arresting in the G1 phase through Far1 protein, resulting in that cell growth is inhibited.
Gene knockout can be achieved by homologous recombination.
homologous recombination
By analyzing ste2, sst2 and far1 gene sequences from the NCBI, we ensured the appropriate homologous area in the upstream and the downstream of these genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. In order to knock out these genes effectively, we selected different lengths of homologous arms, 50bp, 200bp and 500bp. According to our experiment result, we found that 200bp and 500bp homologous arms worked more efficiently.
Fig.1 Homologous combination knock-out strategy
We designed 3 pairs of primers whose templates were the upstream homologous arm, the marker and the downstream homologous arm respectively. The markers were Histone synthesis gene, Uracil synthesis gene and Tryptophan synthesis gene, abbreviated as his, ura and trp. Initially, we got 3 fragments by PCR and they had their own overlapping areas with corresponding to each homologous arms.
Secondly, the recombination fragment obtained from OE-PCR was transformed to the CEN.PK2-1C which has been already"

UiOslo_Norway,2014,Team:UiOslo Norway#Safety#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," had been heavily debated for more than 20 or so years. The use of GMO has been especially controversial when it comes to its use as food for human consumption.
Here we can divide the ethical problems into three sections.
Ethical problems within synthetic biological methods. There are also questions dealing with the application of synthetic biology and those dealing with the distribution.
The distributional questions are related to IPR which stands for intellectual property right and open assess and the global socioeconomical effects of synthetic biology, as these problems are more ready being talked about unlike during the GMO debate.
The iGEM competition has an open access norm for almost all of it tracks except for perhaps Entrepreneurship track. This will of course apply if the teams in this track are to protect their intellectual property right in form of a patent.
Regulations – How are ethical issues being addressed?
Within the European Union (EU) the ethical issues are addressed:
There are Council Directives by the Council of the European Union on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms (90/219/EEC) and on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (90/220/EEC).
In Norway:
The Norwegian Gene Technology Act (Lov om framstilling og bruk av genmodifiserte orgamismer m.m. – Genteknologiloven) governs “the use and production of genetically modified organisms and cloned animals within an ethical and socially acceptable way in regards to the principle of sustainability and without any damage to health and the environment”. This act has several regulations and these regulations further elaborate the restrictions and usage of GMOs and others that the act applies to.
The University of Oslo’s safety and risk procedures are based on The Norwegian Gene Technology Act and its regulations.
Ethical concerns regarding our microOrganizer project
Let’s look at how the future of the micrOrganizer can fit into the three sections stated in a previous paragraph. Our project could fall into methods and application types of ethical issues. First being the bacterial organ concept which could be viewed as artificial organisms creating an artificial organ. As bacteria are living things with its own capability to propagate and have always existed naturally, it interpreted as strange to be bending the “rule of nature” and thus a conflict in our value system can occur. Some may argue that GMOs are also altered to bend to human needs, synthetic biology takes it even a further making it so that humans can create organisms we can “fully” control.  Biocomputing, being another application that can have implications on how we think about machines. Since the emergence of synthetic biology the line that separated"

Introduction
Pathogenic E. coli.
There are  1014 bacterial cells that naturally reside in the human gut, an order of magnitude greater than all the cells in the body. Humans enjoy a mutualistic relationship with intestinal microbiota, wherein the microorganisms perform a host of useful functions, such as processing unused energy substrates, training the immune system, and inhibiting growth of harmful bacterial species [1].  However, not all bacteria populations within the human intestine are benign. There are many pathogenic bacteria which cause a wide variety of diseases when present in the human gut. As one example, cholera is one of the most widespread and damaging of such infectious microorganisms, with the World Health Organization reporting 132,000 cases in 2006 [2]. But cholera is just one of many examples. In the United States alone, there were more than 325,000 hospitalizations from food-borne illnesses in the year of 2006 [3].
There are many medical treatments for food-borne illnesses, the most commonly prescribed being antibiotics. Unfortunately, antibiotics are indiscriminant and lead to rapid depletion of benign bacterial populations within the intestine. Due to this undesireable side effect, dietary supplements have been popularized which aim to introduce beneficial bacteria back into the gut after antibiotic treatment; these substances have been termed ‘probiotics’. Natural probiotics have two main advantages: they provide useful functions for the host and they competitively inhibit growth of pathogenic bacteria.
Natural probiotics do not convey any more advantages than bacteria in a healthy human intestine. Modern synthetic biology techniques should allow us to create an engineered probiotic that goes beyond the limitations of natural probiotics. The viability of such engineered probiotics within humans has already been established [4]. As part of a collaborative effort by the Caltech iGEM team to engineer a novel probiotic with improved medical applications, this project focuses on engineering a pathogen defense system within E. coli.
There are many ways for the engineered probiotic to combat pathogens in the large intestine; we chose to use bacteriophages. Bacteriophages present a novel and effective agent for eliminating pathogenic bacteria. Two important factors contribute to a bacteriophage’s effectiveness: bacteriophages are highly infectious and thus"

For information on the design of our BioBricks, go to the “Basic Parts” page under “Parts” in the menu.
For the plasmid backbones we inserted our constructs into, we used several plasmids developed and characterized by Dr. Susan Golden. The plasmids include pAM2991, pAM1414, and pAM1579 from Addgene.
Ribosome-Binding Site (RBS)
We decided to use the same RBS (BBa_K2596010) for every gene construct. The sequence used is “AAAGGAGGTTTAACCAA,” the end of part BBa_K390002. This includes the consensus RBS “AAAGGAGGT” from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and the Shine-Delgarno core consensus sequence. Even though this RBS is from a different species than our own, S. elongatus PCC 7942, the two species are very closely related and so the RBS should function normally in our chassis. The reason for choosing this RBS over one directly from our chassis is because finding a well-characterized RBS specifically from our chassis proved difficult.
Characterization of cscB: pAM2991
pAM2991 is an IPTG-inducible vector, designed for overexpression of a gene inserted into the multiple cloning site. pAM2291 (as well as the other backbone plasmids) can be found on addgene under the Golden Lab. The smR gene confers resistance to two antibiotics: streptomycin and spectinomycin. We selected for the vector in cultures using spectinomycin in DH10-beta competent E. coli (this strain is naturally resistance to streptomycin) and both streptomycin and spectinomycin in our cyanobacteria. Additionally, we linearized this vector by cutting with both BamHI and EcoRI; by cutting with two enzymes, we minimized the chance for spontaneous re-ligation. We used this vector to characterize our sucrose symporter BioBrick, cscB. We also used this vector in an attempt to improve the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) BioBrick by codon optimization; unfortunately,"

Abstract
This week we tried to mutate the vector however we failed.
Week 3
8.12.2012-8.18.2012
8.12.2012
We did nothing.
8.13.2012
We started to learn how to do our experiment under the guide of a warmhearted laboratory technician.
Here is the whole process of our experiment.
a. Centrifuge the test tube which contains DNA sequence for about 5 mins. This is to prevent DNA from escaping when we open the tube.
b. Add water to dilute the DNA sequence. The concentration is 100μM.
c. Oscillation and centrifugation.
d. Take out 10μL of the liquid and dilute it to 100μL.
e. Make a template for PCR.
f. Use PCR.
g. Electrophoresis.
h. After half an hour, take photos to check whether PCR production is successful.
We do this to mutate the enzyme restriction sites.
8.14.2012
We realized yesterday’s PCR production failed after checking the photos we took and decided to repeat the experiment with another polymerase because we don’t know what went wrong. But this experiment failed again.
We tried to do PCR again with the third polymerase. But this time we added another primer as a control group to see whether there is something wrong with our primer. To be surprised, we saw the right stripe we wanted on the picture.
I have been anxious about our experiment for days and finally had a good night today.
8.15.2012
We did an enzyme digestion to examine whether the mutation is completed. Here are the steps:
1. Design a 10μL system.
2. Put it into a incubator which has a constant 37℃ temperature.
3. Do an electrophoresis.
From the picture, we can see there was another stripe."

As stated above, we have been in constant touch as regards to general lab safety with our department’s lab safety officer Marc Pline and have adhered to all the basic safety protocols.
Combined efforts of all iGEM teams to ensure safety
With such a young iGEM team comprising of all undergraduates, there is a sharp learning curve associated with learning lab techniques as well as lab safety protocols. The Georgia Tech iGEM team attended biological laboratory safety classes which helped, but many things are being learned along the way. So, as an effort to make students aware about lab safety early on in their science careers, we will be combining a basic biosafety class with our outreach program at high school. Also, we propose using the media technology to generate an online, visual course on the basic biosafety issues that are specifically related to iGEM research process.

Read More >> According to Maria, there are three primary healthcare plans in Colombia: “the public service, in which every working adult must pay an amount of their income for health coverage, the private service in which, additional to the amount they are already paying, the person must pay extra for a wider coverage of specialists and medicine, and the SISBEN which is the health plan for people in low income areas that do not have a job or cannot contribute to the healthcare system economically”. There are other healthcare plans such as the compulsory health plan (Plan Obligatorio de Salud) which covers a variety of birth control methods. Maria uses this healthcare plan but didn’t realize that it covered birth control methods until she researched for this project. She also believes that not many people would know this either unless they researched like she did. According to Maria, birth control is generally supported in the more developed areas of Colombia, but in rural areas there is still stigma surrounding birth control methods. As a result, many women in the rural areas get pregnant in their early teens. Maria has experience taking birth control herself; she used birth control pills and states that “it is the most popular method around the community”.  A recent report given to us by Maria relays that birth control pills in Colombia were reduced in price by 50% so that more people can buy them. We are happy to see that Colombia is taking action to make birth control more accessible, but the issue of stigma still exists. We hope that our brochure may be of use to the rural communities in Colombia.

Zuleyka, Guatemalan Citizen
Zuleyka is a mother of eight from Mixco, Guatemala. She had her first child at the age of fourteen and faced several labor complications because she lacked the proper medical assistance to deliver her baby. Zuleyka birthed her baby on a dirt floor and relays that this is common among women in her area. Guatemala has one of the highest rates of pregnancy in South America due to their lack of access to contraceptives and prevalence of sexual violence (UNICEF). In her community, many people believe that their religious deity blessed every woman with their particular number of children, which makes many women question their use of birth control methods if it ""interferes with God's plan"". Zuleyka went through a similar internal conflict, as she wished she spaced our her children out to provide better financial support to her growing family.

Antibody characterisation
Why use microfluidics in our project?
As we went on with the conception of our BioPad idea, we soon had to find a solution to the question: where are we going to store our bacteria? We then came up with the idea of using a microfluidic chip as that could play the role of “container” and interface. Indeed this device fulfils most of our needs, as our support required to be cheap and easy to use. Additionally, the grid-like design of our chips, with their hundreds of chambers, was adapted to the need of having “pixels”, which would increase the precision of the readout. We also had the opportunity to use the expertise of our supervisors and to easily get in touch with the techniques of using microfluidics.
Moreover the PDMS allows the chip to be compressible and thus transmit the outer touch pressure to the bacteria in the chambers, hence we had our interface. Finally a simple but important point is the transparent colour of the chip which allows to scan fluorescence/luminescence through it.
How does it work ?
a. Disassembled view of a microfluidic chip showing all the different components and the region where bacteria/yeasts are located
b. Cross section of the chip showing how a valve works: when pressure is applied in the control channel, the ceiling of the flow layer is pushed against the glass slide, which closes the flow channel
c. When pressure is retrieved, the ceiling elevates again, which opens the flow channel
A standard microfluidic chip is a grid of interconnected channels and chambers. It is usually composed of one or two PDMS layers placed on a glass slide. In our case we used two layers, the so called flow layer and control layer. The bacteria are enclosed between the flow layer and the glass slide. By its shape, the flow layer is responsible for the patterns of the chip. In our case, the pattern consists of several parallel rows of chambers. The control layer comes on top of the flow layer and allows to open or close valves by pressing or releasing water in the corresponding channels. Thus a mechanical pressure can be applied from the control layer on the flow layer, enabling a precise compartmentalization of the chip.
Once the chip is ready to be used, small tubings of 0.35mm diameter are plugged in the inlets of the chip (see gif below). The tubings that are plugged in the control inlets are loaded with water and enable the opening or closing of valves. The tubings that are plugged into the flow inlets are used to flow bacteria"
