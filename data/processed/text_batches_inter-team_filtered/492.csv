Analysis
Lipid Analysis
Lipids were extracted from transformed E. coli using the Blight/Dyer method. (Please refer to the Lipid extraction lab book entry for further detail.)
Mass Spectrometry
Lipids were extracted from transformed E. coli using the Blight/Dyer method. (Please refer to the Lipid extraction lab book entry for further detail.)
The fatty acid content of the transformed cells was measured to determine whether it differed from the previously analyzed background lipid composition. This was done using mass spectrometry.
Bradford protein assay
A Bradford protein assay was carried out to assess protein concentration (Bradford, 1976).
Sequencing
We sent off samples to GATC for sequencing.
Results
The fatty acids were released by base hydrolysis followed by organic extraction, the resulting fatty acids were derivatised with diazomethane to the corresponding fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), together with fatty acid standards. The samples were analysed by GC-MS and the retention times and fragmentation patterns, compared with FAME standards. The results are shown in Charts 3,4 and 5.
By combining a number of genes, we were able to partially recreate the pathway described above (Fig. 4).
Due to time constraints, we were unable to submit a BioBrick containing the sequence of all of the necessary genes for the ω-3 biosynthetic pathway. However, we were able to express and characterise Δ12, Δ15 and Δ6 desaturases, the first three enzymes involved in ω-3 biosynthesis. As shown in charts 2, 3 and 4, the presence of alpha-linoleic acid (18:3Δ9,12,15), an omega-3 fatty acid, can be observed in E. coli. This does not occur naturally in their bacterial membrane.
Mass Spectrometry
Chart 2: ""Fatty acid methyl ester analysis""
C18:3 refers to an 18 carbon backbone with 3 double bonds. C18:2 and C18:1 would have 2 double bonds and 1 respectively. The upper portion of this figure shows the peaks generated by the standard expected fatty acid methyl esters.The lower 4 panels show mass spec fingerprints that are indicative of our fatty acids of interest.

NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," cells and the reduced of mucus layer thickness . When dendritic cells in                         the lamina propria sense these biomolecules, they release inflammatory signals to recruit                         immune cells, which exacerbates the inflammatory response. Microorganisms in the intestinal                         lumen pass through the leaky intestinal epithelial barrier, which further exacerbates the                         immune response against bacteria and creates a vicious circle. These immunological attacks and                         inflammatory injuries eventually lead to the death of intestinal epithelial cells [5]. IBD                         occurs when this condition persists without intervention.
3. A growing global disease
IBD is a global disease that is most common in North America,                         Western Europe, Northern Europe, Australia, and New Zealand [6, 7], which may be related to the                         higher level of industrialization in these regions [8]. There are more than 1 million IBD                         patients in the United States [9], and the medical burden associated with IBD directly exceeds                         $6 billion per year [10]. In Canada, more than 200,000 people have IBD, and the annual medical                         burden exceeds CDN$1.2 billion [11]. In Europe, there are more than 2.5 million IBD patients                         with an annual health care burden of more than €4.6 billion [12]. Due to the growing number of                         cases, huge medical expenses, the loss of work capacity of the sick and the aging of the sick                         population, IBD will place a heavy burden on the world in the next decade [7, 13].
4. Rising in the Asia
In the past few decades, IBD has shown a growing trend in low-incidence areas, especially in new                         industrialized areas such as Asia [14, 15]. This is likely to be related to the Westernization                         of residents' dietary patterns and the rapid urbanization process [16, 17].
Asia is one of the continents that experiencing fastest urbanization in the world [18], and                         there is a close relationship between urbanization and IBD [19]. In Asia, the high incidence of                         IBD is mainly found in some highly urbanized areas, such as Hong Kong, Macau and Guangzhou,                         while residents and rural residents in some less industrialized areas show lower morbidity                         [14]. People who flood into cities have access to better health care and sanitation, but the                         abuse of antibiotics and overly hygienic habits can interfere with normal gut flora [5, 20]. In                         addition, due to the poor quality of air condition, heavy mental stress, a more sedentary"

The celadon cells show the dogs is in state-1 and the bright green cells show the dogs is in state-2. The dog in state-2 has higher immunity. Initially, we put a certain percentage of immune dogs (in state-2) into an area. The immunity will spread around centered on the immune dogs. Figure 3C shows us that the dogs in the area are in higher level of immune state. Subsequently, the immunity comes back to a lower level. Then, it returns to high level again. The immunity will fluctuate but with a decreasing amplitude. If the value of PRO is higher than value2, the dog has immune power. As the extension of time, the immunity of the whole area converges to a certain level.
The simulation result is shown in Figure 4.

Model Results
Used Parameters
Before we could generate results with the model, we had to define some parameter, like concentrations and Kd-values. The Kd-values we found in the paper of den Hamer[1] and appeared to be 66 μM for the Inducer to the scaffold, 1 μM for the Binding Partner with the Center Point and 0.25 μM for the Binding Partner to the Scaffold. The Kd-value could then be used to calculate the association or dissociation rate, as long as you know the other.  For the association rate, we used 105 M-1s-1 as found in the paper of Schlosshauer [2] and is the average diffusion limited association rate they calculated for different proteins. In reality, our constructs probably are more diffusion limited than they calculated, as our construct are very large proteins and therefore will experience much more resistance.
Results Description
In Figure 1 you can see that we use an excess of the Inducers and that the amount of inducers decreases over time but this decrease stagnates after some time. This is because all the pockets of the scaffold construct are already filled with the inducer. Data supporting the inducer excess is also shown in the figure, as the amount of empty scaffold sites decreases at the same rate as the inducer. Furthermore, we see that the induced scaffold sites are very high in the beginning. Our initial state is defines as that the induced amount of scaffold sites starts at 0, this is supported if you look closely to the data, but it increases so fast, that it is not visible with a logarithmic time scale. Another thing that stands out in the graph, is that the green graph (the one of the Binding Sites for the CenterPoint) is not visible in the figure, this is because these values are about the same as the ones of the CenterPoint Sites. They decrease at the same rate, because they are both used for the formation of a bond to create a complex and have about the same initial amount of molecules. Another thing that supports the graph is that the"

EtnR2: PsiPred – Secondary structure prediction
The UCL Bioinformatics PsiPred tool was used to predict the secondary structure of EtnR2 based on its amino acid sequence (Figure 3). The putative helices and sheets were generally predicted with high confidence.

EtnR2: SwissModel Homology Modelling
The SWISS-MODEL server [1-4] is an automated service that selects the best matching template to a submitted amino acid sequence, performs the alignment and builds a 3D model. The most important limiting factor of the quality of the model is generally the matching of the query sequence with an appropriate template. SwissProt threaded EtnR2 onto a selected template protein: flagellar accessory protein FlaH from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. It is a conserved component of the archaeal flagellum system.
Based on the structure of the template, a homology model was constructed (Figure 4). The predicted structure consisted of a parallel beta sheet surrounded by alpha helices.

Greenhouse Effect
The Greenhouse Effect. Increasing levels of greenhouse gases enhance the amount of heat retained, causing the atmosphere and earth's surface to be warmed.
Solar radiation powers the Earth’s climate system. Considering that the Earth’s temperature has been nearly constant for many centuries, the incoming solar energy must be nearly in balance with the outgoing radiation.
Nearly half of the incoming short-wave solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth’s surface. The amount of short-wave radiation reflected back to space by gases and aerosols, clouds and the Earth’s surface is around 30 %, the rest of it is absorbed in the atmosphere. The long-wave radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface is to a great extent absorbed by certain atmospheric constituents such as water vapour, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and other greenhouse gases. The downward directed part of this longwave radiation adds heat to the lower layers of the atmosphere and to the Earth’s surface, which is known as the greenhouse effect.
As a natural process, the greenhouse effect makes for an average temperature of 15°C on Earth.  Without the gases in the atmosphere, the average temperature would be about -18°C. Humans increase the greenhouse effect directly by emitting greenhouse gases such as CO2, CH4, N2O and chlorofluorocarbons. Furthermore, pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2), which by themselves are insignificant greenhouse gases, have an indirect effect on the greenhouse effect: They alter the abundance of important greenhouse gases such as CH4 and ozone (O3) through chemical reactions or by acting as precursors of secondary aerosols.
The enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect results in significant warming of the Earth’s surface and therefore leads to a"

We assumed 63% of the cancers we detected would be in stage 1 as in the National Lung Screening Trial [18] We then assumed that the detection of the other cancers would be evenly distributed through stages 2-4. This is unrealistic for a mass screening programme, as cancers not picked up in stage 1 would likely be picked up in stage 2. This would decrease the cost per QALY as the probability of cure in stage 2 is higher than the average of stages 2-4 and treatment in stage 2 is cheaper than the average cost of stages 2-4. [19] Therefore our model would underestimate the cost effectiveness of our sensor.
In terms of a screening tool, sensitivity relates to the false negative rate, while specificity relates to the false positive rate.
A 100% sensitive test will always pick up the disease but may also pick up patients that do not have the disease (no false negatives).
A 100% specific test will never pick up healthy patients but may also miss patients that do have the disease (no false positives).

Sensitivity was taken as 100%, as with appropriately set cutoffs our tool would identify everyone with NSCLC. This is likely to prove untrue were our test to be validated with miRNA levels in a large patient cohort - though sensitivity would still be very close to 100%. Therefore, P(False negative) = 0. However, we included it in the calculations anyway, as later we show that even if sensitivity was significantly less than 100% our test would still be cost effective. We assumed as a lower bound that false negatives will not survive - in reality, some will be detected at a later stage and survive - but were we to have included that, it would have resulted in additional QALYs gained not due to our sensor, meaning we chose to exclude them.
The specificity of our test would be 84% when sensitivity is 100%. [20]

The third way is making Janus and cutinase into fusion protein, which is a novel work that could increase cutinases' activity radically.
Figure 11. Three ways of hydrophobin addition.
Furthermore, we develop comprehensive and innovative models on Janus-enhanced plastic enzymolysis. We make a good combinaton of thermodynamics and dynamics, and a novel kinetic model is built to better describe the enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis of PET by combing the Michaelis-Menten equation with the Langmuir equation. Meanwhile, we propose models to describe the effect of Janus into the hydrolysis system based on the hyphothetical elementary reactions using the result of self-asembling model and the novel kinetic model in the first part. Thirdly, to visualize the result of our modelling, we write a program using MATLAB which simulates PET degradation process. (Click here to see more about our models!)

On the last day of the event, we visited apiaries with visitors from Mexico city, Chile, Cuauhtemoc city and other states of the republic. We went to visit two apiaries, one of them was exclusively for breeding queen bees and the other one was for honey production. We were taught how to differentiate between the different types of bees, for example between drone bees, queen bees, and worker bees. We saw larvae in their cells and visualized a worm that parasites bees. It was an incredible experience for us.
Trough the three days, we applied surveys to beekeepers to obtain more information on foulbrood in the country. Beekeepers from a variety of ages and states answered these surveys. We had a total of 16 answered surveys. We confirmed there had been the presence of American and European foulbrood in Mexico in the last seven years with an increase in the previous 3 years. Terramycin is the most used treatment to combat this diseases. When we asked how much would they be willing to invest for a product that combats and prevents this both diseases and in general strengthens the immune system of bees, 50% of the surveyed said they would pay the necessary.

In this section the results of our experimental work is described. In short 4 biobricks are made. One of the biobricks are amplified by PCR and USER-fused to a TEF promoter to demonstrate that the biobrick works. The Redoxilator construct which we designed is transformed into yeast together with a copy to check if our minimal promoter is leaky. In total 5 strains are characterized in a 40 hour fermentation showing growth and GFP fluorescence in 4 different carbon sources.

Abstract
Iron deficiency affects 2 billion people -or over 30% of the world’s population – and can lead to anemia, ill health, and even death [1] . Surprisingly, this deficiency is typically not due to a lack of dietary iron, but rather due to low bio-availability, and thus poor absorption of iron. Phytic acid is a prevalent chelator of iron and other nutrients in food. Our mission is to build a system that breaks down phytic acid in the digestive system, releasing bound iron for the body to absorb. Our solution comprises two engineered components: a module that constitutively produces phytase to break down phytic acid and a pH-sensitive module that causes cells to lyse and release the accumulated phytase in the stomach. If successful, our strain would be a low-cost sustainable solution to preventing iron deficiency without the need for constant supplies of iron supplements.
Purpose
Our team focused on ameliorating nutrient deficiencies in developing countries. The three main nutrient deficiency disorders listed by the World Health Organization are vitamin A deficiency (VAD), iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). We chose to focus on iron deficiency anemia, which is ""the most common and widespread nutritional disorder in the world.""
Research in low-income countries has demonstrated that iron deficiency arises not from a lack of iron in the diet, but rather from low bioavailability of iron in the diet. Low bioavailability is due to phytate-mediated chelation of iron in a state that the body cannot absorb. Indeed, phytate (or phytic acid) is a major component of plant tissue; it is the principal form of storage of phosphorous in many plants including grains and legumes [2] [3] [4] . This suggests that iron could be made more readily available without a change in diet by simply dechelating the iron (and other nutrients) from the phytate.
Phytase is an enzyme produced by bacteria and fungi that breaks down phytate. Our goal is to produce a probiotic that will release phytase into the body, thus increasing the bioavailability of iron. Since many communities"
Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#IntegratedHP_-_-_TEXT.html," we decided to use this strain. We optimized our sequences for an E. coli expression, and adapted them to its secretion system by adding export signals. This way, our construction could be broadened and used in a different type of bacterium. To replicate our plasmids, we used Escherichia coli DH5 alpha and to secrete our proteins, Escherichia coli BL21De3 pLys S.
Conceptualizing our Proof of Concept
When conceptualizing our proof of concept device, we decided to design a microfluidic chip to simulate the actions that would occur inside the patient’s body. The chip would be capable of measuring the neuronal signal as well as the conductivity of the biofilm, letting us know whether our system would work correctly inside a prosthetic. After talking with many professionals such as Dr. Heng Lu (ESPCI) and Dr Ayako Yamada (ENS, Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris), we first designed a PDMS microfluidic chip with a vitreous carbon electrode to measure the signals. After talking with Dr. Catherine Villard (Institut Curie, Paris) and Dr. Frederic Khanoufi (University Paris Diderot—ITODYS), an electrochemist, we realized this type of electrode was highly sensitive, perhaps too sensitive for our type of device, and not adaptable to the size of our microfluidic chip. Guided by their advice, we switched to gold electrodes and started the fabrication process of the different type of chips at the Pierre Gilles de Gennes Institute. After attending the iCOE 2018, we learned about PEDOT (poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate ), and its conductive properties. As we also wanted to confine our bacteria so they would not harm our neuronal cells, we partnered with Sterlitech , and tested nanoporous polycarbonate membranes coated in gold as well as nanoporous alumina oxide membrane coated in PEDOT: PSS, PEDOT: CL and PEDOT: TS. This way, we could still measure the neuronal signal and the conductivity of the biofilm while protecting the cells from getting eaten by the bacteria.
Designing the interface between the tissues and the prosthetis
When we started to think about the scientific aspect of our project, we also started to design and think about how our biofilm would integrate into a physical medical device. First, we wanted to design a full prosthesis. We realized that it wasn’t the core of the problem. Indeed, the technology missing"

However, the metabolic pathway was too long to ensure the efficiency.                     we showed our query and suggested they simplify the pathway which decreases the stress of E.coil and                     the difficulty of plasmid structure. After their comprehensive consideration, they adopted our suggestions.                     Nevertheless, when team “SiCAU-China” showed that they would remold tomatoes to meet the need for                     engineering production of breviscapine. We suggested that they could consult Zhang Yang, a professor                     in SCU who had tried the expression of breviscapine. In our perspectives, the professor's experience                     may benefit theirs for optimizing the project and improving the efficiency. What's more, we intended                     to transfer the code sequence in E.coil and regulate it through “Minimid”. Fortunately, “UEST-China”                     and “SiCAU-China” reminded us of the difficulty to transfer code sequence in a genome. So we amended                     the experimental project that could avoid repetitively useless work in a further experiment. Furthermore,                     communication and cooperation were existing as well as in the meet-up.

At the same time, the union was propitious to the development of iGEM in southwest China. We are looking                     forward to the coming of new friends and bringing iGEM in southwestern China to a new stage.

Methods
Sequence Design
Primers were designed with the aid of PRIMER3. The sequence of synCGβ was codon-optimized in Gene Designer for expression in bacteria based on the the nucleotide sequence of hCG-β from NCBI .
Isolation of Phage and Phage Genome
Phage genomic DNA was isolated from purified phage using the QIAamp Viral RNA kit, which is suitable for isolation of viral RNA and DNA. Phage was amplified, titered, and isolated using protocols which are available on our OpenWetWare page .
Cloning
Plasmid from the BioBrick distribution kit containing the pSB1C3 backbone was transformed into chemically competent DH5α E. coli using a 20 second heat shock at 42°C. Transformants were grown on LB/chloramphenicol (20μg/μl) plates overnight, and plasmid was isolated from inoculations of colonies. Restriction digests were carried out using NEB enzymes and protocols, and the digested product was isolated by either QIAquick PCR cleanup kit or ethanol precipitation. In order to reduce the chance of self-ligation, 5’ ends of the backbone were dephosphorylated by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) treatment (Promega protocol) and cleaned up.
BioBrick inserts were prepared similarly, with restriction digests and clean up; however, some inserts underwent initial PCR amplification to add BioBrick prefixes and suffixes, and no inserts were CIAP-treated. Ligations were carried out (3 hours at room temperature with T4 DNA ligase from NEB) using various ratios of vector:insert, and immediately used to transform chemically competent DH5α. Transformants were plated, colonies were grown up, and plasmid was isolated, PCR-amplified, and run on agarose gel to confirm presence of insert.
An additional cloning step was carried out to insert wild type hCG-β into the pET-30a vector under the control of the T7 promoter and lac operator. The resulting recombinant gene included a C-terminal His-tag. This plasmid was used for initial characterization of hCG-β.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"  Due to this difference in their orientation, the two     strands replicate differently.
A short piece of RNA sequence called primer (produced by an      enzyme called primase) binds to the end of the leading strand      (3’ to 5’). The primer acts as the starting point for DNA      synthesis. Thereafter DNA polymerase binds to the leading      strand and starts adding new complementary nucleotides to the      template DNA in the 5’ to 3’ direction.
The replication process for the lagging strand (5’ to 3’)      involves multiple RNA primers binding at random points along      the template DNA. This leads to the formation of short chunks      of DNA in the 5’ to 3’ direction, called Okazaki fragments.
Once the bases pairs are formed (A with T, C with G), another     enzyme called exonuclease dissociates the primer from the DNA     strand. The gaps are filled by complementary nucleotides and the     new strand of DNA is proofread by DNA polymerase. Finally, an     enzyme called DNA ligase seals the sequence of DNA into two     continuous double strands, following which the new DNA     automatically winds up into a double helix.

His work     revolutionized the process of making millions of copies of a scarce     sample of DNA, and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, 1993.     The procedure follows the basic principle of DNA replication in     vivo. A small amount of the DNA containing the desired gene of     interest is aliquoted into a tube consisting nucleotides, primers     (pair of synthesized short DNA segments, that match segments on     each side of the desired gene), DNA polymerase enzyme and a buffer     that allows optimal activity of the polymerase enzyme. Thereafter     the tube containing the mix is subjected to cycles of repeated     heating and cooling which leads to amplification of the gene of     interest.
The first step in a regular cycling event involves heating      the mix to 94–98 °C for 20–30 seconds. It  disrupts the      hydrogen bonds between the complementary base pairs, yielding      single strands of DNA.
This is followed by lowering of temperature to 50–65 °C for      20–40 seconds, allowing the primers to form hydrogen bonds and      bind to the single-stranded DNA template. The polymerase binds      to the primer-template hybrid and"

iGEM being a competition between students, we worked as independently as possible. Once having been taught all the useful procedures, we did them on our own and analyzed the data before presenting them to the instructors and teaching assistants on our weekly meetings. We also planned the experiments needed to be done each week.
Being a small group, each student specialized on one part of the project, such as using the MITOMI or creating the T7 promoter variants. This allowed us to spend less time on learning the procedures; especially true for the microfluidics setups. The different parts of the project are detailed below, with the name of the student that worked on each task. The teaching assistants were assigned to the different tasks based on their personal competence; this does not mean that they completed the task, but rather that they taught us how to do it and answered our questions relative to it.

When collecting data, we simply replace the ID “B0034” with other bricks’ ID.
We then extract information from the websites. The information includes Com_id, Author, Enter_time, Ctype, Part_status, Sample_status, Part_results, Star_rating, Uses, DNA_status, Qualitative_experience, Group_favorite, Del, Groups, Confirmed_times, Number_comments, Ave_rating, Des. And we take 12 of the above factors into account when we're scoring biobricks.
As for optimizing the weight of these factors, we firstly analyze the distribution of value of the factors to choose the factors that can distinguish the parts most effectively. Then we select 40 parts and 40 devices as the training sets. Finally we get the weight by combining results of several methods. The optimized weight is set as the default weight.

1.Scores for different values of factors
To build a scoring system, we start at giving scores to the values of these factors. With the help of wet lab researchers, we rank the values of discrete type according to their effect on researches, and choose a relatively good method to transform successive values into values between 0 and 1.             For discrete values, we have a scoring table as below.

For cloning into this plasmid, we removed our genes from PSB1C3-HNS, PSB1C3-HNS-T108I, PSB1C3-PotB59/PomA plasmids with BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Then we ligated the cut gene with pET45-b which was cut with the same enzymes. We transformed ligated products into BL21 bacteria strain that we know it has T7 RNA polymerase.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was performed with T7 Promoter Forward and T7 Terminator Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly the band should be 360 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, then bands are expected to be at 744 bp line for HNS and HNS-T108I, 2045 bp line for PotB59/PomA.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check for a second cloning control. We used BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes for cut-check.

DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#ExperimentalDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," by snake venoms from across taxonomical families.
We found a suitable peptide substrate in literature [11], and we conducted our initial experiment to test our hypothesis with that specific peptide. The results can be found here .
Substrate screening
In order to distinguish different snake species, we needed to be able to detect enzymatic activity that was unique to the given species. Our study of literature indicated that some proteases found in the snake venom, are unique to the venom of the Viperidae family [2]. For this reason, we decided to focus specifically on these proteases.
One of the most efficient ways to study protease activities and substrate specificity is the incubation of a collection of potential substrate peptides with the proteases, or in our case, the venom of interest.
As a collection of these substrates, JPT Peptide Technologies’ Protease Substrate Set was found to be the one more suited to our needs. This set is comprised of 360 peptides derived from cleavage sites described in the scientific literature. These peptide derivatives contain the cleavage site sequences, flanked by a quencher molecule (DABCYL) and a fluorophore Glu(EDANS)-amide at the N-terminus and the C-terminus, respectively.  Subsequent to incubation with the snake venom, these two moieties are separated. The emitted fluorescence can be detected using standard microtiter plate readers. An illustration of how the substrate screening works can be seen in figure 5.
Figure 5: Illustration of how the substrate screening works from JPT .
The results of this experiment can be found here .
Biosensor design
Our team aims to develop a novel biosensor to detect and distinguish between snake venoms from different families of snakes. Our biosensor is based on the different proteolytic activity of snake venom from different species.
The biosensor consists of a fusion protein. Inspired by the design of different FRET reporters, our fusion protein contains two larger protein domains, separated by a flexible linker containing one or more substrate sequences. However, unlike FRET reporters, where fluorescent proteins make up the two larger domains, the two large protein domains in our biosensor are a chromoprotein domain and a binding domain. The linker between the two domains is designed to contain the specific cleavage sites found through the previously described AMC- and substrate screening experiments.
In this project, our team has used the RFC[25] standard (Freiburg standard) to assemble our protein domains in-frame. The standard RFC[10] standard of the iGEM competition does not give the option to"
UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," finding a hit. We weren’t completely sure if FabI only reduced carbon-carbon double bonds, so we tested valeraldehyde to see if FabI could reduce the aldehyde to an alcohol. To see if FabI could reduce the C-C double bond of an unsaturated carboxylic acid, we tested crotonic acid. We then tested three unsaturated aldehydes, just like crotonyl-CoA, but without the CoA moiety. And finally, to try and find potential acyl carriers, we tested bulky substrates with rings (phenyl acetaldehyde, p-anisaldehyde, and 3-(5-methyl-2-furyl)butanal).
We discovered enzyme activity on the three unsaturated aldehydes (trans-2-pentenal, 2-ethyl-2-butenal, and trans,trans-2,4-heptadienal), but had no activity on any of the other substrates!
We found the enzymes were most active on trans-2-pentenal. There was no measurable enzyme activity using the other 5 substrates. This is highly consistent with the enzyme mechanism in which an allylic double bond is reduced when adjacent to an activating group, such as an electrophilic carbonyl (e.g. an aldehyde or thioester).  Furthermore, crotonic acid has a less electrophilic group adjacent to the allylic double bond, highlighting the high selectivity of FabI for the electronic structure of its substrates.
While significant activity is observed on these alternative substrates, there was a decrease in overall enzyme activity relative to the near-native Crotonyl CoA substrate of ~100-fold. This made it so >500nM enzyme is needed to see enzyme activity in assays.  In order to be used to detect relevant levels of TCS in wastewater the enzyme must have measurable activity at concentrations lower than the concentrations of triclosan in wastewater ( up to 9nM).  Therefore, we have begun to explore the use of enzyme engineering to enhance activity on trans-2-pentenal!

Fortunately a crystal structure for the P. falciparum FabI enzyme had already been determined[28]. We used the computational tool Foldit (See 1 ,

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,"In order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions"

Such function save lots of time for users to look for information about all parts involved in a genetic circuit one by one. And the data base, the iGEM official website, is of great authentic credibility.
Is the software well designed for a synthetic biologist?
Yes.We began to develop Synsketch because genetic circuits play a significant role in synthetic experiment,however, the diversity in styles of circuits not only hinders learners of synthetic biology, but also costs synthetic biologist lots of time to complete a standardized genetic circuits by using the current graphic design tool.So we design a software tool called Synsketch.Synsketch is a standardized software tool especially for synthetic biologists,so it can help synthetic biologists save lots of time creating a standardized genetic circuit.
Would a non-technical person understand the software?
Yes.Synsketch is really easy to use.If a person want to use Synsketch to design a genetic circuit,he or she needn’t to be technical.He or she just need to click the element(For example:RBS) and then drag it to a proper place.After combining all the elements in a picture,a genetic circuit is finished.Besides,for those who begin to use Synsketch for the first time,we have prepared an illustrated course to help them understand Synsketch quickly.
Would a software developer want to use this as a platform for more work?
Yes.Synsketch provides a platform for people to communicate with each other.People can use Synsketch not only to design,share,and edit genetic circuits, but also to join Synsketch community.Our Synsketch website has functions of creating personal account,selecting languages,reading books and watching videos, and communicating with others.Synsketch has wide development space.For its further development,we decide to make Synsketch become a free App.We will combine and develop all the existing functions and add more new functions to Synsketch.We welcome software developers to give us some useful advice as well as use Synsketch as a platform for more work.
How well is the software using and supporting existing synthetic biology standards and platforms?
Synsketch is a tool for standardization.We create Synsketch on the purpose of using and supporting existing synthetic biology standards.Synsketch provide a standardized model for people to design genetic circuits both quickly and efficiently.If Synsketch is successfully promoted among iGEM community,we will get unified visual effect.That will strengthen synthetic biology standards.For synthetic biology platforms,we build up Synsketch community.Synthetic biology lovers can use our Synsketch community as a"

Applied Design
iGEM Manchester-Graz’s took the first steps in the development of a novel technology for drug delivery by developing self-regulating, drug-producing bacteria. In the near future, they could be incorporated into patients’ gut micro flora to secrete medicines directly inside the body. We focused on the late stage treatment of Parkinson’s disease, for which the current treatment involves the oral administration of L-DOPA. Our talks with experts ( Interviews ) in the medical field showed that one of the common side effects of oral L-DOPA treatment is rapid depletion of the jejunum, were L-DOPA is mainly absorbed. Consequently L-DOPA cannot continue to be administered orally and a PEG-PEJ tube needs to be installed surgically. This way L-DOPA is injected continuously direct into the jejunum in lower concentrations (20-200mg/h) via an external pump. This so called Duodopa® therapy is not only a massive decrease in quality of life for patients, but treatment costs also accumulate to over $100,000 a year per person. ( Interview with Dr. Högenauer )
Fig 1 Administration of L-DOPA via bacteria in the patient's gut
By working closely together with patients, experts in medicine and industry representatives we tried to design the system in the most effective way. Our regulatory system is designed to produce L-DOPA in vivo in the jejunum using probiotic bacteria such as E. coli Nissle 1917. Our Modeling Results indicate that our system is capable of producing up to 81.9 mg/h/L, which would be more than sufficient to replace Duodopa® therapy. We focused our work on the treatment of Parkinson’s disease to give patients hope for a better life. Additionally, the system is also capable of various other applications ( Collaboration ). Our collaborations with UCL iGEM and Norwich iGEM showed that the system is also easy to apply in other single or multi gene pathways.
Furthermore, the talks to industry representatives and further investigations showed that the system can also be used as a green alternative to current chemical processes producing Dopamine or L-DOPA in the pharmaceutical industry. A greener industrial process leads to sustainable handling of natural resources and much lower waste removal or recycling costs ( Industry ).

Proteolysis regulation
This controlled proteolysis system could solve the problems of our bistable, since it allows a faster degradation of long-lasting proteins which are the main cause of the slowness and leakage of the system.
For this purpose, we have obtained bacteria with the Sspb gene deleted (Sspb - mutant), so that we can regulate its expression according to our needs. We have obtained this mutant and, additionally, the Clpx - mutant (mutant without the protease) directly from McGinness et al.
Our idea is to add the DAS+4 tag to the proteins of one of the states of the biestable and express Sspb under the promoter of the opposed state. Specifically, we have added the DAS+4 tag to the GFP and the LacI proteins, expressed under the cI promoter, and we have expressed Sspb under the Lac promoter (see Figure 5).
Figure 5. When the State 2 of our bistable is being expressed by IPTG (lac promoter inductor) we are not only expressing the cI repressor but we also are expressing the Sspb adaptor protein. When present, this protein binds the DAS+4 tags, that we have placed on the reporter (GFP) and State 2 repressor (LacI) both of State 1, and allows the ClpXP protease to degrade them. Therefore, when the State 2 is active we are repressing State 1 promoter and degrading State 1 reporter and State 2 repressor altogether.

Category:This new database greatly simplified list forming. All the informations could be found in a single, huge table.
SE:Using the original database, the datas needed to be searched twice in the whole process. First, when users type the keyword and clicked ""search"", all the tables were searched with this keyword to get the biobrick, then sended the part name to search result part. Then the second search took place when the search result part got the partname. The partname was searched in all the tables to give user a detailed page of this biobrick's imformation. In short, the tables needed to be searched by keyword and the part name.

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
ADD PARTS
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:
2014 MIT
2014 Heidelberg
2014 Tokyo Tech
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Part Table
Please include a table of all the parts your team has made during your project on this page. Remember part characterization and measurement data must go on your team part"
NKU_China,2017,Team:NKU China#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

September-October
March 15 - March 31
These initial two weeks were focussed on researching methods to break-down cholera biofilm. We obtained our first cholera plate and began to grow biofilm. We also began the transformation of last year's iGEM team's construct for detecting cholera.
Daily log
April 1 - April 15
After successfully growing the cholera detecting construct from last year, we discovered that it did not function as we had hoped. So, we started to sequence the plasmid in order to understand what we truly had. Cholera biofilm was successfully grown in sea water like conditions.

We used the pSB1A3 vector because we are regulating the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and we need to use the ΔcrcB E. coli strain, that is kanamycin resistant. We constructed the operon so that it is easy for future users to use Gibson cloning to add a new “promoter riboswitch segment” by cutting with HindIII or a new gene by cutting with XhoI. Check out our part BBa_KK2990000 for the correct overhangs for Gibson.

After presentation, we also have Q&A time to give some pieces advice also assist them to have a better experimental design and any confronted problem. We also teach them basic experimental skills, for example, ligation and digestion. At the end, we had vigorous discussions with as many as possible people. Now, each team have better understanding about synthetic biology and their project.
Mini Conference with CGU on June 14
The first-recruited team CGU come for exchanging ideas about their project. Out of excitement, it just happened to be that our projects were also about improving medical problem. We were surprised that we were helpful to each other in this conference. Besides, we also give them some pieces advice to manage their new team to promote their working efficiency.
Mini conference with iGEMers from New Zealand Auckland IGEM team and South China University of Technology on July 3
It was a very excited day as there was a meetup with iGEMers from New Zealand Auckland IGEM team and South China University of Technology in NCTU. The main focus point on this meetup was to share and discuss the experiences of forming the iGEM teams. To make this discussion effective, our team previous leader also joined the meetup and so can provided more information with our friends. We discussed about the ways of recruiting and training members. After knowing the experiences of each other, those experiences can be a useful references for us in the future. Our instructor, Professor Chen also shared his experiences and thought about iGEM. We appreciate their coming!
Mini conference with Professor Westenberg on July 30
Professor Westenberg from Missouri University of Science and Technology came to NCTU. He gave us some valuable advice on how we can alter our experiment. We had a really great time-sharing each other's project, and show him around our campus.
Newsletter
We took part in Amoy newsletters no 1, no2 and no3. We have shown how our team works. The best thing is that we shared our experiences to harmonize with each team member, hoping to share the key to success. We also wrote about the ethics topic that happened in Guangzhou’s Sun Yat-sen University about modifying human embryos. Lastly, we also talked about the progressing project. We had been proud and happy to share all our knowledge, our opinions and with the world.

Site direct mutagenesis on Tyrosinase
The method for this experiment was according to the procedure described in protocols.
Concentration of tyrosinase in its original vector: 320 ng/ul, wanted concentration is 10 ng/ul.
320 / X = 10 ng/ul
X = 32 this means that I need to do a 1:32 dilution.
Dilution:
1 ul sample of tyrosinase mix with 31 ul H2O.
PrimerF:
125 ng is wanted of the primer.
Added 267 ul H2O to the dry primerF sample according to a manual I recived from the company of the primers. This equals 100 uM.
100 uM = 100*10^-12 mol/ul
MW of primerF: 8903 g/mol
100*10^-12 mol/ul * 8903 g/mol = 8.903*10^-7 = 890.3 ng/ul
890.3 ng/ul / X = 125 ng/ul
X = 7.12 this means that I need to do a 1:7 dilution.
Dilution:
1 ul sample of primerF mix with 6 ul H2O.
PrimerR:
125 ng is wanted of the primer.
Added 259 ul H2O to the dry primerR sample according to a manual I recived from the company of the primers. This equals 100 uM.
100 uM = 100*10^-12 mol/ul
MW of primerF: 8894 g/mol
100*10^-12 mol/ul * 8894 g/mol = 8.894*10^-7 = 889.4 ng/ul
889.4 ng/ul / X = 125 ng/ul
X = 7.1 this means that I need to do a 1:7 dilution.
Dilution:
1 ul sample of primerR mix with 6 ul H2O.

Campus Festival (May Festival)
May Festival is one of the two annual festivals of the University of Tokyo , taking place in the Hongo Campus. Same as last year (about last year, please take look at page( https://2011.igem.org/Team:UT-Tokyo/Outreach ), we team iGEM UT-Tokyo have participated in this big event with over 100,00 people visiting. Of course, we have made good use of this wonderful opportunity!  What we have done this year? Same as last year, we held a few kinds of exhibitions in order to let people know about the iGEM competition.
Poster session
We’ve invited team KAIT japan , Tokyo-Nokogen and Saitama to hold poster sessions about projects of 2011 together with us. Large numbers of visitors have found it interesting that E.coli is an organism with such possibilities!  Want more information about our collabration activity? Please also check our Collaboration page.
Alcohol Patch Test
We performed an easy (alcohol patch test) and explained how alcohol affects the human body from the aspect of molecular biology without using so many technical terms. Since break-down of alcohol is an attracting topic, we think many people have enjoyed participating in this little experiment.
Video game
A simple video game was made for the purpose of not letting visitors feel bored while waiting for the alcohol to take effect. It was a game featuring an imaginary E.coli cell and RNA molecule, hoping people would become familiar to E.coli.

Technion_Israel,2015,Team:Technion Israel#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"({K_s}\). However for a value that is higher by an order of magnitude, the time increases significantly.
The following video shows a parameter scan for different initial concentration values:
Your browser does not support the video tag.
From this video we can learn that the time elapsed to break down initial concentrations that are larger by an order of magnitude from \({K_s}\) increases significantly for every small increment. By looking at equation (I) we can find two possible reasons for this:
DHT saturation - for every increment in the initial concentration, the value of the derivative approaches \({V_{{{\mathop{\rm m}\nolimits} _f}}}\). For values that are larger by an order of magnitude than \({K_s}\), large increments in the initial concentration do not change much the value of the derivative.
Product inhibition - most of the DHT molecules are converted to \(3\alpha  - diol\). A larger concentration of the product decreases the breakdown rate of the substrate.
We can use this information in order to determine the necessary enzyme concentration required to break down an initial concentration of DHT at a certain time (Increasing the enzyme level will increase \({V_{\max }}\)).
Percentage of DHT breakdown
Let C be the initial concentration of DHT, and the initial concentration of \(3\alpha  - diol\). The relation between the substrate and the product is:
\(\left[ {DHT} \right] + \left[ {3\alpha  - diol} \right] = C\)
At stable state, \(\frac{d}{{dt}} = 0\), so from equation (I) we get: \[\begin{array}{l}\frac{{{V_{{m_f}}} \cdot \frac{{{{\left[ {DHT} \right]}_{final}}}}{{{k_s}}} - {V_{{m_r}}} \cdot \frac{{{{\left[ {3\alpha diol} \right]}_{final}}}}{{{k_p}}}}}{{1 + \frac{{{{\left[ {DHT} \right]}_{final}}}}{{{k_s}}} + \frac{{{{\left[ {3\alpha diol} \right]}_{final}}}}{{{k_p}}}}} = 0\\{V_{{m_f}}} \cdot \frac{{{{\left[ {DHT} \right]}_{final}}}}{{{k_s}}} - {V_{{m_r}}} \cdot \frac{{{{\left[ {3"

The database will give a primer number which we need to write on the tube's lid and on the primer's properties sheet. In today's case, we got:
pGFPconf1 : primer 501 pGFPconf2 : primer 502 pGFPconf3 : primer 503 pGFPconf4 : primer 504
Then, we need to rehydrate the primers. In order to do that, we took the primer properties sheet and found the primer concentration in nMoles. Multiply that number by 5 and you get the amount of water to be added to the primer in order to make it into the standard PA lab's primer concentration of 200ng/ul.
For todays's case:
pGFPconf1 : 20.2nmoles > added 20.2 x 5 = 101 ul of PCR water pGFPconf2 : 30.3nmoles > added 30.3 x 5 = 151.5 ul of PCR water pGFPconf3 : 28.5nmoles > added 28.5 x 5 = 142.5 ul of PCR water pGFPconf4 : 21.7nmoles > added 21.7 x 5 = 108.5 ul of PCR water
The rehydrated primer stock then needs to be diluted 1:10 for working concentration; therefore, we got 50ul from the primer stock and added 450ul of PCR water.
Once rehydrated, the primers stock can be stored in the -20C freezer in the primer box, the 1:10 primer dilution can be stored the -20C freezer in the diluted primer box.
We made PCR water: got 50ml of UV-sterilised water from the stock and filter sterilised it into a 50ml Falcon tube.

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"). The enzyme converts farnesyl diphosphate into E-β-farnesene. E-β-farnesene is an alarm hormone produced by aphids. It is also an important semiochemical in aphid localization. It is released in the cornicle secretions of many aphid species (Franscis et al., 2005) to alert surrounding aphids of the presence of natural enemies (Kunert et al., 2005). Detection of these short range chemical cues leads not to the aphid directly, but only indicates the presence, improving prey detection of the predators and parasitoids.
Group favourite: it was a milestone in our project work. We succeeded to clone the beta farnesene synthase of Artemisia annua in E. coli. To apply to the iGEM standards, we removed an EcoRI site in the gene (AY835398.1).This gave us one of the basic parts we needed to create our system.
BBa_K1060009 is a construct that constitutively expresses beta farnesene synthase. It is BBa_K1060008 behind a medium (constitutive) promoter and medium RBS ( BBa_K608006 ).
Group favourite: This generator will convert farnesyl pyrophosphate into the aphid alarm hormone, (E)-β-farnesene. This was the final device used for our Aphid experiments .
BBa_K1060011 is similar to BBa_K1060009 . However, in this biobrick we added a lac operator in front of the beta farnesene synthase. This makes it possible to switch of (E)- β-farnesene production by using biosensors expressing LacI.
Group favourite: after the design of BBa_K1060009 this is the next step in the design of our glucose model .

This way, the degradation process does not release any pollutants or toxins to the environment other than the                                  carbon dioxide and water bacteria produce in their own metabolic processes.
In order to ensure the safety of our product, we integrated into our design the self-destruct mechanism developed                                 by the 2013 Ben Gurion University iGEM team . With this mechanism, not only the expression of our genes will be dependent                                 on an IPTG inducer, but it will also force our E. coli to be fully dependent on an unnatural amino acid (UAA).                                 Without supplying it to the bacteria medium, or in case of release to the environment (which will only happen by                                 accident since we do not intend to release our bacteria), our E. coli bacteria will not survive. Our second bacterium, P. putida, which is design to consume TPA (one of the PET degradation products), would not be able to consume                                 PET as it is dependent on LC-Cutinase (the enzyme which breaks the initial bond in the PET polymer into TPA and EG), since LC-Cutinase is expressed and secreted from E. coli. Therefore, the genetic modification done on this                                  bacterium will be useless, since it is responsible for degrading TPA, which is a commodity chemical that usually                                  does not exist abundantly in nature.

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"ina oxide and PEDOT:PSS-coated membranes show similar conductivities, indicating the incomplete coating of PEDOT:PSS on alumina oxide membranes. On the opposite, PEDOT:Cl and PEDOT:Ts exhibit on average better conductivities, but in the same time, the coating of these membranes revealed by electron microscopy seemed to have covered the alumina oxide membranes in a more uniform way, ensuring enhanced conductive capabilities . These results can be criticized because of the high deviation and because the membranes conductivity was measured after several biofilms were grown on them, which may have affected the measurements.
Biocompatibility and biofilm conductivity
One last important property of the membranes to measure was the capability of bacteria to form a biofilm on them, as in our prosthesis system, the membrane is going to be directly in contact with the genetically modified biofilm, as well as the human body.
We used the last section of the following protocol to form biofilms in our PDMS well chips and to measure the biofilm growth.
Results: biofilm growth
Biofilm growth was measured 4 times in total. For each series of measurements, the measured optical densities were divided by the optical density of the base liquid culture, to normalize the measures.

For conductivity measurements, we used the same electric circuit as in figure 35 . Function generator was set on square at 200 Hz. The physical quantities measured are Eg, the generator tension amplitude, and Ep, the amplitude of the voltage difference between a point on the biofilm inside the well and the extremity of the platinium strip outside the well. Tension amplitude of the resistor is given by Er = Eg - Ep. Current flowing through the electric circuit is calculated with I = Er/R. Conductivity of the membrane is given by I/Ep. Conductivity of each membrane with a biofilm was repeated 3 times.
Figure 38: Membrane conductivity with biofilm (mean value and standard deviation for each type of membrane)
To approximate very roughly the conductivity of the biofilm, the average conductivity values of the membranes with a biofilm were divided by the corresponding average biofilm growth values, and the conductivity of the membrane was then substracted.

Interpretation
As told by the membrane manufacturer, biofilm formation on gold membranes seems indeed to be more difficult than on other membranes. However we expected PEDOT:PSS-coated membranes to stimulate more the growth of biofilm, but perhaps this"
UCC_Ireland,2016,Team:UCC Ireland#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the staff. On entry, we were amazed by the differences between the laboratories that we were used to seeing at home in Ireland and the laboratory before our eyes. It was shocking how small and clustered it was, and also there was an apparent absence of modern laboratory equipment. What was more breathtaking, was the fact that this was not just the only diagnosis laboratory for Leishmaniasis in Honduras, but it was the only diagnosis laboratory for all infectious diseases in the entire country. We began to wonder whether a laboratory of such size could recognise the true prevalence of such diseases.
Photos with Dr. Cristian Valladares in Alonso Suazo hospital, Tegucigalpa
Following conversation with Dr. Valladares, we learned that several species of Leishmaniasis, from cutaneous to visceral are carried by Lutzomyia longipalpis, the sandfly which LJM11 induces immunity against. This backs the benefit of targeting our vaccine against this sandfly, as it covers a wide range of the disease subtypes. This eliminates the need for multiple vaccines.
In addition to this, we learned that diagnosis (by biopsy) is often avoided as there is a large epidemiological silence with this disease. Many people with cutaneous Leishmaniasis lesions avoid presenting to their GP for reasons such as tradition and culture, and mainly because of a lack of education about the disease. Many use “self-remedies” instead of standard treatment which can keep lesions at bay, but there is lack success in resolving of the condition as the parasite often returns. Also, the current standard treatment for Leishmaniasis in the country (Glucantime, an Antimony based drug that can cause liver and kidney damage) consists of a series of painful 15ml intramuscular injections for 20 consecutive days. Often, those infected stop in the middle of treatment, or sometimes don’t present at all due to fear of pain. This poor compliance is a major problem as without completing the full course of treatment, the parasite can continue to spread and increase in severity.
This provides the the answer to the first question.. Not only did he mention that around 2,700 cases present per year in the country, but as many people with the disease don’t present, and many others refuse treatment, the figures of those infected in reality are actually much higher than the numbers reflected by this. Also, lack of compliance to the current treatment and lack of education about the disease would suggest that a prevention may be a much better solution than a treatment. So we concluded that not only is there a need for immun"

Model of a batch process
The model of a batch process for our set up was developed from the model of a continuous process described above by removing the inflow of nutrients and outflow of culture from all equations. The final system of DDEs is as follows:
One of the key questions for the two-phage re-sensitation approach is to define the time when the population of antibiotic resistant bacteria, here referred as susceptible bacteria, goes extinct. Therefore, in all simulations we drew a particular   attention to the time at which the concentration of XS goes below 10-15 particles/ml as explained in Methodology . In addition, we calculated the ratio   of average concentration of lytically infected bacteria to the average concentration of susceptible bacteria (r) also as described in Methodology .
In order to see how inclusion of the re-infection and superinfection affects the time of extinction of XS, in Figure 4 we simulated a full model and variations with and without these two processes. It is clear that with the   inclusion of the superinfection has little or no impact on the extinction time (Figure 4A and C). Whereas exclusion of the re-infection process from the model results in decreased extinction time. Although from these simulations it might be suggested   to exclude the superinfection from the final model for the further simulations, we decided to leave due to the following reasons: (1) the absence of a noticeable effect of superinfection might be just a result of the simulation with a given set of initial   parameters and might change together with the parameters. (2) we could not find any previous studies of phage and bacteria models with either superinfection or re-infection included into the process, so it is an opportunity to present a new data here.

4. Seamless Cloning
For cloning our target fragments into vectors, NovoRec seamless cloning KIT from Novoprotein Scientific Inc. was used. Seamless cloning can simultaneously combine one or more PCR products with a linearized vector when the DNA to be joined shares 15 – 25 bp of homology at each end. The required homology can be easily generated by adding complementary sequence to the ends of the PCR primers. No additional treatment of the PCR fragment is required, such as restriction digestion, ligation, phosphorylation, or blunt-end polishing. The efficiency of NovoRec PCR Seamless Cloning is over 95 %.

L-Form simulation
Simulation is nearly done, just giving finishing touches. One of them is improving movement of L-forms, so it's more realistic. Although it took a while to figure out the best movement algorithm, at first we tried doing it completely random, but it didn't work out quite well, so in the end we decided it to make not as random. So what we did is that let's say L-form moves 1px in x and y axis per second, so our algorithm would then generate random number from [-2;2] and then would add it up to the current speed. But, because of nature of randomness balls would move too fast or too slow, so we had to make ""limits"" so it doesn't get too fast or too slow.
Characterisation of the HBsu-(x)fp
Aim:
To characterize the HBsu-(x)FP BioBrick. From our cloning strategy, we planned to conduct a single cross over so the whole pMutin4 plasmid including the insert is integrated into the B. subtilis chromosomal DNA. After it has been integrated, our biobrick will be under the control of Pspac promoter. Pspac promoter is an IPTG inducible promoter.
Methods:
The B. subtilis 168 strain that has been transformed with HBsu-GFP and HBsu-RFP was inoculated on August 15th to characterise the HBsu-(x)fp biobrick.
The concentration of IPTG was varied from a range of 0.05 – 0.8 mM to observe the conditions that yield the maximum concentration of product. We checked the fluorescence of this fusion protein at 10mins, 30mins, 60mins and 120mins after addition of IPTG to see how long it takes to get the maximum signal.
Results:
The results of this first trial were not very conclusive as there were cross contamination between samples with IPTG and the control.

Waterloo,2016,Team:Waterloo#Engagement#GenderEquity_-_-_TEXT.html," bias in synthetic biology and in fact found a direct correlation between success in the iGEM competition and gender mix, was the primary inspiration of the Waterloo iGEM team in investigating this matter and developing a means of engaging the community as well as promoting gender equity.
With the ambition of educating students to be less likely to convey or tolerate sexism, the Waterloo iGEM team created and conducted a 2-part workshop series entitled “Synthetic Biology and Gender Equality 101” for students at the University of Waterloo.  These workshops were held in collaboration with WiSTEM, Women in Science Technology, Engineering and Maths.  Workshop 1 was intended to introduce students to the intersection of synthetic biology and gender equity.   It consisted of a 20-minute presentation, an activity, and an open discussion to close.  As part of the activity, students generated ideas on why women drop out of science through the advancing stages of the educational and occupational hierarchies of STEM fields in the format of a pipeline. Students who attended Workshop 1 were entered into a lottery to attend Workshop 2.  In Workshop 2, students were taught microbiology techniques by Waterloo iGEM team members.
The Waterloo iGEM received positive feedback from students who partook in the 2-part workshop series, thus deeming it to be a success.  Success of the series can be represented by reflecting on 1 of the workshops in particular, where the planned time limit was actually exceeded as a result of an extremely active open discussion.  Dialogue is extremely important in community engagement as it allows for the expression and hearing of multiple voices, as well as the exchange and generation of knowledge and ideas.
Testimonials from participants in the 2-part workshop series can be found below:
“One of the most educational experiences of my life!  Thank you so much iGEM for taking time to educate students on laboratory techniques!  Seriously a once in a lifetime experience!   Synthetic biology is awesome!” – Sally Twin

The former is a factor recommended by the ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Round Table and measures the mass efficiency from input, encouraging cost reduction at the very start of the process, defined by:
PMI can give a realistic picture of a process, providing a “process mass property of a contributing chemical in a synthesis plan” as long as every chemical is tagged in analysis. It is a useful factor that represents the contribution of different reagents to the final product and identifies productivity issues as well as predicting global impact of a specific improvement to the system. Waste stream (WS) is the flux of waste from the point of generation to the point of its final disposal or treatment, “the characteristics of waste stream inventory will help to identify hazardous streams, evaluate options for solvent and energy recovery, estimate the needs for waste management, and develop integrated treatment based on site capacity” [1].
Figure 6 PMI of the Hoffman La-Roche process
Hoffmann La-Roche has 12 WSs: 10 aqueous WSs (3 solvent-free, 7 organic or solvent-contaminated) and 2 solid WSs with a total waste for all WSs being 48240.33 kg per 100 kg of L-DOPA synthesized; 81.27% of which (39205.02 kg) is contaminated water, primarily being produced in WS 2-2 (Cyclisation, isolation; 19255.60 kg). The Deprotection step (4-1) generates hazardous MeBr shown in WS 4-7 that is needed to be handled separately in addition to the existing WSs arising directly from synthesis. DMF and benzoic acid must also be handled as hazardous waste, decreasing the mobility of the process.

Using that type of organism, said loser (for example “weaker” bacteria so few are competitive against “natural” forms, so that they survive only if they are cultivated in optimal conditions and artificially maintained by man). This is a form of security of the device, but it implies maintenance costs of the habitat and of the colony. Philippe Marlière notices that it is enough, then, to submit that mass of organisms to a new kind of natural selection process in order to select individuals and strains more suited to survive (which is possible with some bacterias because of their high rates of reproduction). But, that solution asks once again the question of risk of escape in the natural strain of an organism or of an genomic part which became competitive, even “supercompetitive” (said winner).”
We have to stop here for a while, certifying that evolutionary containment corresponds to that “fail fast” solution already mentioned. Remarks made in wikipedia to that device are close to ours. It is also interesting to notice that, into the light of natural selection and the theory of evolution, a new surprising lexicon is entering the game. Synthetic organisms are qualified as winner and loser depending on their capacities of adaptation. The notion of competitiveness enlightens the application of a manager to biological phenomena. Moreover, it is important to note that our preventative approach leads us to fear for that competitiveness. Thus, the winner bacteria causes us to fear, while the loser bacteria stays within our ethical specifications. Vocabulary and lexicon used seem to be both ethically problematic and socially representative of new criteria of evaluation and the way to express it in contemporary life sciences. Like the liberal manager without a qualm in a system of concurrency (the social winner), bacteria will scare us but, through that lexicon, also becoming something that deserves our respect, because of the development of its aptitude. The use of a socially situated lexicon is no novel in life science, as shown in Evelyn Fox Keller and Emily Martin's works about the influence of explanatory metaphors in biology. Emily Martin focused about how metaphors about egg and sperm roles in the reproduction process have an important social impact about our perception of man and women.
4-Semantic containment
Finally, a new challenge will be to be able to design organisms that implement a semantic containment, for preventing genetic cross-talk. We also consider with classical GMOs to build organisms programmed to commit suicide or to not be able to reproduce (for example, terminator genes or inhibition of reproduction).” Semantic containment will allow to be sure that the synthetic genome/organism is not any more able to share"

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

Lab meeting
We discussed characterisation elements for our signalling circuit, as described in Carol's section. I focussed on dynamic performance and response time, or, in other words, what happens when you add a lot of AI-2 into a system where it wasn't there previously.
We also discussed how we could consolidate our modelling efforts and come up with something with a little depth to it in time for the competition. Some of the main points that came out of that are:
The team members involved in modelling need to meet more and learn more about what the others are doing. We will address this by meeting on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10h00 am.
On the differential side, we have a lot of breadth to our approach but it's still fairly superficial. We have established a differential reaction-based model on SimBiology, but finding values for phosphorylation constants has been a much greater challenge than we had anticipated. We will need to set up a model anyway and collect some input/output data, and from that we can approximate a set of parameters. It's highly unlikely that they'll be unique, but they will give us something to work with and help us evaluate which ones are limiting steps and would be worth tweaking in a real system
The point of standardisation and characterisation is to have a set of parts to work with and choose from, based on characteristics that can be compared among different parts. Endy's 2006 paper is interesting, but it only presents characterisation for one part. It would be useful to have more parts characterised, especially if they actually work. We are submitting a few parts to the Registry: a signalling circuit, a reporter, mutants - all with various combinations of promoter and terminator sequences. It would be useful to characterise as many of them as possible, even if it's just for static and dynamic respones, so that future users have a quantifiable way of comparing performance.
We are testing a signalling-reporter combination, but we don't know how much the reporter will affect our model of the signalling circuit. For example, if we consider response time, we don't know if our circuit response is limited by the signalling circuit, the reporter circuit, or a combination of both. If the circuit response is slowed mostly by the reporter circuit, it would cast doubt on the validity of the model as soon as a different reporter or sexy circuit were implemented. If there is a way to characterise the reporter by itself along with the signalling + reporter"

Bile acid sensor
- The idea came from Si’s final year project.
- A biosensor can be produced for daily home use to detect the bile acid concentration level in blood to prevent a series of liver diseases, especially the Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)
- The basic concept behind this sensor: bile acid - enzyme binding with the acid molecules – promoter – triggering the FXR gene – production of GFP - GFP is normally used as an indicator of the bio-sensor. The main problem is that the fluorescent intensity is very hard to quantified for a home-user - being inspired by the cosmetic skin colour sample card, we can make a sample card of fluorescence to give the rough concentration level of bile acid - a threshold value is required to tell the patient when their blood bile acid level is dangerous and may need a medical treatment - therefore, we will modify the linear relationship between bile acid concentration and GFP intensity level into a Hill system using Hill equation to find the threshold value - also, we may use colour indicator instead of GFP (light indicator).
Background:
- Bile acids are 24-carbon steroids found in bile, which are subject to enterohepatic circulation - synthesized in liver and stored in gallbladder, helping in digestion and absorption of dietary fat and liposoluble vitamins - bile acids are highly toxic. Therefore their concentration must be tightly regulated - the level of bile acids is controlled through a negative feedback system mediated by a nuclear bile acid receptor FXR. FXR is highly expressed in liver, intestine and kidney cells. It responds to bile acids and has been shown to repress CYP7A1, a key gene associated with bile acid synthesis. - Defects in bile acid homeostasis due to functional variations of FXR result in cholestatic conditions such as Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). ICP is a pregnancy-specific liver disorder characterized by pruritus (intense itch) an abnormal liver function - The dysfunction of maternal liver could induce stress on the fetal liver as the fetus relies on maternal liver"

Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#IP#_-_-_TEXT.html,", and to assess the legal protection and ownership protection we require being a former iGEM project.
Patent Protection and Trade Secrets
The technology that we have developed, for the purpose of IP protection can be placed into two categories: 1) the Pseudomonas strain of bacteria genetically engineered to detect toxins in the environment; and 2) the electrochemical platform technology used to convert the sensory element used in the Pseudomonas into an electrical output.  Both present unique challenges towards IP protection.  Presently, we plan to keep our Pseudomonas organism as a trade secret, filing a patent on this technology later in our development.  Patenting of strains will also have to be carefully assessed since it fully discloses the nature and important components required for the system to work.  Due to the increasing ease of genetic manipulation, it could be easy for competitive parties to copy and modify our system in the future.  We can further protect our IP through genetic kill switch technology, and other genetic mechanisms of making it difficult to identify our organism of which we have experience with from 2012.  Each new product which is developed by the company will be treated in a unique circumstance.
The electrochemical sensing platform is the key component to our technology.  It will allow for the development of this product, and could serve as a platform technology for future product lines.  Therefore its protection is key to ensure the development and commercialization of our technology.  In order to protect the technology, our group has filed a provisional patent. This has been completed with Harm Dekkers who is a consultant through HMG Consulting, and has a wide variety of experience with biotechnology related patents.
Our invention is novel and non-obvious and we believe fully-patentable. Some examples of related patents can be seen below.
Table 1. Patents dealing with related technology.
During product development, some engineering hardware/software as well as manufacturing-based IP may be developed.  While the present technology development plan aims to use open-source or generic materials, programs, and systems, it is possible that some intellectual property may be produced from the unique implementation of these systems.  If that becomes the case, the system will be evaluated for their potential patentability.
Patents previously developed as a result of the 2012 iGEM group shall be held by the six iGEM students who are developing the technology.  The patent will be freely licensed to FREDsense in order to ensure that the platform technology will not be hampered in the event that the system can be used for other markets and applications.
Intellectual Property Rel"
Lanzhou,2017,Team:Lanzhou#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," and key members are seniors who always have plentiful experience of iGEM. And according to the experience, a team with at least a quarter of old members serving as the instructors, could keep a relevant stable condition in future.
Selecting new members
The selecting for new members varies in different teams, but all for the same purpose, find out the most reliable and excellent students. Some teams built a synthetic biology club for training attendants for a long time and eventually pick the ones who expressed excellently and insists until the last ( Like Lanzhou this year ). Some would arrange paper reading tasks and ask the member to summarize regularly, through final assessment to decide who is eligible to be the team member. Teams like Peking, owning completed selection measures, from public class, experiments training, group discussion to the final examination, are so rare. Because most Chinese iGEM team couldn’t keep heritage like natural turnover of old for young, this would become worse when there little elder members leave in team.
Project establishment
Different teams settled projects in different ways. Some got the idea from instructors, some discussed through reading papers, brainstorm, and eventually confirm the most probable and innovative projects (this procedure always synchronizes with the selecting periods). Effective brainstorm, thorough discussion between the groups are the core of setting up a novel but practical project.
Team funds
We also discussed the source of funds during the meet up. Most of iGEM teams have sufficient finance support from their university, including team registration fee and experiment funds. The other parts such as travel expenses are usually offered by academic affairs office and the international offices. If a team suffers from lack of funds, raising money towards the public is admissible, but remember to gain the permission of school first before starting crowd-funding.
Words we want to say
The strong unity and persistence of all team members are the basis of completing iGEM projects. Besides, rationale plans on how to recruit new team members, how to raise funds for expenditures insufficiency, how to divide the labor work reasonably, how to transfer a novel idea into the practical experiments and so on are all necessary for final success of the team. Meanwhile there is no absolute right answer, and no absolutely suitable model for all teams. Predecessor experiences could be referred, but correctly recognize team and figure out the proper approach to remove the blocks are the most important.
Future
We have investigated the current conditions of Chinese iGEM teams and found many common problems. We sincerely hope that someone could do a similar work like us and spread it all over the world, so that the problems hidden could be seen and maybe finally influence"

Ruiling CAI
I will definitely arrive at the lab before 9 tomorcolumn! (Never)
Ruiling is a junior majoring in biology at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Devoted to iGEM for two years, she has got lots of training from lab work to project design. Besides, she really treasures the precious and memorable experience of working with all her teammates and instructors. About them, the future is still very long. To be short, she is the leader of the team this year.
“Deadline gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall have no breakfast, play no games, watch no films. I shall wear no ccolumnns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the alarm of the clock. I am the watcher for the schedule. I am the fire that burns against the laziness, the light that brings the energy, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the team of UCAS. I pledge my life and honor to the Deadline’s Watch, for this ddl and all the ddls to come.”
Apart from iGEM she is also a singer and a geek design aficionado. To her, the beat and melody have the magic power to sweep"

Metabolics Troubleshooting
It looks like there was a recombining when we transformed      the arabinose inducible promoter plasmid into Putida.      Even though the colonies were GFP positive, sequencing      result gave us a negative result.
Keratinocyte Experiments
This week the cells died because they were contaminated      with bacteria. We plated the cells to confirm our      hypothesis. We contacted the laboratory that gave us the      cells. The graduate student will not have them available      for another few weeks because their cells were also      contaminated. Thus, these experiments will be put on      hold. However, we decided to try a different assay      technique in which we lyse the cells and then measure      bacteria presence. This will avoid the complications      regarding the concentration and duration of gent      application to the cells.
Community Outreach
We created a map based upon the survey data illustrating      what regions of the country experience more mosquito bites      than others. We collaborated with the University of      Georgia and assisted them on their project. We also      contacted BioBus an organization in which scientists teach      students about the field while they are on a bus to plan      an event with them. However, the scientists will not be      back to work until September. We made arrangements to      contact them in September. Additionally, we made contact      with the Chinese iGEM Team who is putting together a      newsletter and asked if we would like to contribute.

When the Cas12a protein is activated, it will realize a non-specific cleavage that functions as DNase I, so we can report our signal by using the method of detecting DNase I.
We finally used the fluorescent signal as our reporting signal, because it was easy to observe, semi-quantitative, and can be directly read and analyzed by the machine. And our signal reports used the commercially available DNaseAlertTM kit on the market. [4]
The working principle is as follows: a combination of a ground state fluorescent molecule and a quencher generates a complex by ssDNA, and the complex quenches the fluorescence. When the nuclease cleavages the ssDNA, the quenching fails and the fluorophore re-emits.
Figure 4. The principle of Reporter.

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

Leicester,2012,Team:Leicester#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," information needed to pick the correct DNA extraction kit. Produced the 15ml corning tubes for the suspension of ''Pseudomonas sp'' in rich media.
2nd August: Innoculated tshe 15ml corning tube with ''E. coli'' for the DNA extraction test.
3rd August: Did the CFU colonies and dilutions test with ''E. coli''.
6th August: Altered the protocol for the dilutions experiment. Used the spectrophotometer to give the DNA digest the starting value. Innoculated the 3ml of luria broth for the final ''E. coli'' test.
7th August: Worked for the whole day doing spectrophotometry to finally get the experiment right with a good protocol.
8th August: Repeated the CFU colonies and dilutions test with ''E. coli''.
9th August: Counted colonies from the successful test.
10th August: Videod a lot of the Rockethub video, to almost have the video complete.
13th August: Plated out all the CSE kits onto 5% polystyrene on minimal agar.
14th August: Ran both of the doubling experiments for ''Pseudomonas'' to give a basic time to work with in the dilutions experiment. Labelled up all the plates and eppendorfs ready for the next day.
15th August: Produced the overnight culture ready for the growth curve experiment.
16th August: Ran the ''Pseudomonas'' growth curve experiment.
17th August: Counted colonies for the experiment, created the gel, then ran the gel for the DNA digestion experiment.
20th August: Checked and edited the Rockethub site to work out most of the errors and got it ready for publishing after the weekly meeting. Created the overnight culture to rerun the growth curve experiment.
21st August: Edited the protocol, then reran the ''Pseudomonas'' growth curve experiment.
22nd August: Reran ''Pseudomonas'' growth curve experiment using the plate spinner.
23rd August: Streaked out the plates to see if the growth curve experiment failed due to agar or the bacteria. Created new overnight culture.
24th August: Did final run of ''Pseudomonas'' growth curve experiment.
27th August: Advertised UOL iGEM project at Aylestone Leisure centre.
28th August: Counted the colonies on yesterdays plates, tabulated the data then made a graph using excel to show the growth curve. Did some administration for the iGEM team ("

NTNU's main website
NTNU has written an article about the team and the project on their main website.
Under Dusken
The student newspaper in Trondheim, Under Dusken, visited us in the lab and wrote an article about us, the project, and iGEM in general.
Bioteknologinemda
Bioteknologinemda (in english; the biotechnology committee), which is a committee appointed by the Norwegian government to assist in matters dealing with biotechnology, have published an interview with our team leader, Gunvor, on their website. The interview will also be published in their periodical, GENialt.
VG
This year, our team will be participating in Researchers' Night as our main outreach project (read more about this on our outreach page), and in this context, we have also been featured in an article. The Norwegian Science Week, which Researchers' Night is a part of, have cooperated with Verdens Gang (abbreviated VG, Norway's biggest newspaper) to make a magazine covering some of the most interesting activities (we think) that is going to be part of the Science Week. This magazine will be given out as an appendix to the newspaper, and we are one of very few research activities taking part in Science Week Trondheim that have been featured. The article can be read below.
gemFM
We were interviewed by the University College London iGEM team's radio channel, gemFM. Click here to listen to their shows.
