Colombia,2011,Team:Colombia#Notebook#Plasmids_-_-_TEXT.html," of the positive feedback system expression is activated slower than a system without feedback, with delay times of approximately 70 minutes.
The dynamics of the graduated response of the positive feedback system shows also hysteretic propierties, which is useful in the signaling system to the plante, keeping the response active for an additional time after the phytopatogen is attacked with chitinase, so that the immunity is not lost when there is a chance of infection.
Mechanism of plant signaling activation
The defense system activation singaling gene is regulated by a two promotor system: one that is activated by the positive feedback system output (graduated and delayed signal) and another one that is activated directly by the presence of chitin (phytopatogen signal). The signal to the plant would be in its maximal expression only when the two input signals are active, which means in practical terms that only when there is a phytopatogen presence superior to 70 minutes the signal is sent, avoiding unnecesary resource expenses by the plant, for example, when an insect passes by the leaves. The hysteretic dynamics of the system has an additional advantage: the inmune response and the chitinase production (which attacks directly the phytopatogen) would be active for an additional time after the critical phytopatogen concentration is reached
Complete genetic circuit desing
In the figure the two planned mechanisms are shown. The first one is the positive feedback system, and its graduated, delayed output is the input for the second one, which is in charge of expressing the chitinase to attack the phytopatogen, and sending the input signal for the plant inmune system activation.
Plasmid 3
In a nutshell, P3’s mission is that of interpreting P2’s autoinduction signals (LuxI) in a way so that it responds with an appropriate production of the plant’s Systemic Aquired Resistance (SAR) stimulating factor (Salicylic Acid, SA). We have also included a negative feedback loop in order to control possible gene overexpressions by introducing a LuxI activated lactonase.
Test Plasmid
Building a whole working system is the challenge our group faces everyday. But, as important as the assemblage itself, testing our assumptions about how the designed parts work individually, helps us to improve the molecular design. Vibrio's chitin detection system relies on the activation of the promoter of the chi genes by a two-component signaling device . Since the sequence of the promoter remains uncharacterized, we extracted a small region of the sequence upstream the chitoporin gene"

Suspension of Cells in Lysis Buffer
The flask is removed from the shaking incubator and the contents are divided into two 500mL containers. The containers are weighed and a few drops of water is added to the lighter one to ensure proper counterbalance in the centrifuge. The two containers are centrifuged at 5,000g at 4 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes. The supernatant is decanted and the cell pellets are weighed, and then suspended in 1X Lysis Buffer in a 1 to 3 weight of cell pellet to volume of buffer, respectively, ratio.

Tuesday July 10th
Today we did a double digest of B0034 at the S and P sites and sequentially digested B0034 first at the E site using Buffer 4. We miniprepped samples using both the Invitrogen and Biobasic kits. Using the nanodrop spectroscopy, we determined that the Invitrogen kit was still better, so we continued to use that. We also began to look into Gibson assembly, and due to past iGEM inability to attain success, we requested the protocol from the iGEM Washington 2011 team. Minipreped part B0034 (RBS) and digested it in two ways, E+X and S+P.

Took cutinase sequence and put it into swiss model, gave us a model that was similar. Starting off the protein engineering side of the project we looked towards first replicating previously made mutations in the paper titled “Engineered Thermobifida fusca cutinase with increased activity on polyester substrates” referenced in our original paper, “Isolation of a Novel Cutinase Homolog with Polyethylene Terephthalate-Degrading Activity from Leaf-Branch Compost by Using a Metagenomic Approach.” We wished to replicate three mutations, T96A, V212A and Y127A. We wanted to verify that these mutations would produce similar increases in protein activity in our protein, LC Cutinase, as they did in the paper’s protein Tfu_0883. In order to do this we wished to compare best fit homology models generated for our protein and the papers. Using Swissmodel we generated 3VisB as a best fit for LC Cutinase and 1JFR as the best fit for the paper’s Tfu_0083.
Thursday July 12th
We performed digests, double digests, and ligations. LC Cutinase was ordered at Genscript. We further looked over the the results of the homology models generated for the two proteins. We compared them in two ways: 1) Generating a multiple sequence alignment for both proteins and homology models and accessing the similarity of the mutation sites. 2) Loading the homology models in pymol and accessing the three dimensional similarity visually. Both methods gave us confidence in the mutations resulting in similar activity increase. J23100 and J23101 minipreps ran.

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

Kyoto,2014,Team:Kyoto#Project#Magnetosome Formation_-_-_TEXT.html," the pLQ group(lower) also made magnetosome-like vesicles. Protein and lipid membrane was stained.
As shown clearly, the outer membrane of strains with pLQB plasmids tend to show winding structure, suggesting the effect of ectopic expression of membrane proteins on the membrane integrity. More interestingly, we frequently observed magnetosome-like lipid vesicles with a radius of about 100 nm in a pLQB-dependent manner. We counted the number of lipid vesicles per sections of E. coli. The observed vesicle number in pLQB transformant is significantly higher than negative control. The results are shown in Fig. 9 . These results are consistent with the model that the expression of M. magneticum mamL, mamQ and mamB can induce the first step of magnetosome formation; the vesicle formation.
Fig. 9   Significant difference between control and the two transformants
The percentage of sections that contain magnetosome-like lipid vesicles calculated from the pictures from TEM.
While the pLQB transformant could make vesicles, it is unclear whether the three proteins are all necessary for vesicle formation in E. coli or not. Interestingly, E. coli has a protein homologous to mamB, fieF (ferrous iron effulux protein F, 22% identical, 40% similar by delta-blast). We hypothesized that mamB can be eliminated from the synthetic operon without changing the efficiency of the vesicle formation. For this purpose, we constructed plasmid pLQ ( Fig. 6 ) and introduced it to E. coli. As expected, the pLQ transformant also induced lipid vesicles ( Fig. 8 ).
Finally we examined the difference between negative control and pLQB or pLQ ( Fig. 9 ). These results suggest pLQ as well as pLQB would induce vesicle formation in E. coli.
Hypothetical process of magnetosome-like vesicle formation in E. coli
Out of 2000 cells inspected, we found some of the candidates of immature vesicles in the pLQ transformant. Analyses of these samples led us to a model of the magnetosome-like vesicle formation process in E. coli. In our model, the inner membrane is first curved. Then gradually the space between the inner membrane and the outer membrane become larger. Finally the vesicle is formed ( Fig. 10 ).

The speakers introduced the concepts of Synthetic Biology and gave insight into their current projects. The talks were followed by a cosy get-together with barbecue until the late evening.  On Sunday, each team had the chance to present their innovative project ideas to the other teams and discuss it. In the afternoon, team members could attend workshops in which the subgroups talked about biosafety, bioethics and a Germany-wide SynBio Day. Later on, we enjoyed the nice weather by spending the evening in a beergarden with typical Bavarian flair. On the last day, our guests had the opportunity to stroll around Munich’s inner city or even take a short guided sightseeing tour, before attending the workshop at the CASLMU covering Synthetic Biological Tools for Single Cell Analysis. Besides talks by Erez Braun (Haifa) and Roland Wedlich-Söldner (Münster), almost all iGEM teams introduced their project ideas and received further feedback from the audience.
All in all, the meetup was a great opportunity to get to know young, aspiring researchers, to learn about each other’s projects, and also network to develop policy & practices ideas or possibly even bundle projects together.  We thank the CASLMU and our other sponsors for enabling this event and of course all participants for making it such a great success.

Since we were really excited about the program that Team Aachen organized, we only had a small walk around the historic city center and made our first culinary experiences before going to bed early in order to be prepared for the Meetup. The program started in the afternoon, and was a warm-hearted welcome by Team Aachen and a reunion of team members who already got to know each other at the Munich Meetup (which was awesome too).

We make use of this feature to construct a novel voltage switch (BBa_K1092007 & BBa_K1092008), which consist of the PDZ domain (BBa_K1092102), PDZ ligand (BBa_K1092101), this voltage sensor peptide itself. To further adapt this voltage sensor peptide into our project, we added in two (GGGGS)3 flexible linker which serve to link other protein domains, and a (PE)5 linker which serve as a rigid rod that project from the sensor peptide to elongate it and increase the separation distance.

The current problem
  Informations are not complete in partsregistry.org
    When the partsregistry.org was established at first, it is worth to be called the authority of the BioBricks. But as time goes by, more and more BioBricks are added in, now partsregistry.org becomes less satisfy. Information of many BioBricks are incomplete, some even wrong. Because every one can submit one's BioBrick as long as one logs in, many information is informal since the website doesn't examine the information users submit. This would waste resource as well as mess up the database.
    Moreover, the layout of the website becomes more unclear as the database becomes larger and larger. For example, the Catlog. In this page, BioBricks are classified according to many different criteria. But the interface style in one section is far different from it in another section. Sometimes it is the description of a project, sometimes it becomes BioBrick list. A large list will be prsented in front of users with hundreds of BioBricks, but no search tool is available for users to search for the BioBrick that they really want. All of these would increase the difficulty for users to find the information that they want. For example, in the following figure, no list for Translational units can be found while others have long lists.
    
This BioBrick is totally useless but it is still on the BioBrick list. This shows that the uploading of BioBricks should be standardized.
    
  Informations are not useful in database
    We got a database that contains all the information about all the BioBricks. In this database, every BioBrick has 40 properties, they are:
    
    With these long list, no nobody has the patience to look through them all. Indeed many properties are rubbish. Look at the property No.34-No.37, they are completely useless because they are apparently not a part of information of a BioBrick. Another example is property No.14, specified_scar_u_list. This property is NULL, which means it contains no information, for nearly all the BioBricks. We draw a histogram to demonstrate the percentage of unqualified and qualified BioBricks.
  
    Explanation of the above histogram:    x-axis:    1 - number o properties whose information is NULL for more 3000 BioBricks (our database contains 13442 BioBricks).

Discussion
Bien que le vecteur tissulaire n’ait pas été fini, la littérature scientifique montre que la création d’un phage recombiné avec une protéine codant la base de penton de l’adénovirus est possible. Il est aussi démontré que les fragments codant pour les séquences RGD seuls ont une plus forte capacité à infecter les cellules eucaryotes comparé au fragment complet de la base de penton (figure 2). Dans le cas de notre application il est alors possible d’utiliser un bactériophage lambda recombiné pour insérer notre gène thérapeutique.

Conclusions
Pour conclure le fragment RGD seul de la base de penton a la meilleure efficacité d’interaction avec les intégrines des cellules eucaryotes. Cependant dans le cadre de notre projet il est plus judicieux d’utiliser la séquence complète de la base de penton (fragment 1-571) car l’utilisation du vecteur cellulaire et du système d’induction par la doxycycline donne une injection très rapide et très ciblée des bactériophages. L’utilisation d’un système de transfection hautement efficace est déconseillé car les phages n’ont pas le temps de se disperser correctement et vont alors infecter plusieurs fois la même cellule.

The above video represents the ecosystem after 20 ppt estrogen is added to the water.
Low concentrations of estrogen have a noticeable immediate effect on the ecosystem; however, over time the ecosystem is able to reach dynamic equilibrium once more. At tick 100, 20 ppt of estrogen was added to the water. Around tick 105 the fish population dipped to the lowest value it would ever be (150,000 individuals). This lead to the bird population experiencing a dangerously low dip at around ticks 130-135. Also the low fish population at tick 105, led to the highest recorded algae population around ticks 130-135.
Scenario 3: Medium Estrogen Concentrations (21 – 39 ppt)
The above video represents the ecosystem after 30 ppt estrogen is added to the water.
Medium concentrations of estrogen have quite an interesting effect on the ecosystem. 30 ppt of estrogen was added to the ecosystem at tick 40. From ticks 50-100, the fish population was dangerously low for a longer period of time than a typical dip in the fish population. This long dip in the fish population caused the birds to die out as there was simply not enough food. The long dip in the fish population led to a large spike in the algae population. The spike in the algae population coupled with the local extinction of the bird population, allowed the fish population to boom after its prolonged dip. The long dip in the fish population could be potentially harmful for humans as well, if the lake was used for fishing. Such a low population of fish for an extended period of time, would destroy the seasonal yield for many fishermen and put them out of business.
Scenario 4: High Estrogen Concentrations (≥ 40 ppt)
The above video represents the ecosystem after 60 ppt estrogen is added to the water.
When the estrogen concentration is too high, both the fish and bird populations get wiped out. The fish are incapable of producing enough fertile offspring to sustain their population, which in turn means the birds have no available food source. The algae due to the lack of fish, overgrows, and covers the whole lake which leads to other problems such as algal bloom. 60 ppt of estrogen was added at tick 95, and the bird population died almost instantly (~15 ticks), whereas the fish population was a little hardier (died out only after ~100 ticks).

By combining the Ptet promoter and any reporter gene, one can test whether certain proteins are able to dimerize in a cell or not.

Our modelling project consists of two components: a mathematical model done in MATLAB and an animation done in Autodesk Maya. We hope to model the formation of inclusion bodies, which are aggregations of misfolded protein that can occur within cells. Using Maya, we also hope to visually show other students one of the proposed aggregation mechanisms described in the literature. Read more here...

Overview
    Team Tsinghua-A believes that collaborations between teams can be a powerful drive to motivate all teams to actively participate in project preparation while at the same time, it also plays a vital role in realization of resources and information interconnection. Through the whole summer, members of Team Tsinghua-A have traveled through the country to meet up with other teams, hosted seminars at home for team communication in corporation with Team Tsinghua and reached mutual technical collaboration with several others.
I Fudan
    Team Fudan in Shanghai, who previously shared literature resource with us, came to know that we had the parts they needed during the conference meet-up. After they contacted us, we responded quickly with plasmids that contain the parts they need. The parts with five types of plasmids are listed as follow:

Figure 5. E.coli sensing lactate produced Jurkat cells in the chip in RPMI medium: E.coli harboring the same promoter PLldR and either LldR or LldPR were introduced in the chip with and without Jurkat cells.
To compare the responses of E. coli in RPMI or DMEM medium, we performed the same experiments as described previously with for our bacteria in these two media in a 96-well plate using our microtiter plate reader (see Figure 6).
Figure 6: Dose response curve of low PLldR construct to lactate in mammalian culture medium. Red and black curves represent growth in RPMI, the medium used for Jurkat cells. Green and blue curves represent growth in DMEM, the medium used for 3T3 cells. It is very clear from this data that the introduction of LldP is beneficial for both the ON/OFF ratio as well as the KM value of the promoter.
Regarding the cross-reaction of bacteria in wells without mammalian cells we found that lactate will easily diffuse in the medium covering the chip. In further experiments, the coverslip covering the filled nanowellplate should be sealed more tightly in order to prevent a continuous phase of medium covering and therby interlinking the different wells. Nevertheless, contol experiments without mammalian cells in the chip clearly showed that there is no self activation by bacteria within a chip that is devoid of mammalian cells (see Figure 5). This is consistent with our finding that E. coli cells do not produce significant levels of lactate themselves.
Characterization of the lacI-lldR promoter
Overview
Figure 7. Response expected from the hybrid promoter, resulting in an AND-gate.
For the establishment of a fold change sensor topology, a gateway integrating a positive and a delayed negative signal is required. For our system we engineered a hybrid promoter integrating repression by LacI and LldR. The two signals come together to influence our newly designed hybrid promoter in which we combined the Lac promoter with its operator (lacO) in the LldR operator promoter. We designed two hybrid promoters using different versions of the lac promoter. A closer description of the design process for these promoters can be found in our Part Collection .
We tested both of our synthetic hybrid promoters for their leanikess and response to L-lactate, as well as IPTG. The setup of this experiment was a strain containing the following constructs.

All of the photographs on this site were taken by members of our team.
Tim borrowed a DSLR to take nearly all of the photographs of plates, lab equipment, and lab personnel. Aaron also took some shots with the DSLR, and all team members used the cameras on their phones to document progress and take snapshots.
Tim and Keegan created the 3D animations on the Promoter Families page  by exporting 3D data on protein models from PyMol into Blender and exporting animation frames which were then compiled into .avi files and hosted on Vimeo .
Fundraising
The majority of our fundraising was performed by undergraduate team members.
Aaron raised nearly $10,000 by writing letters to local companies and prominent faculty, and by preparing promotional material like our 2011 Summer Update brochure.
Tim also raised a few thousand dollars from several UC Davis departments.
Open-Source Mindedness
Finding financial support for any iGEM team is a struggle. This year's team had extremely limited funding, and as such we took efforts to limit the cost of our project while keeping our results and protocols accessible to other teams.
We chose software tools that are powerful, open-source and, most importantly, free to use. This doesn't just save us money -- it promotes cooperation between teams regardless of their levels of funding. This is in keeping with the spirit of BioBricks, the Parts Registry , and the iGEM competition.

Fiber radius
20x magnification of our co-spun fiber.
We took images along three points on the fiber and used ImageJ to measure the diameter of the fiber at each point. We then averaged the measurements and found the fiber's radius to be 13.9 +/- 0.3 um.
Fiber fluorescence
We used an EVOS FL digital microscope to take microscopic images of our fibers. Natural silk showed some background fluorescence, but the co-spun fiber with NCSilkGFP had considerably stronger fluorescence, as determined by visual assessment. Unfortunately, we were unable to quantify the difference in fluorescence.
Fluorescence microscopy of the same fiber. 470 nm wavelength excitation light was used at 100% intensity in the EVOS FL digital microscope.
For comparison, this is fluorescence microscopy of native Bombyx mori silk. 470 nm wavelength excitation light was used at 100% intensity in the EVOS FL digital microscope.
Fiber Strength
Stress Strain curve for the co-spun silk with NCSilkGFP.
Our fiber had a Young's modulus of 5.39 GPa. The Young's modulus is a measure of the fiber's elasticity. The fiber's ultimate strength, or stress at which failure occurs, was 103.4 +/- 6.6 MPa. The toughness of the fiber, which is the total energy that the fiber absorbed before breaking, was 1.47 megaJoules. The maximum strain, or deformation, that the fiber tolerated before breaking was 2.2% of the original unstressed length (10mm).
Overall, this fiber that we co-spun was extremely stiff and brittle and did not match the properties of natural silk. However, this could be largely attributed to the fact that we did not stretch the fiber after spinning, which is known to be a crucial process that confers silk with much of its natural strength and elasticity.[3] It has been determined in the literature that silk reconstituted from silk dopes and stretched to several times its length can have properties matching or even exceeding those of natural silk fibers.[6] Stretching is known to cause further formation of beta sheet crystals in the fiber, as well as align them in the same axis which allows them to form more hydrogen bonds with each other, thereby increasing the fiber's overall strength.[6] We still need to stretch our co-spun silk after spinning in order to determine if the NCSilkGFP actually"

Having amplified our synthetic sequences and our linearised backbones, we proceed to attempt a serious run of 3A assembly. Things were looking up... Which made it all the more disappointing to find out that just one of our five BioBrick plates grew any colonies! (we were attempting ORF314 with His-tag, the stf gene with and without His-tag, and tfa both as a standalone gene and in a circuit) The stf gene with His-tag was the only apparent success, but on running the product on a gel, we discovered that in fact we were dealing with empty vectors, with our gene nowhere in sight! Time for some troubleshooting...

With the Giant Jamboree rapidly approaching, we finally have some great developments this week! On close examination of our gene sequences, it turned out the amplification of the various sequences had resulted in incompatible ends between the genes and the standard backbones. Annoying, but at least now we know and can address the issue... Luckily, this was not a problem for our tail fibre assembly (tfa) circuit, which we managed to clone into the shipping vector this week. Gel electrophoresis and sequencing confirmed it was really there, so we now have a brand-spanking-new composite part to our name! This was followed by a successful sequencing result for our cloning of a promoter into a previously-existing tetracycline repressor (TetR) circuit, so things are looking up with two composite parts and a basic part registered and ready.

In Vivo Protein Fusion Assembly Using Self Excising Ribozyme
ABSTRACT
Introns, self-excising ribozymes, can become a useful tool to create in vivo protein fusions of BioBrick parts. To make this possible, intron sequences are used to flank non-protein parts embedded in coding sequences. An intron sequence with an embedded recombination site is capable of in vivo insertion of a compatible protein fusion part. As an example, a GFP-fusion was created with an intervening lox site that is removed from the final protein using the intron to form a fully functional GFP protein. In vivo protein fusions can be applied to a larger number of modular systems to make complicated expression systems, such as synthetic antibodies or plants capable of Cry-toxin domain shuffling.
WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK OUR GENEROUS SPONSORS.

Project
The goal of Waterloo's 2011 iGEM project is to implement self-excising ribozymes (introns) as biobricks. But first, what are self-excising ribozymes? Ribozymes are ribonucleic acid (RNA) enzymes and enzymes are reaction catalysts. So ribozymes are just RNA sequences that catalyze a (trans-esterification) reaction to remove itself from the rest of the RNA sequence. Essentially these are considered introns, which are intragenic regions spliced from mRNA to produce mature RNA with a continuous exon (coding region) sequence. Self-excising introns/ribozymes consist of type I and II introns. They are considered self-splicing because they do not require proteins to intitialize the reaction. Therefore, by understanding the sequences and structure of these self-excising introns and making them useable, we can use them as tools to make other experiments easier.
1.0 INTRODUCTION
This design provides a reasonable basis to implement in vivo applications involving RNA level regulatory sequences. The fusion proteins produced surpass strictly what is coded in the DNA. As a result of incorporating ribozyme segments in between two halves of the protein coded in the DNA construct, a regulatory sequence (such as a recombination site) could be included. Since recombination sites can interrupt the functional production of a protein if translated fully (resulting in excess amino acids in the polypeptide), the incorporated ribozyme portions remove them before"

In the previous iGEM competitions, human practice was always the vital and indispensable element. As a group of creators, we devoted ourselves to producing a practical and effective Bio machine. To achieve that tough goal, we need to not only spend a ton of time in the lab but also do something relative to the society who will be our target consumer and real beneficiary. Therefore, we took some actions.
We designed the questionary and gave them out on the website and different communities to see whether people were interested in our project. To find out the existing questions among the sweeteners found already and to improve our project, we interview some relevant authoritative experts. Besides, market demand and trading policy are also significant for us and that’s why we went and discussed with Sixin Wang, the chief engineer of Sdic Zhonglu Fruit Juice Co.,Ltd (the NO.1 company that focuses on producing concentrated apple juice) and some of the bosses in the COFCO (the one of the top 500 corporations and the most advanced food supplier in China) right after we finished our original plan. In later period, we organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University to have a large scale conference to popularize iGEM and collected the critical advice to improve our project. On the final stage, we met the bosses of COFCO again and we were proudly encouraged by them and they believed that we were likely to be successful in the future market.
QUESTIONARY
After we were sending out the questionaries on the website and communities, we realized that different people prefer various flavors, but most of them are still fans of sweetness which makes people feel happy and warm. According to what we found，there is an excellent opportunity for us to research the sweeteners. Prior to we design the specific plan, it is necessary for us to learn about the existing questions relevant to the sweeteners that been observed already.
We mainly have two questions:
Which sweetener do you prefer?
What are your interesting features of sweetness?
Through these two questions our questionary got the information about the market demand. We knew"

Submitted Biobricks
Parts
We placed the first prion-based inheritance element construction into a standard biological parts, also called BioBricks. These are nucleic acid coding molecular biological functions, along with the associated information defining and describing the parts.  You can find more information about this on the website of The BioBricks Foundation .
Using these molecules any synthetic biologist or biological engineer can program living organisms. All our parts are available to anyone for free via MIT's Registry of Standard Biological Parts .
We also placed the PM2 gene, coding the LEA3 protein, in another Biobrick, and probed that it conferes to our E. coli protection against extreme temperature.
<groupparts>iGEM010 Valencia</groupparts>
LEA
Function
PM2 corresponds to the LEA3 protein from soybean (Glycine max). Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins are known for their roles in plant embryogenesis, as important dessication-resistance factors. It has also been shown that they confer tolerance under several stress conditions in Escherichia coli. You can read more about it in our wiki and in several references, as, for example, the following: Liu et al. (2010).
LEA14 Three dimensional representation of the LEA14 proteinn.(EPDB)
PM2 can be useful as a general stress-resistance factor. It could improve survival under low or high temperatures, water stress and maybe other atypical conditions.
Original source
Our PM2 was inserted into the pET28a vector and transformed into E. coli BL21 Star cells.  We sincerely thank professor Yizhi Zheng and Yun Liu (College of Life Science, Shenzhen University. Guangdong, China) for sending us the plasmid with the gene, and, in consequence,"

Cultures were grown from the resulting colonies and screened for biobrick parts with the standard VF and VR primer combination. The amplicons were electrophoresed and the size of fragments were referenced to the expected sizes of the fragments for the respective parts.

Sequencing Parts
The parts were sequenced in the pSB plasmids to confirm their integrity by Sanger method using the sequencing facility at The University of Pretoria. The reactions were set up using BigDye 3.1, its buffer and 150 ng of the respective plasmids as template. Forward and reverse reactions were run using VF and VR primers. Unfortunately when analysing the sequence data it was found that the Cre generator (BBa_K1768004) construct contained two significant mutations in the coding region of the construct. The seven bp deletion causes frame shirt and would render the recombinase protein deactivated. The other gBlock fragment sequences were correct with no mutations.
Figure 4. Chromatogram showing the two deletions in the Cre construct from two different sequenced constructs.
Due to time constraints the project will regrettably be completed after the jamboree. The original synthesised gBlock for the Cre recombinase will be re-cloned to create a functional plasmid set for the characterisation of the various switches proposed.
Future
In order to assess that the excision switch and inverter constructs function as expected an experiment will be conducted where the Cre protein expression is activated and thus characterise the behaviour of the biobricks.
E. coli colonies containing both the Cre protein and the Recombination switch plasmids will be selected. The respective vectors contain Chloramphenicol and Ampicillin resistant genes and will be cultured under these selective agents in LB media. A series of 5 aliquots of the culture during log phase growth will be induced. These will each containing a different concentration of IPTG (0.1-1.0 mM). The presence of IPTG activates Cre expression through pLac promoter, which in turn leads to recombination. The expected result of recombination will be the expression of RFP.

Characterisation
Strains made by transformation with required DNA. Overnight cultures with cells of the required strains in 2.5ml LB + 40mg/ml Cml were grown in the dark at 37C with shaking. ONs were as follows:
JM109 – RLS.lacZ.YFP
envZ – RLS.lacZ.YFP
JM109 – YFP Control
envZ – YFP Control
100μl of ONs were used to inoculate two sterile LB + 40mg/ml Cml making up a total volume of 4ml in 5ml flasks which were then incubated in both light and dark, at 37C with shaking, as follows:
JM109 – RLS.lacZ.YFP (Light / Dark)
envZ – RLS.lacZ.YFP (Light / Dark)
JM109 – YFP Control (Light / Dark)
envZ – YFP Control (Light / Dark)
At 50 minute time intervals 200μl of each sample was taken and mixed with 800μl of sterile water in plastic cuvettes. The optical density of each sample was taken after the spectrophotometer was set with a sample of 200μl of sterile LB and 800μl water as a control, as was the luminescence, with readings for the background luminescence being taken for the sample of LB and water.

The processes of magnetosome-like lipid vesicle formation in the pLQ transformant.
Fig. 11 Not all section had vesicles
Magnetosome-like vesicles were surely detected but not all section had them.
Efficiency of the vesicle formation by pLQ or pLQB was evaluated
Not all sections we observed had vesicles ( Fig. 11 ). We then evaluated our parts.
We need to know the number of E. coli individuals which made magnetosome vesicles after transformation to estimate the efficiency of our parts. However, because we used TEM to observe E. coli, samples of E. coli were fixed by resin and sliced into 100 nm thick sections from different angles. We could not determine the percentage of vesicle-formed E. coli directly from the picture of slices. Therefore, we analyzed the pictures from TEM through reasonable calculation in order to determine the percentage.
Here we defined one value, vesicle-observation-rate (VOR). VOR is the average possibility that magnetosome vesicles were reflected in one section of E. coli (not one individual). Theoretical value of VOR can be calculated from the size of E. coli and the vesicles; we assumed 500 nm size magnetosome at maximum and the size of each E. coli transformant was calculated from the TEM image. We calculated parts efficiencies using theoretical and measured VOR. Specific formula and concept are described in ""Material and Method"" page .
We noticed that the transformants with pLQB or pLQ are larger than the control strain( Fig. 16 ). Their average size were 1.44 (pLQ) and 2.46 (pLQB) times larger than negative control ( Fig. 13 ). Using these values, we calculated the theoretical VORs for pLQ (21.7%) and for pLQB (13.1%). These are the expected probability of vesicle apperance in a single section of E. coli when all cells harbor one vesicle.
When we measured actual VORs from the experimental data, the values were 9.1% (pLQ) and 10.0% (pLQB). Thus, the parts efficiencies, calculated by dividing measured VOR by that theoretical one, were 41.9% (pLQ) and 76.3% (pLQB), respectively. These values were obtained based on a model that assumes 500 nm magnetosome at maximum size of the vesicles, to avoid over-estimation of the parts efficiency"

Overview of Yeast Toolkit
Combinatorial Yeast Expression Cassette Library
We are creating a library of yeast promoters and 3'UTRs that are fully compatible with the BioBrick standard. The sequences come from the upstream and downstream region of 12 yeast genes, and are associated with varying levels of expression strength: 4 for strong expression, 4 for medium expression, and 4 for weak expression.
In addition to our BioBrick compatible promoters and 3'UTRs, we have also given the same sequences designed overhangs with BsaI sites to facilitate Golden Gate assembly, which we are using in our violacein projects . The Golden Gate assembly method has advantages over BioBrick assembly in that multiple pieces can be ligated together at once with no scar.
Yeast Shuttle Vector Library
Using Sikorski and Christianson et al.'s pRS 400-series shuttle vectors as a base, we created a vector platform that is fully compatible with the BioBrick Standard Assembly. This involved site-directed mutagenesis to remove unique restriction sites from within the vector as well as a multiple cloning site substitution. The end product is a vector with a BioBrick multiple cloning site for use with Standard Assembly. Because of the various needs of synthetic biological systems in terms of artificial selection, our vector library contains an array of selectable markers, including histidine, leucine, tryptophan and uracil biosynthetic genes for use in various knockout strains of S. cerevisiae. Each respective marker is available in three plasmid types: integrating, CEN/"

Discussion
We got responses from 1571 people. More than half of the respondents had negative image about genetic engineering. When they hear the word genetic engineering, GM foods came to the mind for many. The technology of gene-recombination came across some decades ago. The word itself seemed to have become common today, but almost nobody knows what it really is. When asked what they think about gene-recombination, more than one third said that it is something unknown. It is significant for iGEM to appeal its safety, utility, and the environmental impact.
Conclusion
Gene-recombination is applied not only to food, but also to medicine, the environment and broader industries. This trend will never cease. Synthetic biology will evolve continuously, as the number of participating teams in iGEM is also increasing year by year. The research in this field has huge potential. Through Policy & Practices we hope to play a role in improving people’s awareness about gene-recombination.

Bacterioferritin is one of the three forms of ferritin-like proteins found in bacteria. It has been shown that overexpression of bacterioferritin in E. coli Nissle 1917 can lead to a visible contrast change in MRI, which allows for visualization of the bacteria (Figure 2). [7]
Bacterioferritin and CATE
In our design, we make bacterioferritin a reporter of passing through Checkpoint 1 . Once enough bacteria have colonized the tumor and overproduction of lactate has been sensed, the AND-gate of the Tumor Sensor is activated. This leads to expression of the MRI contrast agent and the Anti-Cancer Toxin (Figure 3).
Figure 3. Bacterioferritin in our system. Once the Tumor Sensing has been activated, both the Anti-Cancer Toxin azurin and the MRI Contrast Agent bacterioferritin are produced. Azurin will accumulate inside of the bacteria until it is ready for release. Bacterioferritin will take up iron and produce a change in the T2 signal in MRI.
While the Anti-Cancer Toxin will accumulate inside of CATE until it is ready to be released during Cell Lysis , the MRI Contrast Agent will take up iron and create a change in the MRI signal. The change in the signal will alert the doctor of the following:
the bacteria have colonized the correct location,
there are enough bacteria to produce a full dose of the Anti-Cancer Toxin , so the risk of sub-dosing and eventually producing a drug-resistant tumor is minimized, and
the Anti-Cancer Toxin , located on the same plasmid and under the control of the same promoter as the MRI Contrast Agent, has started to accumulate.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of"

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

The figure above was generated by transfecting the inducible expression system and varying the concentration of DOX across 16 different data points, and then analyzing using flow cytometry. We demonstrate that as you increase the concentration of DOX, the mean fluorescence increases. At high concentrations of DOX, we eventually see saturation of signal.

Abstract
Biological parts ,one of the most important tools in the research of synthetic biology ,have been designed ,created and documented in large numbers, most of which ,however, lack scalability. To be more precise, the scalability of a biological part refers to its ability of handling of expanding scale of input and output and the ability of expansion in function. In our project, we aim to demonstrate that a scalable biological part could be devised through proper arrangement of certain sequences in the presence of some protein. We resort to an scalable electronic component ,PLD or Programmable Logic Device in this project. The definition of PLD from Wikipedia is quoted as below:” A programmable logic device or PLD is an electronic component used to build reconfigurable digital circuits. Unlike a logic gate, which has a fixed function, a PLD has an undefined function at the time of manufacture. Before the PLD can be used in a circuit it must be programmed, that is, reconfigured.” That is, digital systems could be integrated to it at will through computer programming by the user, instead of producing an electronic component with a fixed function. Actually, we have constructed a biological part that functions as a PLD, though primitive. The most basic elements in digital circuits are the AND gate and OR gate. We resort to Cre/LoxP system to enable the biological part with the ability to interchange between AND gate and OR gate by regulation of the concentration of the protein Cre. readmore
Design
With the help of site-specific recombination, we manage to change the logic from the physical layer. To a further step, we design a system whose logic changes between AND and OR. readmore
Scalability
We can transform AND gate into OR gate through a flip of the sequence between opposite loxP sites. Moreover, based on a similar idea, our system shows a strong scalability in further design. readmore

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the number of circulating red blood cells. An increase in the red blood cell population in blood will decrease endogenous EPO production. If the concentration of EPO in the blood falls below a certain level (9.8 mU/ml in the case of this model), neocytolysis is triggered. Neocytolysisis the selective lysis of young red blood cells by the body to allow it to decrease its red blood count at a higher rate and reach the desired partial pressure of oxygen in the blood.
The series of partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe red blood production was modeled with a simplified linear age population method which provided similar accuracy to more computationally intensive PDE solvers. The red blood cell production model is then combined with the compartment and infection model to determine the effects of EPO gene doping on red blood cell count.
Comprehensive cell cycle model for RBCs in the context of EPO
The process of red blood cell formation, from stem cell to red blood cell can be modelled in time through a series of partial differential equations based on the age of the cells. Each of the cell stages (BFU-E, CFU-E, erythroblasts, marrow reticulocytes and red blood cells) is represented by a partial differential equation. The general form of the equation is shown in figure 13.
Figure 13. Breakdown of the general PDE used to model the various cell stages that occur in the process of red blood cell production.
Starting at cell age 0 days, when stem cells become BFU-E cells, the age span up until cell age 141 days. When red blood cells are recycled by macrophages, the cells can be broken up into populations of cells at a certain age. For every cell stage, the population density of cells at a given maturity and time can modelled as a population mesh. A population mesh is a numerical estimator that breaks down the process of red blood cell production into populations at a given age. A mesh point is the population of cells of a specific age. When modelled as a mesh, the following assumptions of the relation between a change in time and a change in maturity can be made.
Assumptions
For a population of cells u of age μ and at time t, a change in time Δt will result in an equal change in maturity Δμ, assuming that the maturation velocity \(vs(E(t))=1\).
The maturation velocity is 1 for every stage except the marrow reticulocytes, where the time cells stay in this stage depends on the concentration of EPO"

Introduction:
Our system starts to work with constitutive production of LuxI. After HSL is produced by LuxI, it forms complex with LuxR whoso transcription is controlled by the activity of LuxPL promoter. HSL&LuxR complex negatively regulates LuxPL promoter, as a result when the number of HSL&LuxR complex increase individual cells will drop expression level of LuxR. LasPR promoter is in the control of LasR expression and as HSL&LuxR complex amount increase the LasR production increases. Because the minC expression controlled by LasR promoter, as LasR increases which means as amount of HSL&LuxR complex increases, the expression level of minC increases. Because minC acts as cell division inhibitor after 55 fold of its normal level, we conclude that increase in the HSL&LuxR complex amount to certain level will cause cell division to stop. Since HSL molecules produced by each cell will eventually affect other cells, thanks to this system we can control cell density. To understand mechanism correctly and choose constitutive promoter that will control the rate of production of LuxI according to the desired cell density we mathematically modelled system and then create a program that gives user a chance to select starting promoter and to see resulting number of cells graph

Slovenia_HS,2015,Team:Slovenia HS#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"ACHING OUT TO GENERAL PUBLIC
Reaching out to general public, we were faced with two greater problems: public ignorance  concerning synthetic biology and the negative attitude about GMOs.  Explaining our project to friends and family, we realized that people are mostly completely unaware  of what synthetic biology even is, let alone anything more specific, which is understandable.  Humanities and social sciences relate closely and noticeably to our everyday life, and are therefore  more integrated into the general education of citizens of Slovenia. Understanding science, however,  especially something as peculiar to the general public as synthetic biology is, often requires very  specific knowledge that is thought at universities but is less easily accessible otherwise. For instance,  the news on national television covers topics such as politics, international relations and culture  every evening, but science is not often mentioned. Besides just the problem of being unaware, this  minimal representation of science also means it is often not founded well, which affects the future of  our nation more than we might realize.  Moreover, people who are more aware of genetic engineering and synthetic biology, often have a  rather unfavorable attitude towards it, mostly focusing on the potentially negative sides of it, but are  usually unaware of the positive sides, such as production of insulin, artemisinin and other drugs that  were made much more affordable and safe precisely by the use of genetic engineering.  For these two reasons we have decided one of our main priorities would be firstly introducing  synthetic biology to society and secondly addressing the public concerns regarding it.
TRADITIONAL MEDIA
We realized that the way to reach the most people would be by traditional media: newspapers,  television, radio and internet platforms. Therefore, we have contacted and invited reporters and  journalists to both our labs, showed them our work and results and talked about our project. More  importantly we talked about the importance of natural sciences and synthetic biology in particular to  the society, especially when dealing with issues like health, nutrition and the environment.  Our efforts proved fruitful, as we have managed to be featured and seen many times.  We had an interview for Radio Študent, where our team member talked about the iGEM competition  and importance of biofuel. Radio Študent is one of the biggest and oldest European uncommercial radio stations. We were featured on their programme for a 15 disscusion on 21. May. You can hear the full recording (in Slovene) here.
.  We appeared on TV as well. We had two interviews for evening news programs, talking about engagement of youth in sciences, "

Compare the toxicity profile of other excipients to S. epidermidis. (M. Foldvari, personal communication, August 1, 2014)
Product transport
Since Staphylocide contains live Staphylococcus epidermidis cells, the transport of our product to health care facilities and preparation must be considered.
From our research, the ideal form for our product is an ointment. Using a topical medium for administration would be the most effective for Staphylocide because most MRSA infections originate as skin infections and Staphylocide can easily be applied to patient skin.  First, during production, regular assessment of our engineered S. epidermidis cells must be performed to ensure that the plasmid is maintained.  This can be accomplished by using an auxic strain.   By requiring the presence of a gene for organismal survival, adding a gene essential to growth on the plasmid with the non-functional gene found on the bacteria's genome, the bioreactor’s environmental conditions could be set such that if the plasmid were not essential for survival, the cell line would lose the plasmid in attempt to reduce its metabolic load.
It is also important to preserve the viability of our engineered S.epidermidis cells.  Production,  transportation, and storage could decrease the number of viable cells decreasing its effectiveness.  Considering the shelf-life of Staphylocide after production, the use of refrigeration during transport and storage would prevent excessive growth of the engineered S. epidermidis cells, but still keep them viable.  As this product would only be available by prescription, transport will only be from the production site to a health care facility.
Scalability
We assessed management of the project’s transition from the laboratory work into society’s functional use.
Our proposal for scaling up the project is as follows: Process highlights for the scaled production of donor cells (Lian, 2012)
Establish dedicated manufacturing equipment and facilities.
Choose a strain for the “master seed lot” to preserve desired characteristics.
Maintain a succession of cultures so that live bacteria will be available for each new batch"

Yesterday´s gel confirm the sizes of all the biobricks needed (see the wells 4-10 in the first gel of this site), I did a second round of digestions though, in order to have enough DNA. After a new gel and check sizes, I did the assemblies 1A and 2A (see locks and keys section). Also, I transformed by heat shock and electroporation these assemblies and did plates and culture tubes with respective antibiotic.

We also see lower TNFa expression in each No LPS sample when compared to the same sample with LPS. This indicates that our microglia activation process is indeed successful.
Experiment Weaknesses:
We are missing a negative control of BV2 microglia which underwent the infection process without the plasmid. Without this sample our conclusions are less concrete as we are not able to quantify the effect of the infection process on cytokine secretion.
Not enough biological repetitions for all samples.
Experiment Strengths:
There was no contamination in this experiment and the technical and biological repetitions indicated no technical errors.
 
Experiment 2: Quantify the expression of TNFa through qPCR using BV2 cell line infected with the shIKK vector using Lentivirus. With the addition of a negative control of BV2 microglia which underwent the infection process without the plasmid.

Expectations:
We expect to see a low expression of TNFa in the +shIKK +LPS samples (columns 1,2,3) when compared to the -shIKK +LPS (columns  4,5,6). This would indicate that the infection was successful and that IKKb was indeed knocked down, leading to a decrease in cytokine secretion. Additionally, we expect to see lower values of TNFa in the +LPS WT samples (columns 7, 8, 9) when compared to the +LPS -shIKK samples (columns 4,5,6). This would confirm that the spinfection (transfection reagent) process stresses the cells thus inducing increased cytokine secretion.

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,", we followed two approaches: firstly to study the impact of the techniques used in the project as well                   as the awareness of those performing them, second to study the controversies that might occur in the future implementation of our project.
The survey was distributed in two stages, aimed at two distinct stakeholders of synthetic biology. The first stage was a formal EPFL questionnaire distributed among second year Life Sciences Engineering bachelor students during their laboratory                 practicals. It was included as a reflection part of an ethical course of engineers in biotechnology. The second stage was a distribution externally to the campus and country on animal experimentation, patient biological data protection,                 vaccination and biotechnology in general.
The questionnaire differs from that of the NUS Singapore-Sci iGEM Team in terms of content and is focused on gathering data specific to our project so that we can understand how to implement that data, however the discussion and exchange                 of ideas that we had allowed us to clarify our intentions in terms of the subjects we wanted to touch on for our surveys.
iGEM XMU China
We were very excited to get contacted by this year’s XMU iGEM team who are working on their own assay called the Aptamer Based Cell-free Detection system (ABCD system). They are using Cas12a in an ingenuitive way to detect proteins through                   the intermediary of aptamers. Indeed, aptamers have the capacity of recognizing a specific protein and by doing so will release a ssDNA that will be recognized by Cas12a. Since both of our teams are working on a Cas12a detection using                   fluorophore quencher it was natural for us to give them all the knowledge we had gathered over the summer about our Cas12a assay.
In addition to their detection method, XMU’s team worked on improving protein’s conservation and were kind enough to share their information on using SAHS proteins as a Cas12a protective agent. It was obvious for us that we could immensely                 benefit from this to bring our follow up cancer surveillance closer to the point-of-care. Unfortunately because of time restrictions we were not able to integrate their assay. This collaboration was nevertheless extremely conducive to                 reflect on how we would get closer to our end product and for this we are very appreciative!
iGEM Athens
The collaboration with the Athens IGEM team started early in the summer, after members of both teams identified multiple shared attributes between the two projects, namely cell free expression, and diagnostic kit development. Thus, the contact started with             multiple video conferences over the summer. These conferences discussed iGEM EPFL’s experience with cell free systems optimization,"

Week 3
Calculate growth rate for the e. coli used by Thomas.
Week 4
Tried the Event function in Matlab to generate oscillations in the system. This failed due to the fact that it could be only used for single cells and not for multi cell populations. We did not know that this was a limitation of the function.  Try to look at the effect of the total volume for a single cell and multicell, but the multicell was not possible.
October
Week 1
I got a code for generating oscillations from my supervisor, but it needed to be debugged. So I spended the week on doing this myself and together with my supervisor.   Make a heatmap for the subpopulation system about the ratio of lambda-cl and 434 compared to the RFP production.
Week 2
look at ratios lambda-cl and 434 to compare with the data Thomas got from the lab. He used a library for the promoter from the subpopulation system. Tried to simulate the combined model with total RFP.
Beehave
July
Week 4
Orientation literature research, found articles on BEEHAVE model. Proceeded to read the modeling articles BEEHAVE is based on. Also installed NetLogo and ran a few standard simulations.
August
Week 1
Started looking into BEEHAVE model and figuring out how to integrate BeeT into it. Identified ways of adding mite mortality to the model. Made a very rough first approximation of mite mortality and fixed resultant bugs.
Week 2
Start looking into how to have transport BeeT into the hive. Initial idea is to add an additional 'BeeT' patch, turns out patches are hard coded into the model and adding in a new one is difficult. Got started with a new BeeT module 'BeeTproc' since the changing the patch was a dead end.
Week 3
Started using a local github depository since changes were getting difficult to keep track of. Added comments to all the code I added and put everything into github. Also coupled BeeT in the hive to mite mortality. Added period at which BeeT patch is present.
Week 4
Worked on getting initial results by increasing year round mite mortality, worked on understanding RNetLogo and getting some statistics for results. More background literature research as many aspects of system still unclear
September
Week 1
Had a call with a beekeeper (Johan Calis) and based on that"

Kinetic Parameters Identification
First of all, we shall clarify that, being dedicated to dry lab experiments, we naturally doesn't have as many incarnated Bio-Parts as usual wet labs do.
In wet lab experiment, kinetic parameters are notorious for their difficulties to be obtained quantitatively. To construct a well fabricated device, the kinetic parameters are crucial for an extensible part. When certain parts are placed in the network, certain biochemical reactions with holding kinetic parameters are introduced. To identify kinetic parameters of basic devices determines the extensibility of devices.
Model 2
is a subsystem of Model 3 .
Model 2 and Model 3 from 2009 USTC Wet Team
Here we put forward another feasible way to define dynamic parameters of biochemical reactions, and further characterization of single biobrick and combined bio-devices, in terms of chemical dynamics view.

UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Notebook#MiniTn7_-_-_TEXT.html,"-preps of pSB1C3-attTn7 and pBBR1-MCS4 and digested them with EcoRI and SpeI.
Constructing the pUC18R6KT-miniTn7-Gm. The previous week I could not reach any conclusions of the analytic digestions of a putative pUC18R6KT-miniTn7-Gm. I repeated the digestions with higher amounts of DNA and I realized that there were not positive results. Because of the lack of re-ligation of the vector we think it could be not well-cut. I repeated the digestions of pUC18R6KT PCR product and ligation with miniTn7-Gm. Then I performed three transformations: two with two different preparations of electro-competent DH5α-λpir cells and another with chemically competent DH5α-λpir cells. Only the plates of the chemical transformation had a reasonable number of colonies. I set up 24 inocula of the chemical transformation plates, doing replica in a Gm and Ap plate. The next day I did mini-preps only of the inocula whose replica grew (18). The mini-preps were digested with SfiI and BglI and four candidates showed the expected restriction patter. Finally I had got the main construction of the miniTn7 BioBrick tool kit.
Characterizing pUC18-SfiI-miniTn7-Gm. I preformed colony PCR to detect the site-specific insertion of the miniTn7 in the P. putida genome with 11/11 positives in conjugation product strains and 10/12 positives in electroporation product strains. Repetitions of the electroporation and conjugation to measure transposition frequency were made, but I made mistakes diluting before plating and the results were not usable.
Characterizing the resistance excision by Flp recombinase. We were to use the pFLP2 plasmid, which carried the Flp recombinase or flipase gen, to recombine the FRT cassettes who flank the Gm resistance cassette of pUC18SfiI-miniTn7BB-Gm. I followed the protocol for recombination by flipase until patching in different selective plates because there was growth in every patch, what means that the Gm cassette was not excised. Thus, I started again.
Creating variants of pUC18SfiI-miniTn7BB-Gm. The objective was to include BioBricks into the BCS of the miniTn7 and change its resistance"

Outlook
Although production of rhamnolipids in P. putida could not be carried out successfully here, it has been demonstrated that establishing thereof is feasible. For example, the iGEM teams from Uppsala 2015 produced rhamnolipids in E. coli and University of Columbia 2016 in P. putida. Wittgens et al. also reported the construction of new production strains for rhamnolipid synthesis in P. putida KT2440 [R.2] .
Heterologous production of di-rhamnolipids is feasible as previous mentioned examples show, since the molecular biological techniques are all standard methods nowadays. As rhlC could not be added to the registry as sought, this task is still open for following teams.
Linkage
The objective of our experiments was the chemical and enzymatic linkage of the produced compounds. Through linkage of the antimicrobial agents to the chitosan scaffold we generated our anti germ coating.
Chemical linkage
The aim of the experiment was the linking of the antimicrobial agent rhamnolipid to the chitosan scaffold by divinyladipate [L.1] . Thereby, divinyladipate acts as a linker. By transesterfication an ester bond is formed between the components and they become connected.
First, we tried to verify the successful linkage by IR-spectroscopy. No specific peak was found to identify the formed ester bond. There was an ester peak in each spectrograph of the product. This peak likely originates from the ester bond in the rhamnolipid. Therefore, IR-spectroscopy was no appropriate method to verify the reaction and we tried an other approach to prove the success of the reaction.
We analyzed different mixtures of the educts as controls for the reaction (Figure L.1).

Overview
""Dr. George D. Yancopoulos, chief scientific officer of Regeneron,          said the crisis had pointed up shortcomings in biodefense. “Nobody is          really prepared,” he said. “Nobody in the world has rapid response          capabilities.”—New York Times, January 2015
Humans need improved methods for making therapeutic antibodies.          Producing these complex proteins is hard but important; the 2014 Ebola          Outbreak illustrates the urgency. In response, we propose the use of          microalgae as a widescale antibody production platform. Microalgae have          all the benefits of higher-level plants but scale faster and are easier          to process. Furthermore, from a holistic point of view, microalgae are an          ideal chassis; their primary carbon source is CO2 and they are          unlikely to harbor mammalian pathogens.
The Need
""I rate the chance of a nuclear war within my lifetime as being          fairly low. I rate the chance of a widespread epidemic, far worse than          Ebola, in my lifetime, as well over 50 percent."" —Bill          Gates
Epidemic spread modeling by Brockmann's group          at Humbolt University. (http://rocs.hu-berlin.de/). This model shows the          spread of a theoretical outbreak of a particularly contagious pathogen in          Atlanta, GA. The spread is over 60 days.
With the most recent Ebola Outbreak, over 28 thousand were infected by          the deadly pathogen and an estimated 11 thousand died. Meanwhile, a          potent anti-Ebola antibody cocktail, ZMapp, was going through preclinical          studies. In a study where 18 heavily Ebola infected monkeys were treated with          ZMapp, all 18 survived, including several in the hemorrhaging stage of          the disease. Given the timing and urgent need, ZMapp was approved for use          in humans.[ 1 ]
Antibodies are unique and powerful tools for eliminating pathogens.          Unfortunately,          ZMapp’s utility was hindered by lack of supply, not an apparent inability          to neutralize the virus (as illustrated by the Rhesus model). Only 7          doses were available throughout the Ebola Outbreak despite infection          rates in the thousands. Ultimately, it represents an absence of rapid antibody production capabilities"
Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Project#CF_-_-_TEXT.html," are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html," computer meets biology, a magic. Here is the answer, iGEM! This is my first year in iGEM and I love it. This is the place where I can do exactly what I want to do. I am interested in bioinformatics, genetics, microbiology as well as programming. In past two years, I’ve involved two modeling projects. One is aim to model human kidney in 3D for education purpose, and the other one is using individual-based model to simulate ecology system. In my spare time, I like to do some reading, writing, drawing random things or maybe thinking for nothing.
Colin Brown
Hello, my name is Colin Brown. I am a second year student at the University of Calgary studying mechanical engineering with a biomedical specialization. This past summer was filled with lots of learning about the vast field of synthetic biology, as it was my first year with iGEM Calgary. I came to realize that engineering has many different applications in biotechnology, and is a field I have become very interested in. Over the past few months I helped design our team’s bioreactor, which included design research, computer modeling, and physical prototyping. I am also a sports director with the Engineering Student Society, and am a new member of the formula SAE (society of automotive engineers) design team with UofC. Other interests of mine include hockey, golf, outdoor activities, and spending time with family and friends.
Emily Hicks
This is my fourth summer in iGEM, which probably means that I really need to get a life.  This summer I will be working on both team OSCAR and FRED as well as yelling at people in the lab for leaving the gel boxes open and moving the enzymes.  I’ll no doubt be enjoying the late nights in the lab and hope to learn by the end of the season how to successfully carry a gel from the lab to the imager in one piece.  In my spare time I enjoy beating David at flight control and other important tasks.

OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,2015,Team:OLS Canmore AB CA#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," if they have a working prototype at the giant Jamboree, I personally wish them the best (-Joshua Lamb)
Consort’s Collaboration Write Up for Canmore: Canmore’s project deals primarily with the issue of hair and feather build up in the water treatment systems. This is clearly a major issue and can use extensive amounts of money and time to remedy. There is an extreme amount of inconvenience to unclog the water treatment systems once they get to this point. Creating a BioBrick to produce keratinases could be an effective and cheap solution to the problem and also in preventing the problem. Our concerns for Canmore lie in the prototype and safety. The specific engineering and prototyping of a bioreactor is extremely important. The conditions required to keep the bacteria alive, the amount of  keratinases that would need to be produced and what kind of a time span are all aspects to look into when designing the bioreactor. Their plan to use the membrane bioreactor is a very good and easily applicable idea but the research as to optimum conditions concerning the production of the gene are incredibly important. Having a viable analysis of the cost, time and resources required to make this something we can implement is society is also an important consideration. The time frame of how long it takes to break down the keratin is also something to look into. The comparison of the time requirements to break down other pollutants in the bioreactor chamber compared with the time to break down keratin. Knowing this will allow a design maximizing potential.  Other thoughts for them to consider include: what types of bacteria are already being used in the bioreactor? What are they breaking down? Is there a way to genetically modify bacteria already in use to contain the kera or karus gene? This would eliminate the need to introduce another species and readjust conditions while allowing maximum productivity.  Overall, I believe this project could introduce a valid and much needed solution to the issue of hair build up and could be quite effective, quick and safe. As the bioreactor is not connected to the main water line and is completely contained, contamination of water with E. coli would not be an issue. The proposed prototype also utilizes the current system and technologies used making it as easy as possible for implementation. Canmore has done an excellent job in looking at the practical portions of their project and with more research, their project could do a lot of good in our world. (-Sam Davies)

""Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.” ― Dr. Seuss
What is next?
Not all good things have to end. We present this year's iGEM project at the Giant Jamboree in Boston the 24-28th of September, but this does not mean the work on the project has to stop. We have been working within a strict time frame, but if there had not been a limit, our project could likely have moved mountains.
Despite of all our efforts; in the lab, in the community, on the wiki and with everything else there came along, many aspects still remains unexplored. We have thought and discussed next steps and a fare out future that could take this project to its next level.
Figure 1: PAST is the future.
A lot of the future work would be in the wet lab, aiming to examine a peptide aptamer, determine some of its parameters such as its affinity towards its target and its specificity. To read more about our idea for the future laboratory work, please go to Lab Work .
To know ones limitations is beneficial, because first then and only then, can one challenge and push his own limits. Working with living organisms provides many challenges and boundaries that we have yet"

Secondly, the recombination fragment obtained from OE-PCR was transformed to the CEN.PK2-1C which has been already knocked out the endogenous genes ura, his and trp. Additionally, the colony was chosen by the relevant nutritional deficiency medium.
verification
To verify whether the gene was actually knocked out and to avoid false positive colonies, we designed primer1, 2, 3 and 4 for each gene, as shown in Fig.2. The primer 1 and primer 4 were designed according to the yeast genome. The primer 2 was designed according to the selection maker and primer 3 was to the gene which would be knocked out.
Fig.2 Verification strategy
We got positive result using the primer 1 and 2, meanwhile the negative result would be detected by using primer 1 and 3. Then we sequenced the PCR product using primer 1 and 4 to further confirm the realness of the results.

Paris_Bettencourt,2012,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," washing their hands with disinfectant before leaving the laboratory to avoid transmitting potentially harmful material to the public/environment. However, we are conscious that as any bacterium, E.coli can be hazardous. For instance, all traumatic wounds, infected burns and any serious lesions can potentially be contaminated, but it is very rare.  Treatment: E.coli can be treated with standard antibiotics, which can be prescribed by a doctor if needed.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
Did you document these issues in the Registry?
Yes, we did. As mentioned before, biosafety is the essence of our project, and we're preoccupied by the risk of dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes, as well as any other bioactive compounds such as toxins and antitoxins. We addressed this issue in the characterization of our system. For instance, we made a semantically contained version of the Kanamycin resistance gene. We are also planning to make semantically contained version of the toxin.
How did you manage to handle the safety issue?
Several mechanisms were proposed beyond the classical laboratory safety measures :
Semantic containment that avoid the expression of synthetic genes outside the GMOs.
Meganuclease restriction sites that permit the degradation of the antitoxin.
DNases that degrade GMO's genome.
How could other teams learn from your experience?
We believe that other teams should keep in mind that not only the bacteria are potentially dangerous, but also the eventual release of their DNA could endanger the environment. We suggest that starting from next years, all iGEM teams should add a biosafety part to their project, where they should either use one of the existing mechanisms, or design a new one, especially if their project aims at releasing bacteria into the nature. For this purpose, we created a new Biosefety page in the Parts Registry.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
The work has been carried out in the laboratory of Evolutionary Systems Biology at the Molecular, Evolutive and Medical Genetics Unit (U1001, also know as TaMaRa's lab) of the French National Institute of Medical Research ([INSERM]) within the Paris Descartes University's Medical faculty. More importantly, the Biosafety officer of our unit followed our work. Both institutions have their ethical committees though no specific issue concerning our project needed to be raised.
If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
We met the chair of the ethic committee of Paris Descartes, and they advice us to keep thinking"
Valencia_Biocampus,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Molecular_-_-_TEXT.html,"].
The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is as follows: the promoter is activated when there is a lack of O2 in the environment thanks to a family of proteins called FNR. FNR proteins are global transcriptional regulators that respond to fluctuations in ambient oxygen. They recognize DNA sequences in inverted disposition with this sequence: TTGATN1N2N3N4ATCAA [4], where N1-4 represents a non-conserved tetrad (no influence). The FNR sensor domain contains four cysteine residues that act like ligands for a group (cluster) of 4Fe-4S oxygen-sensitive structures. The acquisition of a 4Fe-4S cluster begins heterodimer formation of FNR that bind to specific sites of DNA and regulate transcription of target promoters. Under aerobic conditions (i.e. when oxygen is present), 4Fe-4S clusters are disassembled and the FNR dimers dissociate and form no structures that can bind to DNA.
How did we deal with this construction? Anaerobic conditions were achieved after putting a culture of E. coli, stirring, inside a sealed box. We let the bacteria to grow for at least two days and then we measured fluorescence.

Mr. Jinghang Ji, Curator of Hangzhou Low Carbon Science & Technology Museum and vice general director of Green Zhejiang
Before we started discussing possible experiments we could perform in order to help the issue of global warming, we decided to consult Ji, curator of Hangzhou Low Carbon Science & Technology Museum.
Curator Ji was very welcoming and was also very curious about what direction we wanted to take with our experiment. We started off by introducing the general topic we had set for our topic, then he elaborated upon the current pressing issue of global warming on our world and how it is significantly damaging our environment. Afterwards, he introduced us present regulations and effort in China to handle this worrying trend, which he felt promising. When we asked his idea on the main obstruction between humanity and a world with less carbon dioxide, his idea was enlightening: the need for economical sources of energy (fossil fuels) will not end in recent years, and people’s lifestyle also played a big role in climate change. At this moment, our determination in active absorption of CO2 was strengthened and we found the loophole in education towards public on this matter.
Then, we moved on to possible ways we can use genetic engineering in order to help tackle global warming. After a good hour of thoughtful discussion with Ji, we finally came to a mutual agreement upon strategy to approach our experiment. Our experiment would focus on genetically modifying a type of organism to absorb CO2 and then eradicate it in some way to prohibit it from entering the carbon cycle again. Ji also suggested that algae would be good candidates although they might lead to tremendous workload during selection process.
We knew this would not be an easy task, however Curator Ji was confident that through hard work and collaboration, we would be able to have successful results.

The European Experience
From July 2nd to 3rd, three of our team members joined “The European Experience”, a meet-up of iGEM teams from Europe, in Paris. Over 27 teams from around Europe were a part of this great weekend. We heard talks about the challenges and risks of synthetic biology as well as how it is a new business opportunity. We got the chance to connect with people from many parts of Europe while simultaneously getting to present our project and ask for advice or recommendations we also did a sightseeing tour through the city with the teams from Düsseldorf and Leiden.
German Meetup Marburg
The iGEM team Marburg organised a two day meet-up for all the German teams to get together, communicate and learn from each other. All German teams were represented and also joined by the team from the SDU Denmark. Four of our team members drove to Marburg on August 5. In the evening, we split up in different groups, discovered the Oberstadt from Marburg and had first talks about the different projects. On Saturday, we heard different talks from the leader of Symikro Marburg and the mayor of the city. In addition, every team had the chance to present their own project and talk about collaborations. We finished the day off with some matches of bubble soccer and a barbecue. On the next day we all left happy and motivated to collaborate and support each other.
Sponsors
Our project would not have been possible without financial support from multiple sponsors and supporters."
