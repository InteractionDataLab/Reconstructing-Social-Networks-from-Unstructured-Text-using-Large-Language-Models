Amsterdam,2011,Team:Amsterdam#Project#Modules_-_-_TEXT.html,". Make and test a cold resistance backbone
Information on this subject can be found on the Application page .
Concluding
Due lack of time module 1 was not completed, still both promoters were used for creating the assemblies. Modules 4, 5 and 6 were not completed due lack of time and the logistic problems of the parts we received from Yale .

METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html," Parts Registry should     be re-described and correct use of terminology should be enforced during     the submission process.
75% of participants agree that different, specified      submission interfaces should be designed for contructs, promoter,      RBS, CDS and terminals is needed during Registry of Standard Parts. But, there are very strong and valid arguments against it such as,      losing the flexibility of the registry will not allow future submission      of unclassified parts.
We suggest keeping the parts submission interface as is, until     these concerns are addressed.
75% of participants agree that Out-dated, un-available      and not-characterized parts in the Registry of Standard Parts should      be removed to an archive after the consent of the designer.
“It would be great to see some sort of organization like this! I     agree that unavailable parts should be followed up on and removed if     necessary. I also think that parts which are not sufficiently documented     should be highlighted in some way. Once these parts are identified,     teams can actively characterize them as part of their projects or as     side projects.”
“Think about these things: (i) who decides when a part is out-dated,     and how can that person know that an old part cannot have a novel use     in the future? (ii) likewise, an uncharacterized part may be both characterized     and used in the future”
We suggest building a backup system, such as an archive, to sort     out the rarely used, un-available and un-categorized parts until they     are in line with the enforced standards.
91% of participants have same opinion with us, which      is that standardization of the nomenclatures used for each different      composition of parts is necessary.
Standards that should be enforced and Additional New Standards
According to our survey, from high rated to low, these standards     have been rated which has been used while assigning a name to parts
33% Type of part
17% Input
17% Output
14% Version
10% Year
9% Group
Along with above, having short recognizable part names along with     function and performance , Genbank/EMBL link and organism information     is important.
93% of participants have said that for the parts that      are marked as “WORKS” distinguishing the parts with quantitative      experimental validation vs parts without this information is important. Most participants have encountered with similar problems about parts      that don’t work under their lab conditions or works but not they      were claimed for.
89% of participants have same opinion with us, which      is that iGEM should sub-categorize the “WORK"

Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," His hobbies include breakdancing, martial arts and boxing. He wishes to gain more lab experience from working in the iGEM team and to engage with the community and network with other scientists.  Flipper is also the team's Casanova; charming the underwear off anyone in a 6 metre radius. Promptly, they ask for it back, and we send him to the corner of shame.
Paul Turner
Paul is a 4th year physicist at Leeds and enjoys the problem solving aspects of his degree the most. He has always had a keen interest in science, but is keen to see the practical applications. Some of his heroes include visionaries such as Elon Musk, Gordon Gould and Richard Feynman.
Outside of university he enjoys Ten-pin bowling, volleyball, fencing and a few layman interests in history and photography. Paul is good at breaking down complex problems and explaining ideas and concepts to others - an essential skill when friends introduce you as ""a physicist""! Other skills Paul brings to the iGEM team are physical experiment design and coding experience for the web and modelling development side of the project.
As a physicist, he also brings an outside view of Synthetic Biology, and a different approach to measuring data.
The Academics
The iGEM team has gained some significant interest from quite a few academics based at Leeds University, and from multiple departments. The team only has two supervisors, but having so many great minds popping by the office certainly adds to the team's resources!
Luke Bawazer
Luke is a post-doctoral research fellow in the lab of Prof. Fiona Meldrum in the School of Chemistry at University of Leeds. Originally from Ohio, he studied for his PhD at UC Santa Barbara before moving to the UK. He has a wide range of research interests at the interface of materials, chemistry, and biology. Luke is enthusiastic to work with the creative young scientists on Leeds's iGEM team, and looks forward to learning more about Synthetic Biology from and with them. He plays football (or soccer as they say in Ohio) regularly, and listens again and again to Origin of Species in audio format while running and working out in the gym.

KP 3/15/13 Today as we compared our individual findings on methods to destroy the biofilm on cholera, we realized that there are many different approaches to take. We can try to stop biofilm production by disrupting the quorum sensing, destroy the internal mechanism that makes the biofilm, or we can attack the biofilm from the outside. We have decided to focus on that last approach. Our goal now, is to find an enzyme or chemical of some kind and then see if it will break down the biofilm of cholera. There are plenty of enzymes already discovered that break down biofilms on other bacteria, but we cannot find anything specific to cholera. We will probably have to experiment with different proven methods for other bacteria and see what effects it has on cholera. We can also possibly incorporate phage as a deliverer of a substance that breaks down cholera biofilm, but right now we are in search of that enzyme.
KK 3/15/13 We reported on our investigation of various genes and enzymes that last year’s iGEM team had identified as candidates to disrupt the biofilm. Their approaches appear very disjointed: some proteins were meant to directly degrade the biofilm, some were meant to hydrolyze the QS autoinducer molecule, some (appear) to interfere with transcription and translation of HapR related genes. While the advantage to their multi-front approach is that perhaps one of their various technique could work, the disadvantage of being spread too thin I believes overrides the advantage. So, we’ll be homing in on only one approached: direct removal of the biofilm.  Dr. Grose answered a question that had come up as I researched. I learned that two serogroups of Cholera are pathogenic to humans: O1 and O139. I wondered if it were important that the species of cholera that we were to work with be of those two serotypes. Dr. Grose explained that bacteria are grouped serot"

Summary
Summary
Our team delivered talks on biotechnology and our project to over 400 students across 3 cities. Subsequently, we conducted a survey to gauge the students' understanding of the talk and the importance of the problem addressed by our project.
We presented a poster at the poster session by the institute's undergraduate science club. The audience consisted mainly of freshman year students; the director, dean, and several faculties turned up too.
We participated in an Indian iGEM meet where we presented our idea in great detail to students and faculty of the host institution and other iGEMers.
We delivered a presentation to top government officials in our state's department of biotechnology about our project. This was of importance as the ""biotechnology parks"" installed by the government are ill-equipped and our project could enable the use of these facilities for complex biotechnology applications. We received ~$9000 from them towards our project.
Presentation at school
Presentations at schools
We made presentations introducing genetic engineering to students of class 11 and 12 (equivalent to high school sophomores and seniors respectively) in 5 different schools across 3 different cities.  Broadly, the presentations had 3 parts:
a. Definitions of some basic terms used in genetic engineering such as gene, promoter, operator, inducer, reporter etc and how to put together these modular components in constructing genetic circuits.
b. A simple, binary framework for quantitatively analyzing the outputs of simple genetic circuits.
c. Introduction to iGEM, our project, and some previous years' projects. In enhancing the awareness of high school students about genetic engineering and iGEM, most teams undertake some form of a. and c.; however, we think we stand out by including b., a technique by which students would be able to quantitatively predict the output of the circuits they construct. The objective was to convey that genetic engineering is a diverse area with inputs from biological and more abstract areas of science and engineering.
The presentation was followed by a questionnaire presented to the audience to see how the presentation changed the audience's knowledge of the topics (related to our iGEM project) and their views about the importance of the question addressed by our iGEM project.This"

Human Practice: An Amazing Summer！！
As Peter Carr puts it, ""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work."" This summer, Nankai iGEM team worked our best to put the spirits of collaboration and sharing into practice. Not only have we attended many important activities and conferences, but also a new information-sharing platform— iShare has become reality. Let’s see what our team did in this amazing summer.
1. What is iShare?
During the summer, we ran into many problems when we were working on our experiments. The lack of materials for instance, is one major difficulty that occurred to us. To continue our project, we had to acquire those materials from other laboratories, which involved us into intellectual property issues..
Thanks to the current system of material transformation, we managed to put all the things we needed together. Most of the laboratories would share their resources with us if we sign the material transfer agreement with them. However a small community as Nankai University is, it still took us a long time to find the right materials we needed. We could imagine how difficult if an iGEM team seeks for information about certain materials among the hundreds of previous teams.
As far as we have concerned, iGEM has already established a functional platform for all the participators to share Bio-bricks that have been submitted since the birth of the event, which is absolutely an excellent work for resources sharing. But there is no information about other materials related to the Bio-bricks, such as bacteria strains, antibodies, enzymes and so on. So our suggestion is that iGEM design a special webpage or a section on wiki for iGEM teams to list the materials they use in their experiments. In addition, iGEM teams could label the materials which they are willing to share. And teams who are interested in those materials could contact the owner for more information or a way to acquire the materials. In this way, future teams could have more resources for similar work and may come up with more improvements, while all iGEM need to do is"

Preface
Why wonder about ethics in a biological engineering competition?
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (IGEM) is an undergraduate competition begun at the MIT in 2004. In four years the competition grew up exponentially from 5 teams in 2004 to 110 teams in 2009. Within the context of its participation in IGEM 09 competition, the Paris team proposes a reflexion about ethical stakes in synthetic biology, in order to exercise our critical reflexion. Our “disciplinary” motivations to lead that ethical reflexion will be developed in a more formal introduction. We propose to wonder, in that preface, about the several “causes” of the necessity of that reflexion, mainly by wondering about the way interdisciplinarity encourages reflexivity. We wish to establish the fact that ethical reflexion is necessarily linked to a critical perspective, a point will be enlighten in the introduction.
Synthetic biology can be read as an encouragement to interdisciplinarity, as a disciplinary challenge by bringing together, in a unique life science, perspectives from engineering and practices from molecular biology. That interdisciplinarity stimulates researchers the necessity to change from their initial “disciplinary standpoint” in order to come up to synthetic biology specifications, requiring them to change position, to become alternatively insider and outsider towards their own science formation. That change sometimes permits the development of a critical perception, or, at least, makes it more attainable. That critical perspective permitted by reflexivity is one of the ways to get to ethical reflexion.
Among the large field of synthetic biology, the IGEM competition invites young scientists, future researchers to interdisciplinary experimentation.  Heter"

Worldshaper-Wuhan,2017,Team:Worldshaper-Wuhan#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," received 333 responses. A second modified version was released with changes in the descriptions and choices of the questions so to avoid the equivocation occurred in the first one. The second version is translated into English version as well, and they were posted in the IGEM community as a collaboration request. However, the sample space is unsatisfactory with only 10 responses in total. After all, the survey provided us with information about the public opinion from their knowledge on colorectal cancer to their expectations of the treatments. The survey intended to leave free response in many of the questions to avoid limiting the choice of response, and we did get a few interesting answers on some of the questions, showing different perspective of different people.
There are 3 versions of questionnaires, even though the questions haven’t change much, the consolidation of the result is quite hard since adjustments have been made to the expressions. In sum, among the 342 responses, 47 of them haven’t heard of colorectal cancer before, and among the 218 people who have heard of the disease, only 37 of them have knowledge about it.
Most of them do not have relatives or friends being suffered from it, however still 80 out of 342 reported having this case.
The most painful parts of having a cancer for most responses are the fact that many patients failed to discover their illness at the early stage of tumor development as well as inability to cure or even treat the disease. Other also chose the choice: physical pain brought by the disease.
However, analyzing the part about attitude toward current diagnosis techniques, most people do not have a clear idea about the pros and cons of the techniques along with problems with sample spaces. The Chinese version mainly focuses on the experience and the cost. While the English version focuses on experience and privacy. Sample space from second trial is too small to make solid conclusion while comparing the results in the three surveys, the dominant answer choices are different reflecting certain degree of diversification between different groups of people. If this project wants to fully develop into clinical uses, further surveys on public opinion have to be made and released between different groups of people.
Clearly, accuracy and efficiency is quite prevailing when asked about the future direction of developing techniques of diagnosis.
And most people think that the development in cancer related treatments should be more focused on methods of curing or at least alleviating, the disease and its diagnosis.

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Project#2D Biosensor_-_-_TEXT.html," control of a T7 promoter in combination with our 2D sensor chip technology. The I746909 construct was introduced into BL21(DE3) cells to make the expression IPTG-inducible since the genome of BL21(De3) contains the T7 RNA Polymerase under the control of a lacI promoter.
While the left chip does not show visible fluorescence, the right chip exhibits a strong fluorescence signal. This proves the ability of our sensor chip technology to detect IPTG. The fluorescence response is also high enough to be detected and analyzed by our measurement device WatsOn.

Detection of 3-oxo-C12-HSL with K131026
0.2 µL of 3-oxo-C12-HSL was placed in the middle of a sensor chip based on K131026 followed by incubation at 37°C in WatsOn.
Detecting the 3-oxo-C12-HSL with K131026 in our Sensor Chips using WatsOn
The next step towards the final goal of detecting living cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was to reproduce the detection of 3-oxo-C12-HSL, already established in the plate reader, in our own WatsOn device. Therefore, we again used E. coli BL21(DE3) cells carrying K131026 and induced with 0.2 µL 3-oxo-C12-HSL of a concentration of 500 µg/mL. In the clip displayed on the left, the right chip was induced and - as a negative control - the left chip was not induced. Pictures were taken every four minutes.
The result was a clear replication of the success of the plate reader experiment. The induced chip showed a clear fluorescence response eminating from the center, where the induction with HSL took place. This demonstrated the ability of not only our sensor chip technology but also our measurement device WatsOn to successfully detect 3-oxo-C12-HSL.

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#chemotaxis_-_-_TEXT.html," chemotaxis model and multiple gene network simulation together in order to check for any emergent behaviour and to see if the system will work.
E.coli is a motile strain of bacteria, which is to say it can swim. It is able to do so by rotating its flagellum, which is a rotating tentacle like structure on the outside of the cell. Chemotaxis is the movement up concentration gradients of chemical attractants (usually a food source) and away from poisons. E.coli is too small to be able to detect any chemical gradient between the two ends of itself, and so must head in any random direction and then compare the new concentration at the new point to the previous one. Its motion is described by ‘runs’ and ‘tumbles’. If the concentration of food molecules has increased after a run in a certain direction, the bacteria will be unlikely to tumble (which is to change direction) - and if it has decreased, then the likelihood of trying a new direction is high. This motion occurs by altering the direction of flagellar rotation. When the bacterium is on a run it rotates its flagellum counter-clockwise, and when it is tumbling, it rotates the flagellum clockwise. Bacteria always respond to a chemoattractant gradient within a range of values, so that there is a minimum and maximum concentration between which bacteria chemotax.
Designing a Model
Chemotaxis in Escherichia Coli is very well studied and there is a multitude of papers about it - each with different data and parameters. In order to construct a useful model we need reliable - and if possible - accurate data. The paper ‘Motility of Escherichia coli cells in clusters formed by chemotactic aggregation’ [2] is where most of the data used in the model comes from. Another older paper, ‘Chemotaxis in Bacteria’ by Julius Adler [1], examined how the speed of bacteria during each ‘run’ varies randomly around an average value. The paper did not offer a mathematical approximation of this random variation; it simply reported their experimental results and discussed them. Therefore to mimic this variation a random number at each ‘tumble’ is added to a minimal speed such that the average value of this random speed is the average speed of the bacteria. For example, the average swimming speed according to our available data is 27 micrometres per second [3], which in the program is represented by a speed of 25 micrometres per second plus a uniformly distributed random number between zero and four.

Intellectual Property
Intellectual Property is an increasingly important and controversial aspect of scientific advance, and synthetic biology is perhaps the paradigmatic area illustrating the effects of this growing legal influence. When thinking about how teams could turn their ideas from iGEM projects into viable real-world solutions, we realized that intellectual property is a crucial area to address. Our team has produced a report exploring how teams can approach this task and how iGEM intellectual property policy can make the transition easier.
We begin with a brief overview of current intellectual property law (specifically relevant to the UK) before progressing to look at the challenges this poses for the iGEM competition. A number of different approaches which iGEM might choose to adopt towards intellectual property are discussed and the pros and cons of each are assessed. We then asked a range of interested groups, including iGEM students, professionals, and the public, for their views before arriving concluding with recommendations for addressing intellectual property concerns in iGEM.

Overview
We want sport competitions to be fair and athletes to be protected against gene doping, the misuse of gene therapy in sports. People caught up in the rat race of doping development underestimate the implications of gene doping, that can stretch beyond sports into public health and social inequality. To get an overview of the design requirements for gene doping detection, we organized a discussion with experts, athletes and coaches at the University of Stirling. We implemented athletes’ wishes regarding invasivity, privacy and testing frequency into our detection method. Further interaction with stakeholders such as the Dutch Doping Authority and Oxford Nanopore Technologies made us add a prescreen and a barcoding tool to our detection method for versatile, high throughput and reliable detection. As a final challenge, we invited engineers to hack our detection method, and used their collective strength to improve our algorithm and anticipate future gene doping developments.

Talk to Dementia patients- Weinberg-Rauhes Haus
Although our project is about ageing, we haven’t been thrown into the deep end of dementia research and care for a while. Precisely until we got a chance to visit the dementia home in Hamburg, this time with the purpose of getting the opinions of the elderly about our project and their life in general. We got to speak to a few people individually and then also two groups of people, everyone with varying forms of dementia: from very light Alzheimer’s, which you wouldn't be able to tell, to the late stages, which are almost incomprehensible. Overall these experiences were enlightening, inspiring and motivating to do more research and help but simultaneously the potential realities of the future were distressing.
Below, is a summary of some of the stories of the people we had the privilege to speak to and the impressions and experiences we gained from the group sessions.
Michelle is speaking to the members of the Dementia care home.
Michelle looking deep in conversation with the elderly members.
Interesting discussion and a cup of English tea!
We are really grateful for the stories the elderly shared with us at the care home!
Stories from the Dementia care home: Monika
As I added some sugar and milk to Monika's tea, her eyes lit up. She asked me what I was doing with my life and I proceeded to tell her I was studying in London. At this point her eyes grew even brighter as a grin crept across her face “I once went to a tea party in London!” she exclaimed happily as she stirred her tea. I inquired further about her time in London and she happily told me all about her holiday there back in the 60s, and how she sees  on the news how things have changed now. I told her a bit about my experience there, then followed up with a quick and very simple explanation of why I was coming all the way to Hamburg from London and what our “ageing” project really tries to achieve. She was intrigued and told me that it is very nice “that such brilliant young people care about us old folks.”
Over the next 10 or so minutes she engulfed me with stories of her upbringing, her life in post-war Germany, her job as a Kindergarten teacher, her children and their children and how things changed after her husband died and she moved to a home for the elderly. She told me"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," fifth step was to use the JMP software to produce models and statistical analyses of the data. The results could then be used to create a new experimental design (e.g. to further analyse factors highlighted as important), or predictions could be directly tested through experimental testing and observed results compared to said predictions.
Rationale and Aim
Previous research has shown that the concentration of some components of the supplement solution are crucial for efficient protein synthesis, and that for each batch of extract produced the optimal concentration may need to be found (Yang, et al., 2012). Studies which have explored this have only focused on, at most, a few components at a time (Garamella, et al., 2016; Kelwick, et al., 2016), which means that important interactions between the components may have been missed. In this study, a multifactorial approach will be taken to investigate the effect that all supplements have on the protein synthesis activity of CFPS systems simultaneously. The specific aims for this section of the project were: (i) to demonstrate the applicability of DoE to determine important components of the supplement solution premix, and (ii) to demonstrate the ability of DoE to predict concentrations of CFPS supplements which yield optimal protein synthesis activity.
Background Information
Traditionally, biologists tend to use One Factor At a Time (OFAT) approaches to determine the effect and importance of factors on a system, which can sometimes be a poor method. By only determining the effect that a single factor has on a system at a time, important interactions can be missed. For example, removing only factor A may have no effect, and removing only factor B may also have no effect, but removing both may cause an adverse effect. Therefore, it is important to take a multifactorial approach when investigating the importance of conditions or components of a system, or when trying to optimise a system. An issue with this approach is that a large number of experiments may be required to fully investigate all factors. By using statistical methods, a Design of Experiments (DoE) can be determined which has the minimum number of experiments required to explore questions such as the importance of factors in a system. This approach also allows for robustness testing or determining batch-batch variation (Anderson & Whitcomb, 2010). As discussed here , CFPS systems can be plagued with issues rising from variation, so this approach offers a method to investigate the causes. It could also be used to determine less important components of the supplement solution premix which is added to CFPS systems, and hence a minimal supplement premix could be determined. There are"
Worldshaper-Wuhan,2017,Team:Worldshaper-Wuhan#collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," problems in our experiment. The leader and members from experimental group discussed about the possible cause and showed us their colony of fungi， given that we had trouble developing colonies and there were too few of them in each trial. While we were trying to figure out the usage and possible solution for our Bio Parts-problem, we visited the lab of iGEM team at Zhejiang University. Our leader and Worldshaper-XSHS’s team leader talked to the team members of ZJU-China about the problem we had. At about 3 pm that afternoon, we gave a presentation to students and teachers from Yiling Highschool. ASTWS-China talked about synthetic biology, Wordshaper-XSHS talked about “What is iGEM”, Wordshaper-Nanjing and our team introduced our projects to the audiences. The short video made by Worldshaper-XSHS gave us an idea of making short videos teach others about the knowledge and technique we used in the project. (We had thought about making a video but it’s more like a propaganda.)
July 29 to the morning of July 30, the four teams sent their representatives to mathematics modeling class which was told by a professor from Zhejiang University. Other team members had to decide the experiment we are going to do, and the leader of Worldshaper-XSHS helped us bought the equipment we needed.
July 30, we held the activity in the China Zhe Jiang Science and Technology Museum. Short videos about iGEM and the teams’ projects were released. There were fun experiments that attracts kids and their parents. The team members went out to hand out the fans with texts that introduce our projects printed on them. There were parents that felt curious about the competition and our projects. The activity lasted until the museum closed. From this meet up, we learned a lot from our experiences and had a better idea on how to introduce synthetic biology as well as our projects to the public. We got some inspiration from other teams’ performances as well. We were really looking forward to another collaboration with other teams.

Explanation of Parameters
Using a proteomics server, in our case ExPASy we determined the aliphatic and instability index, extinction coefficient and theoretical PI which will help us distinguish which of the mutations would be best to increase the thermo stability of the TAQ. The isoelectric point (PI) is the pH at which the protein carries no net charge.  When the theoretical PI is reached the protein has no net charge hence being immobile in an electric field. From table 1 it is evident that there is no large difference between the theoretical isoelectric points of the original Taq to the Taq with the mutations. The estimated stability of the Taq in the test tube is provided by the instability index. From table 1 we see that the instability index is stable as the predicted numbers are below 40, as anything above this will show an unstable protein. The relative volume occupied by aliphatic side chains of the following amino acids; alanine, valine, isolecine and leucine. The aliphatic index of the protein is regarded as a positive factor for the increase of the thermostability, From Table 1 we see that in both the wild type and the redesigned Taq’s aliphatic indexes were increased as the mutations were made thus indicating that these mutations increased the thermostability of this protein. Using the proteomics server the extinction coefficient were measured as it indicates how much light a protein absorbs at a certain wavelength and is useful later when we purify the protein.

iGEM-Team Canmore 2016
Doing research for our project we were lucky to see that other iGEM Teams from the past worked with keratinases and the issue of breaking down hair in wasterwater facilities (Sheffield 2014, Canmore 2015, Canmore 2016). We saw that the iGEM Team of Canmore 2016 was able to submit two composite parts to the registry. These parts consist of a protein coding sequence for the KerUS gene and an IPTG-inducible promoter (BBa_K1717173) and the KerA gene with an IPTG-inducible promoter (BBa_K1717000). Given the fact that we were not able to obtain these parts from the iGEM registry we were in contact with the iGEM Team Canmore and one of their mentors Lisa Oberding from FREDsense who shipped us the required parts from Canada to Germany. Thanks to their former experiences with these two keratinases and already faced issues going along with them, we were able to avoid some troubleshootings.

Visit to SZOIL Maker Space
To promote bio-hacking, we first went to SZOIL Maker Space to know about the nowadays situation on Maker and the specific area of bio-hacking.
Shenzhen Open Innovation Lab (SZOIL) is a space and platform for worldwide makers to communicate and cooperate. It is also the first Fablab authorized by MIT in Shenzhen as a research and development partner in Fab 2.0. On June 6th, 2016, three of our team members visit SZOIL Maker Space and had a long conversation with the staffs there. Huiqi Xie, the person in charge of the Maker space, led us to a tour around their working lab and had a two-hour discussion with us on Maker and especially, bio-hacking in Shenzhen. During the discussion, we found that the main problems for bio-hacking occur in the lack of mentor/lack of education, and the high cost of laboratory and materials.
We offered advice on a bio-lab they planned to build in August, and they invited us to also use the lab and help their Fablab students. After the long talk, we realized that to promote bio-hacking and let the idea penetrate into daily lives still need a long process, rather than something that could be achieved a day. To reach the purpose, we should use every possible chance to deliver the concept and our ideas to both normal people and Makers. We should also focus on educating students on bio-hacking, planting this knowledge beforehand. More importantly, Makers in Shenzhen and all over the world should collaborate together and work on promoting this idea in the society. We understood a lot of things through this important visit, and it influenced our next steps in Human Practice significantly.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," mixture 2 (with the sodium citrate) was partly dissolved. The first mixture (with LB) did not have any changes in the structure of the hydrogel.
10/07/2015
The reaction mixture (2) of 09/07 has completely been dissolved after one day. Reaction mixture (1) did not lead to any changes in the structure of the hydrogel (still intact).
Two new mixtures were prepared:
3. 250 µl alginate, 250 µl CaCl2 (0.1M) and 2 mL sodium citrate;
4. 250 µl alginate, 250 µl CaCl2 (0.1M) and 2 mL LB;
With reaction mixture 3, there was a direct effect. The gel almost dissolved after twisting. 10 seconds of vortexing did not have any effect on the hydrogel. Reaction mixture 4, no changes in the hydrogel structure were observed. Then, to mixture 3 two mL of sodium citrate and to 4 two mL of LB was added. For both cases, no change was observed (even no change on 13/07).
13/07/2015
Again, two reaction mixture were prepared:  (5) 250 µl alginate, 250 µl CaCl2 (0.1M) and 5 mL sodium citrate; and (6) 250 µl alginate, 250 µl CaCl2 (0.1M) and 5 mL NaCl.
Up/down turning of mixture (5) resulted in a partly dissolved hydrogel, whereas mixture (6) did not change anything in the structure of the hydrogel. The 10 seconds vortex of both mixtures did not affect the hydrogel.
Alginate/CaCl2 mixtures
Since a layer of CaCl2 was present in the prepared hydrogels, different mixtures of alginate and CaCl2 (0.1M) were prepared and tested (see Table).
In all the cases presented in the Table, there is still a layer of CaCl2 on top of the hydrogel. Although there is even a layer in the 9:1 case, this layer is really small. By performing 10 seconds of centrifugation, the layer did not increase (so, it is kind of stable).

2. Improve the characterization of the BioBrick tested in other substrates to study the performance of the promoter.
3. Define the Biobrick promoter strength at the temperatures and selected substrates.
Methodology
According to the characterization made by Team Edinburgh 2009, the Pyear promoter (BBa_K216005) used by Bristol 2010, works
best in minimal media and complex media with a nitrate concentration of 40mM. Using this reference, we added 40mM of KNO3 to
every growth media in the different temperatures for Bristol 2010 - BBa_K381001 and UTP-Panama 2011 – BBa_K672000.
4. We used nine falcon tubes of 15 mL. Three tubes for every different substrate at the three temperatures.
5. To each tube we added 10 ml of liquid LB, Minimal Media or Saline Solution and KNO3 40 mM.
6. Tubes corresponding the different substrates were inoculated with BBa_K381001.
7. Tubes were incubated at 37°C, 8°C and 23°C for 24 hours.

UCLA,2013,Team:UCLA#Project#mrnaDisplay_-_-_TEXT.html,"The Mtd protein is the scaffold for our mRNA display experiment. Most proteins are not capable of undergoing the large number of mutations necessary to create a large library while still maintaining their structure and function.  The Mtd is unique in that it has a structure that allows it to be mutagenized in certain sites and still remain stable.  The Mtd has evolved in the natural system of Bordetella bacteriophage to have precisely this property.  Therefore, it acts as an effective scaffold because the majority of the protein is able to remain constant and stable while a small localized region of each protein gets mutagenized (Yuan).
Other approaches for directed protein targeting?
Phage display:   An in vivo technique similar in principle to mRNA display in which bacteriophage are allowed to  replicate to create a diverse library with different binding affinities.  The DNA from the bacteriophage that corresponds to the protein that binds to the target can be isolated and then sequenced.
Ribosome display:  Another in vitro technique that fuses the RNA transcript to the protein that it codes for.  Instead of a puromycin linker between the transcript and the protein, it is the ribosome that links the protein and the template that codes for it (Smith).
What are the advantages of this route / why did we choose this route for our project?
One of the major advantages of the mRNA display approach is that it takes place completely in vitro.  This eliminates the limitations and complications that come with working in vivo and gives us more control over the entire process.  Also, using an in vitro method allows us to create a more diverse library.  Generating the library in vitro can potentially yield several orders of magnitude more protein variants than in vivo systems such as phage display.
With respect to ribosome display, which is also an in vitro method, mRNA display has an advantage when it comes to screening for protein binding.  The disadvantage of ribosome display is that the linker between the protein and the template DNA is the actual ribosome.  This is an issue because the ribosome is a very large protein and it has the potential to interact with the target protein, thereby throwing off the selection process. In contrast, the puromycin link in mRNA display is much smaller and is not likely to interfere in any way with the target protein (Lipovsek).
Issues with using this route?
What we are essentially doing with this project is taking the Mtd protein which comes from an in vivo system (the BPP-1 phage) and using it as the scaffold in our in vitro protein selection system.  We know"

Plate Reader
In any information storage system, the primary issue is being able to read back data with as high a fidelity as possible. Storage of archival data would be futile if the medium used could not guarantee this.
BabblED utilises a powerful system of error detection and correction using checksums, optimal rectangular codes and Levenshtein distance to ensure fidelity of data even when a DNA sequence is damaged or there are mistakes in sequencing. Using these and the incredible properties of DNA we can be confident in accurately storing archival data for 10s or even 100s of years.
You can read more about all these mechanisms below or jump straight into the code at our Github
Checksum
A checksum is a commonly used technique in network engineering that we’ve adapted for use in DNA storage. In this format the checksum allows the detection of errors in a BabbleBlock (DNA sentence). The checksum holds the sum of the word coding regions of BabbleBricks (DNA words) in a BabbleBlock in a 4 BabbleBrick region that can be found towards the end of a BabbleBlock.
When a BabbleBlock is being translated the checksum is looked at first to see if it matches the sums of the word coding regions in the DNA we get back from sequencing. If this is the case, no errors have appeared and the translation program can proceed as normal however if there is no match an error has occurred somewhere in the BabbleBlock and other error correcting mechanisms will have to be used to make sure the stored information can still be read back.
Improved Checksum - Collaboration with Exeter University
Fig1
Fig2
Currently a checksum utilizes only a small percentage of the values that can be stored.    A BabbleBrick contains 5 base 4 digits meaning that 4^5B unique bits of    information share one of 15B checksums where B is the amount of BabbleBricks in one    BabbleBlock. This data has been plotted for BabbleBlocks containing 2 and 3 Babble"
EPF-Lausanne,2008,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," Details on this part are available in the corresponding page of the Wiki : Modeling . This part was done with the help of professor Felix Naef.
The second part of the project was of course the concrete generation of the required plasmids in the laboratory, which was executed in the facilities provided by the Laboratory of Systems Biology and Genetics ( http://deplanckelab.epfl.ch/ ) of Prof. Bart Deplancke. Using Biobricks and material obtained from the Ron Weiss group, we followed a cloning scheme to obtain our genetic circuit in E. coli.
Most of the information on the cloning can be found on the Parts section of this Wiki, with respect to the parts submitted, on this Project page higher up (description of the plasmid), and in the Notebook section for the protocols used in culture, transformation, digestion and ligation.
The third part of the project consisted in the building and using of the microfluidic chips for the two sides of the project in the Laboratory of Biological Network Characterization ( http://lbnc.epfl.ch/ ) of Prof. Sebastian Maerkl. First, the MITOMI approach was implemented in the laboratory to characterize the DNA binding specificity and affinity of quorum sensing-related transcription factors . Then, the chips for cell culture and test of the genetic circuit were designed. Information on this part of the project can be found on the corresponding page of the Wiki : Microfluidics . Protocols for the fabrication of the devices and the preparation of DNA and transcription factors can also be found on the Notebook page of this Wiki.

The part BBa_K092600, which is the construct shown below, consists of the gene for the TetR signaling protein and the RFP encoding sequence under TetR control but without the PLac promoter which regulates the expression of TetR. This part was characterized.
Theoretically, this construct should not be able to express RFP due to the fact that the promoter for the induction molecule (TetR) is not present and thus no TetR should be expressed.
However, preliminary experiments indicated that TetR expression is leaky and we therefore exploited this feature to characterize the respective part(see protocol in parts registry BBa_K092600). We found that RPF was indeed produced thus indicating a basal ‘leaky’ expression, and this allowed us to predict that the addition of the PLac promotor should highly enhance RFP production.
Specifically, we obtained a transfer function that is shown below.
Flow cytometry was carried out to verify the presence of RFP expressing cells. After the plate reading assay, the same"

Background
    Over the past two decades, Lactococcus lactis has vastly extended its application from food to being a successful microbial cell factory .Not only can it produce lactic acid, vitamins, bacteriocins and antimicrobial peptide (nisin) in traditional fermentation, it can also express heterologous antigens, thus allowing the bacteria to act as live vaccines. Using L. lactis as vaccine carriers is appealing as it is able to induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses, has adjuvant properties, and is free from risks associated with the use of conventional attenuated live pathogens. With lyophilization, L. lactis does not require storage at low temperature, and administration of the preparation does not require specialized personnel.
    However, L. lactis suffers from various stress conditions including acid, osmotic and oxygen during fermentation processing, among which acid stress and cold stress are great survival challenges. During fermentation, the decrease of environmental pH will inhibit the activity of intracellular enzymes, which will also affect the normal growth and metabolism of microbial cells. Furthermore, as live vaccines, L.lactis has an advantage in the low pH condition of gastric juice compared with other chassis microorganism. During the process of lyophilization, it suffers from severe cold stress, which rapidly reduce their survival rate. Therefore, the strain resistant to acid and cold needs to be constructed as soon as possible.
What are we doing
    Therefore, we aim to create an ideal chassis microorganism with good resistance and food-safe characteristics by synthetic biology methods. We added genes msmk, cspD2, promoter ppepN, gfp and a kill-switch (→ Basic parts ) respectively to model strain Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 to give it the anti-acid, anti-cold characteristics.

Netherlands Biotechnology Congress
22/05/18
Our first conference! With the other Dutch iGEM teams, we were invited to present a poster at the Netherlands Biotechnology Congress. During the several talks we learned about new developments in biotechnology and public acceptance of GMOs. The highlight of the day was an intriguing talk by Marc Lynas, a British environmental activist and journalist who explained how he moved from violently opposing GMO crops to supporting them. The conference also offered a platform to discuss our project with biotechnologists and with the overgrad winning team of iGEM 2017, TU Delft. After a few drinks and a good meal, we returned home with a lot of new insights.

TU/e contest
22/05/18
We were recruited for the TU/e contest in February. At first there was a selection round. We had the chance to propose the problem and solution that we have been working on. We were also brought in contact with coaches from several companies to see if they could help us with this project. This could be advice on any field of your project, from the specific details to how to approach the market. We talked to for example companies like Deloitte, Thermo Fischer, Medtronic and much more. Afterwards there was the moment of truth, the selection! We had a couple of days to collect as many votes as possible and to convince the coaches, friends and family that our project was worth sending to the next round… and we convinced them all! iGEM made the cut to the final 40 participants!
After that came the business related part of the contest. We had the opportunities to go on speeddates with representatives from Medtronic, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Deloitte and BON. We also received a Golden Egg Check. This document helped us to design our project based around persons of interest and the market that you might want to end up in. We also"
Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," fast-growing organism V. natriegens.  First of all, we use the Marburg Collection to construct a library of pathways with different combinations of promoters, ribosome binding sites, coding regions, enzyme ratios and plasmid copy numbers.   Next, we transform the plasmids for each pathway version together with the plasmid for the biosensor into our chassis. When the pathway is now performed, the cells produce a fluorescence or luminescence signal and its intensity correlates to the 3-hydroxypropionate (
3HPA-
) concentration.   By using
FACS
we can select for the most efficient pathway versions.   By using multiplex automated genome engineering (
MAGE
), refeeding
3HPA
into the central metabolism and repetition of
FACS
selection we have a cycle of directed evolution-guided pathway optimization.   The strains with the most promising pathway variants can then be isolated and their pathway composition elucidated.   Thus, we get information about designing principles for our pathway and can propose an improved design for a new round in the cycle of metabolic engineering.
Figure 1: Our implemented workflow of metabolic engineering
To accelerate metabolic engineering we implemented a workflow based on the
DBTL
-cycle. Starting by building a library of pathway variants, they all can be introduced into V. natriegens as test chassis. By using biosensors FACS-directed selection of promising variants is possible. Cultivation and repeating of FACS leads to directed evolution and finally the most efficient strains can be analyzes to investigate the genetic composition. These finding can be feeded into the Learning-part of the
DBTL
-cycle thereby closing the workflow. Repeating the workflow continiously increases pathway efficiency and enables high-throuput metabolic engineering.
Our pathway
As mentioned in the description, there are many ways to produce
3HPA
.   We decided for a pathway, basing on the conversion of acetyl-CoA via malonyl-CoA to
3HPA
.   According to (Valdehuesa et al. 2013) who evaluated many pyruvate-derived production pathways from a thermodynamical point of view, this is one of the most efficient routes for
3HPA
production.   We decided for this route for several reasons. First it bases on glucose degradation and V. natriegens has an unbeaten glucose-uptake rate, enabling a high glucose consumption rate. Second there is no vitamin B12 necessary, the only cofactors which are involved are NADPH and biotin, both of them naturally occurring"

Motivation
In order to create a flow with bacteria using their flagella movement as the motor, it is important to understand bacterial motility and the effects our genetic manipulation have on it.
Bacterial motion resembles a random walk, with periods of smooth swimming interrupted by brief tumbles that change the swimming direction. Chemotaxis is achieved by modulation of the tumbling frequency.
In our case, we have added phototaxis to E. coli MG1655 cells making them react to light as well as chemical gradients.
By creating a model describing the key features of the system, it will be possible to study the biochemical behaviour of such a system, and how different parameters will affect it, before it is implemented in a bacterial strain.
The real system
Several chemosensory systems exist in bacteria. The one most studied is the chemotaxis of E. coli. Polar clusters of membrane-spanning methyl accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) are positioned in the ends of the rod shaped E. coli [ 1 ].
Tar (responding to aspartate), Tsr (responding to serine), Tap (responding todipetides), Trg (responding to galactose) ang Aer (responding to oxygen) are the most common of these receptors seen in E. coli strains[ 2 ]. Transduction of the signal between the MCPs and the flagella motor is managed by a particular fine-tuned signalling cascade, which is governed by several intracellular proteins.
Figure 1: Schematics of the bacterial chemotaxis pathways [ 2 ]
Chemotaxis consists of three important phases: reaction, adaptation and relaxation. In the reaction phase, one of the MCPs sense the specific chemical gradient it responds to and the membrane protein activates the CheW enzyme. The active CheW enzyme suppresses the auto-phosphorylation of the CheA enzyme and when no or very little CheA enzyme is phosphorylated, no phosphorylation of the CheY and CheB enzymes occurs.

Safety in the lab
Safety is a prerequisite for any research project implemented either in academia or in industry. ETH Zurich values the importance of safety for the research being conducted in      the institute. For this reason, an internal Department of Safety, Security, Health and Environment is organized to provide all the necessary information to the students and employees of ETH Zurich regarding safety. Brochures, lectures and podcasts are also used in order to make the personnel aware of the safety rules and to enhance accident prevention.
Specifically, our team attended a Facility and Lab Safety instruction before starting any experimental work. The lecture was held by Mr. Niels Buerckert, who is the Technical Manager and head of the D-BSSE Safety Committee. The topics covered safety practices and regulations in the lab. In a separate course, two of our team members had the opportunity to get practical experience on the usage of a fire blankets and a fire-extinguishers, putting out a real fire. As far as the biosafety measures are concerned, all iGEM team members got familiar with the safety practices for BSL- 1 and BSL-2 laboratories. Some of the topics covered were:
proper clothing (lab coat for BSL-1/2) and accessory equipment (gloves and goggles)
proper disposal of BSL-1 and BSL-2 waste
handling of liquid waste containing heat resistant antibiotics (e.g. kanamycin)
handling of hazardous chemicals
actions in case of chemical or biological contamination
Safety of our current project design
The description of our iGEM project was sent to the Swiss Department of Health (BAG) in order to assess the safety risk of the biological agents used in our project. The agency characterized our project as compatible with the Swiss regulations.
In our project, we implemented proof of concept experiments to test the functionality of our engineered bacteria in a controlled laboratory environment, simultaneously emulating the real–application conditions. According to the literature, multiple bacteria are suitable for tumor colonization. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 was the bacterial strain we planned to"

Project Name:Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Project Abstract: Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field.
We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Motivation and Goals
This year's modelling project focused on extending the work done by the modelling team in 2010.
Waterloo's 2010 iGEM project, ""Staphiscope"", utilized amplifier parts developed by Cambridge in 2009 to detect low levels of Staph Aureus. These amplifier parts were characterized by the Cambridge team, but only under control of AraC/pBAD promoter, which differed from the promoter used in our 2010 Staphiscope project.
In order to characterize the amplifiers, a parameter scan was undertaken to find promoter-independent Hill parameters of each amplifier, consistent with data of full system. However, empirical verification of our results was lacking. This year, we sought to obtain this data, which (in conjunction with Cambridge data and model), would allow us to find Hill parameters for each amplifier.
Model
To allow for comparison of data, we used the same model as Cambridge in 2009 .
In this model, araC represses the pBAD promoter in the absence of the inducer, arabinose. When arabinose is present, it binds to araC, preventing repression of the promoter and allowing transcription of reporter (GFP). This situation is modelled by a Hill function; we seek the Hill parameters of this function.
Thus, when AraC/pBAD system is induced with arabinose, we expect to see a steady increase of fluorescence from a low level, followed by a plateau of fluorescence at steady state.
Method
To measure fluorescence, we closely followed the assay described in the paper ""Measuring the activity of BioBrick promoters using an in vivo reference standard"" , in the section ""Assay of Promoter Collections"".
Three cultures were grown overnight at 37 degrees Celsius with spinning at 200 rpm: untransformed BW27783, BW27783 containing BBa_I0500, and BW27783 containing BBa_I20260. These were then diluted 1:100 and regrown for roughly 4 hours under the same conditions. They were then diluted to an OD between 0.05 and 0.09, and regrown for 1 hour, again under the same conditions.
After this, the cultures were diluted"

1. Goals for the week
Our goals for the past few weeks were to establish that the basic procedures for our direct evolution method works. Specifically, we can grow T7 in liquid culture with E. coli, amplify phage to create a high titer, select for smaller phage using concentrated top agar, and propagate phage from a single plaque.
2.Experiments and results
Phage growth in liquid culture (5.3 Phage Amplification/Purification)
Phage liquid culture set up
+ phage: 4mL LB + 1mL E. coli overnight + 100μL phage received stock
- phage: 4mL LB + 1mL E. coli overnight
Obvious clearage was seen for the + phage test tube
Spot test result
We purified the phage via centrifugation and adding chloroform. This batch of phage is stored as stock 5.3 in the fridge.
This confirmed our conclusion that we are able to grow T7 in liquid culture with E. coli BL21.
Amplifying phage (5.6 T7+ Liquid Culture Phage Concentration Test)
We tested whether adjusting the amount of phage that we add to liquid culture will produce different spot test results. Purified phage were labeled stock 5.6 in the fridge.
stock 5.6 10: 4mL LB + 1mL E. coli overnight + 10μL phage from 5.3 stock

\( \gamma \) is related to atmospheric pressure. We can get it by following equation:     \[ \gamma = 0.665 \times 10^{-3} \times 101.3(\frac{293-0.0065z}{293})^{5.26} \]     where \( z \) is Altitude.
Saturated vapor pressure, \( e_s \), can be get by the following equatiin:     \[ e_s = e^0(T_{day})=0.6108exp[\frac{17.27T_{day}}{T_{day}+237.3}] \]
Actual vapor pressure, \( e_a \), can be get by the following equation:     \[ e_a=e^0(T_{day})\frac{RH_{mean}}{100} \]     Where \( H_{mean} \) is average air humidity in one day
Slope of saturation vapour pressure curve at air temperature, \( \Delta \), can be get bu the following equation:     \[ \Delta=\frac{4098[0.6108exp(\frac{17.27T_{day}}{T_{day}+237.3})]}{(T_{day}+237.3)^2} \]
Average net radiation in one day, Rn, is the difference between the incoming net shortwave radiation (\(R_{ns}\)) and the outgoing net longwave radiation (\(R_{nl}\)):     \[ R_n=R_{ns}-R_{nl} \]
Net shortwave radiation, \(R_{ns}\) and net longwave radiation, \(R_{nl}\), can be calculated by the following equation:     \[ R_{ns}=(1-\alpha)R_s \]     \[ R_{nl}=\sigma[\frac{T_{day}^4}{2}](0.34-0.14\sqrt{e_a})(1.35\frac{R_s}{(0.75+2\times 10^{-5})R_a} - 0.35) \]     \[ R_a=\frac{12(60)}{\pi}G_{"

Making molecular biology easier
We imagine that iGEM should be about fast assembly of BioBricks, leaving more time for the actual project. It should be easy to combine any thinkable part, device or existing BioBrick. Unfortunately, classical cloning techniques can cause problems and even PCR can be cumbersome, if you have little or no laboratory experience.
Therefore, we introduce a simple and fast way of building new devices and vectors with ready to use PCR products. All that is needed is to select the favorite BioBricks and one of the ready to use backbone vectors, and mix it with USER enzyme. The assembled vector is ready for chemical transformation into competent E. coli cells only 70 minutes later.The 8-9 nucleotide overhangs (linkers) flanking the parts, can hybridize to complementary overhangs without the use of DNA-ligases.
No need to worry whether the destination vector has been fully linearized, no need to perform site-directed mutagenesis to remove unwished restriction recognition sites - just simple, fast, and easy.
It is possible to successfully assemble six biological parts in one reaction, reducing the plasmid construction time significantly. The upper limit of fragments that efficiently can be assembled has not yet been delineated (1).
In 2009 the first team from DTU participated in iGEM and introduced the USER fusion Assembly standard [BBF RFC 39] . This year we introduce a standardized version allowing easier use of the system. The Plug 'n' Play assembly standard can be found here (BBF RFC 80).

We wanted to understand how our assay will work after traveling for a long distance, which led us to ship our assay to the Northwestern Team. After having them go through the test using water, we discovered that our instructions need to be clearer. When going through the protocol, the Northwestern Team misinterpreted how our assay should be used. Although we did not obtain results on how our assay worked after traveling, we did learn that we need to work on giving better instructions. How we changed our assay based on this collaboration can be seen here.

The potential biobricks were successfully miniprepped, and a PCR was performed to isolate what was actually between the VF2 and the VR primers in the plasmid. The product will then be run on a gel, and if it appears the correct length, will be sent for sequencing.
Our Pseudomonas competent cells appear to work (conferring antibiotic resistance), but they are not expressing rfp.
We made spec plates, but a lawn grew with our transformed cells. Interestingly, on top of this lawn grew several well defined colonies. We attempted to grow these colonies (and the proper negative controls) in varying amounts of spectinomycin. It is possible the plates had insufficient spec, or that the strain we are working with is naturally resistant (there was a lawn, but no large colonies, on the negative control).
Several more biobricks from the registry were transformed.

Sent the potential biobricks for sequencing last Friday, ordered primers for mutagenesis on DszC, ordered primers for attachment of fluorescent genes to amino acid genes, received all but yddg knockouts from Yale, found that the Arg knockouts work as described.
An attempt at doing an experiment to calibrate the fluorescent proteins for the plate reader (looking for quenching, linear relationship between OD and fluorescence, etc) was done on Sunday, but as it turns out, we had the wrong promoter for a fluorescent protein, and the wrong antibiotic resistance for one of the other proteins.
Recently, there was a meeting with the kill switch team from Calgary. Primers to create a biobrick with an intein in it for temperature specific activity were ordered.
Competent cells were made from each of the knockouts, and they worked well. The yddg strain was ordered through collaboration with Calgary as well as the keio collection proper in Japan.
Our Gibson assembly kit arrived.
The sequencing results from our amino acid biobricks came back, and it looks like only MetA was successful. It should be noted that the melting temperatures of the Vf2 and the VR primers are 60°, for cPCR validation of biobricks.
Several new combinations of fluorescent genes, antibiotic resistances, and Keio strains were made. We used the wrong ones last weekend, but now, we are going to test TyrA- +GFP, TrpA- +RFP, MetA- +YFP, and also wildtype with the fluorescent genes. Recently, we switched backbones for the 13M RFP"

Our project includes three modules: an input module, a processing module and an output module. In order to realize the principle of our design, we designed two rewirable circuits: a repressilator with lox71 site and lox66 site to achieve the alteration from the state of oscillation to the other state of a stable switch; and another rewirable circuit which is related to quorum sensing to perform the change from positive feedback to negative feedback. To prevent the leakage of the expression of Cre protein in our input module, we added a riboregulator in front of the coding sequence of Cre protein. As to our output module, we got two devices to detect whether our processing module works or not: one is the fluorescent proteins with Lva tag; the other is the spinach RNA aptamer. Most of our parts are constructed by BioBrick™, but for purpose of meeting the special requirement of our construction that we need to connect some parts reversely, we designed a new way based on the BioBrick™ to assemble those circuits.
Furthermore, we have done a lot of work in testing and in the collaboration with other teams. Firstly, we have found the unexpected recombination of lox71 site without Cre protein, and we designed a device(as shown in the Characterization) to verify this phenomenon and finally we tested whether it would affect our results and to what extent. Secondly, we conducted plenty of experiments for all these inducible promoters we used in our gene circuits by microplate reader to get some information about their intensity which help us to select the optimum promoter. Thirdly, to test whether our riboregulator works"

We were wondering if our peptides could activate some biochemical signal or have the larvae reject them. He said if an animal is given something it produces, the tendency is this animal will produce less. He recommended us to see if naturally, bee AMPs get into their food, it could be that maybe if bees have available more AMPs, they disactivate the bacteria, he wasn't sure about it.
When nanoencapsulated medicine is done, there is the risk that it can get accumulated somewhere within the organism since honey bees live within a month, he doesn't deem that is something we should worry about, yet he would say the fat body, that's the place bees tend to accumulate.
Regarding the incidence of American or European foulbrood, he mentioned he has worked in the US for control of these two diseases, the percentage was always around one percent, sometimes two. In Brazil, it's not established, they have few European foulbrood cases and there is no presence of American foulbrood, by the other hand, in Argentina, it has been a big problem. He was there to diagnose the first official finding of it, they had many thousands of colines dying, since then, some of their people went to Brazil to learn bee genetics and the incidence was very much reduced.
In Mexico, we have the presence of Varroa, he mentioned that's a concern because is probably affecting the bee's immune system, another reason to be concerned about the AMPs levels. If we get to see if nurse bee AMPs get to the food of larvae, that is an interesting result because it helps researches understand how bees can resist diseases. Beyond the work, we are proposing, or as part of it, he thinks is interesting to have that information.
As we continue talking about foulbrood, we asked him if it's legal to burn beehives on Brazil, he answered it’s not for someone who is not a beekeeper, the fireman is only supposed to do it if it’s a matter of environmental protection. He has burned a few beehives in a demonstration of how they control the disease when it is found, normally the government would burn beehives is there's a new problem or disease, but they are supposed to pay the beekeeper. He told us about when he was a US bee inspector, what they would do is when they find the disease,"

Project aims
Taking into account what was mentioned before, the aims of this project were structured as follows. (1) Create a library of parts to be characterized and submitted to the iGEM competition. (2) In an effort to have a reporter protein working in all four organisms, generate and characterize two coding sequence that, regardless of codon bias work in all four of them. (3) Confirm the correct assembly and sequence of said parts. (4) Assemble the parts into expression cassettes for characterization. (5) Transform and characterize the parts using E. coli TOP10 cells. (6) Clone constructs into the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 shuttle vector (pPMQAK1) and finally (7) characterize the parts using Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.
Promoter Design
Promoter studies in Synechocystis have demonstrated the mechanism of several native promoters. The promoters can be categorized into three different types (I, II, and III) depending on how the binding motifs arranged to interact with the respective sigma factor and its equivalent transcription factor. For example, some of these have been shown to be “light responsive (psa, psb, and secA), dark-inducible (lrtA), nitrate/nitrite-inducible (nirA), copper-ions responsive (petE), and heavy metal-ions inducible” (Huang et al. 2013a).
When using a Synthetic biology approach, genetic circuits are supposed to function as independently as possible from the endogenous cellular circuitry or even functionally replace the innate molecular machinery (Nandagopal & Elowitz 2011). In an effort to follow this approach, and avoid cross-talks with the host’s genetic background, the development of non-native promoters regulated by exogenous transcription factors seem to be a plausible option. In this scenario, the aim being an orthogonal promoter that can be fully repressed and highly inducible(Huang et al. 2013b). For this case the selected promoters were LacI-regulated and TetR-regulated, both inducible by Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (iPTG) and anhydrotetracycline (aTc) respectively.

Overview
Based on modeling work, we find that negative feedback can contribute to the network’s adaptation to DNA copy number variation. So we analysed the following three-node networks, A and B. The difference between A and B is the output nodes of network A has negative feedback. We transfected this two circuits into mammalian cells (Hela cell). By testing the mean value of EYFP (Enhance Yellow Fluorescent Protein, the output of our circuits), and the relationship between the EYFP and the DNA copy number, we can prove the hypothesis.
Construction
We constructed the following circuit A ,B and C .The circuit A corresponds to the network A ,while the circuit B is the implementation of network B. Circuit C is used as a control design to testify the function of A and B. In circuit A, as we can see, the input is miR-21, which can repress the plasmid pz371 and K1116002(The plasmid’s information can be found in parts). K1116002 induced by rtTA and Dox, serves as an auxiliary node, producing the LacI gene to inhibit the expression of EYFP. EYFP(Enhance Yellow Fluorescent Protein )is used as output. Besides, the miR-FF3 restrains the expression of LacI. The reason that we get the most of post-transcriptional control can be seen in Supplementary text. In circuit B, however, the plasmid K1116003 does not have FF3 target, leading to the contrast between circuit A and B. We can see miR-21 can’t target at pZ349 and pZ331 in circuit C , that is, there is no input in circuit C. The miR-21, used to distinguish cancer cell from normal cells ,is endogenous in Hela cell.

5. Repeat the process above for all other bacteria growths on the plate, recording their values separately, and 1 extra set of measurements for a blank spot on the plate (a negative control). It may be easier to move to the next bacterial growth by selecting the ""Live"" option in the histogram window and drawing your selection shape to the part of the picture with the next bacterial growth.
6. Calculate the ratio between the red and green values (for RFP), or blue and red values (for LacZ-alpha) for any given bacterial growth, and subtract from it any background signal (i.e. the plate itself). This ratio approximates the amount of pigment produced in the bacteria.
Seawater Experiments
For experiments testing E. coli survival in seawater, local water samples were obtained from a dock on the north end of campus, which is part of the opening to Sheepshead Bay (which filters into Rockaway Inlet and then into the Atlantic Ocean.) The date and time of each sample was noted to compare it with tide levels, temperature, and other environmental variables.
500uL of a culture of E. coli (containing BioBrick BBa_J04450), or sterile LB, or an E. coli pellet re-suspended in sterile saline solution, was added to tubes containing 5mL of the seawater sample (SW) or the same sample after autoclave sterilization (sterilized seawater, SSW). The cultures were allowed to incubate overnight in a tube rotor.
Bacterial density in cultures were determined by creating 1:10 dilutions in sterile saline solution and plating these dilutions (for example, spotting 10uL of each dilution) onto appropriate LB plates. Colonies counted the next day were multiples by the dilution factor (# of 1:10 dilutions x 100) to determine CFU/mL count."

Unfortunately only 4 of the 10 selected colonies run in the BioLector showed GFP expression when subsequently examined in the fluorescent microscope, and none of them had RFP expression. This is unfortunately consistent with the data achieved from the actual BioLector run.
Characterization of series B with inducible N protein
Out of the original colonies selected from the transformation of series A constructs, 11 were selected for transformation with pAT01, the inducible pBAD+Nprotein plasmid. This series of 11 strains was successfully transformed with pAT01.
BioLector
Overnight cultures were run in the BioLector and induced with arabinose after approx. 4 hours to induce N protein expression. This was to verify if the trigger mechanism observed using fluorescent microscopy could be induced. Out of the 9 cultures, only one of the E-constructs produced a GFP signal (strong promoter – weak Terminator – no N protein), but none of the constructs  expressed RFP.
Fluorometer
At the same time the overnight cultures were diluted and new overnight cultures were made with a reference and also induced with arabinose to test if a difference in the RFP expression could be seen.  None of the cultures expressed RFP. Data not shown. It was not possible to verify the trigger or inducible mechanism from this experiment. Through visual inspection, it appeared clear that the N induced strains appeared to be lysing.
Construction of BioBricks
In the following section we describe more in detail the method and strategy used for construction of our parts and Biobricks.

In order to construct our biobricks, we used a set of forward and reverse primers to amplify a region of interest by using PCR. The fragments created by PCR amplification were purified using a PCR clean-up kit. The amplicon and the linearized backbone plasmid p"
