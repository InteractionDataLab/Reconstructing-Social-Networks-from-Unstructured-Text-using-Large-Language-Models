Computational Models of Bar1 Negative Feedback
Part 1: Negative Feedback and Noise Reduction
Background: Noise can be defined as extracellular or intracellular perturbation which affects signal transduction as well as gene expression[ 1 ]. A signaling pathway can include mechanisms that reduce noise. Such reduction in biological noise may be necessary for pathway functionality. For example, the variety of T cell receptors (TCR) in a population of T cells generates a wide range of responses to a particular antigen, yet somehow, a very specific, low noise, response is achieved through its biological circuitry [ 2 ]. The regulatory mechanisms downstream of TCR include negative feedback which allows stimulation signals to be controlled, guaranteeing appropriate responses to external perturbations. Also, noise is regarded as a quantitative index of variability within a population, which can be shown by the distribution of population response when stimulated. We wonder if adding a negative feedback to the production of extracellular communication factor will reduce population noise.
Circuit Diagram: We have added the Bar1 gene, which is activated by alpha factor in the primary circuit [ 3 ]. Bar1 is a protease that cleaves alpha factor in the extracellular zone. So, alpha factor inhibits the accumulation of itself by producing Bar1, which forms a negative feedback for extracellular alpha factor. We can tune the strength of negative feedback with different alpha factor responsive promoters.
Modeling Result: Here is the data plot using a stochastic model based on Chemical Langevin Equation  [ 4 ]. The data along the whole time period is integrated into histograms on the right. From the results, we find that strains with negative feedback loop have lower noise (Upper panel), while strains without it have higher noise (Lower panel).
Part 2: Bimodal Response
Background: We explored another behavior pattern, bimodal response, which means when stimulated, the whole cell group differentiates into two subgroups - one of them activated while"
Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," 300 cities all over Europe. The main goal of this night is to put researchers in touch with the public. Thus, they can explain what they are doing, how and what can be the applications in the day-to-day life.
More about the Researchers' Night
This year, the theme was ""Imagine the future"": what future will emerge from research laboratories? How do scientists imagine the future? Archeology, Physics, Philosophy, Biosciences or Linguistic: researchers shared their lab experiences and thoughts on the future. Therefore, in order to defend a controversial discipline, Synthetic Biology (a.k.a. SynBio), the Lyon-INSA team members participated in the Researchers’ Night, which was held on September 28th, 2012, at the CCO of Villeurbanne.
Indeed, an article published by a French team: “Séralini et al., Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize, Food and Chemical Toxicology, Volume 50, Issue 11, November 2012, Pages 4221–4231” and also in the paper “Le Monde” on September 25th, 2012, on deleterious effect of transgenic maize on rats, had a dramatic effect on the public opinion in Europe. Thus, to illustrate that SynBio can be used to improve the environment, health and life of people, we decided to explain the potential of SynBio and to exchange with the public through a scientific speed-dating and around a table containing diagrams and Petri dishes.
“What is it?” asked a little boy. “What are you doing?” asked a woman. We could introduce them to our friends: bacteria! Then, one of the iGEM team members answered: “Bacteria are little organisms which grow, eat and die like every living being. These bacteria are not always pathogenic and scientists can improve their qualities with the introduction of DNA fragments containing genes.”
So the objective is reached: we aroused the surprise, the questioning and the amazement of people. In this respect, we pointed out the usefulness of SynBio. We decided to focus on medical application of BABS (Bacteria Improved by SynBio) such as insulin, growth hormones, and artemisinin production, and also on the food industry application with food coloring or artificial flavor production that already work.
Of course, we have also presented our project as an innovative solution to kill and disperse biofilm in all pipelines or tanks and to prevent any colonization of bacteria.

Our Project
The hydrogen industry produces over 50 million metric tons of hydrogen per year, sourcing over 95% from fossil fuels [1].With the growing demand in refinery hydroprocessing, the global market for hydrogen is projected to reach over 700 billion metric tons by 2018 [1]. The overall aim of our project is to generate a clean, renewable source of hydrogen by expressing genes of the photosynthetic pathway within E. coli. Our first goal is to assemble the Chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway in E. coli in order to metabolically engineer chlorophyll in this organism. Up to date, no researcher has been successful in producing chlorophyll in non-photosynthetic organisms before [2]. Once produced, the chlorophyll will bind to Photosystem II, which is another pathway that we seek to construct within E. coli, to generate hydrogen ions, oxygen and electrons from the oxidation of water. The hydrogen ions and electrons generated from Photosystem II can then be converted to hydrogen gas using a Hydrogenase. Our modelling and human practice approaches will allow us to assess the viability of our hydrogen production on an industrial scale.
Motivation
Climate Change
In the last few decades, clean renewable energy has emerged as the frontrunner for research into alternatives to fossil fuels. Whilst running out of fossil fuels is not an immediate concern, as we continue to discover and produce fossil fuel reserves, the pollutions effects inherent, which cause climate change. At this rate, we will surpass an atmospheric [CO2] of 700 ppmv well before 2100. This would be an irreversible global catastrophe and severe climate volatility would ensue [3,4]. The Paris Agreement on climate change has come into effect on the 5th of October, 2016. This plan outlines certain emission targets that countries promise to conform to. Huge steps have been made towards developing a clean, reliable energy source with hydrogen being the primary candidate. Hydrogen combusts to produce water and energy without producing harmful emissions. To generate hydrogen within E. coli we are building on the work of previous Macquarie iGEM teams.

Switch Circuit
Short Introduction and Overview
Introduction
Many biological applications require a pulse mechanism, that enables on the one side a fast production and high accumulation of specific protein at one time and on the other side a fast elimination of this protein after a period of time has passed. Pulse generators that turn protein production on and off are essential parts of engineered genetic circuits, which allow to control the system of interest. With regard to our project, especially to  the in vivo chromosomal genome-deletion, it is crucial to express restriction enzymes only for a very short amount of time in order to increase  cell survival.
Recent studies describe several engineered pulse-generating circuits, which are based on a feed-forward motif. These are parameter-sensitive and are difficult to construct on the biological level. We propose a novel switching mechanism which requires a start signal, realized by induction with IPTG, and a stop signal, realized by addition of tetracycline. This setup allows us to test genetic circuits with protein pulses of different duration. Moreover, because our setup relies on standard promoters and repressor binding sites, standard expression vectors such as pET system by F. W. Studier (1-3) are fully compatible with our design and can be used without modification.
System Description
The system is based on two plasmids. The first plasmid carries the protein of interest that is under control of a standard lac repressor. The protein of interest is either fluorescent protein for testing or, in our experiments with genomic reduction, specific restriction enzyme to support the gene-deletion mechanism. The second plasmid contains lacI IS, an IPTG-insensitive"

Gold: In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, any one or more of the following:
1.Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry (in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry), create a new registry page for the improved part, and submit this part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). The growth of the Registry depends on having a broad base of reliable parts. This is why the improvement of an existing part is just as important as the creation and documentation of a new part. An ""improvement"" is anything that improves the functionality and ease-of-use of a part, so that it is more likely to be used by the community. For instance: strengthening the expression of a part by mutating the DNA sequence; modifying one or a few parts in construct (Device) so that it performs its intended job better; improving a cloning or expression vector that can be easily used by the"

When concentrating and rebuffering the proteins with PES (polyethylene sulfone) membranes a lot of protein was lost. The S-layer proteins stuck to the membrane. Some could be removed again from the membrane after cutting out the filter and incubate it in ddH2O over-night. This problem has to be kept in mind when using this S-layer.
The results of the purification approach are shown in Figure 16:
Figure 16: Luminescence corrected with the volume of the collected fraction plotted against the fraction during purification of <partinfo>K525311</partinfo>. Abbreviations: s.n. = supernatant, F = filtrate, R = retentate, FT = flow through, E10 = elution with 100 mM NaCl.
The purification strategy has to be improved. The inclusion bodies cannot be purified because urea damages the luciferase irreversible (data not shown). The loss due to adsorption of the SgsE | luciferase fusion protein to PES membranes could be avoided by using different membranes. The binding conditions of the IEX have to be improved as well. Anyway, the idea behind this purification strategy could be a starting point for a better strategy. Possibilities for improvement are:
Different membranes for ultra- / diafiltration
Other binding conditions for the IEX capturing step (higher pH)
Hydrophobic interaction chromatography as purification step after IEX (works in general, data not shown)
Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) for polishing
Stability
To test whether the S-layer protein enhances the half-life of the firefly luciferase, immobilization experiments were carried out. After the IEX described above, the elution fraction was immobilized on silicon dioxide beads or just diluted with HBSS buffer which is used for the immobilization / recrystallization of SgsE S-layer proteins. The immobilization is carried out at room temperature for 4 h. It could be seen that the luciferase activity nearly expired during this time (in the positive and the negative control). So the S-layer SgsE could not stabilize the luciferase at room temperature. The results of this experiment is shown in Figure 17:
Figure 17: Results of immobilization experiments with <partinfo>K525311</partinfo>. The stability of the luciferase activity at room temperature is decreasing quickly.

Water remediation is an important issue in 21st century.  As safe-for-consumption water amount decreases, water purification stands out as an urgent matter to be considered. Our country, Turkey, also deals with a lot of pollution problems, water pollution being one of them. As we search for a project that offers a solution to a local problem, we learned about the increasing antibiotic resistance threat and antibiotic waste in water. In the last few years, Turkey started public campaigns* and public service ads** which aims to raise public awareness about antibiotic use. The reason for these urgent campaigns was the fact that Turkey prescribes a huge amount of antibiotics, consumes a huge amount of antibiotics and throws away a huge amount of antibiotics. All together these prompt contamination of water by antibiotics and pose the danger of increasing the antibiotic resistance among the bacteria present in water. Therefore this may result in bacterial infections spreading simply from water sources. A recent study by the Ministry of Health of Turkey indicates that bacterial resistance against certain families of antibiotics are significantly more compared to UN data.*** This table states how big the problem is in Turkey.

As we learned about the size of the problem in Turkey, we continued our researches in the water purification field. We wanted to know how the antibiotics are separated from water and how efficient the methods are.

We have talked to the ICC (Initiative on Crohn and Colitis) and gastroenterologists from the Academic Medical Center (AMC) in Amsterdam about the feasibility of our sensor and the aspects in our system that can be a point to concern. Also Joost Drenth, head of the department Stomach-Colon and Liver diseases at the UMC St. Radboud in Nijmegen , and Alexandra Ginsberg, designer and writer in the field of synthetic biology , gave us their opinion and advice about our project.
Current approach
Intestinal cancer
Intestinal cancer, also called colorectal cancer or colon cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and woman in the U.S. [3] . The disease usually starts with the growth of polyps
Polyps are small clumps of cells formed in the lining of the colon. They are different variants and can turn into the formation of tumors. Benign polyps are not fatal and often termed as hyperplastic polyps. These polyps remain benign and the chance that these will turn into cancer is very low. Adenomatous and hamartomatous polyps are non-malignant variants; however, they have a chance of becoming cancerous if not removed. The last variant of polyps is an invasive variant and can turn into tumors. When polyps evolve into cancer, the uncontrolled tissue growth of the tumor can be seen through all tissue layers of the colon rectum. Even the spreading of cancer to other organs is possible in this stage.
in the mucosa, which is the innermost lining of the intestines. The mucosa consists of epithelium cells, loose connective tissue, and forms the first line of defense in the intestines.
Currently, intestinal cancer is diagnosed and screened by performing fecal occult blood tests (FOBT), a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. A FOBT is the first screening method in which the feces are being checked for the presence of small amounts of blood that are not immediately visible.  Even though FOBT is feasible, accepted and widely available, its sensitivity for polyps is low and it also has a relatively low specificity. This led to many false-positive results and repetitive screening is often necessary [4] . A FOBT screening is often combined with a sigmoidoscopy. This method of screening uses a lighted tube with a camera to examine the rectum and sigmoid colon. With a small biopsy tool, samples of tissue can be collected"

Instead, we covered a green LED with black film and make it light as weak as our E.coli, and we assayed with the weak green LED by the Y-maze. Here is the result. Unfortunately, the significant difference was not observed. We think that it is because the intensity of the emitted light was too weak. However, as you can see, iGEM 2010 Cambridge team succeeded to make E.coli emit light and to reinforce the intensity of the light. We think that if our E.coli can emit brighter light like them, the assay will show the significant difference.

Checking the Self Destructive Plasmid
In order to check the activity of SDP some experiments should be done. During the assembly of the construct several control experiments will be done. After building a construct, the construct will be checked by PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis to check the length of the construct. Verification forward primer(VF2) and verification reverse (VR) will be used. The expression and activity of I-SceI will be checked by an Assay.  The construct showed in figure.10 will be used to check the expression of I-SceI. The same plasmid or other vectors containing I-SceI recognition site could be used to check the activity of the endonuclease. Incubating this plasmid with expressed and purified I-SceI and agarose gel electrophoresis will show if the endonuclease is active. These results will be compared with activity of commercial available I-SceI homing endonuclease. The expression of TetR will be checked by expression TetR from the in figure.9 showed construct. Western Blot analysis should show if TetR is expressed.

We counted the number of C. elegans in each channel and calculated the parameter ‘ka’ without chemical at first(Fig 4.).
Gaussian distribution is very common in nature and important in statistics. This distribution is tied to many natural phenomena. In our experiment, we use the Gaussian Plate to see C. elegans’’ distribution. Then we use it to see the change of C. elegans’’ distribution after adding attraction or repellent factor (Fig.2).
Firstly, we introduced a parameter ‘ka’ (0<=ka<=1) to describe how much the previous choice influences the current choice
The ‘ka’ is defined as the absolute value of the difference between the probability of two direction choices.

It means the greater the ‘ka’ is the greater the influence of previous choice is. Especially, when ‘ka’ is zero, the simulation model is more like Gaussian distribution.

Assume that ‘ka’ doesn’t change when we add attraction or repellent factors. Then this model can be used to stimulate C. elegans preference considering ‘ka’.
We can analyze how much the factor attracts or repels the C. elegans by introducing another parameter ‘kperf’ (0<=kperf<=1).
Both parameters set above are dependent on the assumption that parameters values are proportional to the probability they affect the C. elegans’ choice.
For example, if ‘ka’ is to ‘0’, previous choice doesn’t affect current choice at all. If ‘’ka is ‘1’, the worm’s next choice is totally determined by the previous choice and the final result will show polarized distribution( C. elegans only pass through the rightmost or leftmost channels). When ‘ka’ is 0.5, a worm has 25% probability of turning right/left and 75% probability of turning left/right at a crossing. ‘kb’ (attraction or repellent parameter) is"

GABA is produced by a two-step pathway from Glutamine (Fig. 7). Glutamine is converted to glutamic acid by the enzyme glutaminase and the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADC) converts it further to GABA.
Figure 7 Glutamine is converted in two steps to GABA (gamma amino butyric acid). GADC (Glutamic acid decarboxylase) converts glutamic acid to GABA.
For the simulation of the GABA production in the Manchester-Graz expression system model the setup had to be adjusted in a way the transcription and translation rates fit to the proper length of the genes (Fig. 8).
Figure 8 Overview of the Simbiology model with introduced GABA pathway.
The simulation showed an increasing amount of GABA vs. time (Fig. 9). By recalculating the amounts of molecules to concentration amounts the simulation showed a GABA production of 296.53 μmol/h/L or 30.58 mg/h/L

Acetylcholine
Acetylcholine is one of many neurotransmitters in the autonomic nervous system (ANS). It acts on both the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) and is the only neurotransmitter used in the motor division of the somatic nervous system. Acetylcholine has different effects on several tissues controlled by the nervous system [3]. Choline is the precursor molecule for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and gets absorbed in the gut. Choline gets converted to Acetylcholine by the choline-acetyl-transferase which links Acetyl CoA and Choline (Fig. 10).
Figure 10 Acetylcholine is produced by the Choline-acetyl-transferase.
For modeling the production of acetylcholine the choline-acetyl-transferase had to be introduced to the model. AcetylCoA is constantly produced by the cells whereas Choline is taken up from the environment (Fig. 11).
Figure 11 Overview of the Simbiology model with introduced Choline-acetyl-transferase.
Acetylcholine is constantly produced by the cells by a rate of 431.11 μmol/h/L or 62.99 mg/h/L (Fig. 12).

Main                                 remarks
Overview
After the formation of the Cas9:gRNA complex, it must find the target and knock it out. As soon as the complex is formed, it will wander around the nucleus describing a random pathway.
During this erratic trajectory, collisions with several regions of DNA will take place. If the union to those regions is thermodynamically balanced and feasible the R-loop will take place.
This structure results on the hybridization of the Cas9:gRNA complex to a DNA sequence. This implies not only joining the target, but also to undesired regions similar to the target, named off-targets.
In this step of the modeling, we used Boltzmann probability distribution and Thermodynamics in order to estimate the probability that the complex binds to the target, using a search algorithm based on the transcriptional activity and target-similarity provided by local alignment algorithms.
Complex diffusion
Model and assumptions
The process of searching the target among all the genome is named scanning. Thus, we can express the contact rate between Cas9:gRNA complex and any other DNA region:
Where parameters with values indicated in Table 5,                         are:
D is the compound diffusivity.
[Cas9:gRNA] is the concentration of the complex.
V is the compartment volume, i.e. the plant nuclear                         volume.
λCas9 is the characteristic length between                         the place of production and binding.
The picture below represents a spherical approach of the Cas9 shape, being λ=VCas91/3. We can consider that next to the edge of Cas9 there will be DNA ready to hybridize gRNA if possible (2). Assumptions made to consider this situation are:
The complex can be considered as a macromolecule with                         three-dimensional random diffusion around the                         nucleus.

Abstract: TU Delft 2009 wanted to build an improved cell to cell communication system.  They wanted to construct an E.coli strain that can pass GFP signals through conjugation only once. When “initiator cells” which contains the “signal plasmid” for the communication system, is added to a cell culture, the initiator cells (donor cells) conjugate with other cells “non-initiator” cells in the culture. During the conjugation, the signal plasmid is transferred to the recipient cells. The signal plasmid encodes for an entry exclusion protein, an endonuclease, and GFP. It has a restriction site of the endonuclease. The entry exclusion protein prevents backward conjugation, the endonuclease and the restriction site can reset the cell back to off state, and finally GFP can a reporter to visualize where the signal is.  The expression of endonuclease should be delayed because cells, which just received the signal plasmid, require time to conjugate and pass down the signal plasmid to the recipient cells. TU Delft 2009 tried to solve this problem by introducing a delay device.  The riboregulator system was used for their RNA-based delay system. By having another level of regulation between the reception of signal and expression of self-destructing protein (e.g. endonuclease), Delft 2009 believed that there could be delayed expression of the self-destructing protein. TU Delft 2009 also designed an algorithm called Ribo Key & Lock Generator that can generate sequences for lock and key riboregulators when RBS sequence is used as an input.

Surveys
An important aspect of our project was understanding how our GM bacteria would be perceived by the public. Public perception can often be a barrier between scientific progress and real world application. The main objectives of our surveys were to determine the public’s knowledge of GMOs, access their comfort level with GMOs, identify any specific areas of concern with genetic engineering, and access their comfort level with our project in particular. Our methods for conducting the surveys were approved by the MSU Institutional Review Board (IRB) as scientifically valid methods. We stood on Grand River Avenue across from MSU’s campus, and asked everyone who walked by to fill out a survey anonymously. We did this for a few days every week during the month of July 2018. Afterward, we tallied all of the surveys to get our final results. The survey itself consisted of a disclaimer paragraph, per IRB regulations, informing the participants about the purpose of the survey, and the contact information for one of our PIs. This was followed by three demographics questions, and then seven questions designed to better understand public opinion of GMOs. All questions were ""multiple choice"" style.
Demographics
Overall, 363 people filled out our surveys. Because we surveyed people at a location so close to campus, we were aware that our polling population might have some bias. We saw this bias in our demographic results, where 52% where typical college-aged students. However, we still think that our data can provide some useful insights into the general population’s opinions. We purposely chose a location near a public bus stop and near businesses, so some of the people we polled would be younger and older, and have varying education levels, as better represents the general population.
Results
Our results show that the general public's opinion of GMOs varies dramatically. Public education and awareness will be an important part of making our GM bacteria marketable. We were happy to see, though, that most people were at least open to learning more about our project. As shown in the results from question 5, only 7% thought that genetically modifying bacteria instead of a plant was unacceptable. The other 93% were at least open to discussion"

Color pathway testing
Correct genes testing
The first indication of whether obtaining of the genes was a succes, is the correct size of DNA product on a gel. DNA sequencing will provide final certainty of the correct genes.
Correct activity testing
The ultimate proof of activity of the pathway would obviously be a colored Escherichia coli colony. However, to identify individual working enzymes, we'd need specific enzymatic assays. Furthermore this is useful, as some enzymatic assays could yield parameters for the modeling guys. Due to a lack of time, we've not looked any further into these assays.
Results
After we had our first succesful PCR on the genes of E. coli with Taq polymerase ( Lab notebook August 19th ) we tried to repeat it using Pfx polymerase, but this didn't work ( Lab notebook September 4th ). In the end we decided to repeat the experiment with Taq polymerase as the desired sequences were not very long, thus the chance for mutations due to the lack of proofreading of Taq polymerase was small. In the end the sequences will be verified through DNA sequencing. The gel of this PCR is displayed in figure 1. The S. cerevisiae genes showed no results.
Behind the gene names is mentioned what the size of the gene would be, idi is larger due to primer design.
Figure 1: Taq polymerase PCR of atoB (1188 bp), idi (552 bp) and ispA (903 bp)
On these PCR products, we did a touchdown PCR with new primers, which were designed to add the biobrick prefix and suffix to the gene. This is described here . The results of this experiment are displayed in figure 2.

The idea of cloning the lac operon is to simplify the screening for the rightly cloned plasmids.
Gibson Assembly of the pCOLA-FS plasmid
The pCOLA-FS plasmid was assembled by Gibson Assembly from the following fragments:
pCOLA-FS synthetic fragment This fragment is 1925bp long.
pCOLA PCR product, amplified from primers FNS_15 and FNS_16. This fragment is 2128bp long.
The final size of the plasmid, after the Gibson Assembly is 4002bp.
For the Gibson Assembly of the pCOLA-FS itself, we calculated a molar ratio of 1:1 BackBone:insert, due to the size similarity of the two fragments, which did not justify having a 1:2 ratio. We used 100ng of the PCR fragment and 93ng of the synthetic fragment, in a total of 15uL of Gibson Assembly Mix (using New England’s Biolabs’ 2X Hifi DNA Assembly MasterMix. We incubated the mix 1h at 50ºC (protocol says to incubate it for 15min, but in our experience it works better if you incubate it for longer).
2uL of the final Gibson Assembly mix was transformed through chemical transformation to E. coli DH5alfa and plated in the corresponding antibiotics.
Golden Gate of the various pCOLA-FS plasmids
After we obtained the pCOLA-FS plasmid and checked it by sequencing, we began the cloning of the different pCOLA-FS plasmids carrying the different enzymes for testing.
For doing that, the first step was getting the fragments to clone using BsaI cloning.
The PCR reaction was carried out using ThermoFischer Phusion polymerase, because of its proofreading activity, and the PCR was carried out in a volume of 50uL (10uL 5X HF Buffer, 1uL 10mM dNTPs, 2.5uL of each primer, 2uL of the template (for 20bg), 1,5uL DMSO, 0.5uL pol and 30uL water).

As a webpage it’s much more accessible - anyone (even on a phone) could use it without having to install any custom programs which would take both time to install and might require a license.
As far as we’re aware, we’re the first iGEM team to ever put up something like this. The closest was Pretoria UP 2016, but our graphs also contained our entire mass action kinetics model, instead of just a visualization.
It was built in JavaScript and therefore not limited by proprietary license agreements, and doesn’t require Java applets to be enabled (which modern browsers no longer support due to stability and security issues). [2]
JavaScript follows ECMA’s open standard so it can run on purely open-source tools. This helps acheive “iGEM’s goal of making everything in the competition open source”. [3] There are also a lot more open source libraries available for JavaScript which means other teams can build upon our work easier. These include Chart.js, the library we are using to draw the graphs.
Finally, our JavaScript code ran faster than our MATLAB code, which we attribute to both our greater experience in JavaScript and the aggressive optimisation that’s been done by vendors trying to compete for the fastest browsers. [4]
Initial mass action kinetics model
We created our first model following a meeting with Thomas Ouldridge at Imperial, who recently coauthored a paper about mathematically modeling toehold-mediated strand displacement. In the meeting we agreed that we’d need to model the different states of the toehold switch. We also discussed modeling the miRNA binding and unbinding to and from the toehold base-by-base. We later decided against this, as whilst it may have been useful for learning about the kinetics of toehold switches it would not have given us useful information to put into our design process and would have overcomplicated our model.
We first modelled a simple system of 4 substances with reversible reactions as follows:
Where CTS, PBTS and OTS represent the toehold switch in closed, partially bound and open states respectively. At this point we didn’t know the value of the rate constants so we used placeholders.
This was useful as it gave us experience programming in MATLAB, which we hadn’t done before, as well as forced us to learn the foundations for the maths we’d need later; mainly ODEs. Khan Academy was very helpful with this.
With all three reactions being reversible, MATLABs dsolve function was not able to"

Endophytic infection by a transformed strain of wild bacteria
We were able to inoculate a model grass species Brachypodium distachyon, a distant relative of the source plant of the endophyte, and demonstrate that the bacteria can grow to occur both root cortex tissue and the root surface. While the bacteria we inoculated under sterile conditions, a similar method is likely capable of inoculating plant in-field, simply by soaking the seeds in bacterial culture prior to planting.
Our experimentation demonstrated that our bacteria can infect a grass plant under near-real-world conditions (but for biosafety, the system was contained). B. distachyon diverged from the original host, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) 51.6 ± 7.9 (SD) million years ago (Vicentini et al. 2008). B. distachyon is more closely related to the major cereal crops (rice, wheat, corn, barley, rye and oats) than it is to switchgrass. Because of the cereal crops’ relationship to the plant we reinfected, we hypothesize that this endophytic bacteria can help promote growth and health in these important food crops.

Alternatively, the repressor could be in the form of a protein that is not a transcription factor.  Rather, this repressor protein could be designed to target the gene product of G, thus blocking its activity, or even the activator A by inhibiting its regulatory effects on gene G.  Such regulation would thus occur on the level of protein-protein interactions.  Along this train of thought, it is even possible to devise regulatory systems that affect gene G on multiple levels for enhanced regulation.

ICT empowerment initiatives
Our research started with a quote that we noticed in an article from the French journal “Le Monde” [5].
The article dealt with MOOC development and quoted a statement made during a UNESCO Conference in Paris by Souleymane Bachir Diagne - Professor at Columbia, New York, who formerly gave classes at the University of Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar. In his declaration, he considered that African population would double in the following years.  The pace for construction of facilities in African Universities would always be late compared with the increasing student flows. Therefore, MOOCs are a technological innovation that Africa cannot miss to democratize knowledge.
We contacted Mr Souleymane Bachir Diagne in order to discuss about his experience as a teacher at the university in Dakar and his point of view on MOOCs and ICT. Indeed, some voices considered that MOOC’s development in Africa is not adapted since the priority should be to improve facilities and internet network.
On this point, he disagreed since it would lead Africa to disconnect itself from a global revolution. Besides, one must not forget about resilient abilities of Humanity. There isn’t a unique pattern of development when a new technology is arriving. For instance, even with the African digital divide, it is in Kenya that the first mobile payment system was born, through the “M-Pesa system”.
Soon after, we discovered the “JerryClan” Initative. The JerryClan is a community aiming at assembling computers (called “Jerry”) from recycled hardware and a Jerrycan. The idea started in Paris in 2011, and it is now an international community operating in Europe, Africa and the United States. The Manifesto of the JerryClan states that “to fight digital divide, making information technologies accessible and understandable by everyone is a requirement. Thanks to its superpowers, Jerry can break cultural, social, and economical barriers down.”[6]
Two typical “Jerry”, Open source
We contacted JerryClan Senegal in order to discuss on the implementation of their project and their perception on MOOcs.
JerryClan was implemented in 2014 in Dakar and about 250 computers were created since then and nowadays, JerryClan Senegal mainly provides social entities and schools.
While we discussed about MOOCs, they also thought that is was a good way of spreading knowledge and the Jerry could settle in this movement since it can access internet and read videos as any other computer and JerryClan proposes workshops periodically.
When speaking with them about the digital divide, they"

The iGEM Team Worchester collected information about the salt pollution of waters in the North East of the USA. They found that in many freshwater areas in these states the chloride     concentration could reach a toxic level, if there should be no political initiative to reduce the burden. The main reason for the load was the use of salt-based de-icing on roads, as     well as dense building and industrial pollution.
Through this collaboration, we realized that salinization of fresh water reserves is a problem not restricted to highly industrial regions in Europe, but a global challenge for the future.
iGEM Aachen - iGEM Dresden
German Meet-Up
The iGEM Team TU Dresden hosted the three-day German-wide iGEM Meet-Up from June 30th to July 3rd. Henri, Gerolamo and Fabian, three members of our team, joined this event representing      the iGEM Team Aachen. The event gave us the opportunity to get in touch with the 14 other German teams present and to exchange knowledge with them. Since each team presented its project      in a 20-minute session, we got an insight into the topics of the other German teams.
In addition to that, we could also present our own project and identify the areas and problems of      our project we still needed to work on together with the listeners during the subsequent questionnaire. In the free time on Sunday, we also had the opportunity to explore Dresden's      historic town together with the other teams and to talk about collaborations. The weekend also included the presentation of the” iGEM goes green” initiative of the iGEM Team Dresden.      In the workshop, detailed discussions about how each team can make the laboratory work more sustainable were conducted. Because we as a team are just as convinced of the importance of      this topic, we decided to join the “iGEM goes green” movement and work together to minimize our carbon footprint (-> Read more).
At the Meet-Up, we not only found a lot of new friends and gathered new insights, but we were able to develop initial ideas with the iGEM Team Cologne-Dusseldorf,      which resulted in our intense laboratory collaboration (->Read more). We would like to thank the iGEM Team TU Dresden for the great event and the excellent organization,      which enabled us to get to know the other German"

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#HP Product Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the Hong Kong community, which is a biosensor for fungal diseases in trees. By using the tri-stable switch, the chemical which has the highest concentration out of three different target substances can be detected. When used as the tree biosensor, the switch will be used to detect tree wounds as well as two different kinds of fungi which live on the roots of trees. After detecting the presence of a fungus or a wound, the device will release chemicals that can either kill the parasite or heal the tree wounds. We plan to use Liana plants as a potential host for easier delivery of the device to the trees. We hope that this biosensor design would be able to help the Hong Kong Government in reducing accidents caused by falling trees. In the future, the circuit can  also be used to detect pests in plants grown in commercial farms.
1) Principle Behind Application: Tree diseases detector
The system senses tree wounds and two fungi that devour the trees’ rigid structural components. The following are the functions of the promoters used:
Promoter
Function
1st Promoter
Detect phenolic compounds secreted by tree wounds (i.e. phenols, flavonoids and proanthocyanidins) (Vek, Oven, Humar 2012)
Induce the switch to produce certain colour of chromoprotein in the sap flow through the surface of the bark.
2nd Promoter
Detect acetic acid secreted by Brown Rot fungi (Wang et al., 2014)
3rd Promoter
Detect compound  like Fe3+ and H2O2 produced by White Rot fungi (Teunissen, Pauline, 2001)
Dealing with infection by two fungal diseases (More than one stimulus stimulating our switch)
Detect the dominating inducer, and produce chromoproteins of color in response to that particular stimuli - chemicals will then be used to treat the tree wounds or kill the fungi depending on which color shows up.
After the first dominating inducer is dealt with, the next dominating inducer will be detected.
Host Organism of the sensor
Liana (climbing plants)
Shares the same habitat as the fungus in temperate forest (Schnitzer et al, 2014)
Implant the sensor in leaves
Go up along the tree trunks and branches
Carry the sensor and check every corner of the tree
2) Product Description
The product is in the form of genetically engineered Liana plant. It will be planted near the target tree, enabling it to grow and climb up the tree without much care needed.
Normal Liana leaves are green-colored. However"

Other iGEM Teams
During the summer an ethic workshop was hosted by the University of Copenhagen iGEM team , the outcome of the workshop can be seen here , and we are very grateful to have been invited.
Laboratories
Most of our experiments were carried out at Center for Biological Sequence Analysis (CBS) at DTU Systems Biology located at the Technical University of Denmark. Here we were invited to use their machines to perform our molecular work and measurements.
Part of the work was carried out at Metabolic Signaling and Regulation and Infection Microbiology at DTU Systems Biology. Here we used the fluorescence microscope and fluorometer to investigate our cultures, which was a great help during the project and we used the flow cytometer to measure fluorescence at cellular level.
Literature
Dr. Samie Jaffrey from Department of Pharmacology, Weill Medical College, Cornell University, was of great help, and provided us the specific sequences of their Spinach-construct which later on made the foundation for our quantification of promoter strengths.

Transformation of P955+P963 (GAL4 based LSPS + reporter) and P959+P968 (LexA based LSPS + reporter) in Y190 S. cerevisiae with S. c. EasyComp Transformation Kit
Investigator: Jeff, Ingmar
Aim of the experiment: Transformation of P955+P963 (GAL4 based LSPS + reporter) and P959+P968 (LexA based LSPS + reporter) in Y190 S. cerevisiae with S. c. EasyComp Transformation Kit.
Procedure:
Co-transformation of P955+P963 (GAL4 based LSPS + reporter) and P959+P968 (LexA based LSPS + reporter) into Y190 S. cerevisiae cells was performed with the S. c. EasyComp Transformation Kit from Invitrogen after manufacturer's protocoll.
For each transformation we used 5 µg of DNA in total.
Transformation was performed after protocol with the only difference in the last step that we did't plated the transformated cell-suspension, but in liquid SC medium without"

Improvement
Our biobrick BBa_K2850001 (ester synthetase/acyl-CoA diacylglycerol acyltransferase) is an improvement of the BBa_K1705001 biobrick created by the MIT team in 2015. Since we did not know how to use the MoClo Fusion sites from this part, we decided to go another way to start our improvement. Therefore we looked up the protein sequence of atfA from Acinetobacter bayliy ADP1 in the NCBI database. The sequence was reverse translated and codon optimized for the use in E. coli and then synthesized by IDT. Since the biobrick of the MIT is not optimized for the use in E. coli our biobrick should have a much better translation rate and therefore a better expression. In addition our atfA was cleaned of restriction sites to make it compatible for any RFC biobrick system that is mentioned in iGEM registry.
How did we construct the biobricks?
As mention before the gblocks were prepared for further usage as proposed by IDTs website. As first step the gblocks and the transport vector were double restriction digested with XbaI and SpeI for later ligation into the completed Biobrick for submission. The added supplements were prepared as follows:
Final Volume: 50µL
The restriction mix was kept at 37°C over night. The enzymes were then deactivated by placing the mix on a heat block at 80°C for 20min. For better time management chloramphenicol LB-agar-plates were prepared while the restriction was going.To prevent the transport vector from ligating with itself, it was treated with 2μL of alkaline phosphatase overnight and again inactivated with a heat block at 80°C for 20min.
Implementation of the insert into the vector was done with a fast-link DNA ligation kit from epicenter. For this purpose, the instructions of the kit manufacturer were strictly followed. Of the resulting 15μL, 5μ were used for transformation into electrocompetent E. coli cells via electroporation (2500 V; 4.2ms). After 1h of regeneration time the electroporation mixes were diluted by a factor 1:10 and 1:100 and streak"

- Water-bathes: We often used the water-bathes for transformation or digestion, etc. They can be dangerous because of the exposition to hot or even boiling water. To protect us, wearing a lab coat and special gloves was indispensable. The same equipment is necessary for the microwave.
- Ethidium Bromide: For some manipulations (to reveal gel electrophoresis), we have used ethidium bromide and UV light. Thus, a dark room is dedicated for that. This room is key-closed and the wearing of a lab coat, gloves and glasses is mandatory. Everything in direct contact with something in this room has to stay there. Wastes are treated specifically. A specific trash can is dedicated to gloves or paper and another is dedicated to the agarose gels that were contaminated.
- Chemical hood: We used the chemical hood when we had to manipulate dangerous and volatile chemicals (for example: the usage of alcohol 96°)
Safety for our project
We have described above the relevant security measures taken all through summer to minimize the risk of incidents in the lab. However, when working in the field of synthetic biology, one of the main concerns is the dissemination of our engineered strain, which could be a threat to the public and the environment.
We have used E. coli and B. subtilis chassis, since their genomes are very well characterized and, of course, since these bacteria are non-pathogenic. E. coli was used for genetic manipulations, moreover the genes that were inserted (BioBricks) into this bacterium, did not increase its pathogenicity. B. subtilis was the final therapeutic agent because of its natural presence in the cave’s microbiote. Therefore, the main threat is the dissemination of our bacteria in the external environment where gene transfer could occur between microorganisms.
This is the reason why, to prevent any risk of dissemination, all our waste was autoclaved before being appropriately disposed. Moreover, the French regulation does not allow any genetically modified microorganisms to be taken outside the lab. We are therefore aware that it won’t be possible to test our genetically modified bacteria in real conditions. In fact, it is unthinkable to release our bacteria in the environment without being confident enough that there won’t be any disturbances of the ecosystems of the Lascaux caves and the surrounding environment.
That’s why, to minimize both the risk of dissemination and of gene transfer, several solutions were planned. First of all, we have designed a physical device that would confine our engineered bacteria to the area to be treated ("

- though the transformation was done only yesterday, the plates showed already several colonies:
- Neg. control plates: no colonies, neither on 50 μl-plate nor on rest-plate
- w/o insert plate: no colonies, neither on 50 μl-plate nor on rest-plate
- DarRrev plate: 1 colonie on 50 μl-plate, and many colonies on rest-plate (different sizes; small or medium-big; but clones in general smaller compared to Termrev clones, probably because DarRrev clones grew just overnight)
Colony PCR --> primer combination does not matter, since only 1 orientation of DarR should be possible; additionally, DarR primers make problems during PCR and have a TM diverging from that of VR and VF2)

Background
Project Motivation
Programmers need to track even minute changes to their code exhaustively, especially as the project scales up. Without it, there'd be far too much time spent just on merging in changes from other programmers and far too little time spent actually coding. It's reasonable that an analogy exists in synthetic biology, where complicated structures are modified with the utmost of detail. But because most synthetic biologists work on relatively small logical functions in comparison to the hulking data structures programmers wield, introducing a version control system seemed like overkill. With today's exponentially-increasing complexity of synthetic life, though, it will soon be a grave mistake to not use some sort of change-tracking tool; biologists will soon get caught up in the same logical complexity that plagues professional programmers. Especially as synthetic biology grows as a field, with increasing support from government and enterprise, more people will get involved in these projects and an inability to effectively collaborate could hamper the entire industry.
However, no tool currently exists to support genome-scale changes in a useful way. Existing methods of tracking gene changes don't scale well, and don't incorporate the power of the version control tools programmers are used to. While programming version control tools could be used to cover DNA data, they aren't used to working with that sort of input and are extraordinarily inefficient. Darwin is a way around that. It's built off of version control tools, so it takes advantage of their strength. But it manipulates the DNA data to optimize for these tested and proven methods of version control, producing a much more efficient and secure tracking system. Darwin is completely open-source, so any security or optimization issues can be identified and solved immediately to help all users of the tool. It's also agnostic to the type of version control backend used, so it can be put into place on a massive variety of systems.
Coding
Programmers need to track even minute changes to their code exhaustively, especially as the project scales up. Typical tools used for this process include git and svn, which create ""diffs"" which capture differences between files and send them over a network to collaborators.

Franconia,2017,Team:Franconia#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," provided the basis for discussions. At lunch we met Team Freiburg. Or    rather Team Freiburg met us. They knew some of our team members from the German Meet    Up several days before and mentioned us, what we enjoyed very much.
After lunch time the    most interesting part began: the poster presentations. We realized next to the other posters our    was – although designed that way by choice – really minimalistic and simple but anyway we    did a great job and could get the others into our project. Altogether there were many    interesting projects presented and we’re excited to see them all in Boston when they’re    finished. In the evening we had a BBQ with all participants which were organized by Team    Delft, too. This was a really great opportunity for us to come together and talk with people all    from Europe and not everyone is being biologist. It was great to meet students from different    schools. The last day of this event we spent in Rotterdam on a Pannenkoekenboot. This means    All You Can Eat Pancakes. We enjoyed it. Sitting together with our new iGEM friends on a    boat driving through the Rotterdam rivers and eating All You Can Eat Pancakes. As I said –    we enjoyed. In the afternoon we walked through Rotterdam and went to a Beer Bar ‘De wilde    Hollander’ in Delft. We enjoyed Beer with the members from Newcastle and had long talks    into the night. On our last day in the Netherlands on the 9th of July we drove to Den Haag and    walked along the beach before we took our way home. Of course, every evening while talking    about the day we ate traditional Dutch cheese and drank different Delft Beer. I don´t want to    mention the monster spiders there in Delft because we’re on our way to forget them. And a    big thank you to those bus drivers who let us drive for free because the tickets are too    expensive.    To sum up, we all had an amazing, exciting and informative time in Delft and great thanks to    iGEM Team TU Delft for organizing this big event.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Hardware#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," the dilutions is visible on the graph, as the distances betwen the points and the lines of best fit are similar both with the green filter and with no filter. The no filter readings are higher as fluorescence is provided in arbitrary units, as they are the light intensity readings without being calibrated against a blank. Without the filter less light is blocked and thus there is increased levels.
We were surprised results without the filter. We expected greater errors caused by variations in ambient light and the input blue light. The input source light must therefore be very consistent and also quite directional so as not to significantly affect the readings. For reference, we used a Nichia Superflux LEDs, product code NSPBR70BSS. However, we don't think there's anything particularly special about this LED - it may be an idea for future projects to test LEDs to see if there is a benefit to using a specific type or brand.
Conclusions
The results follow the trends we expected them to, demonstrating that our combined fluorometer and densitometer has high linearity and thus is an effective measurement tool. It could therefore be developed commercially to be used in diagnostics, especially in developing countries. This is further explored on our silver human practices page .
We characterized the linearity of our light sensor (TSL235R) with optical density readings of LUDOX, and found it performed very well.
Aachen 2014 characterized the linearity of the same light sensor (TSL235R) to detect fluoroescence of purified iLOV, [1] and our results with fluorescein are concordant. Using the same light sensor also means our work further characterizes their fluorometer.
Unfortunately we don’t have a plate reader at our school so we were unable to test the same samples with commercial equipment to compare the performance. However, the linearity graphs and Aachen’s previous work characterizing the light sensor (TSL235R) demonstrate that our hardware has real potential to reduce the costs and increase the accessibility of a screening programme.

SMS_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SMS Shenzhen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," let the bacteria release pest-killing factors only when scale insect exists. Scale insect secrets sucrose (sugar) for ecological reasons. We then introduced a ‘sucrose-induced enzyme release’ system into E. coli. When contacting with the sucrose on the surface of scale insect, our engineered bacteria would kill themselves and release the factors, while they would not cause harm to the plants which do not secret sucrose.
Besides, we introduced another safety system into our bacteria to make sure that they would pollute the environment. A suicide process to let bacteria suicide after wipe out those pests. After killing the insect, bacteria would kill themselves because of the suicide gene. In this way, we can ensure that our method won’t affect any plants or fruits.
III Parts Description
From past research, we know that chitinase and protease play the important roles when the entomopathogen is infecting scale insects. We found a specific entomopathogen named Verticillium lecanii. This kind of fungus feeds on scale insects, and it uses chitinase, protease to “open” the shell of scale insects. Thus, we use the chitinase gene (Genbank number: DQ412944.1) and Protease gene (Genbank number: HQ840790.1) from Verticillium lecanii to build two parts that compose of promoter, RBS, the coding sequence and the terminator.
There is also evidence that shows the ability of the cerase in Verticillium lecanii that degrades the wax layer*4, but the specific enzyme that function in this process has not been observed and sequenced. Thus, basing on these factors, we first transformed the chitinase gene and the protease gene into E. coli. To deal with the wax layer problem, we rely on the industrial enzyme and hope that future team can figure out the specific sequence of Verticillium lecanii’s wax enzyme.
Now with the ‘swords’ of chitinase and protease, we can open the shell of scale insects easily. But how can our E. coli sense the scale insects successfully? We do not want our E. coli to spread chitinase and protease everywhere, since those two enzymes especially the protease may cause damage to plants’ surface. We solve this problem by introducing the SacB ‘sucrose inducing enzyme release’ system.
‘SacB encodes the Bacillus subtilis levansucrase, which catalyses hydrolysis of sucrose and synthesis of levans (high molecular weight fructose polym"

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Basics_-_-_TEXT.html," is the process by which the elongation of an RNA molecule is ceased.
Termination can fall into one of two categories:
Intrinsic Termination
Factor-dependent Termination
Intrinsic Termination
Intrinsic Termination can be found to occur at defined template sequences, usually a region of hyphenated inverted sequence symmetry followed by a run of T residues. Termination through intrinsic terminators is stimulated by additional factors, e.g. NusA. Termination occurs due to the stem-loop structure formed by the base-pairing of mRNA with itself caused by inverted sequence symmetry, followed by the run of T residues. The NusA protein causes the RNA-p complex to temporarily stall at the stem-loop structure, when this is followed by a poly-A tail, the RNA-DNA duplex is destabilized. This causes the RNA-p to dissociate from the DNA, thereby terminating transcription. Termination functions step-by-step.
Factor dependent Termination
Factor-dependent Termination occurs due to events that are not directly related to transcription, such as the release of ribosomes from nascent transcript or DNA damage. One such host termination factor is Rho, which acts on many sites along the bacterial chromosome. (( ??MFD, is a host termination factor that is responsible for releasing RNA-p stalled at sites of UV-induced DNA lesions. ??)) rho-dependent termination is characterized by not having a specific hairpin structure involved in the termination.  The termination thus happens  whendue to XXXXXX, and what have been found of the termination site any commen sequences or consensus ?????????????????  the function of rho dependent termination, have been shown to be affected by XXXX. The rho binding sites on the mRNA, have been identified from XXbp to XXXbp of stream of the termination site. Rho-termination is thus an example of the more complex termination regulation that is not fully understood and can be very difficult to define and use for  engineering purposes. Thus for a more defined anti-termination system the lambda N-protein system and the interaction with the nut-site in the phage genome ????? is a more defined system. Recent research have found out that the Rho termination..?

Entrepreneurship
The area of ​entrepreneurship is essential for the development of any project, for our team, this area is very important because in our institution we have a lot of support from experts to develop it and some teams do not have the support of experts in entrepreneurship in their universities, that is why as part of our activities we decided to make all this support available so that other teams have the opportunity to develop this area as we do.
We conducted an online survey format that was sent to 209 teams from all educational levels and from all countries, where we questioned some aspects such as what their doubts were regarding entrepreneurship and what difficulties had been presented to them in this area throughout its development.
We received a response from approximately 20 teams, to which we devoted about a month of work on their questions along with our experts, we decided to classify the questions based on the approach we had in each question, and then consult them with experts in various areas, such as Raúl Lizarraras, entrepreneur immersion coordinator of Coworking TEC and professor
at the Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Chihuahua, also advisor to the support network for entrepreneurs at the National Institute. of the Entrepreneur (INADEM), Elías Solís Rivera, Director of Research and Graduate Studies in Development, Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Monterrey, Campus Chihuahua, has been certified as an instructor for the Environmental Leadership Program for Competitiveness by SEMARNAT and PROFEPA, likewise we received support from Alan Ventura Hernandez Talavera, Larissa Uribe Marioni, and

Market Research - Cornell iGEM raised funds to develop fishBit prototypes to ship to local New York state hatcheries to help determine the usability and feasibility of our device given the market. See what local hatcheries said about our device here . Our market research also helped to determine who are our competitors are and how fishPHARM is a more economically and environmentally relevant compared to other fish tags in the market. We aimed to market our device to consumers as not only a fish tag, but as a drug delivery mechanism capable of treating BCWD.
Patenting through Cornell Center for Technology Licensing - We have pitched our idea to Cornell Center for Technology Licensing (CTL) and spoken extensively with CTL to continue the patenting process for our fish tag prototype. CTL suggested multiple design implementations to make our product not only more unique and valuable, but more user-friendly for the average fish farmer. We have filed an invention disclosure form with CTL and are currently in the provisional patenting process.

Following correspondence with Oxford’s modeling team, we changed the values of some of our parameters. Oxford recommended we used Karzburn’s 2011 paper, ‘Coarse grained dynamics of a cell free system’ for the translation constant. They also pointed out that we had forgotten to change some of the parameters’ units so our model was not dimensionally consistent, and we updated the model to fix those.

One of the biggest potential problems we identified was that if enough translation of closed switches occurred, it would be difficult to see any meaningful results. The kleakage parameter represents the ratio of translation rate on the closed and the open switch. We concluded that would not get any observable difference if translation on the closed switch was above a ten thousandth of the rate on the open switch, something we would never have been able to quantify easily without the model.
Without the model we wouldn’t have realized quite how crucial reducing leakage was. We spent a lot of time designing our switches to minimize leakage.
The lab team also asked us to find the optimal concentration of DNA for both output variation and overall output. By varying ktranslation and the concentration of DNA we found that a higher concentration was better in general, however it would plateau eventually as miRNA consumption became the limiting factor. In the specific case of miRNA degradation being 2 orders of magnitude lower than the rate of degradation of the other RNAs the GFP concentration plateaued around 5×10-9 mol dm-3.

The part BBa_K332011 was created by iGEM10_NCTU_Formosa. The part is a coding part, which is the coding sequence of Cry11Aa protein in Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. Israelensis. Cry11Aa is a kind of toxin protein towards larvae. Some ideas are concerning the over expressing and purifying the protein and thus to deal with the larvae. The most common expressing system is the E.coli BL21(DE3). However, original page lacked some relevant useful information. So, we decided to make a improvement of this part by testing its expressing level in E.coli BL21(DE3).And we cooperated with 2018_GZHS_United to achieve this goal.

Team Gronigen seems to do something similar with us. https://2009.igem.org/Team:Groningen Check it out.
From Young Byun, 3rd of August
Among the teams of iGEM 2007, there's a device that compares A and B's concentration. I think we can use this to figure out which metal is contained more.
I have looked up the parts for Lead, Cadmium, Mercury as Cheolwon had suggested. As for lead, it is confirmed that it works well but for cadmium and mercury we have to try them ourselves.
I added an excel file that shows the parts I looked up.
From Hansung Roh, 3rd of August
I looked up some parts in the registry with the keyword Metal. It seems like there are not many that we can use. How is everyone else going?

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html,"enn said scientists don't like being regulated, that they have a natural aversion to it. But it is necessary.
Yassen asked whether synthetic biology is ""playing God"".
Murdo said synthetic biology did not put us on a par with God; it was hardly the same thing as creating life de novo. He noted our dependence on other parts of the global ecosystem. We shouldn't be too proud; rather we must have a degree of humility.
Fionn asked if there is a dichotomy between science and religion.
Murdo said this was overplayed. There are areas of commonality but also areas where the two forces speak in different languages. He said science can examine ""how"" questions (how things work) but some of the ""why"" questions, the ""meaning of life"" questions, cannot be fully answered by science. He said they are not in conflict but not fully in tune with each other either.
Glenn said there was a popular perception that religion is dead and science answers all. The Church does not share this view.
Murdo said that in ancient times, the Pope spoke and what he said was automatically seen as true. Now science speaks and what it says is automatically seen as true. But he said neither position is correct. He said that public faith in science has been fairly strong, though has perhaps seen a lessening in recent years. People are questioning if science has all the answers.
Fionn asked about the attitudes of synthetic biologists towards the other species in nature.
Murdo recommended humility, but also not trying to force biology into the box of mechanical machines. Biological organisms are not really machines; they are flexible, able to change.
Glenn said the Venters of the world are very influential and will gain a significant following, but agreed with Murdo that humility is called for, not an aggressive attitude to nature.
Yassen said, in the recent history of science, many churches (especially in America) have taken a dim view of things like IVF and genetic engineering. He asked how open the Church of Scotland is to new innovations in science.
Murdo said that the Church's attitude is really quite positive (for example, in its recent report on the subject), and the Church sees many potential benefits. The antagonistic view of science that is sometimes put forward from a religious perspective is not always helpful. The SRTP has consciously brought in people who have a scientific background; it has explicitly brought together theologians and scientists to talk in a reasoned manner.
He said in many cases technology is inherently neutral; it can be used positively or abused. This is true of synthetic biology as well"
Hong_Kong_HKU,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Future possible applications_-_-_TEXT.html," immune system for transgene expression in eukaryotic cells (mammalian cells)
Hiroshi Ochiai (2010) reported that positive feedback system provides efficient transgene expression in Hela cells both in vitro and in vivo.
Additional papers regarding gene therapy suggested plasmid that lacks bacterial backbone due to recombination by site-specific recombination (such as minicircles) will improve efficiency of transgene, because host immune system will not reject entity containing foreign vectors such as bacteria.
The recombination of origin of replication and marker gene or antibiotic resistance gene can reduce allergic responses in an individual should the application be used in eukaryotic cells such as gene therapy.
4. Reduced GM pollens dissemination
The propagation of GM pollen by GM crops have been a major concern especially its effect on undesired gene flow. Transgene removal in pollen prior to its dissemination is, thus, a crucial step to prevent gene flow happens.
Our sensing module can be adjusted to detect specific stimulus and temporally produce protein of interest necessary for plants for a controlled period. Recombinase can then knockout gene of interest safely.

Lab Project
Our lab project focused on the enhancement of a mechanosensitive channel called TRPC5. Since TRP channel had been found hair cells in ears [4] , our work may enlighten future hearing impairment therapies. In our project, we are developing a modified TRPC5 by random mutagenesis at specific region of the channel. With the accumulation effects of random mutagenesis (error-prone PCR), we may generate the TRPC5 mutant that has the highest fitness of the protein landscape [5] .
For a more detailed explanation of our project, see our home :)

Harvard,2008,Team:Harvard#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," we found construction intermediates from the registry to be especially useful, we provided our intermediates with mtrB with RBS, terminator, or both.
The Genetic Circuitry
In order to control the expression of exogenous mtrB we sought to create several different inducible systems. As depicted below, these systems consist of a repressor under the control of a constitutive promoter (blue). In the default state, the repressor will bind to the downstream promoter (red), preventing RNA polymerase from attaching to the DNA strand to start transcription. Thus, in this state, mtrB is not expressed.
In the presence of an inducer, mtrB expression should occur. In this case, the inducer binds the repressor protein, preventing it from binding to the operator within the promoter. RNA polymerase is therefore able to bind to the promoter (green), allowing for expression of mtrB.
Induction results in mtrB expression
We tried to create such systems capable of being induced by IPTG , heat , tetracycline, and light .

Waterloo,2011,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html,"Knowledge Transfer Strategy
Conclusion
The purpose of this analysis was to understand the relative feasibility of a synthetic biology tool from the perceptions of a scientific and non-scientific community. When devising a marketing strategy, most companies define a technology’s commercial success by its appeal towards investors or its ability to enter a market heavily saturated by other established technologies. Given that most synthetic biology institutions are still at their preliminary phases in terms of commercialization, it is critical that their product is widely accepted and acknowledged by all disciplines that are impacted or will be potentially exposed to the technology.
In the future we hope to take our research and methodologies and present them to the stakeholders discussed within the analysis.  Our next steps are to identify institutions and facilities that would benefit from the use of the knowledge transfer strategy and develop sample activities or educational materials that can be used by these facilities to promote the Staphiscope.

Fun fact:
parts
We have deposited 151 new parts to  Registry , 135 of them being in pSB1C3 vector.
Our parts can be divided into several groups:
DNA binding domains: We deposited five new zinc fingers and DNA-binding protein TAL. Most of them are well characterised and supported by different experimental techniques. They are also prepared with an extension linker making them useful for any further modifications. Some variants also contain His tags for quick isolation and purification.
Split GFPs with overlapping amino acid extensions at the reassembly point are a useful tool for dimerisation and binding studies.
Chimeric biosynthetic enzymes: A principle of binding biosynthetic enzymes to our submitted DNA program with fused zinc finger domains have a potential for production of various different metabolites and increased speed/yield of reaction.
In vivo testing devices: Parts composing a device for testing in vivo binding of DNA binding proteins to their target sequences. 
Oscillator: Parts for composing oscillators that function both in pro- and eucaryotic cell systems. 
DNA program: We deposited several DNA programs used in DNA binding studies as well as in biosynthesis pathway experiments.
Favorite parts:
We selected a few most important and therefore favorite parts:
Biosynthetic device
We fused violacein producing enzymes to zinc fingers and successfully proven that they retain their function ( BBa_323132  and  BBa_323135 ). Furthermore after adding a DNA program ( BBa_323066 ) we demonstrate a 6-fold increase in violacein production and elimination of unwanted side products (see our Results ).
Device for testing binding of DNA binding proteins to their target sequences in vivo
To test whether binding of zinc fingers or TAL to a corresponding specific target DNA sequence occurs in vivo, we designed a device composed of several parts:
a synthetic promoter pSYN in which a DNA binding sequence, particular for each zinc finger to be tested, was inserted between -35 and -10 sites using BbsI restriction site(DTER_pSYN_BbsI, part BBa_K323088 )
lacZ reporter gene, which expression is controlled by pSYN
DNA binding protein (cut with XbaI/NotI) to be tested under arabinose inducible (pBAD) promoter in lacZ_DTER_pBAD_BsaI_DTER cut with BsaI"

At the beginning, initial plasmids are all bound with lacI tetramer and the system is in its 'LacI' state. After adding inducer IPTG at 40000s, concentration of tetR dimer increases and plasmids bound with lacI tetramer start to bind with tetR dimer and form complex of plasmids, lacI tetramer, and tetR dimer. At about 70000s, all plasmids bound with lacI tetramer are further bound with tetR dimer. At about 85000s, due to repression of expression of lacI, plasmids bound with LacI tetramer and tetR dimer both start to unbind to form plasmids bound with tetR dimer only and the system steps into its 'TetR' state gradually. Details of modeling is available here .

Modeling Details of Toggle Switch
Key points of this modeling are:
LacI protein tends to form LacI dimer, which tends to form LacI tetramer further.
Only LacI tetramer binds with pLacI gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
TetR protein only forms dimer.
Only tetR dimer binds with pTet gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
One IPTG molecule binds with one LacI tetramer to form complex IPTG:LacI4 and one aTc molecule binds with one tetR dimer to form complex aTc:TetR2.

OMVs
Background
Outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) are lipid vesicles commonly produced by Gram-negative bacteria, which are filled with periplasmic content and are 20-250 nm in diameters (Figure 1). The production of OMVs allows bacteria to interact with their environment, and OMVs have been found to mediate diverse functions, including promoting pathogenesis, and enabling bacterial delivery of nucleic acids and proteins. A recent paper by Kojima R et al. 2018, demonstrated an EXOtic device that can produce exosomes with specific nucleic acids cargo (Figure 2). We were impressed by the amazing OMVs and EXOtic device and came up with an idea to design a cell-free system to enable specific siRNA to be encapsulated into OMVs for cancer treatment.
Figure 2. The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria consists of two membranes, the outer membrane and the cytoplasmic membrane. Envelope stability comes from various crosslinks including the non-covalent interactions between the PG and the porin outer-membrane protein A (OmpA).
Figure 3. Schematic illustration of the EXOtic devices. Exosomes are nanoscale extracellular lipid bilayer vesicles of endocytic origin, and they are secreted by nearly all cell types in physiological and pathological conditions. Exosomes containing the RNA packaging device (CD63-L7Ae) and mRNA (e.g., nluc-C/Dbox) can efficiently deliver specific nucleic acids.
Abstract
Not only eukaryotes but also prokaryotes can produce nanoscale bubbles to fulfill diverse functions, such as cellular communication, surface modifications and the elimination of undesired components. Additionally, because of this functional versatility, OMVs have been explored as a platform for bioengineering applications. This year, we XMU-China decide to utilize OMVs as a cell-free platform to deliver our nucleic acids agents to facilitate therapeutic targeting of oncogenic KRAS in pancreatic cancer.
Figure 4. We utilize a split protein SpyTag/SpyCatcher (ST/SC) bioconjugation system to create a synthetic linkage between protein OmpA and archaeal ribosomal protein L7Ae. We fuse SpyTag with OmpA at its C-termini and N-termini respectively.

It was obvious that tryptophan productivity evolution indeed occurred with the increase productivity trend along the time course compared with the control group. From the wild type E. Coli BL21 (DE3) with nearly zero productivity, this sensor-based evolution approach successfully increase the productivity to about 3mg/L after only three rounds with totally irrationally knowledge-free fashion. Meanwhile, the control group without bitter defender part showed no growth during the three rounds of evolution, which gave strong proof that it was our constructed system which contributed to the evolution process.
However, the strains carrying mutation part showed no difference in final tryptophan titer than that of strains with naturally occurring mutation. According to the report of Leconte A. M.et. al [1] , in certain conditions, higher mutation rate contributed significantly to the final desired phenotype obtainment along the designed evolution process of biomolecule. However, for our whole-cell level evolution process, considering the inhibition caused by mutation to cell growth, it was possible that in our designed conditions the fitness of higher mutation was not such significant compared with inhibition in fitness. Thus, it was worthy considering resetting our evolution conditions to find the best ones for fast evolution derived by super mutator in the future work.
We further plated the evolved strains on agar plate, and picked 24 single colonies to culture in 24-well plate for 48h and detected tryptophan production by HPLC.
Figure 1 Tryptophan production of rbs30 evolved stains
Figure 2 Tryptophan production of rbs32 evolved stains
As shown in Fig.1 and Fig.2, each single colony has different productivity of tryptophan, as the evolved strains shown in Table 1 and Table 2 are mixed culture. Unfortunately, as the amount of the selected strains was only 24, in these two figures, we did not get the productivity as high as that of mixed culture. We finally found that evolved strain of rbs30-16 and rbs32-3 have the highest tryptophan productivity. We then selected these two strain, and confirmed there productivity comparing with the controls. The result were shown in figure 3.

NRP-UEA-Norwich,2014,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#Project GG-Cloning_-_-_TEXT.html," the project from previously synthesised level 0 modules. Specifically, the enzymes used are BsaI to assemble level 1 constructs from level zero parts and Bpi1 for assembly of level two constructs from level one constructs. The recognition sites for BsaI and BpiI are not palindromic and are therefore directional, being either convergent or divergent in orientation.
The recognition and cleavage sites of the Type IIS RENs utilised are as follows:
BpiI (BbsI) - GAAGACNN↓NNNN
BsaI - GGTCTCN↓NNNN
Where N is any nucleotide
The cleavage sites, which will remain in the assembly product and are usually 4bp in length, can be composed of any sequence (as shown above- N is any Nucleotide). These overhangs are often designed to be a section of the part itself, meaning that even the remaining cleavage sites leave no scar. The accuracy of ligation is dependent on the length of the overhangs; therefore 4bp overhangs are preferred. There is a risk of mis-ligation by similar overhangs and therefore it is ideal for the overhangs to be at least 50% different in order to efficiently assemble multiple fragments in one reaction. All the 4bp overhangs defined in the MoCLo assembly standard conform to this rule.
Figure 1: Level 0 parts consist of sequences with standard overhangs that have been cloned into a level 0 acceptor using the Type IIS REN BpiI. The level 0 acceptor has two inverted BpiI sites and two inverted BsaI sites. The BpiI sites are convergent on each insert and divergent on the level 0 acceptor, therefore will be removed by the process of cloning and will not exist in the assembled level 0 part. The result of the Golden Gate cloning reaction is a level 0 part that is flanked by inverted BsaI sites allowing release of the part using BsI in subsequent Golden Gate reactions.
Figure 2: Level 0 parts can be combined in a Golden Gate dig-lig reaction with the appropriate level one acceptor to create a level one construct that will usually consist of a complete transcriptional unit. The BsaI sites are convergent on each level 0 part and divergent on the level 1 acceptor, therefore will be removed by the process of cloning and will not exist in the assembled level 1 construct. The assembly product has no restriction sites for Bsa1 but"
