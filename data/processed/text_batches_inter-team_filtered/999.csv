SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," kinetic mechanism of reactions occurring on linkers. But this time, we have ignored it.
Future Work
In the future, we will go on optimizing the models. We will have further research about kinetic constants by reviewing literature or determination of experiment. In addition, we will add the factor of environment to the models and improve their rationality. We will also have further research about kinetic mechanism of linkers.

Sequencing
We sent the original plasmids for sequencing with primers YP0022 and YP0023, that bind to the respective promotors and primers to find out the sequence of the plasmid, as this was not given to us along with the plasmid. We hoped to find out what went wrong in the transformation process into yeast like this. Also we contacted a research group, who worked with this plasmid for sequences of primers, as we could not reach the group we originally obtained it from, and got YP0016b, YP0017b, YP0018b and YP0019b. With these we also sequenced.
Day 13
Results
The sequencing revealed that we did not have the plasmid we expected, as the primers did not bind. Our efforts to receive the right sequence of this plasmids somehow were unsuccessful. As we had no way to control, if what we were working with was the right thing and without mutations, we sadly could not use the synthetase in our work.
Test Expression
As we are still dealing with challenges of the previous step, we did not yet continue to this point.
Co-transformation
As our previous efforts did not produce usable results, we did not reach this point.
Test Expression
As our previous efforts did not produce usable results, we did not reach this point.

Photocaging - Targeting Tyrosine in Escherichia coli
Expression of subtilisin E in E. coli
Our aim here was to express the natural subtilisin E in E. coli and to determine the optimal conditions.
Building the expression system
Day 1
Our aim was to create a functional expression system for subtilisin E in Escherichia coli. At first, we had to optimize the sequence of the subtilisin E gene from Bacillus subtilis for Escherichia coli codon usage. For this purpose, our DNA sequence was improved with the DNA and protein sequence analysis tool ‘Geneious’ and the ‘Codon Optimization Tool’ from IDT. In the following, we proceeded to design the expression system digitally.
The expression system consists of commonly used BioBricks:

Yes, we know which proteins dimerize. We understand how proteins dimerize as well, by interaction of domains like leucine zippers and so forth. But why? What is the point of dimerization?
Previous researches have underlined the important advantages of dimerization, including differential regulation, specificity, facilitated proximity and so on. [citation needed] The influence of dimerization in noise propagation is hardly touched due to the difficulty in controlling experiment variables. Synthetic biology provides powerful tools to carry out experiments otherwise impossible in designed systems. This is exactly what we do.
Traditionally, we evaluate the impacts of noise using variance-related statistics, such as coefficient of variance. These quantities can only describe how concentrated the output is around the mean value, but cannot tell us how well we can infer one of the correlated random variables from the other. Channel capacity makes a better criteria of noise because it more scientifically depicts the information dissemination process."

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 
Colony-PCR using Alkaline PEG [1]
Preparation of alkaline PEG reagent:
Combine 60 g PEG 200 (Sigma-Aldrich or equivalent) with 0.93 mL 2 M KOH and 39 mL water. If desired, KOH can be substituted by NaOH in the reagent.
Note: PEG 200 is measured by mass rather than volume because of the viscosity of the liquid.
Adjust the pH to 13.3–13.5..
Note: Due to storage, some batches of PEG 200 have an acidic, rather than neutral pH. In this case, add an additional amount of alkali to reach the target pH range.
Execution of the Colony PCR:
Pick a bit of cell material of colony with a pipette tip and put it in a PCR tube with 50 µL of the reagent. Keep the pipette tip there during incubation time.
Lyse the samples by incubation them in the prepared PEG reagent for 3-15 min at room temperature.
Use 1-5 µL of the lysates as template in a 20-50 µL PCR reaction.
Note: The aliquot of the sample lysate should not exceed 10% of the final volume of a PCR mixture.
Colony-PCR with Heatshock [2]
Pick colonies from the transformed plates.
Streak one part on a masterplate.
Suspend the other part in 10 µL water.
Incubate the suspended sample at 90°C for 5-6 minutes.
Perform a PCR with primers that bind to the insert and with 1-5 µL of the lysate as template in a 20-50 µL PCR reaction.

Next was our turn. We prepared information booths to four topics: green biotechnology - the genetic manipulation of plants; red biotechnology - advances in medical fields through synthetic biology; white biotechnology - genetic engineering used in the bio industry and CrispR/Cas - a new technique in genetic engineering.
At each booth we arranged an informational video and a quiz about each topic to test our visitors’ knowledge about each topic.  After realizing that they often had no idea what products are already made by genetically modified organisms, people were shown everyday examples, such as detergents with enzymes, foods with added proteins and vitamins produced by microorganisms, to demonstrate the importance of synthetic biology in our everyday life. The spectators often weren’t aware and were surprised they had been using products of genetically engineered bacteria all along!
We also gave them several items for comparison, such as rennet cheese with microbial and natural produced enzymes, to let visitors decide which they liked best. Surprise: they liked both.
The green biotechnology booth introduced the people to the concept of Golden rice in comparison to normal rice.  For the red biotechnology booth we showed an exhibit of a pig pancreas and were able to explain that this had been used for insulin production a long time ago, whereas the production nowadays is a lot faster and less cruel. The visitors were relieved that a lot of animals don’t have to die anymore for medical advances.
In the end one question stood out: “Why do you think the society is afraid of genetic engineering and synthetic biology even though there are so many advantages?”
We realized this fear usually stems from the lack of knowledge about procedures, methods, laws and utilizations.  When given those information, a lot of sceptical people suddenly begin to understand the advantages of synthetic biology and start to abandon unrealistic fears.
March for Science Cologne
On the 22nd April of 2018 our team participated in the March for Science Germany in Cologne.  Every year hundreds of thousands of people worldwide demonstrate for free and not repressed scientific research as well as an evidence based policy. It is also used as a way to communicate with the public which has otherwise no or only little contact to natural science. This interaction is important though in order to create a positive picture of science in the public.
Our team met at the Domplatte in Cologne at 11am and together with the iGEM teams from Bielefeld, Bonn and Aachen as well as one thousand other participants we marched 2 kilometres (1.24 miles) downtown to the Rudolfsplatz. On the way there several interested people stopped and listened to our"

UNAM-Genomics_Mexico,2010,Team:UNAM-Genomics Mexico#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," since the Server has .ka indigestion, we changed the file extensions to .txt, idem for the perl scripts. These generate a data_final file, which we then imported into R and rendered into a perspective plot.
The blue and red receptors show the dramatic Pop production correlating with the photon input. The green receptor shows a toggle-switch activity, this is due to the photo-conversion phenomenon. The system will cease to produce PopS when struck by a contrary photon (far red in this case).
Blue Receptor
The kapppa code is here , and the perl runner is this one.
Green Receptor
The kapppa code is here , and the perl runner is this one.
Red Receptor
The kapppa code is here , and the perl runner is this one.
Emission
Our emission models reveal the following behavior, even with abysmal levels of PopS, the Photons/second output is massive. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to adjust the parameters for these graphics to generate the 3D plots.
Neural Network
In Training... Having over a million data to map, our Levenberg-Marquandt algorithm is taking longer than expected.
Conclusions
A model that says nothing is not very useful. However, our model has revealed some very interesting phenomena.
Photomultiplier
All our simulations, data, and intuition show that our system will behave as a photomultiplier. We are very excited at this, since this is the very first synthetic-organic photomultiplier device.
Construction Issue
Had we been able to get Cph8 working, we would have found that the OmpR-P concentration was saturating the available plasmid slots, even with the kinase knocked off it was always superior to 120 molecules per cell. This behavior was revealed by our model, so for the construction we would recommend a high-copy number plasmid.
Other Modeling Ideas
We also though of modeling a bio-cable. The object of this was to determine if our bacteria had the characteristics of a quaternary single-channel communication platform, or if it behaved instead as a 4 binary channels array. its use would be to use light to communicate one edge of the bio-cable by a single input, therefore have automatic transfer of light to the other extreme of it.
The Collaboration with the other UNAM team was along these tracks: modeling this behavior. However, due to a general lack of time, results are inconclusive...

During our project we had a great deal of work with different types of promoters - constitutive and inducible. During the planning of the project and the accumulation of knowledge about the various parts, we discovered that much information is lacking about many of these parameters, and the information that exists is scattered and is not arranged in one place. We chose two modulators - TDH3 [ BBa_K124002 ] of team iGEM08_Brown and PGK1 [ BBa_K2110012 ] of team  iGEM16_Tianjin, two strong constitutive permutative promoters, and improved their descriptions and the information about them, referring to the main sources we used. We hope that groups coming after us will have faster and more convenient access to information when they come to choose the parameters they want to use.
Improve an existing part
We chose to take the existing [ BBa_K1033121 ] part of miraculin made by team iGEM13_Uppsala and improve it by optimizing it for S. cerevisae and by adding the ADH1 promoter from [ BBa_K319005 ] of team iGEM10_uOttawa. Our new part is ADH1_Miraculin - [ BBa_K2408023 ].
The miraculin glycoprotein, originally produced from the Synsepalum dulcificum plant, is a non-cariogenic substance, with a glycemic index of zero. It is suitable for consumption by diabetics and has the ability to convert sour taste into sweet taste. However, miraculin does not change the taste of the foods / drinks consumed. The mechanism of action of this special protein is still not entirely clear, but it is known that it is triggered in the presence of a low pH. Miraculin is a glycoprotein made by plant cells, therefore a yeast like S. cerevisiae would make a better host for expression than bacteria. We optimized the codon of the part for expression in yeast. In addtion, we added few more features:
First, we added the ADH1 promoter at the beginning of the sequence. The ADH1 promoter is a strong constit"

The 10th of october, we were invited by Syngenta a biotechnology company that conducts genomic research. We met Mrs Lebas Marie-Cecile (Public Affairs Director) Mr Thevenot Xavier (Strategic Cooperation Director)  and Michel Petit (R&D Head).
The goal of this interview was to talk about our project in order to improve it.They were very interested in our project and gave us some tips, to present the project at the Giant jamboree in November. They help us to understand which part of our presentation needed to be clearly explain such as the R&D and safety part. We also re-think about the real interest for farmers to have a thermo-sensitive and autonomous system.
For future perspectives, we talked in a second part about how we can limit the regulation problems by transforming an organism and then induce a horizontal gene transfer to our chassis (directed mutagenesis).

Dialogue with winemakers
Integration of Softer Shock in the world of viticulture
This year, we wanted to be as close as possible of our customers the winemakers. This goal has been achieved ! We met winegrowers from France and  all over the world such as  Spain, Greece and Mexico that deals with climate disorders. The 13th of october we met the winemakers through an events called Pari Fermier at Paris. We had the possibility to discuss with 4 winemakers located in different places. We wanted to go further, have more information concerning the impact of climate changes in other countries.  We sent a survey to other iGEM teams as a collaboration and they spread it to winemakers in their area. If you want to have more details about a region just click on the maps and you will have all information concerning the climate changes, the techniques use but also their opinion on our project Softer Shock !

As a student majoring physics, it is hard for me to believe that I can participate in a biology project. Luckily, to my great surprise, these two areas are not so far apart. Modeling and analyzing skills of physics can also be used in biology, and dry project always means a lot of coding task, I can handle that, too. Of course, there is plenty of biology I need to learn, but with the help of our instructor and wet team members, I learn it fast.

Some transgenic lines have low expression of BKT and high expression of BHY while some strains have low expression of BHY but high expression of BKT and CrtI. All endogenous genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis have low or no expression in aSTARice endosperm. The production and accumulation of astaxanthin in aSTRice is determined by co-expression of PSY, CrtI, BHY and BKT.

Overview
We implement a basic diversity of initial binding proteins by creating a high-quality library consisting of over one hundred thousand Monobodies and over one hundred sixty thousand Nanobodies, respectively. Thereby we set up the foundation to build our system on and set a cornerstone for utilizing and generating libraries in iGEM.
We verified the functionality of our library by several approaches.
Assembly
We did not just show that our design and construction of our libraries was successful we also adapted the way to assemble them. Thus we established an unprecedented approach in this competition and provide future iGEM teams a great part collection to build their own libraries .

The world is facing a lot of challenges nowadays with the constant improvement and advances in the field of biology. These being questions about the ethic of some projects and furthermore the regulation of the reproduction of the same experiments, in the case of its success. This is why it is very important to consider all these political, social and ethical issues bonded to the scope and effect of the project. It is worth mentioning how there is a big debate about organ transplantation already since it first became possible in 1945 when the first kidney was successfully transplanted (HRSA). [4] With bioprinting a lot of new questions around patentability, affordability towards the different social strata, clinical safety and social acceptance arise and are to be discussed and dealt with.
One of the biggest security concerns around the use of 3D printed organs for transplantation is the tort liability of physicians, added to the intellectual property debate of 3D produced organs. Considering the fact that the transplantation of these organs needs still years of research of becoming a reality, the governments and regulation organisms are facing a great challenge in regulating the use and manufacture of 3D printed organs. To illustrate this problem, as an example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is in charge of regulating medical devices as artificial hearts. Meanwhile is Organ Donation regulated by other governmental agreements, like in the case of Illinois, the Anatomical gift act. [5]
Another important factor to consider and discuss is the patentability of such a printer, or in the given case of the printed products. This is where the question comes, whether or not a printed organ should be considered as artificial or normal organs.
Flp Recombinase - A stable but reversible genetic alteration
In our talks with medical doctors, pharmaceutical companies and the public one question always popped up: „Can you undo the genetic engineering after the synthetic organ is transplanted into a humans body?“
We thought about this tricky question and finally came up with the idea to modify the well established „T-REx“ system. The system is based on a FRT site encoded on a plasmid and another FRT site in the genome. By recombineering of these sites, catalysed by Flp recombinase, the plasmid is integrated. But more likely is the excision of an integrated plasmid. The Flp recombinase is encoded on a plasmid without any episomale replication origin. Therefore it is diltued in every cell divison. That‘s why loss of integrated plasmid gets more unlikely over"

Table 1 shows the calculated specific activities and RPU relative to the in vivo reference standard BBa_J23101 for the first set of measurements. This can be represented as the ratio of the specific activity of the SPL promoters to the specific activity of the reference standard BBa_J23101.
The second set of measurements involving constructs 1-4 within strain DH5α showed a greater variation in promoter strengths of the SPL compared to the first set. Again these strengths were mapped in relation to the reference promoters. The graph below illustrates the different promoter strengths obtained by plotting RFP over Biomass for the SPL and the reference promoters.
Figure 5 illustrates the variation in promoter strengths of the SPL mapped against the reference promoters. PM corresponds to BBa_J23101, PS corresponds to BBa_J23100 and PW corresponds to BBa_J23116.
The SPL and reference promoters can then be plotted, ranking them according to their specific activities. The graph below displays the rankings.
Figure 6 illustrates the specific activities of the SPL promoters ranked against the reference promoters.

Storage and Handling
You need to use live nematodes as soon as possible for maximum efficacy, because they have a limited shelf life. Be careful with storage conditions, though, because extreme temperatures may kill nematodes or render them ineffective.
Environmental Conditions
Nematode effectiveness against insect pests also depends on a number of environmental conditions. Adequate moisture is the most important -- nematodes need water to move and find host insects. If they become dry, they could die.
Results and Cost
Nematodes do their work under the soil surface, gardeners don't see dead insect bodies, making efficacy hard to measure. Improved plant health may take up to 30 days to occur. For stubborn infestations, it needs to repeat the applications, which can eventually result in increased costs over chemical controls.
Boric acid
It's one of the most effective ways to kill the insects. This natural insecticide shuts down their nervous system and dehydrates them. Spray or coat wood with boric acid. Place boric acid bait stations in your garden and/or at home. Check them regularly and replenish with boric acid.
Disadvantage
Boric acid can be useful as an insecticide, disinfectant, and flame retardant. It‘s fairly safe, but may not be very effective. It can be absorbed through and damage the mucous membranes; also harmful to the kidneys and liver.
OUR ADVANTAGES
In order to attract termites successfully, deliver the packed and carried by chemical agents. This novel way of insecticide delivery create an eco-friendly model to eliminate pests and can be directly applied to other pest control projects.
As our purpose is to control termites which do great harm to people' houses, we can bring the result of the project into production. The business outlook is considerably broad because our project is environmentally friendly and closely associated with people's daily life. Those who have suffered from termite invasion might accept the product easily for the dramatic insecticidal effect and non-ecological influence.
We take advantage of synthetic biology to improve the drug production, cut the industrial cost of the drug and even save the purification process, which will make it more convenient for utilization of the drugs. We offer not only a whole system for killing pests, but also a referable model that uses nano size chemicals to pack bacteria for biomedicine, food manufacturing and cosmetic industry.
FUTURE AND APPLICATION
Aiming at controlling and eliminating pests"

Neo-Protein Design
Among all kinds of hydrophobins, Class I hydrophobin inJanus (we name it from its insoluble property) from Grifola frondosa and Class II sJanus (we name it from its soluble property) from Trichoderma reesei are models of Class I and Class II respectively. However, it has been reported that bacterial hosts could not be used to produce functional Class I Janus, which causes great obstacles in broader applications of them.
Figure 5. The resource of our Janus
When expressed in E.coli, inJanus usually exist as inclusion body. And there are some possible reasons for this phenomenon: the expression is so fast that protein have no enough time to fold; there are many amino acids with S element, and the environment in E.coli goes against the formation of disulfide bond; lack of necessary enzyme and cofactors [1].
Thus, we made some directed mutations of inJanus, and make its expression in E.coli possible. Meanwhile, we do the same to sJanus. Though it could be expreesed in E.coli (the difference in solubility may lead to it), we would like to research on its difference. Then we made contact angle experiments to test their properties. Ultimately, our project is about four kinds of hydrophobins- inJanus, sJanus and their respective mutants: inJanus-m and sJanus-m.
Figure 6. We make some mutation of inJanus to make its expression in E.coli possible. We also do the same to sJanus to see its difference.

Super Protein Chip
Background
Protein chip is an emerging technology, which can be used to track the interactions of proteins and to determine their function. Nowadays they are playing a crucial role in various fields around the world, especially in clinical medicine. According to many researches, protein chip has already become a new method of the rapid detection of tumor markers, but it is still a difficult problem to solve the combination between the matrix and the probe, due to the biomolecule inactivation caused by ordinary substrate material.

Before starting the experiments with this chosen enzyme, a kinetics assay was first carried out. Spectrophotometric kinetic data based on decay of absorbance at 310 nm due to substrate nucleotide catalytic conversion was gathered using a range of starting substrate nucleotide concentrations. The Michaelis Menten curve for the CAT-Seq esterase was plotted using the acquired data. Data shown in figure 2, show perfect fit (R2 = 0.9449) to a standard Michaelis Menten curve. Next, Michaelis Menten plot transformations were performed in order to verify the Km and Vmax of the CAT-Seq enzyme. 3 Fig., display Lineweaver-Burk and Hanes-Woolf transformation plot. Both plots show great correlation (R2 > 0.7) to the linear function. Based on the equation koeficients in the Hanes-Woolf transformation, the experimentally determined Vmax value is 17.2 µM/min, Km value is 86 µM.
Figure 3. Two Michaelis Menten Curve transformations for CAT-Seq Esterase enzyme.
Lineweaver-Burk and Hanes-Woolf transformations for Michaelis Menten curve generated earlier. Both of the transformations were performed on data acquired from 3 independent experiments. Graphs show the fitted linear function and its correlation coefficient.
CAT-Seq library preparation employs PCR amplification for the addition of adapter sequences to 5’ and 3’ ends of DNA templates. 5’ adapters house T7 promoter and RBS (or any other regulatory sequence). Both adapters can be barcoded and include the restriction site, used to circulate the DNA.

Background
We wanted to use a bacteriocin to design a new form of toxic that, unlike general antibiotics, only kills specific pathogenes, thereby leaving our gut flora intact. The goal was to express the bacteriocin colicin Fy in E. coli. Colicin Fy is specific against Yersinia enterocolitica, a gut pathogen. We also wanted to include an on and off system with a silencing sRNA together with the Sensing system.
System design
Two different constructs were needed to get the Killing system working. First the secretion tag, USP45, with the bacteriocin, colicin Fy, coupled to it. Secondly, we need a silencing sRNA system for inhibition of colicin Fy production when not in proximity to Y. enterocolitica.
Result
We managed to prove the existance of the bacteriocin, colicin Fy on an SDS-page. By adding lysate that contains the colicin Fy to living Y. enterocolitica cultures we could show that it works for killing the actual pathogen as well.

Analysis: Cultures were removed from the incubtor and placed on ice to slow changes in cellular composition. 1 ml was extracted from each culture and a UV-vis absorption spectra of the culture was taken from 300-950 nm.   The optical density of the cultures at 600nm was used to normalize the absorption spectrum by division by this value.  Background subtraction of spectrophotometer data was performed in Origin 6.1 Software.  A ten-point baseline was created by a ""positive peak"" algorithm then modified to approximate the scattering curve that falls as the inverse fourth power of wavelength.
Results
Conclusion
This data indicates that pucB/A can be utilized as a reporter gene as the LH2 absorption bands at 800 and 850 nm are not present in the LH2 deficient mutant DBComega.  Furthermore, changes in the expression conditions of pucB/A are reflected on the absorption spectrum.  In this case, expression is higher when the genes are expressed from the puc promoter within genomic DNA than on plasmid pRKCBC3, despite the fact that pRKCBC3 is maintained at 4-5 copies in a cell.
Puc Promoter
The puc promoterpromotes transcription of the LH2 pucB/A genes naturally in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.  It is important that we are able to compare the transcription rate of the puc promoter in the natural system vs. our mutant system so that we can determine exactly how much efficiency is gained by adding a red light sensor.  The absorption spectra of a DBCOmega mutant (LH2"

Day 4:
The modelling team looked through KEGG to see the pathways that are affected by arabinose in the cell. Max continued looking at MATLAB to see how to set up equations. We also sent off our logo to Genescript for our t-shirts. Max kept updating the diary on the wiki. Ogaga made a miniprep and along with Sam, performed a ligation and transformation. Overnights were made with the E. coliincluding our AMP gene and untransformed supercompetent E. coli cells plated in preparation for our arabinose testing tomorrow. Charlie ordered primers for the Drug Delivery Proof experiment through IDT.
Day 5:
We had colonies from both E. colisubtypes and the arabinose test was carried out by Sam and Lamya. No transformed colonies were detected so another transformation was done by Ogaga which will be checked tomorrow. Max continued to look into MATLAB procedures to input our equations. Sam continued to work on the presentation, adding slides, compiling data and finding sources.
World Dundee Worlds Debating Championships 2011:
The team visited Dundee Worlds Debating Championships 2011. The presentation was finished and rehearsed  with Sam presenting. Videos and photographs were taken of both teams. Dundee supported the pros of synthetic biology while St Andrews supported the cons. The event was chaired by Frank Sargeant, and run in part by John Urch. After our presentations, there was an open floor discussion with questions directed towards our student panel. A variety of questions were asked - including whether there might be a cure for AIDS, cancer (through stem cell technology), patenting, and about synthetic biology having an adverse effect (such as soil erosion/desertification/etc.).
Week 7 - 22/08/11
Day 1:
Sarah arrived today and the team had their bi-weekly meeting. We ran a gel on the ligation to see the reason why the transformation failed, and found that the ligation itself had failed.  We have done PCR on our mini-prep backup DNA. Plates of super-competent E. coli were made as a control for the arabinose test to be redone on Wednesday.
Day 2:
The PCR failed as the tubes opened up twice, which caused one of the tube's DNA to evaporate, however the other tube was saved.  We decided not to carry out a digestion on"

METU-Ankara,2011,Team:METU-Ankara_-_-_TEXT.html," enhanced.
Except from this, we established a collaboration with METU-BIN Software iGEM 2011 team  on their software program. This year their project, M4B: Mining for BioBricks is on enhancement and simplification of parts registry and gene library usage to ease the wet lab researchers job. They requested us to use and try their software program. One of our parts in this year, kill switch is composite of this year distributions. By the way we tried their program to search and try on this composite. we gave them the following as feedback and also according to our comments on visual of program, we had collaborated this year.
“We are constructing a device that is induced by IPTG and that gives lysis enzymes and GFP as the outputs because, in order to elute methanol we need to kill our modified cells that convert ambient methane to methanol and the reason why we want GFP as one output is to be sure that it works. Our modelled device has promoter induced by IPTG, RBS, gene coding GFP and lysis cassette ending with cell death and we are glad to have it and it's working how we expected. So then, we use M4B to see that if it finds the exact device or the device that can do the same job. Since the software has only one place for output, we queried IPTG as an input and GFP as an output on the software and got corresponding 117 results. These results contain devices exactly what we have one for the same operation. However, we couldn't find the lysozyme output for the IPTG input in the software.”  
We had requested them to support us on wiki page design and same tricks on loading the links on wiki page. We had prepared the self evaluating lab safety questionnaire and they made them manipulable on wiki page  and the methane release meter on home page is their work.

NorthernBC,2016,Team:NorthernBC#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the solubility of metal hydroxides poses the problem of precipitating one heavy metal out of solution, and another back in due to their individual maximum precipitation pH’s (Akpor & Muchie, 2010).
      Phytoremediation includes phytodegradation, phytoextraction, hemofiltration, phytostabilization and phytovolatilization. Although these methods are generally the most economical, and low in technology costs, they all involve plant growth, which render disadvantages due to dependence on growth conditions, requirement of large-scale agricultural equipment, and knowledge, long remediation timelines and potential environmental harm due to leaching of soluble contaminants (Akpor & Muchie, 2010).
      Currently the most effective method of remediation is the use of chemical adsorbents, for example commercially activated carbon, which has a very high and restrictive cost associated with it; this makes it far from a globally attainable solution for copper removal (Bhatnagar & Sillanpaa, 2010). Therefore, our team has chosen to take the microbial remediation approach, which demonstrates advantages in environmental friendliness, cost effectiveness and self-sustainability. Our team is investigating methods of copper binding in order to contribute to the promising advancement of this remediation method. The current problems our team and other scientists face, which we hope to overcome, include possible and more persistent toxins than the parent microbe, as well as scaling bench top successes to a large industrial scale.

Delta 12 desaturase
In 2012 the St Andrews iGEM Team aimed to achieve a similar goal to our team, to produce a synthetic Omega-3 fatty acid. Their pathway included delta 12 desaturase, an enzyme we required in the conversion of oleic acid to linoleic acid. St Andrews had produced the delta 12 BioBrick and submitted this to the Registry – which provided an invaluable opportunity to use existing components from the Registry. Unfortunately when we requested this part from the iGEM Registry they were unable to send us this BioBrick as it would not transform, and after contacting the University they were also unable to provide us with this BioBrick.
As delta 12 desaturase is an essential enzyme in the production of our Palm oil substituents we therefore attempted to re-produce the delta 12 BioBrick submitted by St. Andrews with improvements such as codon optimisation for E. coli BL21 (DE3).
Creating this system in Algae
During our project planning we evaluated the prospect of genetically engineering algae, such as cyanobacteria in order to produce our fatty acid products. The advantages of this would include being able to use light as a source of energy, significantly reducing the expense of media required - in particular glucose. The gene sequences for delta 9 and delta 12 desaturases are also not-native in E. coli, so these were obtained from a cyanobacteria. Whilst the cyanobacteria is prokaryotic, there was potential risk for incorrect protein folding when expressing these genes in E. Coli.
Unfortunately because of the slow growth rate of cyanobacteria we were unable to use this as a chassis for production of our fatty acids. Further, as an iGEM requirement all BioBricks must function in E. coli - so we would potentially have to repeat our project in two different organisms in order to satisfy this criteria.
In the future we would like to see our system created in algae to derive the potential benefits discussed.

East_Chapel_Hill,2017,Team:East Chapel Hill#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," concentrations in samples of water taken from the wells, you used an Orion 4-star meter and fluoride ion selective electrode, with 1 ml TISAB III added per 10 ml sample just before analysis (APHA, 1998). What other methods of measuring fluoride / removing excess fluoride exist on the market? Are they easy to use? Are they viable for use in developing countries like Ghana?
A: Current products on the market such as the Orion 4-star meter which are designed to measure the concentration of fluoride are actually pretty easy to use as well as quite accurate - however they can be very expensive! The electrode itself is several hundred dollars and needs to be replaced each year, as well as requires some level of technical training to operate. Realistically, any filters/measuring devices currently on the market could never be implemented unless an organization paid for it. Finding a cheaper and easier way to identify the range of fluoride in drinking water is still a concern for many.
Q: The World Health Organization recommends a daily fluoride limit of 1.5 mg F− L−1, however your study recommends a dose of 0.6 mg F− per kg body weight per day as optimum for preventing severe dental fluorosis and maximizing dental caries protection by combining 0.05 mg F− per kg body weight per day from water (Institute of Medicine, 1997), and 0.01 mg F− per kg body weight per day from food (McClure, 1943). This is significantly lower than the recommended limit posed by WHO. Does the 0.6 mg/L just apply to younger children, or, in a perfect world, would you like to see this implemented for all ages?
A: It would be ideal if 0.6 mg F - per kg body weight per day was the limit for adults and children. However, the lower the limit the harder it is to reach that limit because it increases the cost of good filtration. That’s why I thought that having some sort of a compromise in which we focused this limit on vulnerable younger children (because developing teeth/bones are more prone to damage) would be more cost-effective. The flaw with this idea is that it may be difficult to have two standards - one for adults and one for children.
Q: In your study you do not address other health impacts of consuming excess fluoride, including reproductive and developmental changes, neurological effects, and impacts on the immune, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic and endocrine systems, and carcinogenicity (NRC, 2006; Ozsvath, 2009 and references therein)"

Uppsala-Sweden,2011,Team:Uppsala-Sweden#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"verter gave very little amount of colonies and cph8 failed again. It’s time to use another approach. We got one single colony on the transformation plates and we will screen that one, but if that colony is wrong will try to run a PCR using the standard VF2 and VR primers using the DNA in the kit as template. If there is any BioBrick plasmid in that well, we should get a PCR product. If this will not work out, we need to either synthesize the gene or to PCR up the gene from the Voigt plasmid pJT122. We will then need to clone it into a BioBrick plasmid and run site-directed mutagenesis on it to eliminate the illegal PstI restriction site. Since cph8 is an important part of our project we have to solve this dilemma.

XJTLU-CHINA,2015,Team:XJTLU-CHINA#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,", we found that they were also willing to search synthetic biology on internet and wanted to learn more about this novel field>
Provided definition: Synthetic biology is the design and construction of biological devices and systems for useful purposes. It is an area of biological research and technology that combines biology and engineering, thus often overlapping with bioengineering and biomedical engineering. It encompasses a variety of different approaches, methodologies, and disciplines with a focus on engineering biology and biotechnology.
Question 2
Which conventional industries will be replaced by synthetic biology?
你认为以下哪些传统产业会被合成生物学取代?
As we known, synthetic biology can be applied in many area and even replace some conventional industries. We asked Dr. Liu, a biologist in our university, for which area could be replaced by bio-synthesis. She made a list including agriculture, metallurgic industry, cottonocracy and oil industry. Hence, we asked people this question to find if they knew the application of synthetic biology. Result was that most of people considered that conventional industries such as agriculture, cottonocracy and oil industry may be replaced by bio-synthesis. Particularly, the majority of people chose oil because they know biofuels are being used. However, only a few people knew that synthetic biology could be applied in metallurgic industries as well.
Question 3
Have you ever heard about bio-safety before?
您在这份调查之前是否听说过生物安全？
Biosafety is an important issue in biological research as well as in human society. We wanted to find out if people knew about bio-safety and we hoped that they could pay attention to bio-safety after this survey. Result was that less than a half of people have heard about bio-safety before and over a half of people did not consider about safe problem. Therefore, we provided some information about biosafety after they answered this question; they could learn and start to think about bio-safe problem.
Provided information: Biosafety is the prevention of large-scale loss of biological integrity, focusing both on ecology and human health. These prevention mechanisms include conduction of regular reviews of the biosafety in laboratory settings, as well as strict guidelines to follow. Biosafety is used to protect us from harmful incidents. A complete understanding of experimental risks associated with synthetic biology is helping to enforce the knowledge and effectiveness of biosafety.
Question 4
Some people consider that modern biotechnologies including synthetic biotechnology may cause problem in safety of human society. do you agree or disagree?

My Colleagues
 
Overview Step1 Step2
Zejun YAN is an undergraduate Biologist in Edinburgh University. I am interested in Biology in general, and is going to specialize in biotechnology in my honour year 2008/2009. By working on iGEM 2008 project with the rest of our team, I have alreay gained a lot in different aspects of biology. Importantly, I have got the opportunities to apply the theories I have learnt in the past 3 years to the daily work in our lab. Meanwhile, the ten-week lab working really shows me the insight of the real biology in the lab, and gives me really good lab experiences. Finally, all members of iGEM team have built good friendship by working and helping with each other through the whole summer.
I am also interested in education in general. However, my main interest in education is about the difference in education system between China and UK. I have been thinking about this since I came to UK six years ago, and also writing down some thoughts. So far, my main concern about the education is that 'always study actively', which is the key to the success!I will continue my writing on the way to my success in academic biology study.  After undergraduate, I will continue my academic study for another 4 year or so, because the more actively I sutdy, the more I can get out of it!
My hobbies are football, travelling and cooking (Although I have not been cooking last year, Because my female flatmate did all the cooking for me). Cooking has become my interest since I lived alone six years ago!
I spent most of my time in the lab and gained a lot of experiences and skills, you will see me presenting the biological parts of our iGEM 08' summer project in MIT. I am so looking forward to seeing people from different countries in the world!

Nikolas Rakebrandt
My name is Nikolas Rakebrandt and I am currently in the first semester of the MSc ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"" program in Göttingen. Before my career as a scientist, I made a little detour and hold  a BSc in Business Administration and Economics from the University of Passau. After this, I acquired   my Biology BSc in Göttingen with a thesis about effector proteins of plant pathogenic fungi. I am   really looking forward to iGEM because it will be ""our"" project and we will be able to work and plan   on this autonomously. I think this will be very challenging and fun, not to mention that we will probably   learn a great deal!
When I am not busy with PCRs, cloning or studying I am very much into sports like football, surfing or basketball.  Also I like travelling whenever there is time (and money) or just being outside.

As a big fancier of genetics, microbiology and biochemistry, I recently started to study Microbiology and Biochemistry for a Masters degree at the Georg-August University of Göttingen. Last year, I aquired the academic degree of bachelor of science in biology at the Humboldt University of Berlin. During these studies I also specialized on the already mentioned fields. This year is the first I participate in iGEM and I'm really looking forward to work independently on our project and hope learn something and to meet new people.

Last year, I finished my Bachelor with an emphasis on molecular biology at the University of Göttingen. Next to the university courses I really enjoy to play tablesoccer in my freetime. I am a member of a club which competes with other teams in a german wide national league. This year, I joined the iGEM team to participate in an interesting competition as well as improve my lab skills. I am eager to organize and develop a project together with other students and just like to have a fun time with them. Hopefully, we are able to get to the jamboree in europe and meet lots of other students with worthwhile ideas and projects.

When we popularize the safety of synthetic biology and antimicrobial resistance, we recognized it not enough to hold activities only, so we focus more on the social media like writing reports on internet. At the beginning, we connected with the school journal. And then as the scale became lager, many famous media came to report us like Guangzhou Daily. Especially the reports about our exhibition in science center, was spread on many well known websites like Tencent, Baidu and so on.

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," 3: Proof of the introduction of the PAM sequence in our target DNA for the Cas12a assay. Limit of detection for our system.
We did a titration with different concentrations of mutated BRAF DNA fragment in plasma, in order to have an idea about the limit of detection of our Cas12a system coupled with PCR.
In the same experiment we wanted also to prove that we can effectively and precisely detect any given target sequence without the need of a nearby PAM sequence. To that end we amplified the first region of our mutated BRAF fragment                       (Figure 1) Titration results (agarose gel electrophoresis) are shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6. Titration results viewed on an agarose gel. BRAF mutated gene fragment (different concentrations before PCR shown) was used as template for the PCR amplification. Our negative control included treated plasma (addition                           of PBS) without any added DNA template.
The PCR was done successfully from plasma, with the correct size obtained for the amplicon. We can see that the minimum detectable concentration for PCR amplification directly in the blood was 10 aM in this experiment. The same PCR-amplified                       samples were then used as activators for the Cas12a detection assay (Figure 7).
Figure 7. Results of the Cas12a detection assay (average fluorescence; n=4 replicates after 250 minutes; bars represent the standard error here). The assay was performed using as template the amplified region 1 of BRAF mutated                           fragment PCR products. One crRNA used here (the complementary one). Please refer to Figure 1 in order to have an overview of the crRNAs/DNA fragments used for this experiment. Negative Control sample contained only plasma without any added DNA template.
Again here we have a good correlation between the concentration of activator and the level of activation of Cas12a, (although the 100 fM signal is above the 1 fM). This also means that the addition of the PAM sequence through PCR amplification                       worked correctly.
Finally, these results allow us to say that 1 fM of target DNA is the minimum detectable concentration for the Cas12a/PCR-from-plasma system in this experiment, since we couldn’t detect any signal in the attomolar range.
Result 4: Our system as a tool for single base pair polymorphisms’ detection
Here, we wanted to establish a proof of concept for the detection of a particular sequence contained in the same sample as another sequence differing only by an SNP site, in addition to the presence of"

He kept our workbench always clean and tidy and every reagent and culture in place. Thanks to him, we never had trouble finding the correct buffers and our cells were always incubated at the correct temperatures.
Ethics (Julian)
Julian organised the symposium and held the talk on the Ethics of Emerging Technologies. He was always calm and attentive, when everyone else was freaking out because of approaching deadlines or failed experiments and has been our last resort, when it came to time-critical jobs, which had to be done late in the evening or on weekends. He could more than compensate his slightly less comprehensive lab experience with his commitment and working morale.
Notebook (Heiko)
Heiko was a very strict and rigorous guardian over our notebook and was admittedly sometimes a real pain in the ass, when we were too slow in maintaining our online labbook or not abiding his sophisticated formatting rules for the physical one. It is solely his merit, that we probably have the most consistently formatted labbook of all iGEM teams. Hence, it is a real pity, that there is no special award for that.

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design-2_-_-_TEXT.html,"uchheim, 2015). We found a publication by Watson et al. (2008) where they used two incompatible lox sites for recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) (Watson et al., 2008). In their genome, two incompatible lox sites flanked a selectable marker. The same two lox sites flanked the gene of interest in the plasmid.
Using two incompatible lox sites allows the Cre recombinase to recombine only the sequence between the lox sites; we determined that this system may work to incorporate our genes of interest. Figure 4 shows how RMCE works with two incompatible lox sites in the context of our experiment. We will use BioBrick loxP (BBa_J61046) and lox71. To confirm that Cre-lox has worked, we will engineer the selectable marker ura3 between the lox sites in the genome, and grow the transformed strain on uracil-enriched 5-FOA media to ensure only transformed colonies are viable.
Since we were uncertain of the size of the gene insert we could reasonably incorporate using RMCE, we contacted the authors of the article, Dr. Adam Watson and Dr. Tony Carr of the University of Sussex. They informed us that we could insert our genes of interest with little difficulty, as they previously used RMCE to insert up to 16 kb fragments with no decrease in efficiency.
After much consideration, we decided to use both Cre-lox recombination and HR in parallel experiments to determine which method yields the most recombinants. We will use HR to incorporate the lox sites into the Y. lipolytica genome, and HR to integrate the progesterone pathway. In a parallel experiment, we will use Cre-lox recombination and RMCE to insert the genes into the Y. lipolytica genome. This will allow us to characterize the recombination rate of the lox sites to satisfy one of the iGEM bronze medal requirements, while keeping the HR technique as a contingency plan if Cre-lox recombination fails.
QUANTIFICATION of PROGESTERONE
Several quantification methods were evaluated based on their specificity, accuracy and time efficiency.  Each of these methods, additionally, require the purification of the products of the synthetic pathway from the yeast cells. We considered gas or liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry since they report concentrations of precursors and quantify our desired product. However, gas chromatography would require the derivatization of progesterone so it could be vaporized during the mobile phase.  We determined that we"

Minnesota,2014,Team:Minnesota_-_-_TEXT.html," Cities area including the 3M Science Day Fair for 3M employees and their families, UMN Biodiversity Fair, CSE Family Fun Fair, and the Middle School STEM Fair hosted by the Association of Multicultural Students at UMN. Finally, the team designed a Synthetic Biology Game Show that was presented on stage with 30 participants at the Minnesota State Fair to assess the general public’s knowledge of the subject and teach hundreds of passers-by in a way that was both engaging and interactive. Winners were rewarded with reusable bags, magnets, and gift cards donated by our sponsors. In the spirit of science, our curriculum has been ever evolving to constantly address salient topics and educational materials. The variable versions of our curriculum allow it to be flexible and practical in various settings.
Public Perception
Our team sought to inform the majority stakeholders in our community concerning the scope of our project. This year our team chose to have an exhibit catered towards adult residents at the Minnesota State Fair (the largest statewide annual gathering with over 1.8 million visitors each year) to learn how we can best design our technology to meet the needs and concerns of the people whose waters we hope to bioremediate. We delivered a short synopsis of our device, the synthetic biology involved, and safety precautions we have outlined for our project. We then presented visitors with a five question survey using a Likert Scale to gauge public perception of both our device, and the synthetic biology methods used. The survey was a huge success with over 320 participants. With such a diverse attendance, our survey captured a great cross-section of the Minnesota community that would be impacted by the implementation of our device. The results of our survey, illustrated below, informed how and where the public would be most comfortable with implementing our device, and illustrated the need for catered education addressing the public’s major concerns prior to applying our device in the environment. Our model for gauging public perception allowed for a wide, diverse crowd to be accessed. This model can be used upon request.
Intellectual Property
Members of our team attended three Intellectual Property Protection and patenting workshops that educated them on the process of commercialization of our invention. This allowed us to develop a comprehensive business plan and perform an economic analysis of the mining, fisheries, and governmental markets that could potentially benefit from the use of our invention. We presented our work and received feedback and advice from employees and scientists at both Cargill and 3M. We also worked in conjunction with the Office of Technology Commercialization to explore the patentability of our project, the novelty, the non obviousness, and utility of our product"

Of course, at this age my interests and hobbies are not limited to this, usually in addition to the attributes of the technical ladder house but also love a sport, more friends, usually the kind of love often joke to adjust the atmosphere of the people. Blizzard games such as Watch Vanguard (my staircase 3500 + oh) and basketball (school team) have always been my favorites. So I believe I can quickly integrate into a large group, contribute to the team and become true friends with you.

Cambridge,2011,Team:Cambridge#Society#interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," initially sceptical about the use of abstraction in biology, as her biochemistry training taught her that all biological systems are wonderfully complex. However, through iGEM she learnt that engineering principles allow a fresh, common sense approach to biology, and she also commented on the power of being able to take components out of systems in order to explore their properties and that being encouraged to ‘play around’ with genes is not only exciting but often a very useful thought process. Moreover, iGEM pushed Shuna to get to grips with modelling and to explore the use of computational tools in her research, which will undoubtedly be useful in the future.
When we asked Shuna about the open source nature of iGEM we unearthed a conflict. Shuna said that she loves the open source ethos of iGEM, the fact that her team made genes for bacterial pigments that are now widely available for anyone else to use is fantastic, she told us. However, she did say that if something profitable were to come from her PHD research, she would look into making money from it, and recognises that research in an open source world lacks that reinvestment of profits that commercialised research has.
Finally we asked about the impact of synthetic biology in the wider world. Shuna told us that she is most excited about what synthetic biology can do for medicine, mentioning the ease with which microorganisms can synthesise drugs like antibiotics which are otherwise require a complex and costly chemical synthesis.

Uppsala,2013,Team:Uppsala#zeaxanthin_-_-_TEXT.html,"a Anantis.
Methods:
For the characterization of zeaxanthin in E.coli DH5alpha we put together a standardized method for zeaxanthin extraction and measuring. Since zeaxanthin in its pure form is extremely expensive (~ 480 €/mg) we bought maize at our local supermarket and carried out liquid-liquid extractions using methanol and performed spectrophotometry measurements. We compared literature absorbance values of zeaxanthin to the peaks we obtained from our own measurements and continued our experiments until we believed to have an optimized extraction method.
Figure 1. Maize bought at our local supermarket that was grinded and later used to make a standardized zeaxanthin extraction method.
Figure 2. Extraction experiments carried out on grinded maize using methanol.
The operon acquired from Slovenia iGEM 2010 consists of the genes CrtE, CrtB, CrtI, CrtY and CrtZ  assembled with the inducible promoter pBAD/AraC.
Since we would eventually like to produce zeaxanthin in Lactobacillus in yoghurt it would be preferable to have a constitutive promoter, such as the CP-promoters in our promoter library. Parallel to the characterization of zeaxanthin in E.coli we therefore attempted to remove the pBAD/AraC promoter from the zeaxanthin operon.
Results:
Spectrophotometry
Production of zeaxanthin in E.coli DH5alpha was detected trough spectrophotometry measurements performed after liquid-liquid extractions using methanol. The resulting absorbance curve was compared to the standardized curve. In both graphs you can find the two peaks corresponding to zeaxanthin.
Figure 3. E.coli culture believed to have zeaxanthin production.
Figure 4. A liquid-liquid extraction was carried out on the E.coli culture containing the plasmid above. Methanol was used as an organic solvent.
Figure 5. Spectrophotometry of zeaxanthin extraction from maize resulted in the graph above. The two peaks are characteristic for zeaxanthin.
Figure 6. Spectrophotometry of an E.coli culture containing the plasmid with the zeaxanthin operon. The characteristic peaks of zeaxanthin are present, indicating that zeaxanthin was present in the sample.
Spectrophotometry measurements were also done on unmodified E.coli, as a negative control. These measurements did not result in the peaks that are characteristic for zeaxanthin.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," we can’t say in the North people are rich, or they are hygienic, or they are what. I don’t know is it culture?
Daniel C.:
So the toiletries are the main part why people get infected?
George:
It might be wrong to say that. Because correlating it with the toilet, I don’t think it comes directly proportional.
Daniel C.:
Or is it also the access to water?
George:
[No] access to water is poverty. So poverty is the thing. Access to water maybe, maybe not. But maybe hygiene. Water can be very far, but people can be hygienic. You can have water very close, but maybe you are not hygienic. So hygiene, if it’s promoted, the chlamydia cannot find space. Because we say even when you get chlamydia from this place, you take it to the city and it will not survive. [...] So that’s why we think that it’s just those places where there is less hygiene. Because when they move out those people, then the disease is not there.
Daniel C.:
Ok, then thank you so much for the interview George!
George:
If we would use [your] method to find chlamydia then we would know when we have to much chlamydia that it is rising. But now, since we are only using when the signs come up it is very difficult to have like incidents to know right there, right then.
Daniel C.:
Of course! Because sometimes people got chlamydia, got treated but still have signs left.
George:
Yes. So I think that method will help. If you do come to me I put a question about this STIs but it is not even on the list. People don’t even think about it.
Daniel C.:
Even not in Malawi? I mean in Malawi there is awareness of chlamydia or not?
George:
There is no.
Daniel C.:
There is no? People don’t know it?
Dominika:
We heard that there are educational programs in schools that are teaching about chlamydia and hygiene.
George:
That is about this where we are talking over the eyes. But the one [that is] transmitted by sexual what what is not viable. So it’s possible that people are having it in light numbers because there is no method of testing. The one we test, I donˋt think passes even through sexual intercourse, it passes through this hygiene things and then we test checking the eyes. This other type of chlamydia,"

Keep the rest of your solution in the small beaker for cheaking the solidification of your separation gel.
After the separation gel is solidified, the isopropanol should be discarded. Then  clean the glass plates with water and discard the warter afterwards.
Prepare the stacking gel in a separate small beaker according to the protocol above.
Note: Ammonium Persulfate and TEMED should be added at last, because TEMED will solidify the solution very fast. And be noticed that TEMED smells very bad, so use it fast and close the bottle rapidly.
Put the comb into the stacking gel.
Let the stacking gel solidifying by following the same procedure from the protocol above.
Note: Make sure a complete gelation of the stacking gel and take out the comb.
Running Setup
Take the glass plates out of the casting frame and set them in the cell buffer dam.
Pour the running buffer (electrophoresis buffer) into the inner chamber and keep pouring after overflow untill the buffer surface reaches the required level in the outer chamber.
Prepare the samples:
Mix your samples with sample buffer (loading buffer).
Heat them in boiling water for 5-10 min.
Loading Samples and Runing the Gel
Load prepared samples slowly into wells and make sure not to overflow. Don't forget loading protein marker (ladder).
Then cover the top and connect the anodes.
Set an appropriate volt and run the electrophoresis when everything's done.
Note: As for the total running time, stop SDS-PAGE running when the downmost sign of the protein marker (if no visible sign, inquire the manufacturer) almost reaches the foot line of the glass plate. Generally, about 1 hour for a 120V voltage and a 12% separating gel. For a separating gel posessing higher percentage of acylamide, the time will be longer.
Preparing gel after running
Take out the sealed glass plates carefully.
Clean the casting frame and used devices.
Put the used running buffer into the used running buffer beaker for further usage.
SDS gel staining-destaining procedure
Fix the gel with destaining solution for 10 min.

Genspace,2015,Team:Genspace#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," that attenuates to negative control levels after approximately 5 hours, consistent with being on the low-end of the AHL scale.  In                         contrast, the 1nM and 10nM concentrations of AHL result in dramatic increases in activity.  The onset of activity increase for 1nM appears to be slightly delayed compared to 10nM, which could be related to the effective diffusion                         delay of AHL through the outer membrane pores.  However, after 3 hours, the activity for 1nM is commensurate with 10nM and eventually is greater beyond hour 8.  This is due to an intrinsic difference in behavior as a function                         of AHL concentration that is explored next.
The number of Beta-Galactosidase molecules at each hour is estimated by multiplying the Miller Units (a reasonable proxy for the number of Beta-Galactosidase molecules per cell as noted by Garcia et al., 2011) by the OD600 value scaled by 8x10 8.  Using a three-sample moving average to ride out statistical fluctuations in each time series, we find the results shown below.
 
Figure 3: Beta-Gal Molecules versus Hour
This plot shows that the concentration of 1nM AHL results in the highest yield of Beta-Galactosidase, almost a factor of four times greater than the negative control.  These results are of interest in a variety of applications where the total yield of a synthesized product must be either maximized or set to a target value (often subject to a variety of other constraints).  Further consideration of this type of phenomena is considered in the figures below.
Figure 4: Beta-Gal Molecules & Companion OD600 versus Hour
The yield curves in these concentrations under study have a number of features in common.  The yield over the first three hours increases at the lowest rate (r1).  After three hours, the rate often increases (r2>r1) until a plateau is reached (P).  These three parameters (r1, r2 and P) are sufficient to classify the observed yield curves.  In the case of the positive and negative controls – as well as the 0.1nM concentration – the plateau is reached about an hour after entering stationary phase.  This may also be true for the 10nM concentration as 14 hours of data capture was barely sufficient to reach stationary phase.  However it is noteworthy that the 1nM concentration appears to have reached its plateau of terminal"

TG Model 5
We do realize there's an option to knock-out a gene, and then perform the analysis, but this approached yielded easier-to-interpret results (in our humble opinion). We kept the Objective Function (OF) of the old data since it made sense. After running all the models, we realized that our OF was maximized for the Main Transgenic Model.
Parsing v4
Since our pathway was adding a novel metabolite, we hypothesized the transgenic pathway might represent an Extreme Pathway (you know, the regular hardcore, skydiver, shark-wrestler, wompa-tamer, lightsaber-juggler kinda of pathway...). For all the nasty details, go here . Anyhow, getting the data into the format acceptable by ExPa required another round of parsing, and another script .
Visualizing
In all this, we have been looking for a decent way to present our findings. However, the full network for the whole metabolome is just to massive to represent in a visually meaningful way:
We've tried Arcadia , but we get strange errors (apparently, libSBML errors, again). We've tried Cytoscape , but again the network is just so massive it is impossible to work with (in our humble personal computers that is). We tried the Edinburgh Pathway Editor , but it was not that functional to our problem as the Import Options were non-existant. We also tried SBMM but got the weird ""HTTP Status 500"" error. Therefore, we opted for two approaches : fraction our data into modules, sorted by ""sub-compartment"" (i.e. metabolic classification); and work with only the reactions changing between WildType and TransGenic strains.
A note on the Edinburgh Pathway Editor, while it is extremely unstable and crashes more often than BethSoft's Third Scroll (beware and abuse the Save option), it is functional enough to create pathways and illustrations. The main image at the Introduction Section was created using said Editor.
The Results
So, what have we learnt form all this parsing around? Well:
Under symbiont form, our transgenic chassis is capable of Hydrogen production?
Flow through the Hydrogen output reaction is maximal for our TG model, therefore it does produce Hydrogen.
To what extent does the Hydrogen production affect core metabolism, and Nitrogen fixation?
Nitrogen fixation is increased to 150%, we believe we are detoxifing the chassis from redox potentials (see note below).
Carbon intake is increased to 130%, we believe our system require more energy to compensate redox export ("

iGem Safety Rules
    For iGEM 2010 teams are asked to detail how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects. Specifically, teams should consider the following questions:
      1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
      2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?             If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry? how did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams learn from your experience?
      3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?             If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project? If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
      4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?

FAU_Erlangen,2016,Team:FAU Erlangen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", we have shown that fluorescent proteins like GFP can work as photosensitizers on solar cells. However, the quantum yields of those fluorescent-protein-sensitized solar cells were not higher compared to those of normal DSSCs, where a dye in hibiscus tea is used to absorb light. One possible reason is that the absorption maximum of this tea is at about 517 nm. This wavelength belongs to the part of the spectrum most prominent in sunlight. That means that the spectrum of sunlight and the absorption spectrum of hibiscus tea have a high overlap. GFP absorbs at 400 nm, where the intensity of sunlight is not as high anymore, leading to lower quantum yields.
However, GFP is a fluorescent protein, which means that it not only absorbs, but also emits light. The emission maximum of GFP is at 510 nm and therefore very close to the absorption maximum of the tea. We hypothesized that combining both fluorescent protein and tea in one solar cell would allow the emission of the protein to excite the dye again and thus lead to higher quantum yields than either would achieve individually.
By examining this issue further, we have observed that when the tea dye binds zinc oxide on the solar cell, its electronic structure changes slightly and its absorption spectrum shifts to 597 nm, which is yellow light. Since GFP emits green light, the overlap is not as high as expected. The solution to this might be the use of the red fluorescent protein, mCherry, in combination with tea to achieve the highest quantum yields.
Results
For the first solar cell tests, the influence of biofilms was tested for both TiO2 and ZnO. The results are shown below:
Figure 1: Comparison of different solar cells with and without biofilm. Photosensitizer = hibiscus tea. All cells have been sintered after the addition of TiO2/ZnO nanoparticles.
As can be seen, biofilms greatly increased both current and voltage. In the case of TiO2, the biofilms were three times as effective as the TiO2 layer without biofilm. For ZnO, an improvement of 70% was reached. The reason is that the application of biofilms as bottom layer can improve the adhesion of the oxide layers to the surface. Additionally, the restructuring of the surface by the biofilm layer increases the overall area of the solar cell.
It should be noted that the current for solar cells without biofilm could be increased up to the level of those with biofilm by adding an excess of TiO2. In other words, the biofilm solar cells require less"

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," opted for an application which is relevant for people all across the globe, as Staphylococcus aureus is everywhere (4) . To fairly distribute the risks, Gelcatraz as a platform and the resulting wound plaster must be extensively tested in the Netherlands before making it available to other countries. That will ensure that (clinical) tests are performed in a setting with all the required safety precautions. Once Gelcatraz is considered safe to use, it can be adopted by anyone with access to a laboratory with standard equipment. As no special equipment is required for the safe use of Gelcatraz, scientists with all budgets may benefit from its use. As discussed above, patients will globally benefit from lysostaphin secretion and its integration in a wound healing plaster.
Although the main benefits of our design will be enjoyed by a certain group of patients, the entire (Dutch) society and even world will benefit from reduced antibiotics resistance. Escape of bacteria, although unlikely, would mainly affect patients and their surroundings. The effects would however be minimal thanks to the several layers of security (weakened, benign bacterial strain unable of survival outside of the hydrogel). From the safety analysis performed for the safe-by-design challenge,  it can be concluded that people exposed to our platform for their jobs (e.g. medical doctors, nurses, people working in waste processing or manufacturing) will not suffer from this.
Conclusions
In this ethical analysis, we reflected on our Gelcatraz design with respect to five values: public beneficence, responsible stewardship, intellectual freedom and responsibility, democratic deliberation and justice & fairness. We conclude that our product benefits individuals as well as society, and that its benefits and burdens are well-distributed.  We identified some issues that need to be addressed, such as the use of Gelcatraz by amateurs and the yet unidentified risks introduced by synthetic biochemistries. However, we believe that these risks are mostly covered by the several safety levels we integrated in the design.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#Selection#Motivation_-_-_TEXT.html," should therefore restore the functional reporter protein. As afore mentioned we   chose beta-lactamase as a reporter, as it allows the application of selective pressure. Both, the Evobody and the target protein are fused to a different    half of the split-beta-lactamase. In case of a successful binding Evobody the bacterium in concern should be granted an ampicillin resistance due to a restored and    functional beta-lactamase ( Galarneau et al. 2002 ).
The TAT-hitchhiker selection works on a similar premise as the split-protein. Yet, in this case the beta-lactamase is not divided into two subunits    but instead its natural export signals are removed. this modified beta-lactamase forms a translational unit with the target protein whilst a signal peptide    for the Tat (Twin-Arginine Translocation) pathway is attached to the Evobody. Only in case of a funtionally binding Evobody to the target protein is the    beta-lactamase exported into the periplasm where it can counteract the ampicillin. Since the Tat pathway only exports correctly folded proteins, this approach also    provides an option to check if the proteins are expressed as we predicted ( Waraho, Dujduan & DeLisa, Matthew P. 2009 ).
In summary, we wanted a selection system to screen for Evobodies with high affinity to the target protein while being functional in vivo. We chose three approaches, of which the bacterial two-hybrid system proved to be the most promising system .

Consulting Experts : To view our project in a more comprehensive way, we consulted professors not only in the department of Biology, but other departments such as Resource and Environment and gained valuable suggestions and profound insight.
Interviewing Workers : On top of discussing with experts, we also interviewed some employees in related industries to collect the opinions from enterprises. We think that while experimental work plays a vital role, the real situation of the industry should also be valued, which is also quite helpful for improving ourselves.
Engagement : As a team paying attention to the social effect caused by our project, we never forget to take the public opinions into consideration. By distributing questionnaire and making short video on fundamental biology, we tried to make more people know about us, and we also have our own platform (ECUSTLab) to publish related articles and collect public suggestions.
Gold
3+ net : Thought teams under the environment track focus on different issues, we are all faced with the limited application scenarios and public concerns, which pose barriers for the practical use of projects. The concept of “3+ net” (Applications+, Society+ and Biosafety+) and related guidelines will be helpful for all teams to improve projects accordingly.
Economic benefit : One of the most important problems caused by biofilm and rust in cooling water loop was the exceedingly high usage of water, chemical and energy. So we kept improving our project based on the principle of “spend less, get more”, since it is not our ultimate goal to create something, but to make it truly useful for the society, the economy, and the people.
Responsibility : By analyzing the data acquired from the questionnaire carefully and holding meetings regularly, we discussed the public opinions thoroughly and often had self-reflective thoughts on the project and its social impact. Synthetic biology is a powerful weapon, which should always be used properly and with responsibility.

Also a lot more maths and a lot more of learning maths to model the electrochemistry.  Human Practices: We could not meet Prof. Sternberg. We designed a new survey more focused on the ethics for tomorrow.  At 5pm meeting with Rodrigo.
Friday
A relatively sunny day. Wet Lab: The plate reader experiment from yesterday (Oxidation of Pyo over time, in solution with FCN(R) and sodium sulfite) shows no effect of ferrocyanide on pycyanin.   For the Oxford collaboration, we received the gblocks and we are going to miniprep them next week. In the meantime, Joe Windo received them a couple of days ago. Why ? Alberto made a new spotting plate but this time with Pyocyanin. Diellza ran the PCR to add the ssRA tag to C1A. Tomorrow we know if it works. Shivang did some PCRs for the Valencia collaboration but they did not work. Josh, Diellza and Alberto prepared new redox molecules solutions, to completely replicate the electrochemistry of the Nature paper. Human Practices: Thomas and Alberto went to the Science Museum to survey people. The hypothesis is that there is a correlation between background knowledge on biotechnology and its acceptance. Tom suggests that we should change the survey to be more focused and integrated into PixCell. Siwat incorporated all the feedbacks from KUS iGEM team into the science communication framework. He is also contacting the Debate Society and looking for speakers. Wiki: Yutong is trying to finish the Lab Overview and Attribution Page.  Dry Lab: schematic of the PCB is finished, we just need to check with Paschal. We have decided to change the TX/TL model from SoxR dbeing dependedn of the percentage of oxidised of Pyocyanin to SOxR being dependend on the concentration of Pyocyanin  in whatever state and assuming full oxidisation. Luis made agar salt bridges. At 5 pm meeting with Tom.
