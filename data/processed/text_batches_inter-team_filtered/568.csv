Mingdao,2016,Team:Mingdao#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," with the forward primer (VF2) and the reverse primer (VR). Therefore, we used the AOX2 gene in the following experiments to test the gene expression, enzyme activity and electrochemical properties with the substrate of alcohol.
Figure 7: The alignment of the sequencing data and AOX1 gene in a reverse view. One T mutation is present at 1926 bp (i.e., 349 bp from the ATG start site in a forward view)
The AOX gene was successfully synthesized by IDT and cloned onto pSB1C3 with a fusion protein of Lpp-OmpA (LO) which is driven by a constitutive promoter and RBS. In the following experiments to prove the concept, we tested the gene expression system by a reporter gene (GFP) and analyzed AOX gene expression by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Furthermore, we examined AOX enzyme activity by H2O2 assay, a product generated in the process of the oxidation of alcohol catalyzed by AOX. Finally, we designed a prototype to demonstrate the application of AOX enzyme on the alcohol meter in an electrochemical simulator.
The AOX gene were cloned onto pSB1C3 driven by a constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23101 ) and RBS ( BBa_B0034 ) and fused with bacterial outer membrane proteins, Lpp-OmpA (LO) to display protein on the cell surface of E. coli. To test whether the gene expression system works, we cloned a reporter gene (GFP) in the same context (i.e., Pcons-RBS-LO-GFP/pSB1C3). And the gene expression level was compared to Pcons-RBS-GFP/pSB1C3 ( BBa_K1694035 ) got from NCTU-Formosa, which has the same promoter and RBS but without LO. The clones of E. coli DH5α were cultured in LB media supplemented with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37°C overnight. Because overnight cultured LB medium has a background level of fluorescence, the bacterial GFP was measured in the PBS buffer ( Enzyme Microb Technol. 2001 ). As Figure 1 showed, the GFP expression was extremely high in E. coli. LO-GFP fusion protein expression was observed at low but significant level compared to wild-type E. coli or E. coli expressing LO outer membrane proteins.

This summer was a rollercoaster. High ups, deep downs, tons of adrenaline, ending in a lot of love. We started as complete strangers, and yet we feel like family after these 5 months. iGEM was our life this summer, and we saw each other every day. Of course it was important not only to sit behind a laptop, or be in the lab and therefore we did lots of other things you can find on the Public Engagement & Education page for example, or the Collaborations page. Whereas these were amazing experiences, the memories we treasure most are the ones on this page. The first time we met, the crazy night at the farm or the emotional DISC workshop. The project ends, but the group activities will not, and we will remember the first bucket night when we will join each others weddings in the future!
First date!
When the team was announced, nobody knew each other except by name and phone number. To tackle this the team met to have for dinner at a mexican restaurant. Here, over a few drinks and side-dishes, the team got to know each other and make their first impressions. Apart from the drinks, someone ordered a bucket-sized cocktail that would become a running joke throughout the project.
DISC Workshop!
On the 13th of May, we organized a DISC workshop to find out the personalities of everyone in the team. Next to that, everyone had to fill in a questionnaire about themselves. This way we learned that Jens sports the most, Ingeborg wakes most early and Noa eats Chinese for breakfast. The DISC workshop was a way to see who was more introverted and who more extroverted, and we found there were not a lot of extroverted people in the group. Next to that we found that the people in"

Introduction
In this essay I will address the question of whether Edinburgh’s drug purity biosensor is morally wrong because it promotes drug use. First, a clarification of the question will be made, in which I will suggest it should be reformulated as asking if the implementation of the biosensor is morally wrong. Next, I will introduce Utilitarianism as the criteria for moral deliberation, subsequently arguing that the biosensor will have positive consequences for certain demographics, and negative consequences for others. However, I will conclude that, relative to the Utilitarian Principle, the implementation of the biosensor is morally good.
Section 1: Utilitarianism as the Moral Standard
When determining the answer to the question ‘is an object x morally wrong because it condones y’, what we are interested in is not whether an object x is bad, for objects in-and-of-themselves are not up for moral evaluation. Rather, what we are asking is whether an action associated with some object x is morally wrong. For example, when someone commits murder with a gun, it is not the gun itself but the act of unjustly shooting it that is considered immoral. For the very same weapon could be used in another situation without moral objection, such as stopping a heinous crime. Thus, when deliberating the moral status of a drug purity biosensor, what we really want to know is whether its implementation in society is morally wrong.
Now that we have reinterpreted the question, we need a criteria for right and wrongness. In normative ethical theory, this criteria is conventionally understood as an action-guiding moral principle; in other words, a principle that can take an action x as an input and judge whether it is right or wrong, and thus, whether it should be performed. Different normative theories take different action-guiding principles as their criteria for morality, and a few of the most common - stated in their most basic forms - include: Deontology"

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Protocol
Part 1: TSS Buffer
To make 50 mL:
5g PEG 8000
1.5 mL 1M MgCl2 (or 0.30g MgCl2*6H20)
2.5 mL DMSO
Add LB to 50 mL
Filter sterilize (0.22 μm filter)
Part 2: Making Chemically Competent Cells
Grow a 5ml overnight culture of cells in LB media. In the morning, dilute this culture back into 25-50ml of fresh LB media in a 200ml conical flask. You should aim to dilute the overnight culture by at least 1/100.
Grow the diluted culture to an OD600 of 0.2 - 0.5. (You will get a very small pellet if you grow 25ml to OD600 0.2)
Put eppendorf tubes on ice now so that they are cold when cells are aliquoted into them later. If your culture is X ml, you will need X tubes. At this point you should also make sure that your TSS is being chilled (it should be stored at 4 fresh then put it in an ice bath).
Split the culture into two 50ml falcon tubes and incubate on ice for 10 min. All subsequent steps should be carried out at 4 wherever possible
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm and 4
Remove supernatant. The cell pellets should be sufficiently solid that you can just pour off the supernatant if you are careful. Pipette out any remaining media.

An often criticized aspect of parallelized microfluidic systems is how the tubing to feed the devices becomes increasingly complex with the numerical increase in parallel processes. To address this, we opted to build a reservoir system that feeds the inlets simultaneously. Using our design, we only need an inlet for each fluid, and an outlet for the droplets, decreasing the amount of tubing three-fold.
An important design consideration is having similar pressure drops and velocities at each of the outlets, in order to assure that mass-flow is uniform at each of the chip inlets. Using the software, COMSOL Multiphysics, we built a model to simulate the filling of the reservoirs. This  was done to have a more informed decision as to where the reservoir inlets and outlets should be located. You can learn more about our flow model here.
Figure 7. Fluid Velocity as a Function of Radial Position
The results of the model showed that the pressure and velocity values were similar enough to build the reservoirs using the layout we had designed.
To build our feed reservoirs, we decided to use sheets of transparent acrylic. A layer with the reservoir and a layer with the inlets was cut. The dimensions of these pieces were 7x7x0.5 centimeters. Applying a small amount of acetone onto the one of the bonding surfaces, and pressing and holding the surfaces together allowed the pieces to bond. Using a two-part epoxy resin, we were able to bond our N-333 Nanoport Assemblies to the reservoir inlets, to get a tight seal between the tubing.
To assemble the entire device, we plasma bonded a 30mL sheet of cured Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Sylgard 184), at a 1.5:10 curing agent to monomer ratio, to the glass chip. Holes with a 2mm diameter were punched into the PDMS, corresponding to where all of the channel inlets were located. A very small amount of precured PDMS at the previous composition of 1.5:10, was applied to the bonding faces of the reservoir, and positioned onto the PDMS sheet. This assembly was cured at 80 degrees Celsius for 4 hours on a hot"

<contacts> <dist> <distName>Qatar</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Qatar signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 4 December 1997, ratified on 13 October 1998, and the treaty entered into force on 1 April 1999. Qatar has taken no national legal measures to implement the treaty. In May 2003, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Qatar told Landmine Monitor, “There was no immediate need to formulate legislation because Qatar has not had any landmine problems and does not use landmines.”
Qatar was a full participant in the Ottawa Process and one of the few nations in the Middle East to sign the treaty in 1997. Qatar has voted in favor every annual pro-ban UN General Assembly resolution since 1996.
Qatar maintains that it has never produced or transferred antipersonnel mines. At the Fifth Meeting of States Parties in September 2003, Qatar reiterated that it has never used, produced, or exported antipersonnel mines, and that it has no stockpile of live mines. Qatar did not declare any stockpiles of antipersonnel mines in its Article 7 reports. Qatari military officers have told Landmine Monitor that Qatar possesses a small stockpile of dummy antipersonnel mines (without fuses or detonators) for training purposes.
Qatar is not mine-affected. It is not known to have contributed to any international mine action programs since 1999, although representatives did express an interest at the September 2003 Fifth Meeting of States Parties in supporting a victim assistance program. In 1999, Qatar donated $200,000 to the (Slovenia) International Trust Fund for mine action in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Sampling of expressed proteins
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was to take a 5 ml sample of the cell suspension 20h after expression induction.
Operational sequence:
At first, the OD600 was measured (1/10 dilution) and determined as 4,0. Afterwards, 5 ml of the cell suspension were taken out and pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 4°C and 1500xg. The pellet was washed with 500µl of sterile water, followed by a second centrifugation step. The pellet was then stored at -80°C until cell lysis.
Cell lysis of stored pellets and SDS page
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was to isolate the protein crude extract out of the stored cell pellet.  Afterwards, we wanted to separate the proteins by SDS gel electrophoresis.
Operational sequence:
At first, we resuspended the frozen cell pellet in the adequate volume of breaking buffer (containing 1mM PMSF) to get an OD of 50.
CaDXMT1 (15 min after induction of expression): 42 µl breaking buffer (OD600: 0,42)

For this assemble strategy we also used Weber et.al (2011) fusion sites and as its shown below, every frame has different versions of sites, which are part of the Cas9 protein sequence and are going to be kept after the insertions's assembly. We designed two dCas9 version A protein insertions which can be found as BioBricks BBa_K1903020 and BBa_K1903021 and two dCas9 version B insertions: BBa_K1903022 and BBa_K1903023 . Using these BioBricks sequences as a temple, new protein insertions can be designed for assembling version A and B dCas9.
2. Golden Gate Adaptor
We design a Golden Gate Adapter as the Biobrick BBa_K1903003 , enabling iGEMS's standard assembly plasmid to be a Golden Gate assembly vector. This part is composed of the prefix lacking the XbaI however instead there’s a BsaI fusion site follow by the BsaI recognition sequence, a 100 random nucleotides spacer and finally the suffix having also a BsaI fusion site. Digesting this BioBrick with EcoRI and PstI and ligating it to the plasmid, would make any standard assembly vector adaptable to Golden Gate upon the reaction takes place. The BsaI fusion site is inverted and only when the Golden Gate reaction is made the XbaI site will apear having a normal prefix for the part.
3.PAMmer
For the PAMmer design we follow O’Connell et al (2014) findings:
PAMmer must be a short deoxyribonucleotide single stranded sequence.
PAMmer need a 19 nucleotide extension downstream the base paring region of the RNA target.
PAMmer should have an 2 to 8 nucleotide extension upstream the NGG to gain binding specificity, however it shouldn’t be to long to avoid losing binding affinity.
PAM region in the PAMmer must not be the same as in the gene to avoid gene silencing.
4. sgRNA
To design the sgRNA we used a two steps strategy to create the sequence. First we searched the sequence for the sgRNA for Streptococcus pyogenes already modified as a chimeric sgRNA just with the variable base-paring region; we used the sequence detailed in"

Team Toxipop did extensive research in April and May once our project was decided.  Our research extended throughout the summer as different problems and ideas presented themselves.  The following papers guided us throughout the process.  They include information about the Cell Lysis Cassette and the individual genes that make up the composite part.  We also looked into previous water toxin detection systems.  This included looking at current products on the market as well as scientific literature that provided valuable information about different reporting systems.

Database standardization is done by additional gathered unstandardized      information manually by hand , most of the distributed parts are      analyzed and new parameters are assigned according to parts input-output      model like : Inducer, Activator, Repressor, Inhibitor
For each promoters we assigned their inducers or repressors      as input and for protein generator parts we assigned generated proteins      as output which maybe activator or repressor of other devices.
iGEM devices are depicted in pictorial forms called flowcharts,      encapsulation of implementations , decision branching and direction      are milestones of our algoritm. The subprogram at the head of the      arrow starts executing after the termination of the subprogram at      the tail of the arrow. Following flowcharts are the high level representations      of our algorithms developed for the BioGuide software.
We run our algorithm on the real combination dataset to build      our input/output relations graphs . We also collected the subpart      assembly order, such as 1st: promoter, 2nd:rbs, 3rd:coding seq,      any internal parts and the Last: terminator. Each specific Biobrick      type has been assigned a number as a unique image ID from 1 to 19.
ImageID assembly orders for each construct has been used to      extract the type information for each subpart with that construct.      This innovative approach helped us to reveal 400 possible brick      combinations present within the 3x384 well plates distributed by      iGEM in Spring 2010
Four different graphs were constructed Graphical Modeling Theory      where relations of atomic parts, devices and systems and the functional      combinations that can build new constructs are presented for the iGEMs parts registry database. Three graphs are composed of iGEM      devices and one graph is based on Biobricks.
Each graph comprises a set of vertices or nodes and a set of      edges. In the set of nodes each node represents a device, while      in the set of edges each edge represents the input-output combination      of the nodes.
We arrange a survey to analyze user needs and response, According      to our survey results,244 participants are completed our survey      between 10 to 22.10.2010, 57% of the participant had scientific      degrees from B.Sc to Professor and 18% had graduate degrees. 18%      of participants are enrolled in their teams as either Instructors      or Advisors.INSA-Lyon, Lethbridge,"

Collaboration
WPI Worcester Polytechnic Institute
This year, the BU iGEM team collaborated with the WPI-Worcester iGEM team.
The collaboration became possible at the NEGEM meet up in June, where six New England iGEM teams presented their project ideas to the rest. During one of our small group discussions, a team member from WPI talked about how lucky we, the BU team, were to get access to a flow cytometer for single cell fluorescence measurement. Right then, the two teams decided to collaborate: we would test some of their constructs on our flow cytometer and they would view cells expressing our devices with their confocal microscope.
They gave us two copies of the same construct, one in a chloramphenicol resistant backbone and the other in an ampicillin resistant backbone. The device has BclA-YFP , which is a cell surface targeted protein to express YFP on the cell surface. We also ran one of our own single color YFP controls, which is listed at ""Internal YFP"" as this is not targeted to the cell surface. It should be noted that this control is in a kanamycin backbone.
The results our shown below. For details on how we converted the arbitrary YFP units to MEFLs, please see the TASBE Tools page for information about controls required to do that conversion.
Fluorescent measurements of three devices expressing YFP. The BclA-YFP parts were provided by WPI while the Internal YFP is one of the control parts provided by Boston University.
The WPI team took micrographs of cells containing tandem promoter- RFP testing constructs. We gave them media with two concentrations of arabinose (1 mM and 100 mM) and aTp (100 ng/mL"

For us to be able to efficiently process your requests, it is vital that your parts have been processed in conformance with the above guidelines. Input files not conforming to those guidlines would take a lot of work to process, due to the fact, that anything non-standard has to be parametrised by hand, using quantum chemistry software.
We still encourage you to submit your targets, even if they do not fit the guidelines. Currently, the processing of those files will be handled with lower priority, and their processing itself might take a lot of time. That said, we will inform you of all possible complications regarding your submission. Just bear in mind that it could take a very long time to process your request."

Back to Turing Patterns
Federico C 27 may 2008 (EDT)
As far as I have understood the project, we are trying to artificially reproduce Turing patterns; a kind of patterns that could be generated from a homogeneous media, that have been studied extensively, reproduced chemically and that are thought to have an important role in some process of morphogenesis.
Apparently some naturally occurring patterns seem to match and resemble Turing patterns, such as those seen in the organization of trychomes in Arabidopsis thaliana’s leafs or the jaguar spots, yet it’s still controversial whether or not they are actually that kind of patterns for the genetic network that underlies its formation is unknown.
While we could analyze the variation in naturally occurring patterns and dwell into the genetics of an organism (basically, hammering the organism by knocking out genes), a different approach to the problem; the construction of synthetic networks that produce patterns in organisms that previously didn’t have them, might to be an insightful and refreshing alternative.
Our synthetic devise may not resemble the natural one and might pale in comparison, yet its successful construction would allow us to establish whether or not the basic elements necessary for the process are complete and well understood and even reveal what would be needed for cells to generate complex patterns.
Problem #1
Federico C 27 may 2008 (EDT)
Which construction are we going to use? I’ve been unable to design a devise to replicate the widest known Turing pattern, the one that is presented in most papers, it involves a node that is repressed by the action of one diffusible signal and induced by the action of another node and there doesn’t seem to be promoters that behave in such a way, actually that leads me to think that most Turing patterns are not formed in the way that most papers suggest… simply it’s not biologically feasible.
Anyway, unless someone else comes with a silver bullet I’ll suggest affronting the problem in a different way: To get theoretical guys [sic] to investigate what is needed for a devise to reproduce Turing patterns. I have designed a lot of devices, yet I only intuitively know that they can generate Turing Patterns. If it can be showed that those devises are able to produce Turing patterns we would have made a big step. I want to remark that, in my opinion we should not be attached to the model that is shown in most"

We pushed through the stress and got the presentation done! We received extremely helpful feedback from the audience. The professors weighed in with what they liked/disliked about the presentation. Secondly, the previous iGEM members gave us extremely helpful critique based on their experience from last year’s presentation. They gave us tips and tricks to focus on while presenting in Boston. All in all, it was an extremely good idea to prepare a mock presentation. The feedback we received really helps us take our presentation to the next level.

Tips for Post Graduates?
As prestigious as iGEM is, it would make sense that enrolling in such a competition would be quite costly, and we’re not talking about time and effort, but we’re talking money. Money for lab equipment, enrolling in the competition, flight tickets, and accommodation expenses in Boston. All these are expenses that required a whole lot of money. What do we do, well the answer is simple, SPONSORS! In a record time we were able to gather enough money to ensure we would be covered throughout the iGEM journey. It wasn’t until October when news broke to some professor about how much money we were able to collect in such a short of time. We were contacted by a professor to give a presentation to postgraduate students regarding how to raise money! Getting this email meant a lot to us, first off, we are just master students asked to give a presentation to post graduates, how cool is that? We did indeed meet them and give them tips and tricks that we used in our journey to collect that amount of money! Needless to say we felt very proud!

All the hardowrk we have put in the last months is all boiling down to these last hours, and we xouldnt be any more proud of our WIKI and what we have achieved! Just a week from now and we will be in Boston, turning our dream into a reality, BOSTON HERE WE COME, BE PREPARED FOR HEKCITE!

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental"

TAS_Taipei,2015,Team:TAS Taipei#wetlab_-_-_TEXT.html," human GzmB (we do not have the safety clearance to test human samples!), we wanted to see if our chassis was actually expressing the correct protein. We ran an SDS-PAGE gel using E. coli samples containing our full device (Figure 10).
We also ran a biuret protein color indicator test (Figure 11), which turns from blue to purple. The biuret solution turning purple indicates that proteins were secreted into the LB. The tube containing ACT3m only (without YebF) remained blue, which indicates that proteins were not found in the solution. Combined with our SDS-PAGE results, this indicates that the full device synthesized and secreted YebF+ACT3m out of the bacteria.
Figure 10: SDS-PAGE gel of our protein YebF+ACT3m. Bacteria cells were grown in liquid culture and ran on a gel. Lane 3: negative control ( BBa_B0015 ); Lane 4: full construct ( BBa_K1610105 ). The arrows show additional proteins in bacteria carrying our full GzmB inhibitor device. However, we are unsure if any of these bands are the correct protein product.
Figure 11: A biuret test is a simple test for proteins. Bacterial cells expressing YebF+ACT3m or ACT3m were grown in liquid culture, and spun down to separate the cells from the LB solution. Only the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Biuret, a protein color indicator that turns from blue to purple, was added. The tube on the left contains LB isolated from our full construct (purple). The tube on the right (blue) is LB from liquid culture of bacteria carrying ACT3m only (not fused to YebF).

Figure 12: Survey to understand the public's opinion of eating genetically modified foods. Image taken from Pew Research Center (Funk & Rainie, 2015).
According to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2014, 88% of scientists polled believe it is generally safe to eat genetically modified foods, compared to only 37% of U.S. adults (Figure 12; Funk & Rainie, 2015). There is a huge difference in opinion between scientists and the public. These results match a survey that we gave during our school's Spring Fair as well, where we found that over 52% of students polled are uncomfortable with genetically modified products. Given this information, we imagine that the public would be fearful of using biopharmaceuticals where living bacteria is used either"

Modeling Gold Recycling with Delftibactin. Would It be Feasible?
Highlights:
Constraint based modeling allows for yield estimation of delftibactin production
Cost estimation of delftibactin production using a fed batch process
Cost equivalency to more traditional chemical methods
Gold price exceeds expenses for delftibactin approach by one order of magnitude
Introduction
Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases expressed in natural organisms help to develop evolutionary advantages over competitors. This ability has been recognized at the industrial level for example, by pharmaceutical companies like Cubist that produce antibiotics (e.g. Daptomycin [1]) based on non-ribosomal peptide synthesis. Of course, we were also fascinated by the idea to elevate our system to a larger scale and to test its industrial feasibility. Accompanying our experimental results confirming the ability of delftibactin
to precipitate gold we attempt to use theoretical considerations and metabolic modeling to show the realistic potential of our idea.
In particular, the feasibility of utilizing delftibactin for recycling at industrial scale was assessed in the following steps: A genome scale metabolic model of recombinant E.coli cells capable of producing Delftibactin was formulated and then simulated using constraint-based modeling (Flux Balance Analysis). Subsequently, the optimal production envelope was used for simulating the bacterial growth and delftibactin production in a bioreactor, which was used to estimate the cost for the produced delftibactin. Finally, we suggest a workflow for the isolation of gold from printed circuit boards using delftibactin and compare its potential financial impact to a state of the art method"

Background
Water pollution
Water, such a vital material for all kinds of creatures, plays a rather important role in human's life. In China, Laozi, a well-known philosopher in the Spring and Autumn Period, thought highly of water and said,
The best of men is like water;
Water benefits all things.
And does not compete with them.
It dwells in (the lowly) places that all disdain
Wherein it comes near to the Tao.[1]
However, in our daily life, although water is noble, it is not so strong and usually gets sick. With the development of industry and modern society, water is badly polluted. So what is water pollution? Water pollution happens when toxic substances enter water bodies and degrade the quality of water. Although over 70% of the earth is covered by water, fresh water, which can be used by humans, occupied only 2.53% of the global water resources. Over 80% of rivers in China have been polluted in some degree[2]
Some picture about water pollution reference from the Internet.
Water pollution can be classified into organic, inorganic and so on. What we care most is heavy metal pollution because heavy metal waste water is the current outstanding problem in the field of water pollution and becomes the focus of research in the controlling field.
Heavy metals from industrial processes can accumulate in nearby water body, which are toxic to marine life such as fish and shellfish, and subsequently to the humans who eat them. Heavy metals can slow development, result in birth defects and some are carcinogenic. The most commonly encountered toxic heavy metals in wastewater include Arsenic, Lead, Mercury, Cadmium, and the less common include Chromium, Copper, Nickel, Zinc[3]. Three kinds of heavy metals are of concern, including toxic metals (such as Hg, Cr, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd, As, Co, Sn, etc.), precious metals (such as Pd, Pt, Ag, Au, Ru etc.) and radionuclides (such as U, Th, Ra, Am, etc.)[4]. Heavy metals bring about serious environmental pollution, threatening human health and ecosystem.[5]
here are millions people are struggling with water pollution. In China, for example, about 75 percent of the population (or 1.1 billion people) are without access"
Northwestern,2012,Team:Northwestern#Project#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," of an inducible promoter (Pgad) that is activated at high intracellular chloride ion concentration upstream of a lysis device. In order to convert Pgad from a chloride-sensitive promoter to an effective pH-sensitive promoter, a chloride-hydrogen antiporter known as CLC-ec1 is constitutively produced. The CLC-ec1 antiporter is activated at low intracellular pH and pumps 2 chloride ions into the cell in order to move one hydrogen ion out of the cell. Thus the CLC-ec1 antiporter will be activated at low intracellular pH which will cause the antiporter to pump chloride ions into the cell and hydrogen ions out of the cell. The increasing intracellular chloride ion concentration will activate the inducible Pgad promoter which in turn will activate the lysis device.
Construct
The clc-ec1 antiporter gene was PCR amplified from K12 E. coli’s genome obtained from Dr. Tyo’s Lab at Northwestern University. We also collaborated with the CUHK 2011 team in order to improve the characterization and submit their Pgad part to the registry as it was not submitted last year.  We obtained the Pgad part from the CUHK team in an unknown vector. Because the vector was unknown, we PCR amplified the Pgad gene. After PCR cleanup, gel electrophoresis was performed to verify that the expected band pattern was observed.
After gel verifying the clc-antiporter and the Pgad promoter, we then set out to construct the pH inducible promoter for use in our phytase delivery system. To do this, we transformed and miniprepped a lysis cassette, the protein expression plasmids described before, and a double terminator from the registry. We assembled and cloned together each part piece by piece, gel verifying after each step in the process to avoid errors. The final construct created was Pgad/lysis/(4 different CP+RBS)/CLC-ec1/Double terminator. Another construct replacing lysis with GFP was used to measure the activity of the Pgad promoter in an assay described in our system characterization section. Each of these constructs was again gel verified and sequenced.
Assay
To obtain a relative measure of the Pgad activity at varying pH’s of our pH sensor, cells containing the assembled Pgad/GFP nsCP/clc-ec1/xx in pSB1A3 plasmid were grown overnight, diluted 1:500 and then regrown to log phase (all in LB). Once in log phase, the cells were transferred into a 96-well plate"

COMPARISON WITH OUR SEQUENCE
 
Y/N
Single-chain insulin for treatment of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes   having the formula
B(1-26)- X1 - X2 - X3- X4- A (1-21),
B - linker - A formula
Y
B(1-26) is a peptide chain consisting of the first 26 amino acid residues of the B chain of   human insulin counted from the N-terminal end of the B chain or an   analogue of the B-chain with one addition or one deletion of one of the amino   acid residues in the B-chain or derivative of the B-chain being chemically   modified by introducing a group in the side chain in one or more positions of   the B-chain or by oxidation or reduction of the side chains of the amino   acids residues in the B-chain,
Our B chain consists of 28 AA. Although the patents contain different   versions eg ‘an analogue of the B-chain with one addition or   deletion’ – the total length of the   B-chain must STILL be 26AA.
N
and A(1-21) is the natural insulin A chain or an   analogue thereof with one addition"

Project Timeline
Summarized below is the sequence of events that led to the completion of our project, from brainstorming ideas to finally submitting our parts and finishing the wiki!
Project Decisions!
February 2018
Based on Judge feedback and our desire to bring the 2017 WLC-Milwaukee project to fruition, we decided to continue our 2017 project detecting E. coli in contaminated water supplies using Lambda Phage tail proteins. We began laying out the ways we would improve our past project and complete the areas where it had fallen short and been unsuccessful in 2017.
Began Cloning parts into pTrc99a
March 2018
With the help of our advisor, we designed primers and began the frustrating process of amplifying and cloning our parts from the pETail4 plasmid (containing the Lambda Phage tail protein genes) into pTrc99a in order to control protein expression levels using the pTrc99a IPTG inducible trc-promoter (also called Ptac).
MUBRC
April 2018
A number of our team members participated in MUBRC (The Milwaukee Undergraduate Biological Research Conference) by volunteering and helping facilitate setup for this event while Jack presented a poster of our past work and hopeful project improvements in order to gain feedback from other undergraduate researchers and PIs in attendance.
Started Human Practices Investigation
June 2018
As a team we began investigating issues relating to water quality and testing, how our project may fit into the market, how our project could fulfill a need for water testing in certain areas, and could be designed to reduce waste and eliminate any environmental hazards.
Organization Outreach Day
August 2018
In August Jack and Laura presented a poster and posterboard at the Organization Outreach day, welcoming new freshman students to our campus and talking with various students about bioengineering, synbio, and our project. Through this event we made contact with a number of students who were very interested in joining iGEM and"

We confirmed the PCR reactions by running 5μL agarose gels. For samples bigger than 300bp we ran 1% gel, for samples smaller than that we ran 2% gels.
We performed PCR Clean up in the samples: C0051, C0040, C0062, I13458, R0063AB, R0063EB, R0063FB, R0063GB, R0010AB, E1010, E3030, C0012, C0071, C0080, B0015DE, B0015DF, B0015DG, B0015DH, E0040, C0079, pSB1C3, pSB1k3. Then, we nanodropped them.
July
Week 3
We performed restriction digest of the samples with SpeI and NEB buffer 4 for 1 hour. Then, we performed PCR clean up of the RD samples and measured the DNA concentration by nanodrop.
We did ligation of pSB1C3 and pSB1k3, in order to circularize the plasmid that we amplified in order to remove RFP.Then, we transformed the ligation product using bioline cells and spread plate them.  The 1C3 yielded colonies but the 1K3 didn’t. We picked colonies of 1C3 for overnight culture.
We performed PCR on pSB1A3, R0010(EB, FB, GB) and R0079 (AB, EB, FB, GB) with phusion from NEB to trouble shoot. For PCR we extended 1A3 extension time, while lowering annealing temperature for all samples. We run a gel to check the PCR product. For 1A3, we ran a 1% gel and for the other samples we ran a 2% gel. Again the amplifications  did not work and we decided to double check the primers we designed. We realized that the primers R0010_For_E, R0010_For_F, R0010_For_G,  R0079_For_A, R0079_For_E, R0079_For_F an R0079_For_G had problems on their design and couldn`t anneal properly to the template. We are ordering new correct primers and troubleshooting the amplification of pSB1A3.

3) Mix*, read the absorbances at 340nm, of the solutions (A2)  at the end of the reaction (approx. 5 min). If the  reaction has not stopped after 5 min, continue to   read the absorbances at 2 min intervals until the absorbances remain the same over 2 min**.
(*) for example with a plastic spatula or by gentle inversion after sealing the cuvette with a cuvette cap or Parafilm®.
(**) if the absorbance continues to increase, this may be due to effects of colour compounds or enzymes in the sample. These interfering substances may be removed during sample preparation.
SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. Sample dilution:
The amount of trehalose present in the cuvette (i.e. in the 0.2 mL of sample being analysed) should range between 4 and 80 μg. Thus, the sample solution before the borohydride reduction step must be diluted sufficiently to yield a trehalose concentration between 0.12 and 2.4 g/L.

If the value of DAtrehalose is too low (e.g. < 0.100), weigh out more sample or dilute less strongly.

Alica Emhardt
Alica is our medicine and musician talent. She proved her great acting and singing skills in our music video “Permanently singing our CRISPR song "". You can see her delighted commitment to human practices on the pictures of the science fair in Freiburg. She is always very busy, but nevertheless she spreads good mood in the laboratory.
Alina Rudorf
Cell culture grandmaster Alina treats all our cells with that special kind of care. No matter if HEKs, CHOs or HeLas, one can always rely on her cells to be in the right density for seeding. She acquired sponsors for serological pipettes and cell culture. Due to her calm nature it’s very pleasant to work with Alina, who is always chic come hell or high water. :-P
Anne Müller
Through Anne‘s veins runs real tradeswoman‘s blood. She`s very good at gaining excellent sponsoring arrangements. Among many other things, she organized lab chairs and software licenses. In the lab she is prominent for her great cloning skills. Even in tense situations she keeps smiling and stays positive.
Fenja Gawlas
Fenja has a very open and direct personality, which makes her an ideal candidate to call things by their right names and help the team think in new ways. Additionally, she is our sponsoring and mini prep queen and organizes jamboree accommodations in every requested language. She keeps track of our expenses, but also has a creative streak when illustrating the team photos or Princess CRISPR.

Autoinduction
Module Integration: Autoinduction
Module 2 is triggered by a switch from glucose consumption to a secondary carbon source consumption. When the initial preferential carbon source (glucose) is exhausted, the system will metabolise the secondary carbon source that is available. This switch triggers the promoter that controls the start of Module 2. By knowing the initial concentrations of each carbon source, this acts as a programmable time delay system for the activation of encapsulation.
Thermoinduction
Module Integration: Thermoinduction
Module 3 is initiated upon an increase in temperature. The system is initially grown at 28°C, at which point Module 3 is repressed. When the temperature is raised to 42°C, this repression is blocked, triggering the start of Module 3. This temperature sensitive system was chosen as after encapsulation, chemical induction may be less effective due to limited diffusion.

Summary
We examined the efficiency of circularization of mRNA in E. coli. The mRNA synthesized by transcription of induced plasmid may be considered that there are mainly 3 shape patterns in the process of circularization (fig.1).
Figure. 1  reaction mechanism of the self-splicing and position of each sequence
In this experiment, we carried out reverse transcription of RNA of Escherichia coli, and calculated the abundance ratio of each shape pattern by detecting specific sequences by using MPN-PCR (Most Probable Number-PCR).
By examining the abundance ratio of sequence A, B or C, D , and B / A shows the probability that the reaction doesn’t start (step Ⅰ). Also, we can calculate the probability that RNA will cyclize (step Ⅱ,Ⅲ) by C and D. By examining them, we investigated the rate-limiting step in the process of cyclization or probability to cyclization of the RNA.
Experiment
We extracted total RNA from E. coli and then carried out the reverse transcription. This time we used the two types of primer; oligo dt primer and random primer. And we carried out reverse transcription with them. We serially diluted obtained cDNA, and calculated abundance rate by using MPN-PCR.
Case 1: Determination of the sequence A and B
We carried out reverse transcription with the oligo dt primer which is complementary to the poly A sequence at the 3 'end of the mRNA (fig.2).
Figure. 2  the sequence of oligo dt primer
Oligo dt primer anneals specifically to the 3 'end of the mRNA, so the ratio of reverse transcription of A and B are the same. Thus, B/A calculated by the MPN-PCR shows the abundance ratio of step Ⅰ, that is, the probability that no reaction started.
Case 2: Determination of the sequence C and D
Since there’s no poly A sequence on the mRNA after starting cyclization, it’s impossible to use the oligo dt primer. Therefore, we use the random primer. However, some problems arise when we determine them with random primer.
Problems
Reverse transcription is carried out in the following steps.
Primer is added to RNA.
The cDNA is synthesized by reverse transcriptase.
Inactivation of reverse transcriptase

Experimental (wetlab) planning
The figure above depicts the work flow involved with biological engineering projects. The design and synthesis phases are dependent on product specifications, components to build with and tools to put them together - these phases are synthetic biology-driven.  The systems biology-driven steps are the analysis and model steps, which take advantage of high-throughput omics measurement technologies, bioinformatic approaches to organizing the generated data and computational biology methods to simulate biological systems. The design and model stages are largely carried out computationally whereas the synthesis and analysis steps require the use of the laboratory (i.e., wetlab).
Synthesis
The substrate we're working with is DNA, which we can isolate and clone from a natural source, find within a repository such as the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, or have fabricated (i.e., chemically synthesized) by a DNA synthesis company such as DNA2.0 or GENEART.
Once you have your DNA, you're ready to get started with the realization of your design.  Usually, the first step is the bacterial amplification of your starting material, DNA, which is usually housed on a plasmid.  Therefore, first transform E. coli with the appropriate DNA and allow the bacteria to propagate, thereby amplifying the amount of your DNA. The properly transformed bacteria can be selected for by including the appropriate antibiotic in the growth medium.
Specifically, you should spread out the (hopefully) transformed cells on an LB-agar dish and culture overnight. After selecting 5 colonies from the dish the next day, you should grow up 5 overnight liquid cultures (5mL volume is good).

As a student leader in our team, I                             participated in recruiting and selecting new team members to start a team. In the stage of                             research, I selected information about antimicrobial peptides that target on A. hydrophila                             but                             are not harmful to E. coli. During summer vacation, I participated in wet lab, including                             Interlab, constructing parts, and extracting and testing the peptides. In September and                             October, I took part in planning presentation, writing and revising wiki, and designing                             poster.                             iGEM gives me a platform to preview a life for research in lab and my partners' effortless                             hardwork in the project gives me the courage to finish the process.

UESTC_Life,2013,Team:UESTC Life#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," According to many papers, the effects of linker length on equilibrium stability arise from significant and sometimes opposing changes in folding and unfolding kinetics.[1,4,7,8] As for the structure, the rank of linker is α-helix >β-sheet > loop.[2,3,4,5,8] And the effect of structure is dominant. We collected amass of data1,[4,6,7,8] and degraded the effect of linker. Finally, we got a formula. The formula can predict the efficiency of the length of linker. The full mark is 10 points.

Overview and Introduction
Microfluidics is a scientific field that exists at the intersection of the fields of engineering, physics, chemistry and biotechnology. It deals with the manipulation of microlitre volumes of liquids which are processed on devices called microfluidic chips. As a result, microfluidics allows complex protocols and procedures to be performed on chips.
There are a variety of different types of microfluidic chips in existence. For example, digital, paper and centrifugal microfluidic chips are all in use today. MARS focuses on continuous flow microfluidics fabricated from polycarbonate and PDMS.
Problem Statement
If a synthetic biologist would like to use microfluidics in their lab, they would follow the traditional design and manufacture workflow. This consists of three general stages divided into:
Design
Manufacture
Implementation
Designing, manufacturing and using a microfluidic device  requires significant knowledge investment in topics such as the basics of fluid dynamics and specialised software such Adobe Illustrator. If a synthetic biologist does not want to design their own chip, they can search through published literature. However, these devices are often highly specialized and not useful for the average synbio researcher. After either designing their own chip, or selecting a published microfluidic, they would begin the time consuming process of designing and modeling their chip  using Comsol. Once the design is finalized, they can move on to the manufacturing stage of the workflow. Most microfluidic fabrications methods, such as soft lithography, require a high initial startup cost, technical agility, time investment and more educational investment to learn how to correctly manufacture the chips.
After manufacturing their device the synthetic biologist can then move onto implementation and testing. However, there are many difficulties that may arise when testing a device. For example, certain chips may require some external apparatus, such as off-chip metering or electronic components. These can vary from design to design, adding additional costs and time investment in learn how to use them.
Even after investing time and money into this microfluidics workflow, success is not guaranteed. The process may need to be repeated dozens of times to get a fully functional microfluidic chip.
These difficulties with replicating and"

The person who makes the experiment not only need rigorous attitude also need humorous character. Make a funny person in order to stick to the boring work. So, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
For me, majoring in biology is an amazing journey as well as fulfilled life. Participating in iGEM is a fantastic experience more than a changeable competition. It is a window connecting to brilliant knowledge and pleasurable as well as suffering life. For others, It is a play – interesting, funny, painful, powerful and unforgettable. iGEM is for life, for future. So the most romantic and exciting thing is… what? しらない。
Living in the 21th, I have seen the magic and great of biotechnology, which changed the life of the whole humans. And with the development of biology, we have accumulated lots of information for large data analysis and let synthetic biology becomes the truth. So I choose to learn biotechnology in UESTC. In my school, the thought of synthetic biology is very popular and it encourages students attend to lab. When I was a freshman, I had heard about iGEM and the idea of it attracts me much. Becoming a iGEMer is my lucky and the day fight for iGEM is worth commemorating.
I join iGEM in order to find more friends who have the same interests, not only in biology. I prefer to make friends, talk about our future, begin our brain storm. In my words, everything have their common point. When we join this competition, what we learn more than biology. I also like play basketball, although I get badly injured, l still love it deeply. Boston, I love Celtics, I am a big fan, I want them win the champion!!! Let’s go Celtics! Unbutu!
Self reflection:      For me, iGEM is a key to a new world which leads me to open the door of synthetic biology. As an iGEMer, I’m lucky to be involved in creating a magic. What’s more, I have the honor to witness many legends in biology"

Feeding Assays
To understand the insect test in an easy way, the testee selection, and experiment design would be briefly described. The results consist of three parts-feeding assay pre-test, the fusion protein improvement test, and preference test.
**Note: The word “Pantide” in the following paragraph refers to the collection of all the toxin design in our project.
Testee Selection
In the test of Pantide toxicity, we chose tobacco cutworm as the testee for the insect appetite tests because all the Pantide targets lepidopterans. We hope that we can observe the difference of the three toxins in vivo. Tobacco cutworms, which are one of the major pests in vegetable farms, impact on Crucifers in farmland around the world. In the serious pest damage, the density of tobacco cutworms is approximately up to two hundred million per hectare. Therefore, we used five tobacco cutworms to mimic the much more severe situation in our insect experiment.
Experiment Design
All the experiments were to check the functions of Pantide for leaf protection, so the observation of the results would focus on the remained area of the leaf disks.
       In the following experiments, we used E. coli BL21 Rosetta-Gami strain to produce Pantide. We aimed to evaluate the remained leaf area applying Pantide. In this insect test, Pantide was diluted into three concentrations to observe the trends of dose response and to confirm the quality of PANTIDE. All the following experiments have three dilution ratios including 1/125 x, 1/25x and 1/5x. Three repeated tests were done in each experiment. See the procedure of insect experiment on Protocols .
Hypothesis
According to the mechanism of Pantide, Pantide is supposed to perform its toxicity in the nervous system of the larvae. We might see larvae paralyze and finally die.
Insect Test Result
Feeding Assay Pre-test
To know the qualitative toxicity effect of Pantide, we prepared the samples with the sonicated LB solution lysate containing Pantide-expressed E. coli Rosetta-Gami strain and diluted it with the three concentration. This experiment is the pre-test that shows us whether the amount of Pant"

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#HumanPractice#GMO_-_-_TEXT.html,"As our moss is not ingested into the human body, gene transfer between the bacteria in the human digestive system and our moss is virtually impossible. As we established a safety mechanism which destroys the genome of our moss in case of its escape there can be no gene transfer even if the moss should be ingested by humans or animals.
Destruction of Biodiversity
Figure 5: The Risk-Benefit balance symbolizes the consideration of beneficial effects and potential risks that are an inherent part of a specific technology.
As mentioned above our safety mechanism prevents our moss to spread beneath our controlled environment in contrast to GM foods which are cultivated on open fields and could escape easily. Additionally Physcomitrella patens is not an important crop which renders the argument of GM opponents useless that by genetic modification humankind could lose an essential agricultural plant.
Introduction of new allergens
Allergen production is also not a problem with our moss filter as proteins are generally not stable in the environment. After the filtration of the water by our moss microorganisms will degrade every potential allergen produced by our system.
Human Practice – equity of Golden Rice
Introduction
“What is the connection between our moss project and Golden Rice?""
Figure 6: Golden Rice(left) and non GM rice (right)
Night blindness is a result of a so called vitamin-A-deficiency (VAD). Especially in developing countries high rates of infectious diseases and malnutrition occur, which lead to deficiencies in immunity. These aspects effect night blindness which can cause complete blindness within a few days [ CMB Christoffel Blindenmission ]. The golden rice project is a method of biofortification to combat the VAD by using genetic engineering. Cleaning wastewater with our genetically engineered moss Physcomitrella patens leads to directly improved conditions in developing countries by using Synthetic Biology.

Final construct after this cloning is; respectively T7 promoter-Lac operator(LacO)-HisTag-PotB59-RBS-PomA-S-tag. Besides, a constitutive promoter called LacI promoter and LacI protein sequence in front of that, found on peT45-b vector’s another part. It is obvious that this part is IPTG-dependent, so Western Blot can be performed easily with the help of His Tag to observe PotB59 expression and S-tag to observe PomA expression.
In this part’s design we confronted with the same problem as we did in Hns part design . So we planned to clone them into PSB1C3-T7 plasmid, which we designed. By doing this, we will have the proteins synthesized in high amounts with the help of T7 but there won’t be any additional amino acids.
Results
PSB1C3-HNS/HNS-T108I/PotB59-PomA CLONING
We cloned IDT G-Block genes into PSB1C3 vector in order to make it ready to be submitted and have many copies of it. For this purpose we digested PSB1C3 vector and HNS,HNS_T108I, PotB59/PomA G-Blocks with ECoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Then we ligated these cut genes into the plasmid by using T4 DNA Ligase . Ocurring products were transformed into BL21 competent cell strain. To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was perfomed with Verify Forward and Verify Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly t the band should be 314 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, then bands should be at 744 bp long line for HNS and HNST108I genes, and 2045 bp long line for PotB59/PomA gene. As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check for a second cloning control. We used EcorI and PstI restriction enzymes for cut-check.

2.1.1  The composition of BBa_K1755305
We connected BBa_K346002'PmerT', as a promoter, with BBa_1755003'RBS+ribB CDS+B0014'to get BBa_K1755305.
2.1.2  How does it work
PmerT is a kind of promoter from Tn21 mercury resistance (mer) operon. When there is no Hg2+, it cannot start the transcription. Upon binding the cognate metal ions, the metallated MerR homodimer causes a realignment of the promoter so that RNA polymerase contacts the -35 and -10 sequences leading to open complex formation and transcription. (see more details http://  parts.igem.org /Part:BBa_K346002).
So PmerT promoter can be induced by Hg2+ and start the coding of ribB downstream to increase the output of riboflavin. And there is some quantity relationship about the concentration of Hg2+ and the production of riboflavin. We can calculate the the concentration of Hg2+ by our ‘Micro Holmes’ system.
2.1.3 Results
We transformed BBa_K1755305 into E.coli BL-21. Then we detected the concentration of riboflavin through measuring the absorbance under 444nm. Unfortunately, we didn't find that riboflavin production respond to the change of Hg2+ concentration, which indicated that BBa_K1755305 can not work as we anticipated.

3.1.1  The composition
We used BBa_K911003 as a promoter and connected it with BBa_1755003'RBS+ribB CDS+B0014'to get 3.1  BBa_K1755024.
3.1.2  How does it work
BBa_K911003 is a fluoride sensitive riboswitch that is highly sensitive to the F-. It is a positive regulator so F- can induce the promoter to transcript. Since the report gene is at the downstream of fluoride promoter, the riboflavin production can be influenced by the change of F- concentration. So we can use the concentration of riboflavin to determine the concentration of F- and even apply into our ‘Micro Holmes’ system.

The Popularization of Synthetic Biology and iGEM
On Oct 27th, our team and SMS_Shenzhen gave a lecture to students in Shenzhen Middle School. Since the junior high students have already been exposed to basic biology including fundamental knowledge about DNA, in an-hour-long lecture we told them more about detailed DNA structure, inheritance and plasmid working mechanism. We then introduced them to the central theme of synthetic biology. Most students showed great interest in the lecture and asked tons of questions, not only about what we have covered but also some extended ones. In the end, we delivered our “iGEM survival guide” to them to popularize both synthetic biology and iGEM competition.
After the lecture finished, iGEMers from SMS_Shenzhen gave us and their middle school students a tour of their laboratory. We taught the students how to use micropipettes and they were quite impressed by so many accurate, delicate equipments."

Guidence of Student Experiments
Biosafety and Publicity
We believe that biosafety is not an issue which should be only considered inside biological lab, but also around people and communities. Spreading knowledge of biosafety to the public will help eliminate misunderstanding and prejudice, from which the science and all the people will benefit. We hope that sharing this idea with all iGEM teams can be useful to take advantage on biosafety.
To investigate public attitude towards our project and to publicize our biosafety ideas are what we do for our human practice. As “eating bacteria” is somehow an unacceptable concept now, we would like to find whether people know the truth about biosafety issues raised by bioengineered bacteria, or they are just panicked by their imaginary “bacteria”. And then, after initiating basic knowledge of microbiology, gene engineering and synthetic biology, we shall take a look on if people’s opinion to biosafety issues will change. In this way, we will estimate the value of our scientific publicity.
The rational discussions of biosafety we take with the public do not limited on our project, but also hotspot issues such as transgenics and stem cell therapies. For more information, please click on Human Practice .

We had several meetings with 2018 iGEM team NTHU_Taiwan since August 3rd to troubleshoot their problem on making constructs.
Earlier before the meeting, NTHU_Taiwan designed the gene of insert for their experiment. After getting the synthesized gene part from IDT and digesting both the inserts and the vectors, they proceeded to ligation, which failed after times they tried.
During the discussion, the design of the gene, cutting site and many other aspects are checked by us and appeared to be just fine. Later we concluded that the failing of ligation is due to low concentration of the inserts left following digestion and purification.
To avoid the digestion and purification steps, which caused the loss of their inserts, we re-designed primers for them and suggested NEBuilder Assembly kit for ligation. The kit requires lower DNA input and can save time by avoiding PCR amplification steps. Gladly, team NTHU_Taiwan successfully made all three constructs they needed-- pSB1C3 - AHL snesor - Anti – STAR, pSB1C3 - pLac – STAR, pSB1C3 - pLux – GFP—following our instructions.2018.08.03
Wiki Page
Since building wiki pages is unfamiliar to our team, on August 24th , team NCTU­_Formosa gave us a tutorial about html.
During the tutorial, we learned:
1.Basic tags and elements for html
2.Image scale and website format adjustment
3.Styling html with CSS and JavaScript
4.Conversion of websites in PC and mobile version
Thanks to NCTU­_Formosa’s guidance, discussion and their generosity to assist our problems through messeges after the meetup, the wiki page we expected can be built successfully by a team composing of biology background. We both learned a lot from each other.

SUSTC-Shenzhen-B,2012,Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-B#SynBio.intro_-_-_TEXT.html," standardization, assembling in synthetic biology is as easy as playing with LEGO toys, the interface is well-designed so that the construction is so simple. Besides, abstraction, reliability, uniformity and reuse, the generic terms in engineering, are all introduced to synthetic biology. Therefore, synthetic biology turns to a field of multidiscipline. Experts with different backgrounds gather to make their efforts. Programmers write the code to calculate, mathematics find model to predict, Engineers consider about the hierarchy, biologists debug the system. Ironically, synthetic biology is more engineering than genetic engineering.
Talking about hierarchy, let me make an analogy between synthetic biology and computer hardware. Proteins and genes are compared to resistance, capacity which are the bottom of the system. Upwards, biochemical reaction is the same as gates in electronics because both of them can function basically. If biochemical reactions form a network and gates form a network, we call them pathways and modules in synthetic biology and electrical engineering respectively. Moreover, there are computers and cells.
The dream is so nice but the reality is so hard. There is still plenty of work to do to make synthetic biology to be a qualified engineering. Often, we don't even fully understand the devices we are using and the whole system is not under our fully control. Despite this, after all, a new world is in front of us, as a Polish geneticist wrote,' I am not concerned that we will run out of exciting and novel ideas, ... in the synthetic biology, in general.'

The first is a normal eGFP plasmid with an added 5' untranslated region, which was used as a target site for our CRISPR/dCas9 based editing system. The other eGFP reporter also contained a 5' untranslated region and also had a non-functional ACG start codon. The data gathered was analyzed using fluorescence microscopy and image analysis. The results of this analysis can be found here . We then confirmed our analysis by using flow cytometry as part of a collaboration with the Boston University Team
Collaboration
Our team collaborated with the Boston University Wetlab team in two major ways. First BU helped us validate both our eGFP reporter proteins, which were used as reporters for the APOBEC enzyme, with their flow cytometry machine. The flow cytometry data collected from this collaboration also functioned to validate our microscopy-based analysis system. We, in turn, helped the them using our fluorescent microscope. We analyzed the fluorescence of several of their reporter proteins to confirm their findings. See our collaboration information here.
Human Practices
The main goal of the team's human practices was to make information and education about biological concepts more accessible to the public. After revamping some protocols from the College of William and Mary, a previous iGEM team, the WPI team held a large scale outreach event at WPI's TouchTomorrow. During this event, children and their families were able to learn about the intricacies of DNA, the basics of Mendelian genetics, and the relative size of organisms through fun activities like DNA Extraction from Strawberries. The team then modified these activities for WPI's Women in Science program that they assisted with. Community engagement was not the only approach taken by the team this summer to accomplish their human practices goal. They also effectively utilized social media to make scientific education and knowledge more accessible. By using three different social media platforms the team was able to reach nearly 1,000 people with every post, making biological research"

Exchange parts with SYSU-Software and FAFU-China
     We shared iGEM Interlab kits and iGEM plate kits with SYSU-Software. During our experiments, we found out that one of our Interlab plasmids (Device I) could not be transformed well in bacterial culture medium. So we borrowed some plasmids from SYSU-Software. Furthermore, SYSU-Software had used up one of their plate kits (B0015 terminator) and we gave them ours. Reference can be seen in the Collaboration site of SYSU-Software .

Dangerous chemicals
We tried to avoid the use of dangerous chemicals whenever possible. We have completely banned a number of dangerous chemicals, such as ethidium bromide which had been replaced by anthocyanin for our DNA gel electrophoresis. At the same time, we have restricted  the use of dangerous chemicals (such as acrylamide) which must be clearly placed in marked areas in the laboratory. And we were also required to keep the chemistry reagents in classified storage.

William_and_Mary,2018,Team:William and Mary#Human Practices#A Statewide Standard_-_-_TEXT.html," any STEM field will ultimately benefit from a strong understanding of bioengineering. To broaden our reach and ensure we could impact as many people as possible, our team decided to improve the Virginia Standards of Learning. Changing these standards benefits the 1,293,049 students currently enrolled in the Virginia public school system, and will have a lasting impact as more students enter and graduate from the Virginia school system.
We began by reaching out to Dr. Anne Petersen, the Virginia State Science Coordinator. Our email described the importance of updating the Virginia Science Standards to reflect the advancements made in synthetic biology. The email also included a proposal for a new science standard.
This email resulted in a lasting collaboration. Over the past months we have shared our activities booklet and corresponded extensively over email and over the phone to create a new biology standard representing synthetic biology under standard BIO. 5. The final draft of the standard was voted on by the Virginia Board of Education on October 18th. The standard reads:
BIO.5  The student will investigate and understand that there are common mechanisms for inheritance.  Key ideas include...Synthetic Biology has biological and ethical implications.
A complete version of the SOLs and Curriculum Framework from 2010 can be found here and here .
The final email from Dr. Petersen with revisions of the standard can be found here .
Our team will now begin the collaboration on the curriculum framework for the synthetic biology standard. Our proposal includes the following information:
Plasmids are small circular pieces of DNA
Synthetic biology techniques utilize existing cellular mechanisms
Transformations allows for the uptake and incorporation of external genetic material
CRISPR/Cas systems can be used to target and alter specific DNA sequences
Advancements in DNA sequencing have made synthetic biology research more accessible and led to a rise in DIY biology or Biohacking
Synthetic biology has applications in a variety of disciplines including medicine, agriculture, research, energy, and travel
Synthetic biology advancements have ethical implications which affect both animals and the environment
We will be working with the curriculum framework team until March when our framework will be up for public review. The final review of the framework will be in May and will then be voted upon. Once passed, the Department of Education will develop Continued Professional Development to support professionals in transitioning to the new Science Standards of Learning. Full implementation of our standards will be completed in 2021.
However, because Virginia’s standards are only updated every 7-8 years, and take over a year to update, many students are not being exposed to the most recent findings and research. To address this, our team is working with Dr."

Our team
Our team brings together 19 students from different fields of study: law, design, biology, chemistry, and physics. The multidisciplinary approach of our team allows us to successfully carry out all the various aspects of our project, but also to constantly learn from one another. We agree as a team that iGEM is an amazing opportunity to bring to life scientific ideas, expand our knowledge, practice laboratory techniques and meet inspiring young minds.
We come from different institutions: Pierre et Marie Curie University , Paris Diderot University , Paris Sud , ESPCI , ETSL and ENSCI .And we are fortunate to be mentored by our four tutors : Deshmukh Gopaul, Patsy Polston, Vincent Le Gros and Guillian Graves.
The multidisciplinarity of our group also gives us the opportunity to constantly learn from each other, whether in biology, chemistry, physics, as well as in design and law. Being able to conduct our laboratory experiments for our own research is a real achievement for us. IGEM is a great adventure in which we can deepen our knowledge and acquire new skills.
When we are not working hard in the lab or in the design studio, you will find us having fun together over games and drinks.

Welcome to the Stanford team Wiki for iGEM 2009
Stanford iGEM is a student-run, faculty-directed research group at Stanford University. The objective of our interdisciplinary group is to design and build novel engineered biological systems using standardized DNA-based parts to submit to the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) competition, held annually at MIT.
We will be competing for the first time in 2009.
Our research draws from the principles of Synthetic Biology, an emerging interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary area that involves the design and construction of biological systems.
BOO! Robert has 1 day left and wishes to make his mark on the wiki before he goes! Bwahaha go SiGEM!

Design: We developed a new production process for the fusion protein BBa_K2643002. We followed existing dxCas9 expression protocols ( Huai et al. 2017 ), but developed a new downstream process for the fusion. We evaluated three different types of chromatography:
Nickel affinity chromatography: The fusion protein has a HIS-tag (used to purify both Tn5 and dxCas9 individually).
Heparin chromatography: The fusion protein is a DNA-binding protein (used to purify both Tn5 and dxCas9 individually).
