Evolutionary Biology, Population Genetics & Evolutionary Algorithm
The process of evolution is as simple as the repeat of variation and selection, but it is also more complex than everything we can imagine. While an organism is evolving to fit the environment, the environment containing other organisms are also evolving. The variation rate of the organism and the selection pressure of the environment themselves are also evolving to keep the survival of the entire ecosystem.
There are many theoretical researches of evolution following the work of Darwin. Evolutionary biology , population genetics and evolutionary algorithm are 3 research fields that are closely related to the research of the dynamics of evolution. The first two fields are on the biology side, while evolutionary algorithm is an engineering approach widely used in optimization problems.
Fitness landscape is often used to characterize evolution. Mountain"

2nd Mediterranean Meet Up
This year the devoted and strongly motivated Aix-Marseille team organized the second Mediterranean meet up in Marseille on the 9th and 10th of August.  This second edition was a great opportunity to meet more teams and countries each other and to share about our projects.  It was a meetup including poster presentations, to which we invited teams from all the Mediterranean countries.  It gave us all an opportunity to make a rehearsal presenting before the Giant Jamboree.
This year, 7 teams from Spain and France joined us: UPF_CRG_Barcelona , Madrid-OLM , Grenoble , Bordeaux , Pasteur_Paris , Paris_Bettencourt , and Montpellier .  To kick-off the meeting presented their projects. Toengage the audience, each team gave a 180-second synthesis of their project. This was an initiative taken from Swissnex Brazil and Nano-Tera .
We had a superb judging panel, to evaluate the presentations and give us all feedback on how they perceived our projects, that included: Mr. Laurent VILLARD (Department of medical genetics at the Timone hospital ), M. Victoria SCHMIDT (Post-doctoral at the LISM laboratory), M. Leticia HOUOT (our Secondary PI), Mr. Gauthier DANGLA PELISSIER (one of our Instructors), Mr. Marlon SIDORE (one of our Instructors), and M. Thea Chrysostomou the European after-iGEM ambassador
The snap presentations gave a very dynamic and a punchy training session.  It was a chance for iGEMers to make a concise synthesis of their project. Additionnal poster sessions and bioethics round tables allowed a more thorough description of the project with a support and encouraged discussion about the projects in a relaxed atmosphere. After the project presentations, we all went on a visit to discover the city. This tour allowed the different teams to get to know each other better and create strong social links.  The meet-up was an excellent rehearsal for presenting the project and a great opportunity to develop cooperation between teams. A big thank you to"

Waterloo,2015,Team:Waterloo#Modeling#PAM Flexibility_-_-_TEXT.html," a randomly mutagenized PAM Identification Domain. Only cells capable of binding the NGA PAM sequence were able to cut the plasmid, and thus survive. By sequencing surviving clones, the authors were able to identify mutations in the PI domain that altered PAM sequence specificity.
Two mutants in particular showed both high specificity and activity for the NGA PAM sequence. The first mutant, referred to as VQR (D1135V,R1335Q,T1337R), worked equivalently on all four NGAN PAM sequences. The second mutant, EQR (D1135E, R1335Q, T1337R) was most specific to NGAG PAMs. A second round of testing also found a VRER variant ((D1135V,G1218R,R1335E,T1337R) that was specific to NGCG PAMs.
A PyMOL generated image of the wild type residues near the PAM binding site of spCas9.
A PyMOL generated image of the three mutations found in the EQR spCas9 variant
A PyMOL generated image of the three mutations found in the VQR spCas9 variant
These result indicate that spCas9 can display altered PAM specificity with relatively few mutants. Additionally, the data produced by Kleinstiver et al. also provided significant insight into the types of mutations that altered PAM specificity. This allows for a more targeted approach to engineering new spCas9 PAMs.
Computational Engineering of PAM Flexibility
The goal our work was developing a procedural pipeline to produce and identify Cas9 mutants with altered PAM specificity. This would be done by performing simulations of spCas9 mutants docking to a PAM DNA sequence to predict a theoretical binding affinity for many different PAM variants. Finally, the specificity and affinity of each spCas9 mutant would be determined by clustering in order to find mutants which will be highly specific for particular PAM sequences, which will then be tested in the lab.
PAM Flexibility software pipeline: the 3D Cas9 structure is mutated, then 256 variants with different PAM DNA structures are created, then PyRosetta is used to score PAM affinities.
Obtaining a Structural Model of spCas9
As of June 2015, at least three different groups have produced experimental data on Cas9 structure.
In particular, the PDB we used was produced by Anders et al. By using a catalytically dead version of spCas9 (dCas9), Anders et al. managed to determine the crystal structure of a"

Abstract
Since the beginning of Synthetic Biology, people aimed to transpose electronic devices into genetic constructions. In recent publications ( Siuti and al. 2013 , Bonnet and al. 2013 ), a new design of one-way logical gates using Serine recombinases were described allowing to avoid reversibility of recombination and creating strong and robust genetic logical gates (AND, XOR, OR).
The E.calculus project consists in creating a n-bits full-adder using those kinds of logical gates, which should be able to execute a 2 bits counting and also transmit any carry on the next step of the counting.

Aalto-Helsinki,2018,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," a 3-day BioHackathon Aalto-Helsinki team has developed a web application Finder. It is an online search engine for the lab items so as to help the lab workers easier and faster find the needed reagents and other items. This came out from our own personal experience while working in a new lab during the summer. We believe this would increase the efficiency of lab workers, especially it would be helpful for those working for a short-term so as to onboard in a fast and intuitive way. Finally, this would be really helpful in a new type of labs- community labs where fast onboarding is essential. One of the community labs is just emerging at the moment at Aalto University where we join in the early development of it.
Teams that took part in the collaboration come from Lund, Groningen, Vilnius, and Helsinki.

Other Conferences
During the summer we got the chance to meet other iGEM teams and network with them in four different occasions: besides the already mentioned BioHackathon in Vilnius and the collaboration on public engagement we had with the Tartu team, we attended both the Nordic iGEM Conference in Lund and the European meetup in Munich. The conferences were a great opportunity to present our project and receive valuable feedback on it, as well as a way to get to know what other iGEM teams were working on. In this way we identified some of the teams with which we could potentially have a collaboration, such as the Toulouse team.

Parts
BBa_K363001-BBa_K363007
Calcium dependent response elements (binding sites) for the Crz1 activator.
This part is a binding site for the Crz1 transcriptional activator. When placed upstream of a eukaryotic promoter sequence (~700bp in the case of FKS2), this sequence results in the calcium dependant transcription of downstream coding sequences given that Crz1 and the upstream signal transducing phosphotase calcineurin are constitutively expressed. The signal cascade occurs when calcineurin binds to cytosolic calcium, activating its phosphotase activity. The active calcineurin dephosphorylates cytoplasmic Crz1, resulting in translocation of Crz1 to the nucleus where it binds to this part and promotes the assembly of general transcription factors at the promoter sequence.
BBa_K363001
The consensus calcium dependent response element binding site for the Crz1 activator.
This part was derived from calcium dependent response element (CDRE) binding sequence of the FKS2 gene. The consensus sequence for Crz1 binding as described by Yoshimoto et al (2002) was mutated at non conserved residues to generate this part. This UAS is the consensus sequence for Crz1 binding, and is expected to have higher binding than the UAS characterized in BBa_K363006, as it is the consensus sequence and occurs with ~4 times higher frequency than the characterized sequence in the yeast genome.
BBa_K363006
A characterized calcium dependent response element binding site for the Crz1 activator.
This part was characterized as part of a larger sequence (see design notes for this part in the registry), as it occurs naturally as an activator of the yeast gene FKS2, which is codes for an enzyme involved in spore wall synthesis. We found that applying a voltage of 8V for 40-80 seconds provided"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," model more accurate, especially for the lower miRNA concentrations we decreased kopen to 105, the lowest possible value in our range.
Another way to improve the lower miRNA concentrations was increasing the decay rate of just the miRNA. We had assumed it decayed at the same rate as the other RNAs in our system. Increasing just the miRNA decay rate had similar effect to decreasing kopen.
With our initial parameters our model was a poor representation of our system. Once we updated our parameters, it was able to represent our results relatively well.
Stochastic model
The Oxford iGEM team kindly ran stochastic simulations of system for us. They ran both intrinsic and extrinsic simulations and provided us with the final uncertainties.
Intrinsic Simulation
Intrinsic stochastic models find the uncertainty caused by the changes in reaction rate due to the fact reactants collide randomly. This is more accurate than mass action kinetics for low reactant concentrations.
For our stochastic simulation, each time step a reaction rate was determined randomly using the Poisson distribution. As this is random, multiple stochastic simulations have to be run for a large enough sample size. A time step of 0.01 seconds was used.
The intrinsic simulations gave an uncertainty of only 0.0096%. This validated our use of mass action kinetics to model our system. As the intrinsic uncertainty is negligible we could assume rate of reaction was proportional to concentration of the reactants, i.e. the law of mass action.
While we later updated the parameters with our experimental data, the concentration of reactants did not decrease to invalidate this result.
Extrinsic Simulation
Extrinsic stochastic models find the uncertainty cause by the uncertainty of our parameters. The extrinsic uncertainty is by far the more significant of the two uncertainties in our model.
The extrinsic simulation assumes our parameters were normally distributed and runs multiple simulations randomly choosing parameter values.
The specific conclusions of our extrinsic simulations, such as the test being complete in 37 minutes in 90% of cases, are unfortunately no longer useful after our experimental results showed some of our starting parameters were significantly off. However, the extrinsic simulation demonstrated that biggest weakness with our model was our parameter's uncertainties.
Cost model
There's two parts to our cost modeling; the cost analysis which works out the cost of the test, and the much more impressive screening cost-effectiveness model that works out the value of rolling out a screening programme.
Our screening programme's cost per quality year of life gained would be just be £8300 at the current lowest threshold for lung cancer screening, and taking into account cancer recurrence. Treatments under £20,000 per quality year"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#toolbox#photoswitching_-_-_TEXT.html," for the quantification (Figure 3).
Figure 3: Absorption spectrum of the positive lycopene sample from 400 to 550 nm normalized with the measurement of a 1:1 acetone water sample. It shows the typical absorption spectrum of lycopene.
Figure 3 shows that the absorbance maximum of the lycopene is 476 nm, which correlates with the data found in the literature (Chemat-Djenni et al., 2013). We then quantified the lycopene production with one biological and three technical replicates (Figure 4). It verifies the implications of Figure 2 that the cells containing the amber-variants are not able to produce lycopene. That makes them suitable for the incorporation process of AzoF, such that an increase of the lycopene production is to be expected after cotransformation with the AzoF-RS and feeding with AzoF.

Basic Lycopene Production of the Cotransformants
The cotransformants, now containing the lycopene pathway with one of the three crtI variants and the AzoF-RS, were cultivated in a 6-wellplate in LB-media at 37 °C and 400 rpm. To measure the basic lycopene production when native amino acids are unspecifically incorporated at the amber-codons, no AzoF was added to the media. After 16 hours of cultivation, 15 mL of the culture were harvested and the lycopene was extracted with acetone ( lycopene extraction protocol ).
Figure 5: Absorption spectrum of the extracted lycopene of the three samples. LP is the lycopene producing strain with an intact crtI, TAG318 has the amber-codon at position 318 in crtI and TAG353 has an amber-codon at position 353 in crtI.
Figure 5 shows the measured absorption spectrum of lycopene for all samples. All of the variants produce lycopene, even the ones with the amber codon. This means, that the AzoF-RS unspecifically incorporates native amino acids when no AzoF is supplemented and"

Production Plasmid
Part of our project concerned an assembly that produced L-DOPA (levodopa or L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) from L-tyrosine in E. coli.
L-tyrosine can be converted to L-DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. An equivalent of tyrosine hydroxylase in bacteria is 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase which is expressed by the genes hpaB and hpaC in E. coli. To simplify our assembly, we designed our construct to position hpaB and hpaC coding sequences in succession under the control of CP25 promoter which constitutively expresses downstream coding genes.
We constructed our production assembly by cloning a CP25-hpaBC-rpoc transcriptional unit into a vector containing a pMMB67EH ori and spectinomycin resistance marker. Our construct was assembled using golden gate cloning techniques. To do so, we first used golden gate to assemble all individual parts (CP25 promoter, hpaBC, rpoc terminator, and backbone) into entry vectors with the Type II restriction enzyme BsmBI. From there, the entry vectors were used to assemble a cassette plasmid with the Type II restriction enzyme BsaI. Cut sites for BsmBI and BsaI had been added previously to all parts by the Ellington Lab through the use of primers and PCR amplification.
We made a similar assembly using the same methods; in this assembly, however, we used PA3 promoter, another constitutively expressed promoter, in place of CP25 because we were afraid CP25 was too strong of a promoter.
Here is a brief overview of each main constituent of the hpaBC transcriptional unit:
CP25 promoter strong promoter; initiates transcription of hpaBC; interchanged with PA3 promoter.5 promoter. PA3 promoter (BBa_K2458000): moderately-strong promoter; initiates transcription of hpaBC; interchanged with CP25 promoter.
hpaBC (BBa_K2458001): gene expressing the enzyme hpaBC (4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase).

Edinburgh_UG,2017,Team:Edinburgh UG#HP#Interdisciplinarity_-_-_TEXT.html," from all disciplines and is                 interdisciplinary by nature. For example, human practices and modelling represent social sciences and mathematical                 sciences, respectively. Moreover, iGEM indirectly qualifies projects in terms of medals and prizes, providing                 a model system to measure the benefit of interdiciplinarity.
To measure the interdisciplinarity of past iGEM teams, we recorded the discipline of each iGEM participant from                 2013 to 2015. It is noteworthy that a diversity in disciplines does not always imply interdisciplinarity.                 Even in a diverse team, members may not exchange in skills or closely cooperate. But, diversity is a close                 and practical measure. The measurement of interdiciplinarity is correlated to their tracks, and medals to                 observe the relationship between interdisciplinarity and performance in iGEM.
Measurement of Interdisciplinarity
Interestingly, the measure of interdiciplinarity is a product of interdisciplinarity itself. Diversity of disciplines                 is analogous to biodiversity, which ecologists have been studying. Here, we use an ecology-inspired interdisciplinarity                 index: Rao-Stirling index, to quantify the following aspects of interdiciplinarity [4]:
Variety: how many different disciplines are within each iGEM team?
Balance: are participants of each discipline of similar proportions?
Disparity: how different are the disciplines in the iGEM team? E.g. the difference between                     linguistics and synthetic biology is far greater than that between cell biology and synthetic biology.
We chose the Rao-Stirling index due to its incorporation of all three aspects and its well-known uses in social                 sciences [5-6]. Moreover, Rao-Stirling index, similar to its ecological counterpart Rao’s quadratic entropy,                 behave mathematically in a fashion closely resembling the human intuition of diversity [7]. For example,                 the index is very sensitive to the addition of a highly different discipline and an increase in overall range                 of values covered.
Rao-Stirling Index: $$D = \sum _{ij,i \neq j} d_{ij}p_{i}p_{j}$$
where $D$ is the interdisciplinarity measure. $p_i$ and $p_j$ are proportions of discipline $i$ and discipline $j$ in the                 team, respectively. $d_{ij}$ is the difference between discipline $i$ and discipline $j$, measured in Euclidean distances.

INPN
WHY INP
Ice-nucleation protein (INP), an outer membrane protein from Pseudomonas syringae, is responsible for promoting nucleation of ice at relatively high temperatures (above -50C). The proteins are localised at the outer membrane surface and can cause frost damage to many plants. It is composed of three domains structurally distinguished as the N-terminal domain (191 amino acids, 15% of the protein), which is the portion most responsible for targeting to the cell surface, the C-terminal domain (49 amino acids, 4% of the protein), and the central domain, composed of repeats comprising an 8-, 16-, and 48-residue periodicity that acts as a template for ice crystal formation.
WHY INPNC
INP has been successfully used to display several proteins, such as levansucrase, carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase), Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV"

Modelling Overview
Modeling as an iterative process: The design-build-test cycle
One of the core aspects of synthetic biology is the iterative design-build-test-learn cycle, where the information gained from one experiment is used to design the subsequent experiments.
Within the learn stage of the design-build-test cycle, models can be used as a way to interpret data, and, more crucially, make predictions about the system that can be used in the design stage of the cycle.  Modeling is itself an iterative process, where the predictions from the model are used in experiments. Constraints on time have put a limit on the number of iterations of the design-build-test cycle that we could perform. However, by using modelling we have been able to make predictions on how the expressed proteins of our biobricks would behave in an experimental setting. Furthermore, we have been able to feed the model with some data extracted from our own experiments.
Figure 1: Classic representation of the design-build-test cycle
Two models - same input
In our project, we had two different modelling objectives.
The first objective was to apply enzyme kinetics in order to predict the optimum amount of time for the blood-sample to be in contact with our ScAvidin-linker-LacZ part (BBa_K2355313), or in other words, the incubation time.
We did this by calculating the rate of cleavage of our substrate by different snake venoms, and thereby calculated the expected concentration of β-galactosidase being eluded into the a secondary reaction chamber, containing ONPG. We would expect the use of β-galactosidase as a reporter molecule to lower the detection time of our device, compared to if we use a colorimetric reporter, such as AmilCP.
The second objective, was to model the data from our substrate screening assay. The goal was to fit the data in order to find central parameters such as reaction rate, and compare those parameters across the 360 different substrates that we have assayed.

Repression efficiency of sgRNA variants (A1-6) was measured using a β-Glucuronidase activity assay in E. coli strains harbouring pMTL82251-sgRNA (A, B) or pMTL71401-sgRNA (C, D) plasmid backbones. Strains harbouring vectors pMTL82251 –sgRNA (A, B) or pMTL71401-sgRNA (C, D) were used as controls, expressing dCas9 but no sgRNA. Briefly, strains were grown in media with the appropiate antibiotics and overnight cultures (A, C) or cultures at the mid-log growth phase [OD600 ≈ 1.0] (B, D) were harvested by centrifugation. Subsequently, cell pellets were re-suspended in 500 μL of a suitable buffer and 75 μL of the cell suspension were reacted with 28.4 μM of 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucuronide. Fluorescence intensity was monitored over a period of 10 min at 440-460 nm using an excitation wavelength of 355-375 nm. Data represent mean values of three technical replicates ± SD. Statistical analysis was carried out using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons against the control strain (c); p-values are indicated as: 0.1234 (ns), 0.0332 (*), 0.0002 (***), <0.0001 (****).
The sgRNAs tested exhibited different levels of repression for the PtcdA promoter (Figure 4). sgRNAs A2, A3, A4 and A6 all repressed gusA expression, although with different efficiencies. For the sgRNAs expressed from the pMTL82251 vector sgRNA A4 and A6 have the biggest effect on gusA expression, whereas sgRNAs A1 and A5 do not seem to repress (Figure 4-A, B). The repression efficiencies observed for the sgRNAs in the pMTL71401 vector have a similar profile as observed for the pMTL82251 vector; sgRNAs A3 and A4 significantly reduce the detected enzyme activity whereas sgRNAs A1 and A5 do not effect gusA expression (Figure 4-C, D). Moreover, no clear difference is observed between the samples harvested in the exponential growth phase and the samples harvested at the stationary growth phase. Suggesting that with"

Functionalizing Fibers
Project Goals
Due to its remarkable physical properties, silk has a wide array of potential applications.  We hope to further the potential of silk by conjugating it to other functional peptides. This approach allows us to greatly expand the potential of silk. For example, a team in Japan, led by Dr. Tamura, has been able to successfully express recombinant silk-GFP fusion fibers from genetically engineered silkworms, suggesting that it is indeed possible to produce functional materials out of recombinant silk [1] . Although several groups have been able to express and isolate silk from microbial organisms [2] , the functionalization aspect has yet to be thoroughly investigated in model microbial organisms such as E. coli.
One of our goal this year has been to functionalize silk by genetically conjugating it with GFP and getting it to glow green. If this works, it would serve as a proof of principle for the next step of our project- replacing GFP with SpyTag, to have an “all-purpose” protein fusion intercalated into our fiber. SpyTag is a peptide that irreversibly forms an amide bond with its partner protein, SpyCatcher. Theoretically, this would allow us the flexibility to produce a number of various fibers via post-translational treatment. For example, a SpyTag-silk fiber could be treated with a SpyCatcher-RFP fusion to produce a red fluorescent fiber without ever having to directly fuse RFP to the silk at the genetic level.
Co-Spinning
A method of producing functionalized fibers is to simultaneously spin, or ""co-spin"" ordinary silk proteins with other proteins. These proteins will be expressed separately, but mixed together and spun into a fiber from a single dope.  This is an alternative to simply fusing the silk to a protein, and spinning only the protein fusion. This is useful because the fused protein can often interfere with the silk’s physical properties.  Therefore, spinning the functionalized proteins with normal silk proteins helps maintain the physical integrity of the resulting fiber.  In order to"

However, these methods can be applied only after harvesting cells"" - Secretory and extracellular production of recombinant proteins using Escherichia coli, 2004, p.630
""E. coli normally does not secrete proteins extracellularly except for a few classes of proteins such as toxins and hemolysin. Secreted proteins can leak from the periplasmic space into the culture medium possibly due to an increased permeability of the cell membrane during a lengthy incubation period. Small proteins secreted into the periplasm are frequently released into the culture medium (Tong et al. 2000). In general, movement of recombinant proteins from the periplasm to the culture medium is the result of compromising the integrity of the outer membrane. However, care must be exercised during such recombinant protein production so as not to compromise cellular integrity, which often causes cell death"" - Secretory and extracellular production of recombinant proteins using Escherichia coli, 2004, pp.630,632
Nina: It is good that e.coli does not secrete many types of proteins since we then would have this bacteria secreting somewhat only our proteins and other molecules of interest.
""Another method of extracellular protein production involves fusing the product to a carrier protein that is normally secreted into the medium (e.g. hemolysin), or to a protein expressed on the outer membrane (e.g. OmpF). For example, human β-endorphin could be secreted into the culture medium when fused to OmpF (Jeong and Lee 2002; Nagahari et al. 1985). Recently, a method of releasing active scFv antibody and human interleukin-6 into the culture medium using the hemolysin secretion pathway was reported (Fernandez et al. 2000; Li et al. 2002). The hemolysin transport system (Hly) is a type-I secretory apparatus that forms a protein channel between the inner and outer membranes o fE. coli. Hemolysin toxin (HlyA) is secreted by direct passage of the HlyA polypeptide from the cytoplasm to the extracellular medium using the hemolysin transport system (Fig. 2). For extracellular production using the hemolysin secretion pathway, the target protein is fused to the C-terminal"

This summer, we hosted a summer camp for high school students to build their interests in synthetic biology. In addition, we held a conference for iGEMers cross-strait to learn from each other and be more prepared for the upcoming competition. With these efforts, we have passed on our enthusiasm of synthetic biology to our peers and raise their interests on the topic.

Education and Engagement
Each and every person is a part of a community, from the time they are born to the time they pass. More than being in a community,                  we are responsible for it and the better living of the people in it. To do our part as a team and as a member of the iGEM community,                  we took responsibilities throughout the establishment of our project. By doing so, we have had a two-way dialogue with the public, the students of our school and educators from all around our country. In all these events, we have attended and organized, we showed                  incredible efforts to reflect iGEM values while raising the interest of many people and serving as a model.
To dig deeper into the topic, here is what we have done outside iGEM and the rationales for our approaches:
Presenting Synthetic Biology to Middle School Students
As the youngest group to participate in iGEM is high school students, a few days after the DNA Day, we have prepared and given a                  presentation to middle school students. We thought of the middle school students as the future representers of the competition, our school,                  and our country. Our goal was to reach out to them and provide them with information about synthetic biology and iGEM.
The presentation was interactive and we had so many questions coming from the students as well as answers. We were amazed by how one                  student even knew what CRISPR Cas9 was!
During the presentation, we have additionally shown them projects about synthetic biology beyond iGEM as well as providing                  information about those projects. It was incredibly inspirational, for us, how students were enthusiastic about our project and synthetic                  biology overall.
Celebrating DNA DAY
Interview with the Middle School Students:
2 days before the DNA Day, we prepared general knowledge facts about DNA, genes and so on. Those were simple but interesting                  facts such as “The human"

Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their   system.(translating all the abstract, send information and plasmids to paris (by JW) (inform at HQ, send a mail)
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice,   safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach,   including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and   beyond iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on past Policy & Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities. We’re working on   safety and intellectual property rights, and plenty of human practices ofcourse (WIKI)

Modeling the Gene Regulatory Network
Our group seeks to assess the optimality of the synthetic system that modulates pucB/A gene expression and LH2 complex assembly in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.  Here we employ a mathematical model of this system to generate predictions about the behavior of the active system in response to light input. Features of the system that the model may help investigate include the time scale of response to light signals, the robustness of the system in response to fluctuations in light intensity, and the translation between changes in gene expression and the absorbance spectrum of the engineered cells.
Though the context of the model can extend back to the transcription of PrrA/B genes involved in integration oxygen and light signals, a preliminary testing model was developed using assumptions of certain initial conditions to isolate the light signal's effect.  Since Cph8 and OmpR are located on the same transcript downstream of the puc promoter region, it was assumed that their associated protein and mRNA had already reached steady state concentrations.  Moreover, the concentrations of the factors were assumed to be equal at this state.  The model whose diagram was constructed in the Simbiology Toolbox distributed by MathWorks details key reactions leading to the translation of the pucB/A genes.  The reaction rate equation used for the phosphorylation of OmpR as a consequence of the light signal reaching Cph8 bound to OmpR is capture in a modified form of Michaelis-Menten kinetics.  A logic function that corresponds to light ON/OFF (1/0) multiplies the maximum reaction rate in the numerator.  Thus, the model assumes that no phosphorylation occurs by this mechanism in the absence of light.  The OmpC promoter binding equation was based on the Hill Equation for a Repressor (1).
Component characterization steps and literature searches are underway in order to obtain quantitative parameters for the reaction rates.  In order to simulate behavior of the system, putative values were included that exaggerate true concentrations and time scales.  OmpR was given an initial concentration normalized to one, and"

The team should like to thank everyone involved with the project this year, from Academic supervisors, to other iGEM teams' beautiful, well-coded wikis, to our sponsors and our friends. We should like to give an extra special thankyou to the lab technicians, and of course the Professors and Doctors that arranged time for us in their labs.
Academic Support
The team is very appreciative of input from every academic that has come by to our weekly presentations. It is invaluable for us to be able to practice presenting, discuss our ideas and direct the project based upon the cumulative experience of so many great minds. Special mentions go to:
Our supervisor, Dr. Luke Bawazer for suggesting use of the Si4 sequence, for strategic guidance, and for assistance with experimental planning.
Our other supervisor, Prof. Mike McPherson for securing our entry fee and funding, use of his labs, and valuable scientific insight and encouragement.
Dr. Sarah Deacon 's input on preps, explaining why for things we didn't initially understand and helping us to form our ideas into a more cohesive strategy.
James Ross for assisting us with primer designs and providing valuable insights into a variety of assembly strategies.
Prof. Bruce Turnbull for providing us after-hour lab space at times and cheering us on at Cafe Scientifique.
Prof. Fiona Meldrum for supporting our SEM characterization and providing us with various research supplies.
Prof. Steve Evans for arranging AFM time"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some widespread"

We can obviously see that cockroaches will behave strong migration tendency after people using cockroach killing chalk or BAYER-Premise. Migration rate infected by M.anisopliae emulsifiable powder was significantly lower than that by cockroach killing chalk or BAYER-Premise (P <0.05), even lower than blank group. While, there was no significant difference in migration rate between          cockroach killing chalk and BAYER-Premise (P>0.05).
Similarly, gnawing rate in M.anisopliae group was significantly higher than that in cockroach killing chalk or BAYER-Premise group (P <0.05), while between the latter two groups, there was no significant difference(P>0.05). Thus, M.anisopliae will spread easier in cockroaches population causing an epidemic-like disease.          As for mortality within three days, M.anisopliae showed it drawback, it did not have high mortality          compared with two other chemical product, but it can still effective after several days and show similar mortality finally.
The results above show that M.anisopliae emulsifiable powder will not cause high migration rate compared with other traditional cockroach-killing methods, though the mortality within three days is not high, it can reach to high level after several days. What’s more, it can produce an epidemic-like disease and be long-term effective in an environmental friendly way.

Introduction
Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) is a protein found in the aerobic gram negative bacteria Vitreoscilla spp. It is regulated by the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin promoter, which is oxygen dependent and activates the transcription of the hemoglobin under microaerobic conditions to increase oxygen uptake [1]. It was first discovered in 1966 and was initially believed to be a  cytochrome, until its primary structure was disclosed in 1986 and it was recognized as a hemoglobin [3]. The gene coding for VHb (vgb) was cloned for the first time and expressed in Escherichia coli in 1988, and its capability to increase oxygen uptake was quickly noted [4][5].
The discovery led to a new approach in combating the reduced yields in fermentors caused by low oxygen conditions arising from high density cell culture: instead of modifying external parameters in order to increase oxygen availability, hemoglobin is co-expressed in order to enhance the cellular oxygen utilization. In this way, the cells are able to aerobically catabolize the available carbon sources under microaerobic conditions, without generating growth-inhibitory metabolites such as lactate and acetate [5]. Furthermore, it has been found that in addition of being able to increase protein yields under microaerobic conditions, the presence is also correlated with improved cell growth and survivability [5]. This seems to be the case not only for Vitreoscilla and E. coli, but also for other bacterial species [6], yeast [8], plants [9] and even some vertebrates [10].
Structure
VHb is a homodimeric protein, consisting of two subunits of 146 amino acid residues each and with a close resemblance to the globin fold [2]. The globin fold is a three-dimensional motif shared among the members of the globin superfamily, consisting of six to eight alpha-helices packed at an approximate 50 degree angle from each other. Starting from the N-terminus, the helices are denoted as helix A-H. Between each helix and the following one is a loop connecting the segments, denoted by AB, BC, CD etc., corresponding to each pair of helices. The pocket in which"

Similarly, sicA proteins must form a dimmer when binding with invF to form the sicA-invF complex. So according to mass balance, we minus double px2 in the equations for proteins[sicA] but just minus single px2 in the equations for proteins[invF]. Therefore when the last inducer, aTc, is added, we can give all the equations for layered AND gates as follows:
Then we use time parameter to combine the three equations (I), (II), (III). We give initial value for all three inducers but make other materials’ initial concentration zero. The simulation result shows as figure2.1 and figure 2.2.
MIN System Model
We established two kinds of model to describe the principles of MIN system, one in single cell, and the other one for population.
We constructed the first MIN system model which simulate the system in single cell. Also a series of differential equations were written to construct the model. The construction strategy is still dynamic simulation method. We assume that the initial concentration in every single cell is the same. And we ignore the diffusion of AHL because the consumption of AHL will be very quick due to high E.coli population. With AHL gradually decreases, the transcription rate of MinC increases. We use kM(1-I[AHL]/I0[AHL]) to simulate the process. So four equations are used to describe the dynamic change of some important materials:
We give an initial value for AHL, and the simulation result shows as figure 3.1
We also designed a model for E.colis’ population.
At the beginning, we use a classical model, density-dependent growth model, for our population growing simulation. An equation, dN/dt=k1N(1-N/(Nm-M)), were used to describe the change of cell density. But we find it just cannot describe the function of our system. Because if we use this model, however we adjust the parameters or change the initial value of AHL, the cell density will finally come to the maximum Nm. The Nm is set according to normal condition. But in our MIN system, MinC and MinD can bind with each other to form a MinCD division inhibitor. The inhibitor can prevent cell division process. After some time, the number of cells that are still able to"

About Lab Note
We decided to make not only English Lab notes but also more detailed Lab notes in Japanese, and to show them in wiki this time. In the English version, it is possible to read about the purpose of the experiments and the kind of experiments we have carried out. Furthermore, in the Japanese version we show the purpose, the methodologies and  we make a careful and detailed list of the results.
The reason why we present the Lab notes in Japanese in slightly more detail is because we think that the Lab notes must be precise. In fact, it is very well established that Lab notes must be accurate, and must bear a high degree of detail so that it can enable the reproduction of an experiment. This is a very important requirement for Lab notes. However, previous iGEM teams, particularly non-English teams, show lack of important entries or errors in the expressions of Lab notes. It is a fact that even in our group there are few members complying with these pre-established rules. So, we judged convenient to write the Lab note in our native language “Japanese” in pursuit of the accomplishment of the rules and comply with the highest accuracy possible. We believe that these notes will be not only of help to Japanese teams participating in future iGEM's but will constitute standards leading to exact reproducibility of the experiments. Moreover,"

In response to 3rd and 4th proposition: They pointed out genetic engineering is just a different in the degree of breeding we’ve been doing for thousands of years. However, there is a point at which a difference in degree constitutes a difference in type, and genetic engineering crosses this line. We also already have lots of scientific progress at the status quo, and don’t need to cross this boundary.
In support of 1st and 2nd opposition: Things do get out, so treat them carefully.
In support of 3rd opposition: There is potential for a dangerous arms race, and government must check corporate science, ensuring a sufficient knowledge base is built prior to its application. Government is more representative of the people, particularly of their moral interests.

By modelling the pathway leading to MeS we can get a good estimation of the average MeS production. Apart from that we can also take a closer look at the pathway and find the rate limiting steps. We can use this information to fine tune the MeS production the way we want it.

ODE Representation
The methyl salicylate pathway contains the following reactions:
with:
PchA = Pyochelin A
PchB = Pyochelin B
BSMT1 = Benzoate/Salicylate carboxyl methyltransferase
SAM = S-adenosyl-L-methionine
SAH = Salicylate methyl ester
At first, our intention was to model the entire pathway from the implemented DNA sequence to the resulting production rate. This could be very useful to approximate the resulting production rate and to figure out the rate-limiting step. To achieve this we need a mathematical representation of all the relevant biological processes, including transcription rate, mRNA degradation rate, translation rate, protein degradation rate and enzyme kinetics.
We created a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to represent every step in our pathway: transcription, translation and the chemical activity of the protein.

See the formulary below for further information about the used terminology.
Comments:
The proteins pyochelin A (PchA) and pyochelin B (PchB) are extracted from the pchDCBA operon and are the structural proteins responsible for salicylate biosynthesis. Serion et al. (1995) describes that the expression of the pchA gene appears to depend on the transcription and translation of the upstream pchB gene in P. aeruginosa. They also state “Salicylate formation was demonstrated in an Escherichia coli entC mutant lacking isochorismate synthase when this strain expressed both pchBA genes, but not when it expressed pchB alone”. This is also confirmed by Gaille, Reimman and Haas (2003): “The pchA gene is strictly co-expressed with the upstream pchB gene; without pchB being present in cis no expression of pchA can be observed”. Finally Serion et al. (1995) reports that the pchB stop codon overlaps the presumed pchA start codon.
Therefore we conclude that transcription and translation of pchA and pchB is coupled and we decided to use only one gene (pch"

University of Toronto iGEM
This year’s iGEM team from the University of Toronto has been working on a cell-free method of detecting gold on a paper-based biosensor. Their goal is develop a cheaper, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly method to detect gold for the mining industry. Their detector is GolS, a transcriptional activator that binds gold ions in solution. Following gold ion sequestration, the protein binds to a specific promoter called the P(golTS) promoter region and activates downstream transcription.
IgeM UofT sent us two plasmids of their design. One plasmid (called GolS hereon in, BBa_K2048001) contains the sequence of GolS under regulation of a TetOn promoter and a downstream P(golTS) promoter linked to a LacZɑ sequence, contained in pSB1C3. The other plasmid (called P118A hereon in, BBa_K2048002) contained the same DNA sequences, however the GolS sequence has a point mutation changing a proline to an alanine at position 118. Wild-type GolS in Salmonella enterica is known to bind to other metal ions, such as Cu, but the GolSP118A mutation abolishes specificity for Cu while only slightly decreasing specificity for Au ions1.
One of the goals of our project this year is to synthesize gold nanoparticles. When we found that iGEM UofT was working with a gold ion sensor, we became excited at the possibilities of collaboration. After some brainstorming, we came up with the idea of characterizing GolS in vivo to add onto iGEM UofT’s current data (mainly in vitro, but some in vivo).
We were informed that UofT had performed an analysis of the ability for GolS and GolS_P118A to react to copper"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," reactions with salt supplement amounts according to the Surface Response experimental design (Table 2) were performed (Figure 5). Five reactions (12-16) were discarded from analysis. These were all repeats of CFPS systems with default amounts of salts and showed no CFPS activity due to an error during set-up. Discarding these results had a minor effect on the diagnostics of the surface response design, with some terms becoming more correlated (but all values were still below 0.2), the Power for terms decreasing slightly, and average variance of prediction increasing slightly. Despite this, the D, G, and A efficiencies all increased.
Table 2: Salt Supplements Surface Response Experimental Design: Table of reactions performed according to the DoE salt supplement surface response design. CFPS reactions contained concentrations of magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate, according to the table above. The pattern column shows how much of each supplement was present in each reaction; very low concentration (a), low concentration (−), usual concentration (0), high concentration (+), and very high concentration (A).
Figure 5: CFPS Salt Supplements Surface Response Design : CFPS activity (fluorescence at each time point minus fluorescence at 15 mins) of reactions with salt supplements in amounts according to the DoE salt surface response design. Legend shows the reaction number and ‘pattern’ for three of the salt supplements in the order of magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate (Table 2).
Results for the remaining reactions were used to build a model in JMP to predict an optimal composition for the three salts. The model predicted that at high amounts, magnesium glutamate and sodium oxalate were having an inhibitory effect, and potassium glutamate was having an enhancing effect on CFPS activity (Figure 6). It is well known that magnesium ions are crucial for protein synthesis, for example in the functioning of ribosomes, however at high amounts magnesium can become inhibiting to protein synthesis by stalling translation at the translocation step (Li, et al., 2014). Therefore, it is not unexpected that magnesium glutamate causes a decrease in protein synthesis activity at certain concentrations.
Figure 6: Cube plot generated by JMP using data collected for the SRD. The x-axis shows magnesium glutamate concentration, the y-axis shows potassium glutamate concentration, and the z-axis shows sodium oxalate concentration. The ovals shows predicted CFPS concentration. The maximal CFPS activity was found at 195 mM potassium glutamate, 6 mM magnesium glutamate, and 2 mM sodium oxalate. The"

Friday, 8/31/12  Should we all come together on one project or continue in these multiple tracks?   - option 1: everyone comes together at the end to try and invest max time in PUF in order to produce results. Hopefully this not only yields results but will help team unity and bonding   - option 2: everyone continues working on the side projects. perhaps all of them don’t get done, but there is also the opportunity to have more biobricks and more data. Everyone still had leadership and ownership over their own projects.   - what will the judges like the most? typically they like 1 really complete and detailed project, and then a small side project or an idea that accompanies the other one.

Dundee,2015,Team:Dundee#Modeling#Fingerprints_-_-_TEXT.html," Figure 7, suggests that the concentration of lanosterol does not increase after \(\gamma = 0.4\). Therefore if the value of \(\gamma\) is smaller than the suggested value, \(\gamma = 1\), but larger than \(\gamma = 0.4\) the same concentration of lanosterol will be formed. Recall that \(\large{\gamma = \frac{K_{3}}{K_{2}}}\), therefore the binding rate ratio can be less than the suggested value. The effect of \(v_{0}\) on lanosterol formation can be considered by setting \(\gamma\) and \(\lambda\) as the suggested values, (Eq 10) .
Figure 9: Complex formation with increasing \(v_{0}\), which corresponds to increasing lanosterol concentration. Increasing complex formation will correspond to increasing fluorescence and in turn allow us to visually detect squalene. The optimal value allows us to calculate the optimal concentration of lanosterol to use in the fingerprint ageing device.
Figure 9, similar to Figure 7 and 8, suggests that the concentration of lanosterol does not increase after \(v_{0} = 1.5\). Therefore if the value of \(v_{0}\) is smaller than the suggested value, \(v_{0} = 2.56\), but larger than \(v_{0} = 1.5\) the same concentration of lanosterol will be formed. Recall that \(\large{v_{0} = \frac{LS_{0}}{SE_{0}}}\), and \(SE_{0}=0.82 \mu M\). From this the best concentration of lanosterol synthase to have in the fingerprint ageing device is:
$$ \large{ \begin{equation*} LS_{0}=1.23 \mu M. \end{equation*} } $$
The results of the model describing lanosterol formation has been passed on to the lab to be used in future decision making.
Method
Using the law of mass action (1) the binding reaction schematic was written as  a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):
$$ \large{ \begin{eqnarray} \frac{dLS}{dt}&=&K_{2}PC - K_{1}LS\cdot SE, \nonumber \\ \frac{dSE}{dt}&=&K_{2}PC - K_{1}LS\cdot SE, \nonumber \\ \frac{dPC}{dt}&=&K_{1}LS"

Various parameters in the program can be easily specified, such as the rate of production of endonuclease, the rate of movement of the endonuclease, and the number of cut sites that need to be destroyed before the cell is considered to be degraded. After obtaining and analyzing empirical data, these parameters may be adjusted to match the real world as closely as possible. For now, the simulation will use ballpark figures, but will be run multiple times with different parameter values. This will give us an idea of the sensitivity of the data to the parameters we vary.
Below is a screenshot of Cell++ in graphical mode, the circles representing endonuclease. The cut sites are not visible in this screenshot.

Preliminary Analysis
In our first simulations, we varied the number of cut sites required for termination, and the point in the cell at which the endonuclease was created. The latter piece of data is represented terms of distance from a reference point; the first point was an arbitrary point close to the genome (distance = 0), and in subsequent simulations the endonuclease is generated at points of varying distance from this reference. Our data is summarized below.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html," nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.

Green Emission
Description
Green Emission is composed of a series of enzymes that generate light by the oxidation of a substrate. Our sub-device has 6 enzymes (LuxA, LuxB, LuxC, LuxD, LuxE, LuxY), two catalyze the oxidation step (LuxA, LuxB), one adjusts the emission spectrum (YFP), and three generate and recycle the substrate (LuxC, LuxD, LuxE). This complex converts fatty acids to aldehydes which are in turn used as a substrate by bacterial luciferase to emit light.
We plan on having the adjusting enzyme, as well as the 3 regenerating enzymes expressed constitutively. We would then only use the oxidation enzymes as reporters for whatever event we are observing.
While the oxidation per se does not generate light, it does generate an intermediate molecule in an electronically exited state. When said molecule returns to a basal energy state, a photon is released.
This light emission system has been taken from the bacterium Vibrio fischeri. The natural emission spectrum of Vibrio fischeri is blue, nevertheless this strain must emit green light, the spectrum shift is achieved by means of an ""antenna"" protein called YFP (taken from Vibrio fischeri strain Y-1) which receives the light emitted by bacterial luciferase and then emits light of a different wavelength (yellow in this case), YFP uses NADPH as a substrate.
See also the work of Edinburgh 2009 .
Signaling Cascade
When our device recieves Pops, the following cascade will ensure:

Green Reception
Description
Green Reception is composed of a two-component system. Firstly, we have a sensing agent (CcaS). This protein shows two basal states, both with histidine kinase activities but each with an affinity for different substrates: a phenomenon known as photoconversion. We plan on using the Green phase regulator (CcaR) who happens to be a Transcription Factor.
When our regulator is in a phosphorilate state, it shows greater affinity for DNA. Thus it is active. The target promoter region has been recently identified. We thus plan on constructing our reporter genes under this promoter. Such a construction would be an <IF Light> logic gate.
This two-component system has been described in Synechocystis sp. PCC "

Education and Public Engagement
Our first public engagement activity, was aimed at educating pupils (16-17 years of age) at the Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys. We presented our talk on the subjects “Synthetic Biology and iGEM”, “Magnetotactic bacteria”. We were at the early stages of our project at the time of  this event. It was extremely useful to see how the 'public' viewed our project ideas and how we could use these ideas to shape our project.
Here are examples of the questions asked by the pupils in each class:
Year 12 Physics class:

LB Plates Protocol
Makes 8 plates
Take a clean conical flask and add 200ul distilled water from the dispenser.
Weigh out the correct mass of LB Agar according to the packet instructions, and add to the conical flask with the water. Put in foam bung, cover with foil, tape with autoclave tape, and send to the autoclave for sterilisation.
Once the agar has been sterilised in the autoclave, remove of the foil and remelt the agar mixture in the microwave until the mixture boils.
When the mixture has completely dissolved, add to a preheated waterbath at 50'C to allow the temperatures to equilibrate.
Add 200ul antibiotic to the flask when the temperature is suitable, and mix by swirling.
Pour the mixture between 8 plastic plates.
Using a bunsen burner, wave the flame over the plates to remove any air bubbles and to sterilise.
Allow to cool underneath a Bunsen flame, to keep the plates sterile.
Once dry, turn the plates over, secure with parafilm and store the cold room until needed.

Human practices
Founding and communicating, in this year’s project, set the tone of our human practices. And that is what we would clarify through three aspects, as follows.
At the beginning of the project, a milestone for iGEM in Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) was settled, that is, an official student club, or the “iGEM club”, was founded. It serves as a stronghold of all iGEMers in HIT as well as a place to develop reserves. Recruitment of new iGEMers is organized and lectures for beginner training and workshop for project are held regularly. Meanwhile, it also organized academic visits and help with some team trivia during this year.
Furthermore, we manage to spread the idea of iGEM across Harbin. We delivered a lecture for the team of Northeast Agricultural University (NEAU) to help them prepare for iGEM next year. We also invite representatives of team NEAU to our termly meeting and share our ideas with them.
Also, in order to exchange ideas and extend eyesight, groups of iGEMers went to summer schools and conferences in Peking University and Tongji University in China as well as King Mongkut's Institute of Technology in Thailand. And those activities are sure to benefit our project in many ways.
Human practice, on the whole, offers us quite a lot besides knowledge and project. It makes us get aware that we are not only a group of people gathered to fight for a competition, but a big family for sharing sorrow and joy.
iGEM Club as a Stronghold
Founded in March 15, 2012, the iGEM club serves as the stronghold of all iGEMers in HIT. It takes charge of most of the administrative work of the team, including team establishment, meeting arrangement, member training, process monitoring and so on.
The aim of this club is to systematize the whole structure of the project, and also to spread the idea of iGEM to more people of HIT. Our project is divided into several parts, and they all advance in parallel. We also planned for a series of"

Part1:Construction of DDE equation
The ara operon is regulated by the AraC protein. If arabinose is absent, the dimer AraC protein represses the structural gene by binding to araI 1 and araO 2 and the DNA forms a loop. The loop prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter of the ara operon, thereby blocking transcription .When arabinose is present, arabinose binds AraC and prevents AraC from interacting. This breaks the DNA loop. The two AraC-arabinose complexes bind to the araI site which promotes transcription. When arabinose is present, AraC acts as an activator and promotes the translation of Cre. Then we use Cre-Loxp recombination, a site-specific recombinase technology to carry out inversions in the DNA of cells. The description of the system contains the above mass actions as well as some hill kinetics, Henri-Michaelis-Menten. Since concentration of protein is the integrals of its mRNA, we assume that it is proportional to concentration of mRNA in a previous time. readmore

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"023 and BBa_K592024 . However, we discovered that they did not put a terminator after the mTagBFP CDS. We wondered if the observed fluorescence outputs will be different with versus without a terminator. Therefore, we decided to perform an experiment for comparison. The experimental results showed that the observed fluorescence levels were lowered without a terminator.
Given our results, we would like to caution future users in referencing the relative promoter strengths reported by Uppsala Sweden 2011, as their measured expression levels, generated by parts without a terminator, may not fully represent the true strength of the tested promoters.
THE INVESTIGATION
We hypothesized that the expression level of mTagBFP is affected by the presence or absence of a terminator.
An experimental construct was built where the mTagBFP generator ( BBa_K592100 ) was driven by a constitutive promoter (BBa_J23101) and a medium (BBa_B0032). It was compared against its counterpart which harbored a terminator, BBa_B1006 3’ to the CDS. Constructs without promoters served as controls for auto-fluorescence. We then performed the same experiment but used BBa_B0034 as the RBS instead. Both of the results showed that the observed blue fluorescence outputs were lowered when the transcription was not properly terminated.
Figure 1. Comparison of the expression levels of a BFP generator with and without a terminator. (a) Circuit diagram illustrates experimental setup of the experiment harboring BBa_B0032. (b) Experimental results of the experiment harboring BBa_B0032.(c) Circuit diagram illustrates experimental setup of the experiment harboring BBa_B0034. (d) Experimental results of the experiment harboring BBa_B0034. Error bars represent SEM of 3 independent experiments on 3 different days.
Our results indicated that the proper expression of mTagBFP requires a terminator, thus the previously submitted part BBa_K592023 (BBa_B0032-BBa_K592100) and BBa_K592024 (BBa_B0032-BBa_K592100) are translational units only and should not be considered as acceptable alternatives to mTagBFP generators, which have terminators.
In this experiment, we have improved BBa_K592023 (BBa_B0032-BBa_K592100) and BBa_K592024 (BBa_B0034-BBa_K592100) by adding a terminator BBa_B1006 3’ to these parts. Both of the improved parts, BBa_K1899001 (BBa_K"

Rounding to a scale of 10-2 lx it correlates to creating an amperage of 10-4 mA using the silicon photodiode data sheet. This current is passed through a 10kΩ resistor to create a voltage of 5 mV, which is passed through a TI INA118 differential amplifier with a gain of 1000 to produce the maximum readable voltage of 5V using the gain equation found on their data sheet with a gain resistor of 50Ω, this creates the maximum distinction with the blank value. Since the Arduino Uno returns 1023 values the maximum expected value for fluorescence is predicted to be around 1023. The values used in these calculations are interchangeable for other proteins and as such, our modeling can be used to make our hardware applicable for other teams.
Note: The photons emitted by the LED are the limiting quantity in this situation, using 1 mL of an OD of 1 yeast culture, there are fewer photons emitted by the LED than can be emitted by the proteins.

Team Logo Design
We have figured out a Logo that symbolizes the multidisciplinary character of our work and our institution. It has been figured out inspired in Japanese language ideograms, ""kanji"",which are familiar to Japanese people. The image as a whole reflects Japanese aeshetics.and is written with strokes proper to Japanese written language.The logo shows the official name of our group ""KIT"" in lower case letters to represent in a simple way the identity and character of our group. The important issue is not to memorize its official name, but identifying and keeping in the memory the group by associating the faces of our group with the logo mark.We have tried the logo image to reflect a bit of the Japanese mind mainly the smartness and delicacy....

Team: Hong Kong HKU
In mid April, our team had our first meeting with HKU iGEM team. In that meeting, we exchanged our project idea with their team members. They raised a few questions upon our project and shared their past experience with us.
During the wet lab in the summer, we suffered from unsuccessful transformation of a designed composite. HKU iGEM team kindly offered help by transforming the composite for us in their lab.
In the final stage in our project, we presented our project to HKU team members. They suggested a few ideas for us to improve our presentation and gave some useful guidelines for the iGEM competition. We gratefully honour their help throughout our project.
Team: LMU TUM Munich
It is our great honour to be invited by Munich United IGEM team to collaborate with them and help them out with filling their survey form. Although our project is still under a laboratory testing phase with no intention to enter the market in a foreseeable time, their  focus on putting research work into real world application has definitely broaden our view--we can actually put our ideas into something on the market! Maybe you will see biochemical-synthesized repellent and attractant out on the market some day. Please kindly check out their website too! Team:LMU-TUM_Munich
Team: Evry
How lucky are we! Not only invited by Evry IGEM team, we are also invited by team EVRY to help them collect data by answering their questionnaire. Their questionnaire includes comprehensive information of their project and some cool insight of the most up-to-date biotechnology. Not only did it show us the most modern Biology, it also inspired us to focus more in green living style: to make a sustainable future with our living standard not being diminished. We are also very grateful to be have this chance. Team:Evry

JNFLS_China,2016,Team:JNFLS China#Experiments and Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", there is no more chance for users to observe the real-positive result.). Current effort could make the outcome of RNA-interaction become visible, yet how to cancel the ""dilution effect"" comes with the growth of the concentration of microRNA.
We come up with the idea that in the genetic circuit we designed, GFP expression is related to microRNA concentration. That is to say, the concentration of microRNA directly defined the expression level of GFP. That is to say, they are coupled together. Therefore, to get away ""dilution effect"" appearing in the process, we have to ""decoupling"" the concentration of microRNA and expression level of GFP.
FimE Site-specific recombination has been applied by BIT-China in 2015. It has a vital trait that for same gene segment subject, it can and only can transcript for once. We expect the repressor which controlled by microRNA could regulate the expression of FimE. We placed promoter in Expression Cassettes of GFP at the interval between upstream and downstream sequences. (And the initial sequence of promoter is reversed) When the concentration of microRNA increase, the repressor's concentration would decrease. Therefore, FimE will have a normal expression and initiated the expression of GFP by re-reverse the promoter’s sequence to make it become functional. Afterward, when ""dilution effect"" of microRNA appeared and the concentration of which has decreased to an amount that below the effective concentration, by then, repressor would re-expressed and the FimE content will continuously decrease to zero. Yet the re-reversed promoter will not be affected and made the expression of GFP continue goes on.Therefore, even though a large concentration of microRNA is existed, promoter will not be consequently reversed by a long term existence of FimE content and the signal will be stable. So we designed an ideal genetic circuit (Fig. 1).
Even though we have achieved constitutive expression, there is one problem still has our attention. That is for the circuit we designed can only justify the existence of microRNA. A definite quantitative determination of microRNA’s concentration is still unachievable. A change of repressor or initial promoter of the repressor is needed. Moreover, different circuit have a different FimE content, through which we may achieve the definite quantitative determination of microRNA’s concentration somehow.

Collaborating with other iGEMers is very  important. Science cannot be done lonely, helping other people in iGEM will  develop this field of study. What goes around comes around.
During our lab studies, we were always keeping  touch with other teams. We were helping each other and making some activities  together.
We assisted the Bilkent_UNAM_Turkey team when  they have some problems with their shuttle vector. We gived them our  BBa_K541026 (Reflectin 1A (SacB) and LALF (LipA) protein for B.subtilis).

Figure 2.Snap shot of interactive horseradish peroxidase kinetics model.
After careful examination of the models under various parameters, we decided to use HRP because it is fast and give accurate response, evident from the kinetic models. However it turns out that we couldn't produce HRP in E. coli. After some more literature search we found a substitue of horseradish peroxidase, ferritin , which is known to has fast kinetics and accurate response just like horseradish peroxidase.
Agent Based Modelling
For any detection system, the sensitivity and specificity are of great importance. Ideally, one should determine these parameters from repeated experiments, but to shorten the development time and to provide some insight on directions of further improvements, we developed an agent based model to describe the behaviour of the system. We have been able to challenge this model with varying the amount of target DNA that the TALEs in our system would bind to, as well as the amount of TALEs that would be on our strip. Through this we have been able to predict the amount of protein that needs to be loaded onto our strips before we started our prototyping.
How was our model created?
A simple 2D Monte-Carlo method was used for the simulation of the DNA movement along the strip, as well as for the action of the TALEs binding the DNA. Once a TALE binds to the DNA it is rendered unable to bind to any further DNA, effectively simulating saturation. For the quantitative output generated by the simulation, the number of target DNA binding to the TALEs is tallied with the number of non-target DNA that binds to the TALEs. To determine the sensitivity of our system we set the probability of target DNA binding to TALEs equal to 1, with non-target DNA having a probability of binding equal to 0. In future iterations we plan on altering these parameters such that we can determine the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity in our system. These calculated parameters will also be tested in the lab, allowing us to feed our experimental data back into our model in an iterative fashion.
A 2D region of the test strip, viewed from the top, was partitioned into a grid of squares such that a single TALE (0.1 nm by 0.1 nm, represented by the colour black) will be occupying a single square. The spaces on the left side of the grid are designated as the DNA loading zone, where the DNA species (red for target DNA, green for non-target"

After infecting for 20 minutes, we added 5 mL of 1x LB top agar and plated them on LB plates. We let them incubate at 37C overnight. I also tried a spot test of each sample on an E. coli lawn (to check for plaque formation) and on a plain LB plate (to check for phage lysate contamination). Results Actual Protocol - We performed this experiment as we planned on doing it. The agar frequently boiled over in the microwave which made it difficult to use.Next time we will use 2X and mix it right before we need it. Results - None of the samples showed signs of plaques after 24 hours. I will let them incubate one more night. Three of the phage lysates were contaminated. Observations - It is very likely that these phage samples are no longer viable. We ought to make a list of which phages we would like from Dr. Casjens at U of U and start from fresh samples instead of these ones.

22 March 2013 - Friday - BDM Procedure description - Check plates for any plaques that appeared during the second 24 hours. Identify phage samples we need to request from Dr. Casjens at U of U and send the list to Dr. Grose. We still saw no plaques and a lot of contamination. We’re going to get Dr. Grose a list of the phage we want... probably just T4.

Also Bryan gave us a great tutorial on how to use different programs to compare protein and dna sequences. From here we are going to try to get to  know the structure of the phage to better understand how to make point directed mutations.

Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce"

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," now arriving at the last two weeks of work time before the Wiki freeze, on the 18th of September. While time is running short, lab work is still in full swing and a number of important developments are taking place. Collaboration is a central aspect of iGEM, with teams from across the world helping each other to troubleshoot experiments, work on shared designs and to provide information. Here at Oxford, we have collaborated with several teams; for the Bordeaux university team, we have helped them carry out toxicity assays on their species including Putida and Rhodobacter. We have also used our extensive PCR experience from earlier in the project to help Warwick obtain their biobricks. Meanwhile, we have carried on characterising our own bacteria and we have been continuing the crucial process of detecting and quantifying our secreted therapeutics. Additionally, another member of our team has been working on developing our biobeads. These represent an additional method of containment for our bacteria and, along with the catheter and kill switches, allow us to ensure the safety of our bacteria as a therapeutic agent.
The main focus of the final few weeks will be to collect and organise everything in order to present it on the wiki for the world to see. So far our wiki has several pages already live. Several more are soon to follow, including our lab notebook, detailing all the experimental work we have been doing, as well as our policy and practice pages.
Even though we are in the final few weeks, a few last bits of public outreach are still to follow. One member of our team has been at a specialist UTI clinic and will be returning detailed information from experts and patients opinions on our project. As well as this, a school event will be carried out at the natural history museum to highlight the importance of antibiotic resistance and our project to GCSE students. Lastly, we have a survey soliciting the public about their preferred method of containment. This can be viewed here .

ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE, FINDING A SOLUTION
Antibiotics represent one of the great medical achievements of the last century; allowing an effective and broad method of treating infections, they revolutionised medical treatments. However, the century to come is likely to be dominated by the need to replace them, their utility severely restricted by antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance is not a surprise, but rather a natural consequence of the principles of evolution. The onus on the scientific community is to find a solution; at Oxford iGEM, we believe that a targeted solution is essential. To show this, we have developed a treatment to a"
