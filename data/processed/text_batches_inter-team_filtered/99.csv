TAS_Taipei,2016,Team:TAS Taipei#weblab_-_-_TEXT.html," calculates the inhibitor concentration that corresponds to a certain relative level of GzmB.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the main chronic inflammatory diseases made worse by elevated GzmB activity. We will use this as an example to show how the calculator works. GzmB concentrations in synovial fluids (joint fluids) of arthritis patients were determined from Tak et al., 2009 (summarized in Table 3). There is a significant GzmB concentration difference between the control group and RA patients. The equation that returns a concentration of inhibitor can be used here, as it takes in relative GzmB levels and returns the amount of inhibitor needed.
Table 3: GzmB Concentration in Synovial Fluids. GzmB concentration in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis obtained from Tak et al., 2009.
Rheumatoid arthritis (pg/mL)
Control (pg/mL)
Mean +/- s.d.

If a patient has a GzmB level that is X times the amount of control (around 34 pg/mL), then proportionally, X/100% = 100%/Y, where Y is the factor we want to decrease the patient’s level by (relative to his original level). Therefore,
, and the amount of inhibitor needed [L] can be calculated. For example, if an RA patient has a GzmB concentration of 3400 pg/mL, then the patient has about 100x the normal GzmB level. Therefore, the Y factor would be 1%, and [L] can be calculated to be around 130 uM.
It should be noted, however, that there is a large standard deviation for GzmB levels in RA patients, which means there are significant variations: if treatments are to be given, it would be better to conduct treatments on a case-by-case basis.

Tianjin,2015,Team:Tianjin#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"Our Goal
1. Stimulate PET hydrolysis by FsC, LC and Thc_Cut1 with addition of four kinds of Janus.
2. Enhance enzyme activity by making fusion proteins with Janus.
3. Compare the differences between four kinds of Janus for stimulating cutinase activity.
4. Study the mechanism behind Janus's acceleration.
Our Design
In 2005, Toru Takahashi etc. found that growth of the mold fungus Aspergillus oryzae on the biodegradable polyester polybutylene succinate-coadipate (PBSA) induced not only the cutinase (CutL1) but also a hydrophobin (RolA), which adsorbed to the hydrophobic surface of PBSA, recruited CutL1, and stimulated its hydrolysis of PBSA [4]. This gives us the inspiration that Janus may stimulate enzymatic plastic degradation. As well, in 2013, Liliana Espino-Rammer etc. added two kinds of Class II hydrophobins HFB4 and HFB7 of Trichoderma into the process of PET hydrolysis by Humicola insolens cutinase, and they turned out to stimulate the enzyme activity [4].
Figure 10. Two hypotheses of the mechanism of behind Janus's stimulation of enzymatic reaction hydrolysis:(a) Janus make the PET more approachable applicable to the cutinase. (b) Janus could change the cutinase's structure.
In our project, we would try two new hydrophobins, inJanus and sJanus, and their respective mutants, to test if they have the ability to increase the activity of above-mentioned three cutinases- FsC, LC and Thc_Cut1. It is the first time to study two classes of Janus in the process of plastic degradation, and it could reveal the differences between them and provide a better hydrophobin partner. Meanwhile, will our brand new inJanus-m and sJanus-m behave well in the process? We would like to explore.
Because the mechanism behind Janus' acceleration is still unknown, we would try different ways to add Janus into plastics, and various ways could lead to huge difference of Janus's effect. The first way is simple mixing, which means mixing cutinase, Janus and PET at the same time. The second way is PET pre-incubation with Janus, which means adding Janus into plastics primarily, and then putting cutinase in the container after "

By allowing      participants to use the microscope, they were able to gain a better appreciation for both how this technology works, as well as the microorganisms      and microparticles that compose the world we live in. The third component of our booth was the use of a virtual reality (VR) headset with the app      InCell VR. This application allowed participants to get an in-depth view of the inside of a human cell at the molecular level. Children were able      to see cell components including the nucleus, mitochondria, and ribosomes during this interactive virtual experience. Although it was difficult      to introduce complicated genetic concepts to  young children for the first time, they were as fascinated and intrigued as we were!

Canadian Undergraduate Technology Conference (CUTC)
QGEM was invited to attend and participate in the annual Maker’s Fair at the Canadian Undergraduate Technology Conference hosted by the University of Waterloo.      CUTC is Canada's largest technology conference for undergraduate students established to bring together creators, designers, engineers, entrepreneurs, budding      scientists and young visionaries across the country. There we were able to interact with and explain potential applications of synthetic biology to students in      both high school and post-secondary. The team also highlighted problems tackled by past QGEM teams and briefly outlined recent years’ projects for a better      understanding of the work that we do. As well, we were able to collaborate and share our ideas with other design teams from around Ontario.
Science Quest
Something our team has always been passionate about when it comes to synthetic biology is education. We believe that teaching children about the basics of synthetic biology      from a young age can not only prepare them for future education but also allow them to explore a potential area of interest that they may want to pursue as a career one day.      Although Science Rendezvous provided an opportunity to expose children of various ages to what our team does, and better explore the topic of DNA and cell biology, we"

--CS-- Today I did the plasmid preps of the 4 promoters that I had grown up; I will need to do the NanoDrop of these later. I also did colony PCR for all 4 of the denitrification genes that I have been working with this week. I used Taq polymerase and made the reaction according to the protocol. I used the forward pSB1C3 primer (#307) and the reverse primer for each of my genes to check that the gene had been inserted into the plasmid in the correct orientation and transformed correctly into the bacteria. While picking plaques for the colony PCR I also streaked out the different colonies on LB+Cam plates and grew them up in the 37°C overnight.

Images on top from left to right: nirS and norB. Images on bottom from left to right: norC and nosZ.
These digital images are awful, but there were some bands that showed up for nirS and norB. Only one of these actually ended up being the appropriate length though when compared with the ladder, so I need to start all over with the cloning PCR to amplify the genes from the P. aeruginosa DNA.

However, on the plate only colony 8 showed up without RFP, thus I selected this colony as one that would be considered a final construct.

Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," a stronger immunity against TMV in Nicotiana tabacum. The results indicate that the chemical modification of an elicitor, such as sulfated derivative of ß-glucans, could improve its resistance-inducer efficiency. Moreover, if a ß-glucan is a substrate for plant (1→3)-β-glucanase, its sulfation clearly protects the molecule from its enzymatic degradation. Thus, a basal activity of plant glucanases can degrade ß-glucans and consequently releases short inactive ß-glucans; whereas sulfated derivatives still remain active molecules during a longer period. This might explain the higher resistance induced by ß-glucan sulfates compared to ß-glucans.
Furthermore, non-sulfated Curdlan doesn't trigger the response through a mutant gene: pmr4. This mutant is resistant to mildew infections but is unable to induce Pathogenesis-Related proteins expression . Also, activation of a Pathogenesis-Related protein called PR1 in grapevine is regulated by the salicylic acid signaling pathway . The lack of PR1 expression in non-sulfated Curdlan-treated grapevine could be explained by a negative feedback of glucan. This is demonstrated by the study of a double mutant of pmr4 which restore the susceptibility to mildew. It suggests that linear (1→3)-β-glucan negatively regulates the salicylic acid pathway. So, sulfation of the glucan would counteract the negative feedback effect. [16]
To conclude, activation of natural defenses before the invasion of pathogens is a way to improve the plant resistance against infection and to reduce the use of chemicals products.
« Ok I understand the value of producing Curdlan. How will you proceed? »
« That is a good question, let me tell you how we approached the subject! »
In Agrobacterium , three genes (crdA, crdS and crdC) are required for Curdlan production. The putative operon crdASC contains crdS, encoding (1→3)-β-glucan synthase catalytic subunit, flanked by two additional genes : crdA and crdC. The first assists translocation of the nascent polymer across the cytoplasmic membrane and the second assists the passage of the nascent polymer across the periplasm. Finally we would like to sulfate our Curdlan molecules chemically in order to enhance its effects on the activation of the plant natural defenses since it has been shown that sulfated curdlan is much more effective (see"

Aim: Miniprep of over night cultures with number B2A, B1B, B3D (clones were isolated of overnightculture, 5ml LB-medium with CHLP).
The plasmid preparation was performed as described in the manufactueres protocol (Quiagen). Elution was done with 40 µl of elution buffer (Kit) at room temperature, with the columns having been incubated 5 minutes at room temperature before the final centrifugation. Miniprep products are stored in a 50 ml Falcon tube in the lowest drawer at -20°C

Still, we decided to PCR the miniprep product, since any DNA that is in the product should be amplified. We performed our usual protocol for a cross junction PCR, but we repeated the reaction for 30 cycles.
Some of the bands varied in size, but we decided to send it all in for sequencing.
Constructing the reporter Zif268 Plasmid
PCRs of Zif 268 and GFP
We decided to perform more PCRs to clone out Zif 268, since it will have to be gel purified. This reaction had the same conditions as yesterday's.
We also received the GFP plate today, so we decided to perform a colony PCR in order to get out the sequence that encodes GFP. We used our GFP Forward and GFP Reverse (Primer Index: 146 and 147) for the reaction, had an annealing temperature of 58*, and an extension time of 30 seconds. The expected product size was ~700 bp.
The last four lanes show the expected band size of ~825 bp for GFP. However the bands are comparatively faint.
Gel Purification of Zif 268 and GFP
We performed a gel purification of our PCR products.
We made a 1% agarose gel to gel purify our zif clone and GFP. The bands for GFP are much fainter than those for Zif 268.
After gel purification, Zif 268 had a concentration of approximately 110 ng/ul.
While we had a bright band for Zif 268 on our gel, our band for GFP was much fainter, so we decided not to gel purify it, and instead to re-do the PCR (4 times) for that reaction.
We ran another PCR to get out GFP.
Our yield for the gel extraction of GFP was 10.2 ng/ul.
Isothermal assembly and transformation
Our yield for the gel extraction was lower than what we wanted, but we figured we would try the assembly anyway. This meant that we needed 2.9 ul GFP and 0.9 ul backbone. Ideally all the DNA takes up 2.5 ul when performing an isothermal assembly. We decided to perform 2 reactions, so that one of them might work.

Penn_State,2010,Team:Penn State#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," is fluorescing, it will be hard to detect a change at all!  Quorum sensing solves this problem by sending a signal to all the surrounding bacteria that will cause them to begin producing AFP.
In this way, only when oxygen-sensing and quorum-sensing are used together will the AFP indicator be a strong enough signal to measure.
This system could also be implemented in other chassis, such as yeast (wine) or Lactobacillus (yogurt), so the food itself could be the sensor. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in food would obviously face severe regulatory constraints. To better understand public perception, we created and administered a survey to over 250 randomized students in cooperation with other iGEM teams, especially RMIT. For details, see our Human Practices page.
Project Contributors
Penn State iGEM would like to give a big thank you to those who helped us through the process of our project.  We really appreciate the help the following people have given us:
Mike Kang
Mike designed the oxygen promoters that deal with FNR in Dr. Salis' lab.  With his help we were able to take his design and assemble the promoters.
Trip Garland
Trip designed the oxygen promoters that deal with arcA in Dr. Salis' lab.  Although, we did not get to assemble his designed promoters, they were a potential use for our project.
Collectively, Mike and Trip designed and constructed the anaerobic fluorescent protein expression vector.
Dr. Leland Glenna
Dr. Glenna helped guide us in the process of designing our Human Practices survey and also helped us with our statistical analysis of the results.
Mike Speer
Mike was the driving force behind our iGEM team to help us accomplish our goals while we worked in Dr. Richard's lab. Under his guidance, and tested patience, we overcame many obstacles to complete our tasks. Specifically, we would like to thank Mike for his help with the assembly of the Tet inverter to the cI repressor.
RMIT-Australia
RMIT collaborated with us by helping with our Human Practice's project.  They distributed our survey to random students at their school, so we could better understand some of the different perspectives on Genetically Modified Organisms across the globe.

Each child created their own unique microbe with a cool new function it was able to accomplish through synthetic biology. We think one of the strengths of this activity was its accessibility for the wide age range of kids that attended the open house. Some of the ideas sounded like incredible future iGEM projects such as “curing the common cold”, “microbes that grow to a larger size”, “microbes with extra appendages to grab food”, “microbes that clean wounds” and our favourite “microbes that can do absolutely everything”.
While each child designed their microbes, our iGEM team members were also answering any questions that kids or their parents and guardians asked about iGEM, synthetic biology, and our project. This included answering questions about applications of our project, safety and ethics, the growth of field of synthetic biology, and where our work will continue the future.
We also ran a pipetting activity we called ‘Liquid Rainbows’. Our team explained how scientists (including synthetic biologists) use special lab equipment to measure liquid when performing experiments, just like using measuring spoons and cups for cooking. Using coloured water we helped each child mix different colours of water into microfuge tubes to form different colours. These kids appeared to get the hang of it quite quickly and really enjoyed using real equipment just like scientists!
Finally, we let participants take a crack at our Snake35 game (for more info see our Snake35 page ). Our iGEM team members explained how we have been studying how proteins interact or stick to each other, and although we cannot see the protein with our eyes we can tell if they have stuck together using light. This was a really valuable experience for us because we were able to take feedback from this event and improve the final version of our game.
Social Media: A crucial initiative to drive public recognition for synthetic biology
Background
During the course of summer, the Waterloo iGEM 2017 was represented by Melissa Prickaerts at the Biotech Bootcamp. One key takeaway from the Biotech Bootcamp highlighted social media as an important factor in sparking interest and curiosity for synthetic biology. In 2017, Pew Research Center in Washington D.C. reported that 67% of adults in America uses social media as their main source of news. While the advent of fake news controversies raised skepticism regarding the credibility of social media, this platform is undeniably influential over public’s perception. If used responsibly, social media can be an important tool to move public recognition in synthetic"

THE RISE AND FALL OF SHEWY
The project Shewy has its name from Shewanella, a bacteria that seemingly can carry out electrosynthesis. Based on the paper ""Towards Electrosynthesis in Shewanella"", we decided to further investigate the scheme for electron transfer in Shewy and to look at reversing it so that the bacteria were passing electrons into their environment.
The aim: generate reductive power
As much as this project seemed ambitious, there were numerous applications for the reductive power of Shewy. By fixing carbon dioxide with protons from water, and sending electrons from Shewy straight into oxygen, bacteria could possibly evolve oxygen, meaning that the bacteria could be used in oxygen evolving devices in spacesuits or rockets.
Mabel and Fred came up with the idea that by using reverse electron transfer we could send electrons to some other compound that we want to reduce. For instance, if the electrode is on and we are driving the electron transport chain in the reverse direction, we would add an enzyme that breaks down the fumarate (original electron acceptor) and then direct the electrons to whatever we want to reduce.
The main application we had in mind with Shewy was the synthesis of biopolymers. The idea was to use reverse electron flow to fix CO2 to lactate and then polymerise lactic acid to form PLA, which is one of the main plastics used in 3D printing. Printing circuits was another application of the Shewy idea. If the metals could be selectively reduced in an small, controlled space, they could be ""printed"" to generate circuits. By removing the proton gradient generating components in Shewy, and inserting bacteriorhodopsin, a focused light source would cause metal to be reduced in a controlled space.
In light of these ideas, we spent much of the first half of the Easter term reading around reversed electron flow. However,"

Finally, Xiang concluded on applications of bacteria in cancer therapies.  Apart from the existing techniques and methods, and the development situation, he also gave us his prediction on the developments of bacteria targeting cancer therapy in the future.  Through his presentation, we learned more about our orientation of work ahead.

First of all, as the representative of our team, Wu Yaoming gave a brief introduction about iGEM to the high school students, especially about the software track. Then, Chenxin explained some concepts of synthetic biology which aroused their high motivation to try it. Finally, several teammates went to the stage to describe the general destination of our software. The picture shows below is about making an introduction about iGEM by Wu.
Gratifyingly, during the lecture, the high school students focused attention to the task we were dedicated in and showed great enthusiasm about the competition. The objective of human practice is to make more people familiar with synthetic biology, now we were out of the first step.
After the lecture, we were surrounded by the students, well, also by their questions. Our earnest teammates explained them in detail one by one. Our uniform called ‘facebook’ is inspired by the Face off in Sichuan Opera. It conveyed our wishes: We wish the iGEM will be more far-reaching in not only UESTC but also high schools in Chengdu. We wore it while the students wore their school uniforms. And they will be the important scientific and technological manpower in the future!
Before our leaving, we took photos with the high school students. This was a wonderful and meaningful visit. Just like what the banner says, we wish the synthetic biology to be a part of our life! So, join us!
Part D. Communication with other iGEM teams
On July 25th 2014, we communicated with the SCU-China iGEM team and the UESTC-China iGEM team in our school. We discussed some issues we encountered in the preparation progress and drew on each other’s experience.
After that, we visited the laboratory where the UESTC-China worked in summer and we knew some knowledge about biological experiment which inspired us a lot in the software test we were going to work on.
After the short but meaningful communication, we knew more about each other and we also found our shortcomings form comparison.
See you in Boston!

6) Providing Wiki Creation Assisting Software: KELN to iGEM members
Last year, our team developed KELN, a software for easily making HTML codes for tables in lab notebook pages. It is highly useful when making HTML tables for lab notebooks (experimentation results), and we provided the software for Kobe iGEM team. They sent us feedback on the software, and we found some room for improvement. We are currently revising the software. We sincerely thank Kobe team for the pointers. The feedback was as follows:
-Feedback on KELN-
1. You kindly gave us a manual for KELN, and it helped us understand how to use it. However, we were a little bit confused which version we should install and how to change members’ name, because the manual was not for the latest version but for the original version.
2. We found that KELN was very helpful to write about routine work by using tables. However, we felt that the format is to some extent restricted. For example, we found it a little hard to put comments into a necessary space. It might be better to add some functions so that one can design pages as they want.
3. We tried to change some codes so that it would fit out aims. However, even though we installed Eclipse, we couldn’t even run the original code (probably we should construct some settings, because ‘import’ doesn’t work correctly). Of course, it came from the lack of our knowledge. But, we hope you will add some explanation so that other teams like us can change this tool easily."
Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Notebook#OptogeneticKillSwitch_-_-_TEXT.html,"could not be created)
8 August - 3 October: Further Construction & Testing
The greatest obstacle to creating a working kill switch was the fact that it proved impossible to create a part actively expressing MazF; the ligation-transformation process for this part failed consistently. The possibility was considered that the MazF produced under a constitutive promoter was simply too much for even non-deficient cells to handle properly. We therefore created a cloning strain that overproduces MazE. In order to do so, we made use of the ASKA cloning library 2
, a collection of E. coli strains that overexpress specific native genes when induced by IPTG. We grew a culture of the ASKA MazE strain (registered in the library under its synonym, chpR), then isolated the chloramphenicol-resistance plasmid and transformed it into a DH5α cloning strain as per standard protocols. The resulting strain (AE) was made chemically competent. During the final growth phase, the culture was induced by 0.1 mM IPTG. The ligation mixture of CP-MazF was transformed into these competent cells, which were then grown on IPTG-containing plates. However, no colonies containing the desired plasmid were found.
During this period, we also tested the response of our constructed pDusk-RFP by way of the light response protocol detailed on the Protocols page. A complete lack of distinguishable expression from this part prompted us to make use of the original pDawn- and pDusk-mCherry parts as created by Möglich et al. Results indicated that pDawn, rather than pDusk, forms the more suitable light sensor for this kill switch.

We took their advice and were delighted to find out from our gel electrophoresis results that our overlap PCR was successful!
Gel Electrophoresis of PhtpG1-RNA aptamers
With their help, we eventually succeeded in constructing the RNA aptamer plasmids! We managed to successfully construct our plasmids, as well as Team CUHK’s parts. Subsequently, NUSGEM assisted CUHK in characterising their parts. We measured the fluorescence intensity given off by the RNA aptamers under different temperatures according to the assay protocol provided by them, and found that that tRNALys3-iSpinach gives off a higher fluorescence reading than tRNALys3-Spinach 2.1 (Figure 1)!
Figure 1
Last but not least, CUHK also hoped to carry out their survey with a wider audience, so NUSGEM did the survey and spread the word of their survey to help them with gathering responses in Singapore.
Teams Toulouse-INSA-UPS and ULaval
What started out as a contacting session between Team Toulouse and Team ULaval turned into a great collaboration between three groups from different parts of the world. All three teams wanted to bring to discussion how synthetic biology touches different aspects of . The three main subjects we chose to discuss were bioethics in synthetic biology, economic aspects and lastly, society’s perspective of synthetic biology.
Skype call with them
Team NTU
With Team NTU just being next door in sunny Singapore, how could we not collaborate with them? Both teams first met in our SG iGEM Meetup (hyperlink), and we subsequently met up several times to finalise our collaboration plans.
Team NTU made a trip down to the BioMakerSpace for discussion!
NUSGEM helped Team NTU in 2 ways. Firstly, we gave them some CoE1 plasmids. Secondly, we validated their Adenine Base Editing project. We co-transformed 2 plasmids into the strain, sgRNA Kan* plasmid and ABE-dCas9 plasmid, and validated the constructs under"

16 plates each of LB agar, ampicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol were made.
To test the effectiveness of our antibiotic stock, five vials were created, and were kept in the shaker.
Vial one contained LB control; vial two contained LB and DH5α; vial three contained LB, DH5α, and ampicillin; vial four contained LB, DH5α, and chloramphenicol; vial five contained LB, DH5α, and tetracycline.
 May 18
Placed all the agar plates in the fridge, as no contamination was visible. Vial two was cloudy, as expected, indicating DH5α growth. The large block of ice formed over ten years' neglect in the 4°C fridge below our lab bench was cleaned with a chisel and mallet.
Four plates were prepared with DH5α: LB agar; LB ampicillin plate; LB tetracycline plate; LB chloramphenicol plate.
Vial Two was disposed of after bleaching. Stocks of 70% and 100% EtOH were obtained free from the Bendeck lab upstairs, replenishing our meagre stock.

What did you work on during the project?
I coordinated and organized various ad hoc tasks for our team and -for our annual biobrick tutorial. I was main contact for communicating our project to the outside world in addition to being involved in the administrative-, the outreach- and the human practice part of our project.
Philip Hau Sørensen
BSc. Human Life Science Engineering, 5th semester.
What is your motivation for joining the DTU BioBuilders?
At my first year at DTU, I had a lecture session on synthetic biology. It was immediately clear to me how synthetic biology was the future of recombinant DNA technology, a field I have been interested in since childhood. When I heard that DTU had a student team working with synthetic biology, I couldn’t help but apply right away!
What did you work on during the project?
I worked on outreach, human practises and as part of the wet lab team. I was responsible for the 4th International InterLab Study of the iGEM competition. As part of the wetlab, I was involved in the design and testing of our BioBricks. As a side project to this, I did some modeling on the enzymatic reactions of the BioBrick device I developed.
High school student
Minh Greulich
3rd year high school student, Nærum gymnasium
What is your motivation for joining the DTU BioBuilders?
I'm very interested in biology and so I wanted to experience a real lab and learn about the process. It has been fun but also a bit intimidating.
What did you work on during the project?
I assisted with the interlab study and I helped with some of the creative work related to the Wiki page.
Supervisors
Christopher Workman
Associate Professor, DTU Bioengineering
What is your motivation for joining the DTU BioBuilders?
I supervise DTU Biobuilders and iGEM projects because I believe in a future where synthetic biology is used to benefit society in new and diverse ways. The next generation of engineers and scientists will make the breakthroughs that will make this possible and it is exciting to be a small part of the development of this next generation.
What did you work on during the project?
My role was most often moral support and encouragement. There are so many challenges when going into the lab and experiencing repeated failures. This can be very trying on the patience and it is important to keep the spirits up in order to perse"
Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#Project Adhesion_-_-_TEXT.html," to make it compatible with RFC25. It was designed to get an ATG followed by an NgoMIV site upstream of the BFP CDS. The original ATG from the BFP CDS was removed. In the end we would still have to mutagenise BFP, because we never got the RFC25 assembly to work.
Results
Mutagenesis of BFP into RFC25 was successful, verified by sequencing. All other constructs were not successful. Mainly because we had trouble with the RFC25-assemblies. The mutagenesis to remove TACTAG also failed because the reverse primer annealed to a region upstream of the desired site causing a frameshift verified by sequencing. The repeat-like sequence of the 60bp linker was probably one of the reasons for this.

We want our bacteria to stick to cancer cells and release butyric acid in order to suppress tumor formation and prevent colon cancer in early stages. We use RPMrel and FimH in order to provide our bacteria to stick to cancer cells as RPMrel is a colon tumor specific binding peptide. After, our bacteria sticks to the cancerous cells in colon flora, it will secrete butyrate which induces apoptosis and differentiation and also inhibits proliferation.

We can do as much as we can to try to educate and inform people
Interestingly this brought an alternative reaction from the academics. Dr Wilson said that
the staff need educating as well. We need to know what is acceptable to say
, which could indicate the beginning of the social, structural change needed for there to be a difference. It is interesting that an offensive act like this one, could act as a catalyst for both staff and students to reevaluate why the university is as diverse as it is, but also it acts as a platform for significant change in attitudes, highlighted in Dr Wilson’s comments.  A second question from the audience asked:
How do you think that universities, in particular Exeter, can reach out to local communities to make sure that disadvantaged people can reach A-levels and Open Days?
Dr Hill responded by emphasising the University of Exeter’s role in the Exeter Maths School saying that since then, around 25% of students are going to Oxford and Cambridge. This action in setting up a maths school, which gives the students the opportunity to attend top class universities, is excellent because it shows how institutions are trying to get more students interested in physics, maths and computer science.
Conclusively, this panel discussion brought forward some of the opinions and ideas that we discussed with the academics, in highlighting their work on improving gender equality in their fields. Furthermore, we managed to establish a dialogue with students and gave them a platform for further discussion on this issue, which will continue to have lasting effect. The youtube video of the talk has over 90 views, as of the 16th October, and is expected to continue rising. This work, whilst concluded for our iGEM team, is far from over. We have highlighted the issues of gender inequality and lack of diversity at our University, however, the situation may be significantly worse at universities across the country and the globe. We hope that future Exeter iGEM teams take up the mantle, and try to make a significant difference in gender equality at the University. We hope with more discussions like this, and more work that shows the academics and students trying to make a difference, we can kickstart the social and structural change necessary for there to be a significant improvement in attitudes in the UK. The more people that are made aware of the issue, the more potential for action to take place.
We hope that future iGEM teams will look at the is research and approach more Universities, scientific bodies and even the government, to ask what they are willing to do to make a difference?

Week 1: May 1-2
Our first week consisted mainly of formal introductions and various brainstorming sessions regarding the direction of the 2014 project. The options were narrowed down to a biofilm based water filtration system and a rapid, multi-diagnostic test. Experts in the field of bioremediation, molecular biology, and medicine were consulted in order to gain more insight on the prospects of both project ideas. Ultimately, the rapid multi-diagnostic was voted over the water filtration system and we began preliminary planning.
Week 2: May 5-9
We attended a series of workshops tailored towards those who are researching various aspects of molecular biology. We learned the basics of genetic engineering and lab protocol in preparation for future research. These workshops were especially helpful for our team members who had no prior experience working in a lab.
Week 3: May 12-16
The techniques we learned during the workshops were applied within our own lab; we made stocks of competent E. coli., poured anti-bacterial agar, performed plasmid mini-prep, ran gels, etc.. The team decided upon an in-vivo diagnostic system that could detect pathogens through homologous recombination. Literature research was conducted on the subject of how to enhance the natural transformation of E. coli.
In regards to E. coli., it was discovered that E. coli. was closely related to H. influenzae, a species of bacteria well known for it's high frequencies of natural transformation (competency). H"
Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," about the impact of Varroa destructor on honeybees, we found the patent US 8647615 B1 dealing with methods for attracting Varroa destructor. We decided to send an email to the assignee, The United States Of America, as  Represented By The Secretary Of Agriculture via their website. We have not received any answer yet. But, as it was not in our aim to use their research to commercialize an attractive solution of Varroa destructor, we decided to base our research attractive module on the result of this US patent.
We had to use a DNA construction designed by Dr Christopher Voigt from Voigt Labs, MIT. Hence, a MTA agreement has been filled with Dr Clark Lagarias from UC Davis, so that we could obtain the strain containing the cyanobacterian light sensors from Dr Nico Claassens, Wageningen University in Netherlands.

Team safety and training
INSA safety training
During the summer, our lab was in the engineering school INSA which possesses a safety department with one prevention advisor and several prevention assistants assigned to the laboratories. Their goal is to ensure the well being of the employees regarding safety rules and risk prevention. In our laboratory, the LISBP, safety is supervised by Nathalie Doubrovine who was the one instructing us regarding safety procedures.
As new interns we had to take part in a general training session to learn how to identify the risks and prevent ourselves and our colleagues from harm. We also followed several other trainings that allowed us to use technical apparatus such as autoclave or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).
The laboratory safety training requirements of the LISBP are detailed in the Rules and Procedures of the LISBP.
New employees safety training
Every new LISBP employee has to attend this training session regardless of its status (researcher, PhD student, intern...). The training is divided into two parts. The first one is a training concerning general prevention in research laboratories. This one is taken individually with the NEO software and the explanations of the prevention assistant. It also informs the employee about the emergency numbers.
The second one is a training about the techniques used during our stay concerning microbiological, chemical and incendiary risks.
We then have a test to make sure that we were understood and aware of the previous presentations.
Autoclave
The whole team went through an autoclave training, detailing the explosive/implosive danger surrounding work with an under pressure apparel.

Transfection of HEK cells with receptor
HEK293 were transfected with the receptor plus mCherry to see, if the virus infect only cells expressing the receptor (the two plasmids should infect same cells). In parallel cells were transfected with the blue light and the red light positive control (PMZ422 and PSAM200) and the receptor inducible by the light systems. After 24 h cells (expressing the receptor) were infected with MuLV IRES EGFP.
HEK 293 tranfected with PHB308 (mCherry) and the receptor. Transduction with MuLV after 24 h of incubation. Pictures were taken two days post transfection.
Transfection HEK and Pheonix cells with receptor (transfection while seeding)
To avoid a too high cell density for transduction cells were transfected while seeding. The PEI transfection mix was given to the HEK or Phoenix cell suspension (1,5 x 10^5 c/ml, 100 µl mix per 1 ml cells) and seeded on a 12W plate. Results indicated that PEI was too toxic for cells during this method.

Blue
we engineered three light-sensing systems wherein transcription from an output promoter is controlled by different light wavelengths.
The three system is differently designed but they have the same result-----Different-colored lights activate expression of corresponding florescent protein.
Each TCS comprises a light-switchable sensor Histidine Kinase (SK) containing an N-terminal phytochrome-family photosensory domain and a C-terminal bifunctional kinase-phosphatase signalling domain.
Green
In the green light-inducible system, the SK CcaS is produced in a green-absorbing ground state, termed Pg.
In dark, no light activate the whole circuit so there is no florescent protein produced. Absorption of red light switches CcaS Pr back to Pg, which dephosphorylates phospho-CcaR, deactivating transcription.
Absorption of green light flips CcaS to a kinase-active red-absorbing state (Pr) that phosphorylates the response regulator CcaR, which then binds to the cpcG2 promoter and activates the transcription of GFP.
Red
In the red light-inducible system, The SK Cph8 is produced in a kinase-active Pr state .
In dark, Chp8 phosphorylates the response regulator OmpR, activating the transcription from the ompC promoter thus produced more lambda C1. The increase of lambda C1 repress its transcription of downstream promoter for RFP.
Red light switches Cph8 Pr to a far red–absorbing state (Pfr), which dephosphorylates phospho-OmpR, deactivating the transcription of OmpR. So the inverter has no affect and RFPs are continuously transcribed.
Blue
In the blue light-inducible system, FixK2 promoter is the downstream signalling promoter of YF1/FixJ blue light-sensing system. The YF1/FixJ system become inactive when illuminated by blue and active in darkness. An inverter is placed behind FixK2 promoter.
In the absence of blue light, YF1 phosphorylates FixJ that activates FixK2 promoter, allowing the transcription of lambda C1"

General Safety
In accordance with proper safety standards, our team's members ensured that the relevant Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) was worn during all investigations in the lab. This includes the use of disposable gloves and lab coat when present in the laboratory. Prior to any lab work, every team member also took a WHMIS crash course to prepare for work in a research environment. The teaching laboratory in the Medical Sciences Building of the University of Alberta was classified as a Level 2 Biohazard laboratory, so there was a restriction where food and drink was not allowed in the lab. The disposal of biohazardous waste was dealt with disinfection of cultures with a concentrated bleach solution. All contaminated equipment was bleached and autoclaved. Upon exiting the lab, all members were also required to wash their hands with disinfectant soap and water
Handing Perchlorate and Chlorite
The only hazardous materials that were used in our project were Sodium Perchlorate and Sodium Chlorite. Because of the danger that these compounds present, whenever experiments included their use, our supervisor was the one who handled these substances. Proper handing guidelines were followed according to each materials' Materials Safety Data Sheets.

Abstract: TU Delft 2009 wanted to build an improved cell to cell communication system.  They wanted to construct an E.coli strain that can pass GFP signals through conjugation only once. When “initiator cells” which contains the “signal plasmid” for the communication system, is added to a cell culture, the initiator cells (donor cells) conjugate with other cells “non-initiator” cells in the culture. During the conjugation, the signal plasmid is transferred to the recipient cells. The signal plasmid encodes for an entry exclusion protein, an endonuclease, and GFP. It has a restriction site of the endonuclease. The entry exclusion protein prevents backward conjugation, the endonuclease and the restriction site can reset the cell back to off state, and finally GFP can a reporter to visualize where the signal is.  The expression of endonuclease should be delayed because cells, which just received the signal plasmid, require time to conjugate and pass down the signal plasmid to the recipient cells. TU Delft 2009 tried to solve this problem by introducing a delay device.  The riboregulator system was used for their RNA-based delay system. By having another level of regulation between the reception of signal and expression of self-destructing protein (e.g. endonuclease), Delft 2009 believed that there could be delayed expression of the self-destructing protein. TU Delft 2009 also designed an algorithm called Ribo Key & Lock Generator that can generate sequences for lock and key riboregulators when RBS sequence is used as an input.

In this section we have proven that Sortase works as a catalyzer of a conjugation reaction between two fusion partners with a LPETGG-tag and a exposed glycine residue. The spider silk as well as the Sortase and tagged peptide (ZHER2) were kindly given to us by our supervisors and mentors, My Hedhammar and Kristina Westerlund, respectively.
The figure below shows two SDS-PAGEs performed to demonstrate the efficient conjugation of peptides to spider silk. Figure 7(a) shows a test performed with spider silk and ZHER2. The bands visible between 30-45 kDa in well 2 and 3 correspond to the conjugated product, demonstrating clearly that Sortase is attaching the tagged peptide to the spider silk.
In the course of our project, we were also able to create additional BioBricks containing a combat protein and what we refer to as 'LT' - a sequence consisting of a linker, a Sortase recognition motif LPETGG as well as a Hisx6 tag for purification.  We were able to demonstrate efficient attachment of our defensin BioBrick to spider silk as well, proving that the design of our BioBricks permit Sortase-mediated conjugation.
In Figure 7(b), the conjugated product can be seen observed in well 7 around the size 35 kDa, corresponding to the size of spider silk (~23 kDa) and defensin (~11kDa) fused together. The negative controls are unfortunately not visible because too little protein was left to be loaded onto the gel but the same control (unconjugated spider"

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into"

Below are picture of the transformed samples. The cell control was used as the negative control (as only cells were spread and these cells had no Chl resistance). The difference between the positive and negative control was the fluorescence and color of the colonies. The hypothesis is that the negative control would not emit fluorescence while the positive control would. This can only be confirmed after taking fluorescence readings.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html,"OR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html," for improvement were identified and it was suggested to change the part with DNA processes to show the interaction between the repressor gene and the promoter/operator/reporter genes. In particular, it might be better to show that the repressor gene codes for the repressor proteins and transcription cannot happen while repressor proteins are bound. So this week we have been working on improving our Maya animation. We also talked to Cesar about creating a schematic to describe our system. He suggested a couple of software options we can use for the schematic. We also started working on writing up content for the wiki and made plans for future weeks.
Week 18: September 1st - September 5th
This week we have been working on improving our Maya animation. In particular, we simplified and improved the transformation animation. We also made the DNA pieces appear more clear and organized. The scene of the animation with DNA was also changed to show the interaction between the repressor gene/repressor proteins and the reporter circuit. This week we also continued  writing up content for the wiki and editing the journal so we can start uploading content to the website. We also downloaded Microsoft Visio software so we can start working on the schematic for our biological system.
Week 19: September 8th - September 12th
This week we started uploading our content to the wiki so we can design and prepare for how we want to display our information. We collaborated with the various biology sub-teams to create a rough outline of our schematic. This week we were also preparing engineering content for the aGEM presentation, and determining which information was important to be communicated in our project at aGEM.  Additionally we also practiced answering potential questions we might receive.  We received valuable feedback regarding the alignment of the detection chambers in our prototype.  If we place these chambers radially and symmetrically to the PCR chamber we automatically reduce the amount of Teflon tubing required to transport the sample from the PCR chamber to the detection chambers.  This allows us to make a device that is both more economically feasible and more portable through the smaller design.  Additionally we received feedback regarding the heavy base of our prototype.  We wanted to ensure that during the development phase that we would have a device to showcase aesthetics and the fact that it was operational for several months through many tests.  When creating a new design we plan on altering this and planning for a lighter, less expensive base, as tests will have to undergo on test, instead of multiple over several months.

Would you be my chassis?
Introducing Xenopus as a new chassis in the iGEM contest requires a few epistemological investigation. The term “chassis” refers to a specific kind of model organisms which are bound to the specific ways of experimenting developed in synthetic biology. Examples through history have shown that the organisms used for conducting the experimentation often influence deeply the theories and projects inferred. As the term “chassis” is at the center of our study, it is important to remind why Xenopus is an interesting model organism, and to what extent the term chassis is epistemologically relevant when referring to vertebrates.
Xenopus as a model organism
In experimental biology the choice of the right organism is a crucial beginning of research, this has been widely repeated, so was saying Claude Bernard, father of experimental medicine, and confirmed on the matter by many historian and philosophers of biology, such as Lederman and Burian [1]. Though the choice the organism studied is often a matter of contingent circumstances (and it was indeed the case for our research), it often has an undeniable impact on the development of a research. As R. Burian explains, “most biologists realize that the choice of an organism can greatly affect the outcome of well-defined experiments and can thus have a major impact on the valuation of biological theory” [2], thus some model organisms, like Drosophila melanogaster and Escherichia coli accomplished their role with great success, while others, like “Hieracium, Oenothera and Ascaris […] led investigators astray” [3]. The history of Drosophila melanogaster is quite interesting in that matter, as the fly studied by Thomas H. Morgan had a huge impact on the practices and problems of genetics [4], the simplicity of its genome favoring the theory of the central dogma, one gene, one protein, one feature, and the projects of mapping genomes. As genetic modifications had huge impacts on Drosophila melanogaster’s phenotype, we put in the genome an explanatory power that neglected important aspects of the complexity of genetic regulation and organisms’ environment. However it was a fertile way to limit this complexity which would have been ungraspable at the first try.
Synthetic biology brought a new word when referring to model organism: the term “chassis”. Though this term may surprise when first heard (one spontaneously think of mechanics rather than biology) it"

For a preciser measurement of the expression of their gene, SRRz gene, they used GFP as a reporter in this case alternatively. Our model simulated the concentration of the GFP expressed in their system.The mathematic formula and parameters’ and the results are as follows:
The simulation result is as follow：

The fitted curve of all the spots generated from real experiment can be seen from here:
From the three figures above, we can prove that our simulation have the same trend of the real experiment data, which also gave SCUT-China_A a meaningful design performance forecast.
Besides, our team also troubleshooted the image processing software of their project whose aim is to get the yellow degree of an experiment tube so that they can measure the concentration of the SRRz protein. We improved the system behavior and back-end of the software and gave some advice on the implementation process.

During the whole collaboration process, we established very closed friendship. The team leader Chen Nanzhu and other team members also gave their feedbacks after we got an embryonic form of our main project. Besides, we also invited them for holding a high school meeting which we organized at very beginning.
NJU-China
Background & Demand
At the very beginning of this year around the end of March, NJU-China got interested in weight -reducing drugs. They noticed that people may use various emojis when it comes to topics related to “losing weight”, “body weight”, “fat” on their microblog. Some people may be eager for practicing their body so a very positive emoji would be used on their microblog while others are totally opposite. Out of an objective perspective, some big data was needed to scope a general relationship between the three keywords and the emojis used by microblogers under the analysis of statistics. As a result, they reached out for us.
Solution & Results
In this case, we built a python spider for them to extract big data to dig out the relationship between the three key words they wanted and emojis that people post on the social microblog media, specifically on WEIBO, in the last whole year (2016.1.1-2017.1.1). All the robot abstractor we built has been under the regulation of “ Robots Protocol ” file stated by the official WEIBO company on their website.

This piece was cut out, and a new PCR was done directly on it after advice from one of the lab technicians. However, this new PCR did not work, and the sample was lost.
New PCRs with the exact same conditions and recipe was done afterwards to try to obtain just a tiny bit of PCR product again, but all of the trials were unsuccessful, and no more fusion product for LPE and GFP was obtained. Taken these data together show that LPE and GFP could not be fused together by the means of fusion PCR. Even though both the PCR programs was changed to try different conditions in regard to the annealing temperature, denature time and elongation time. Future experiments to get LPE and GFP to be fused is to make a touchdown PCR to see if starting at a high annealing temperature and then decrease it every cycle will make the primers more effective, or another approach is to try to redesign the primers to make a more suitable overhang for the fusion PCR. This is some of the approaches that will be carried out in the future to make the fusion of LPE and GFP possible.

Question: Is it possible to fuse Propionate-CoA Transferase (PCT) and Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP)?
Experiment: The experimental set-up can be seen at our protocol section . Firstly, both PCT and YFP were amplified using PCR. The DNA template from IDT was mixed with the prepared MasterMix, and the PCR was started at the following conditions for PCT: 95 degrees for 3’, 95 degrees for 30’’, 60 degrees for 30’’, 70 degrees for 1’ and 70 degrees for 10’, with the three middle step repeated 35 cycles. For YFP the PCR program used was 95 degrees for 3’, 95 degrees for 30’’, 56 degrees for 30’’, 68 degrees for 30’’ and 68 degrees for 10’, with the three middle step repeated 35 cycles. Both electrophoresis lasted for 1 hour at 115 volt. After amplification the integrity of the amplified DNA was checked on a 1% agarose gel, and the DNA was purified using PCR Purification kit from QIAGEN according to the manufacturer's protocol. After purification the DNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop. To fuse the two genes a fusion PCR was carried out. The purified gene products was used in a PCR along side with a prepared"

After visiting the state fair, we reached out to a student organization at Cornell, Debate in Science and Health, and joined in on their public forum on gene editing. Using what we learned at the state fair about people’s misconceptions and apprehension about synthetic biology, we helped catalyze important discussion on our own campus about current and future technology for genetic engineering and synthetic biology.

What does synthetic biology mean to you?
PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS SURVEY
Synthetic biology is more powerful when we work together. For our collaboration, we worked with Stony Brook iGEM to understand people’s attitudes about synthetic biology in different parts of New York. Together, we wrote a survey to administer near our respective universities - us, in Ithaca and upstate New York, and them, in Long Island and New York City. We held weekly meetings over Skype to discuss where we wanted to go with our collaboration, focusing on using the strengths of both of our teams. We also developed skills in survey writing and distribution. We learned to ask questions that would improve the knowledge-base of our teams, and researched what we could uniquely investigate that could not be found online.
Through reflection, reviewing literature, and thoughtful dialogue, we chose to focus on the comparison of perceptions of synthetic biology in different geographic locations. As student researchers from STEM backgrounds, we recognized the bubble we could potentially be in. Conducting this survey helped us pop that bubble. Together, both of our teams went through several iterations of survey drafts which we constructed together. We tested our surveys on small sample populations, and brought back feedback to clarify or rephrase our questions. When the questions were finalized, both teams went out to collect responses.
Cornell iGEM visited the Ithaca Farmers’ Market as well as the Ithaca Commons during our annual Apple Harvest Festival to collect survey responses. We also visited the Great New York State Fair in Syracuse to gather responses from people across the state of New York. Stony Brook collected responses at their campus and online. Altogether, we had 92 survey participants. Our survey questions can be found here . We hope that other iGEM teams will follow our lead and conduct similar analysis in their communities.
For analysis and discussion of the results, see the Collaborations page for more information.

Collaborations
An important part of iGEM is collaborations. For us, the collaborations served to demonstrate whether we could feasibly incorporate microfluidics and our system TERRA into the synthetic biology workflows of other lab groups. In return, we provided these other teams with a more automated method of performing some of their necessary tasks. During this iGEM season, we collaborated with the BostonU, Harvard, and MIT iGEM teams.
Harvard Collaboration
Droplet Generation
This chip was designed to encapsulate sodium alginate, calcium chloride, and cells suspended in media in droplets for later use in the Harvard iGEM team’s keratin skin patches. The Harvard team needed to find a way to control pore sizes of alginate, which were used to suspend E. coli and would only allow the desired treatment to be secreted through the pores. Our microfluidics-based system offered a controlled and precise method that would alter the amount of E. coli in each alginate suspension droplet, as well as change the pore size with of the alginate gel with calcium chloride, due to the features of a microfluidic chip. Our teams conducted literature review to design a microfluidic device to provide an solution for the Harvard team’s project.
Version 1
Since this chip passed the proof of concept experiments using colored water, this was the chip used, in combination with the TERRA Adapter during our collaborative meeting with Harvard on August 9, 2018. The chip was tested with biology a total of 4 times, each time eventually leaking before creating a stable stream of droplets. An analysis of the failure concluded that pressure around the chip was ineffective at keeping the requisite area around the channels sealed given that there was too much empty space between the channels and the pressure
applying binder clips. The future chip should either be smaller in overall area or the channel design should be spread out over a larger portion of the chip area. Harvard iGEM left us with the material needed to attempt to encapsulate their droplets on our own for when the new chip is assembled and tested.

DTU-Denmark,2016,Team:DTU-Denmark#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," phase plane concept to the team, which is an extension to flux-balance analysis. The hope is that it will be possible to find optimal in-flow of various substrates in order to maximize product, in this case beta-carotene. Downloaded first Y. lipolytica model “MODEL1510060001”. Tutorials are studied in Matlab.
Software
Script writing is finished. Testing of functionality was initiated in order to find the most “sustainable” solution in terms of resources and the optimization step (reverse-translation) from the desired sequences to protein sequences. Approach decided for main body of script is building and checking the sequences “on the fly” while using as initial files the y_lip.txt (gcn), desired.fsa(protein sequences), ressites.txt(restriction sites).
Hardware

Design
Designing a real-time, high throughput and efficient reporter system to analyse RNA base editing in cells.
A significant roadblock in optimising base editing technologies and also their widespread use in different cell types is the lack of an efficient and real-time reporter system to analyse and quantify such editing assays. One potential way of overcoming this is to use a fluorescence protein as a reporter molecule for such assays. Fluorescence molecules are powerful as they can be easily tracked and visualised using fluorescence microscopy or via flow cytometry.
Compared to nucleic acid sequencing, this proposed reporter molecule can provide a real-time read for any editing assay. Therefore, we designed and constructed a real-time fluorescence reporter system for quantification of base editing efficiency in live cells.  Moreover, we aim to incorporate a second reporter in the system that is under the control of the same promoter in order to normalize the effect of differential transfection and expression efficiency.
1.1 Design of the dual fluorescence  EGFP-T2A-mCherry reporter for quick visualisation of RNA base editing.
Inspired by the work of Martin et al. (2018), as well as WPI Worcester 2016 iGEM project, we designed a EGFP-T2A-mCherry dual fluorescence reporter plasmid system. This plasmid consists of two fluorescence marker, an EGFP gene and a mCherry gene (Fig 1). Here, mCherry is expressed constitutively and used as a marker for transfection efficiency"

It is a fusion protein between the Clostridium cellulovorans cellulose-binding domain of cellulose-binding protein A (CBPa) with the B domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A (BpA). This fusion protein can be used to bind antibodies to cellulose. To facilitate protein purification, we added a HisTag. To remove the HisTag, we separated the HisTag from the sequence by the TEV cleavage site sequence.

By using this method, we can obtain the density of algae faster, and the last four groups in the experiment ""Exploration of the speed gradient and time gradient"" are the shedding rate measured by the modified blood cell counting plate method.
7. Pumping method
Experimental principle: Separation of algae and bacteria by different sizes of membranes
Experimental results: the separation is not complete, the reason is unknown, and the experimental picture record is lost.
8. Dual wavelength method
Experimental principle:
It is known that the concentration of bacteria and algae (c) and Abs (A) are proportional to within a certain range, A = kc and k changes with wavelength.
Within a certain range, the Abs of the algae mixture satisfies the formula A=k1c1+k2c2 (k1k2 is the absorbance of the pure solution of the algae at this wavelength)
It is planned to find two wavelengths λ1, λ2, and calculate the k value (k1-k4) of the algae at this wavelength by pre-experiment. For an unknown mixed solution, measure the A of these two wavelengths, that is, have the equations:
A1=k1c1+k2c2
A2=k3c1+k4c2
Solve the equations to get c1, c2
We found that the error of this method may be caused by the error caused by mixing and the error caused by wavelength selection.
8.1 Mixed error exploration experiment
Objective: To investigate the deviation caused by the mixing of algae and algae at each wavelength, and whether od satisfies the simple summation Experimental method: Full-wavelength scanning of suitable bacteria and algae suspension, mixing the algae liquid in equal volume, and mixing the mixture for full-wavelength scanning, comparing the theoretical value curve with the actual measurement curve.
Experimental results:
Conclusion: in proper concentration, the error caused by the mixure of algae and bacteria is extremely small.
8.2 wave length selection
Experimental purpose: find the wavelength combination with the smallest error, measure the concentration of each component of the mixed solution with the dual-wavelength method.
Experimental methods: Group 1: algae concentration gradient, group 2: bacterial concentration gradient, group 3, group 4: group 1 and group 2 corresponding gradients were mixed in proportion. Full-wavelength scanning of all samples (4*10)

Results
We see that the construct BBa_J23101 is the strongest of our 3 promoters. BBa_J23106 showed the lowest fold induction response, and the BBa_J23117 showed the same response as the different controls. And this result was obtained with the two different methods (flux cytometer and microplate reader). When the electrophoresis was done, we saw that the construct J23117+I13504 was inserted in pSB1C3, but it appeared that the activity of this promoter was really low or null.

In the afternoon the time was taken to take a tour in the tourist center of the city and ended up having dinner with a picnic in the Parc Guell. A viewpoint that have views of the entire city at night.

Organization of a Meet Up: Another European Meet Up
Reason
After attending two meet ups we realized that these meetings are very enriching experiences in preparation for the Giant Jamboree. One of the main reasons for these meet ups is to get to know and know the project of other teams. Other reason is that its also serves to practice the presentations of the project and its results. And finally serve to open the network of contacts beyond the contest itself.
We realized that the events to which more teams come are usually the first ones to be organized, and in these although if they serve to obtain collaborations, do not fulfill so much the function of practicing to present the results of your project due to at the beginning of the summer there are no results.
This year the European meet up was on July 20. Date in which novice teams, without sufficient contacts do not yet know how to deal with these events and do not have the necessary funds to attend. And teams with more experience do not yet have conclusive results. With this context we proposed this ambitious project: Make another European meet up. We invited all the teams of the continent in mid-September. A date that was supposed to be the best for the organization of new teams and with the possibility of simulating the final event.
Event
The event was organized between September 14 and 16. Although this event was given as much publicity as possible and contact was made with all possible teams in Europe, attendance was low due to several factors:
- Spain is geographically at one end of Europe and travel is expensive.
- The teams were short of funds and were saving for the trip to Boston.
- The event was announced at the beginning of September, many teams did not have room to maneuver in their organization to attend.
Despite these inconveniences we had assistance from several participants of some teams (all of them came from within the Spanish territory thanks to the facilities for transport). Although there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.

We made a new plan, chose lacZ as the target gene and MRFP Expression Cassettes sandwiched by 555bp right and left homologues arms as donor DNA, we hoped that once donor DNA was recombine into genome of TOP 10, the color of red fluorescence protein would expose the positive recon.
1. we cloned the left arm and right arm from genome of TOP 10, cloned the MRFP Expression Cassettes from plasmid tested by the"

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html," still unknown. What's more, a protein in MoDeL may have different protein chains and it is more complex to determine the overall rate. In the demo database, we assume all proteins with no parts in bound state have a uniform degradation rate. Proteins with more than one chains are considered stable and non-degradable. This idea could be applied easily by writing reaction templates in MoDeL format. The reactant is a general species template with only one substituent-type part (ANYUB) of type ForwardProtein (no reverse reactions happened here). It is similar for degradation of mRNA molecules. Only mRNAs with single chain degrades at the same rate.
For reactions of dilution due to reproduction of cells, quantities of species decrease in a similar way to degradation. The rate of dilution is also similar to the reproduction rate of E.coli:
<math>k_{g}(1-C_{E.coli}/C_{max})C_{species}V_{Flask}</math>
where we only replace the second <math>C_{E.coli}</math> with concentration of species in dilution. To apply this idea, we only need to construct a species with only one substituent-type part (ANY) of no specific type and it will be matched to all species. Among them, only species bound in compartment E.coli will be diluted.
Replication of plasmid DNAs is not as easy as reproduction of living cells in two aspects: first, plasmid backbone with the same replication origin could be found in many species in the system because the original transformed plasmid backbone may bind with other compounds or proteins to form complex; second, the replication of original transformed plasmid DNA molecule tends to be repressed by all species including the same replication origin. However, E.coli cells do not have any effects on the reproduction of other E.coli cells. MoDeL language perfectly support this idea by separating the template reaction into replications and repressions. The first part describes the exponential amplification of plasmids with reaction rate <math>k_{g}C_{plasmid}V_{E.coli}</math>, where <math>k_{g}</math> is the replication rate of a certain plasmid, <math>C_{plasmid}</math> is the concentration of this plasmid, and <math>V_{E.coli}</math> is the volume of E.coli cell. The product may be different from the reactant. It is possible because the reactant may be a complex, such as complex of LacI tetramer and plasm"
