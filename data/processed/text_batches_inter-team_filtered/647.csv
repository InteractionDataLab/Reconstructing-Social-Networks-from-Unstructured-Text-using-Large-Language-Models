what new risks might arise?(Consider the different categories of risks that are listed in parts a-d of the previous question.) Also, what  risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available? (Note: This is meant  to be a somewhat open-ended discussion question.)
The effect of mutation part may be enlarged to get more kinds of goal strains, so more uncertain factors will be added in.The possibility of new type of bacteria’s birth will increase sharply.
6. Does your project include any design features to address safety risks?
(For example: kill switches, auxotrophic chassis,etc.) Note that including such features is not mandatory to participate in iGEM, but many groups choose to include them.
Yes.All of bacteria that contain mutation part is auxotrophic.One of special genes of them has been knocked out so they can hardly survive in normal environment.In addition,our part of mutation stimulator will be destroyed in high temperature so as to get rid of spreading.
7. What safety training have you received (or plan to receive in the future)?
Provide a brief description, and a link to your institution’s safety training requirements, if available.
Training of extinguishing and protection,such as the manipulation of fire extinguisher and emergency shower in fire or biohazard.
8. Under what biosafety provisions will / do you work?
a. Please provide a link to your institution biosafety guidelines.

b. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or an equivalent group?
If yes, have you discussed your  project with them? Describe any concerns they raised with your project, and any changes you made to your project plan based on their review.
We have the commitee but the discussion is not necessary because it’s a dally work to check the safety.
c. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines?
If so, please provide a link to these regulations or guidelines if possible.

2. The bind between different ligands and GPCR will not impact signal transduction in pheromone pathway.
Based on these, the most significant work is to find out the RFP intensity corresponding to the standard sucrose.
Combining the experimental data, we made a simple calculation and got the RFP intensity of standard sweetness amounting to the fluorescence intensity induced by 750nM ideal ligand in our model.

We set a correction factor Kcorret=750  on calculation result. Then we reset the input according to following equation:
Then we prefered to predict different sweetness of sweetener. The sweetness data was obtained from previous study[7].  (Table 7．)

Discussion
After 22 hours, the peak of all curve were displayed as the pheromone model. And different sweetness also could induce different fluorescence intensity. But this model still need optimization in further, based on the following aspects:
(1) Through molecular simulation to discover the combination constant of sweetener binding process.
(2) The correct factor is to be considered the molecular weight, binding sites and combination numbers of the sweetener.
(3) Combine the protein expression and cells growth together. Consider the interaction between two models.
SUMMARY
Based on our models, we successfully got following results:
1. We simulated the structure of T1R2/T1R3 receptor and bound it with different sweeteners to observe the combining situation of different sweeteners through molecular docking.
2. We constructed the signal transduction model to simulate pheromone response pathway in two different levels and proved that our system could work as we expected.
3. We also provided an ideal relationship between RFP intensity and sweetness based on the wet lab data and our signal transduction model , which also demonstrated that our system could detect different range of sweetness.       Although sweeteners are various, but we still can taste all of them and sense different sweetness due to the powerful sweetness receptors, T1R"

These talks gave us a better understanding of some of the challenges surrounding the sensing of NO. Among these problems, we wanted to improve the flexibility of the sensor and also the specificity.
Tackling one problem at a time, we designed a hybrid promoter combining a mammalian promoter which has 9 CArG elements and PyeaR from bacterial cells. As we did not know how the individual promoters would affect the cell, we designed the hybrid promoter to have BamH1 between the two promoters. This would allow us to restrict and separate the two. In addition to this, we sent off the hybrid promoter for synthesis in two orientations; one where the bacterial PyeaR is upstream of CArG and the other reversed.
Human Practice Planning (06/12-07/12)
With genes sent off for synthesis and no lab space yet, we turned our minds to the criteria for the medals. As most of the criteria were aimed at work on BioBricks, we looked at the human practice element of the gold medal. We decided upon the creation of a film and to do this, we wanted to collaborate with an artist who had shown interest in iGEM and contacted us. Besides discussion about the film, we contacted a local school to organise a lesson with year 7 children and also a radio show interview. Within these few weeks we also put together a proposal for grants from the Biochemical society to fund for the artist and also the Enterprise Fund to fund for lab consumables and travel expenses. We later found that our proposals were accepted and we had received the grants.

The pellet of the 6 centrifuge tubes was collected in a sole centrifugation tube, covered in aluminium foil tube, by scratching it out with a small spoon.
The remaining rest of the pellet which cannot be scratched out were resuspended in a small amount of MeOH and were transformed from tube to tube with a interim shaking step.
This suspension was transferred into the tube with the scratched-out pellet.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#NRPS_-_-_TEXT.html," domain fulfills a distinct function in the assembly of the growing peptide chain [13]. The two levels of modularity - modules and domains are shown in Fig. 1.
Figure 1: Modular organisation of NRPS.Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases can be subdivided in modules each incorporating one amino acid. Those are comprised of several different domains, here condensation (C), adenylation (A) and thiolation (T) (according to [13]).
Principle of Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthesis
For the synthesis of NRPs at least three different domains are essential to carry out the selection of the substrate, its activation and the peptide bond formation: Adenylation, thiolation and condensation domains [13].
Activation of the Thiolation Domains by Phosphopantetheinyl-Tranferases
NRP synthetases contain thiolation domains (T domains) in every module, where the corresponding amino acid is covalently bound to the enzyme via a thioester bond. The essential amino acid residue of the T domains is a serine which is posttranslationally modified to carry the sulfhydryl group required for the thioester bond formation. This modification is carried out by separate proteins - the phosphopantetheinyltranferases (PPTases), which use coenzyme A as cofactor [18]. The reaction is shown in Fig. 2a.
Activation of Monomers by Adenylation Domains
The attachment of the amino acid to the already activated T domain is carried out by the adenylation domain (A domain) which is highly substrate specific for a single monomer. In a first step, the monomer to be incorporated is activated with ATP. Secondly, the thioester bond between the phosphopantetheinyl residue and the monomer's carboxylic acid residue is formed [19]. The reaction is depicted in Fig. 2b.
Formation of Peptide Bonds by Condensation Domains
When two neighboring monomers are activated, the condensation domain (C) catalyzes formation of the peptide bond, which is shown in Fig. 2c. The C domain is selective for the acceptor amino acid and thus the C and A domain of a given module always display the same substrate specificity [20].
Figure 2: Reactions catalysed by the three basic NRPS domains. a) Thiolation (T) domains are the carrier domains of the monomers and the growing peptide chain. The transfer of phosphopantetheine from coenzyme A to a"

Results:
Measuring RNA (or DNA) with corresponding Kit resulted in expected results eg. around 10 ng of RNA and very low amount of DNA as shown in Table 1. Similar results were seen for DNA sample. When DNA was added into RNA, the measured RNA amount decreased, which was the only measuring bias we have observed.

Conclusion
The experiment only investigated interactions between dsDNA and ssRNA, which are not supposed to introduce any bias into the measurement as per manufacturer's information [2]. The remaining question is how would a RNA:DNA hybrid be treated by the dye. It is possible that RNA was not properly digested and therefore remains in the hybrid form. A hybrid could hypothetically be detected by both RNA and DNA specific kit. Unfortunately no proven hybrid sample was available and therefore this hypothesis could not be tested.
It was concluded that having DNA - RNA mixture does not influence the measurement in a significant way. RNA amount is moderately decreased after addition of DNA into the sample, which would not explain the presence of RNA in cDNA samples. What remains to be investigated is how a RNA:DNA hybrid would influence the measurement. We therefore conclude that the RNA measurement in our samples is accurate and there is RNA present, either as a ssRNA or RNA:DNA hybrid.
Is RNA Template Properly Digested? Is It Carried Over with the AMPure XP Beads?
Hypothesis:
RNA is found in the final cDNA product as it is not digested properly. The RNase Cocktail contains RNAse A and T1, which are only supposed to introduce nicks"

We interacted with the public by handing out seed packets in parks, and informing them about the decline of bees and the city by-law that makes urban bee-keeping illegal; many signed a petition that we created to remove this by-law. To promote iGEM, we went to two middle schools to tell the students a little bit about our project and what iGEM is.

Social Media
In this digital era, internet users highly increase. Social media is an effective tool that can be used to introduce synthetic biology, iGEM, and ITB_Indonesia team. We frequently used Facebook and twitter as our link to society because these social media are the most popular media in Indonesia with the highest access number.
Today, internet users in Indonesia has reached 82 million people and still growing with very wide range age users, from kids up to adult.  Besides, Indonesia is placed on the 8th position in the world as the highest internet users and holds the 5th position as the most Twitter users with 29,000 twitter account.  It is an opportunity for ITB_Indonesia team to introduce iGEM and synthetic biology. With these facilities, ITB_Indonesia team hopes that people can access iGEM and synthetic biology easily.
ITB_Indonesia team has a Facebook fan page with 1,474 likes and 151 followers on twitter. Here, we introduce our team, idea, project, and share our activity. We also tell information about synthetic biology generally.

Groningen,2014,Team:Groningen#Template#MODULE#Notebook#toolbox#text_-_-_TEXT.html," Escherichia coli containing pSB1C3 with the promoter as insert. E. coli was grown and the plasmids with the promoter were isolated.
 
21 - 27 Juli
 
BioBricking the genes NisT, NisI, NisP and the combined genes NisF,  NisE and NisG gave problems with illegal restriction sites.
The illegal restrictionsite in NisI could be removed using the reverse primer as listed above. This primer contains a mutation needed to remove the illegal restriction site.
The other parts gave more problems, as these all contained multiple restriction sites. Therefore, it was decided to use Gibson assembly with primers containing mutations to remove the restriction site. By using Gibson assembly, the genes could also be constructed in pSB1C3 in one go.
The primersequences can be found at THIS PAGE LINKLINK. The primers are denoted with the position of the  illegal restriction site that they should remove. Illegal EcoRI sites  are abbreviated with an E, XbaI sites with an X, SpeI site with an S and  PstI sites with a P.
 
28 Juli - 3 August
 
The CP promoters in pSB1C3, that were isolated in the week of 14 - 20 Juli, were tested on their insert size. For this, a PCR was done on the plasmid using the primers VF2 (BBa_G00100) and VR (BBa_G00101) were used. The insert size corresponded to the expected size.
 
A touchdown PCR was done on the genes of the nisin operon and the  sfGFP(Bs) gene. In this PCR the annealing temperature dropped from 55 °C to  45 °C, lowering the temperature with 1 °C each cycle. This  unfortunately resulted in a PCR program of just 10 cycles, instead of the intended 30. The remaining steps of the program were finished the next morning. Only the genes NisA, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs) were amplified this way, see figure 1. Therefore, the PCR           was repeated, this time with a complete cycle. No additional genes were amplified this way.
 
Another attempt was made for amplification of the remaining genes. This time, the most ideal annealing temperature for each gene was used by using a gradient PCR and placing the tubes at the optimal temperature. This still did not amplify the remaining genes. Also, a PCR with a general annealing temperature of 50 °C was done."

Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," a series of cells samples with different concentration by gradient dilution. And we used OD function of our device and spectrophotometer to test the sample respectively. By this way, we can get a relation between the readout of our kit and the real OD value. If the relation is linear, we can use a linear model to analyze and predict.
Result
$$ spectrophotometer=-0.06759+4.61774 DeviceReadout_i+\epsilon_i /; \epsilon_i~N(0,0.0052) $$
Taking the OD values measured by spectrophotometer as real values, it is obvious that the real OD values can be derived from the readout of our device, which means that our device is able to measure the OD value of samples accurately.
Florescence Function Testing
Test method
As we already derived the model of OD function of our kit, we design a method to test our florescence function based on it. We made a group of cells samples that steadily express the fluorescence protein by gradient dilution, and use our hardware to measure the OD values and Fluorescence intensity of each sample. As the criteria of the method, the OD values should be proportion to the fluorescence intensity of samples. So we use this method to test if the florescence function of our kit can actually work on florescence intensity testing.
Result
$$ FL_i=53.828+88.287OD_i+\epsilon_i /; \epsilon_i~N(0,6.16) $$
The linear regression model is shown above, which implies us that the florescence function can regularly work. And it can test the florescence based on the linear model we made.
For testing data and more details about data analysis, please look up in data
Design and components
In order to make such a device, we have to minimize the size when we select of the components and design the bracket.
The overall design
Our reaction system is about 800μL, which heights approximately 8mm in the common 10mm cuvette. Therefore, we choose the position which optical pass is 4mm high. Although simply changing filter paper can reuse photosensor, to make it more automatically, we use two photosensors with different light filters to sense different light. Optical pass design is displayed in figure. If we switch on LED in a certain order and measure light intensity respectively, we can calculate the intensity of transmitted light. According to the intensity results before and after the reaction, we obtain the cell density and fluorescent intensity in the solution.

Purdue,2009,Team:Purdue#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," The team recieved the BV-2 line from Harvard Medical School. Thanks again to Dr. Selkoe and Beth Ostaszewski for providing the line. We immediately plated the cells and will be checking on them in four hours. Our offical lab notebook has been started. We hope to get our glioblastoma line in this week or next.
July 22nd, 2009 Upon hearing the bad news that the glioblastoma line we were to recieve from Dr. Yu was completely gone, we researched papers looking for similar reagents used by other groups. Dr. Tofilon, from the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida, has generously agreed to provide us with a vial of >90% CD133 cells. We are incredibly grateful to Dr. Tofilon and his students. We hope to have the rest of the media supply in by next week, and then recieve and begin working with the cells.
July 23rd, 2009 We have begun to grow up our BV-2s so that we can freeze them down. So far... so good. We hope to have our designed constructs done in two weeks and send them off to gene art. An expression vector has been picked out.
July 24th - August 28th, 2009 We've been culturing BV-2s and GAMB-1s...making sure we can keep them alive.
August 29th, 2009 Prepared 3D culture with BV-2 cells.
September 1st, 2009 Stained 3D cells to do a live/dead assay.
September 10th, 2009 Took fluorescent pictures of cells in 3D culture.  They were mostly dead.  :(
September 22nd, 2009 Started growth rate experiment to determine doubling time for BV-2's in both BV-2 and GAMB1 media.  Took preliminary photos (time = 0) at 2:25 pm.
September 23rd, 2009 Took 2nd data point for growth rate experiment.  Took photos at 9:55 am (approx. 19 hours after plating).
September 30th, 2009 We presented our presentation to Indiana BioCrossRoads and a few memebers of biotech companies. We recieved great feedback and some very important questions to consider before we bring the project to MIT. We have begun to put in the final push before the October 21st deadline.

Miguel Correa Marrero
Miguel (Miguelito) is an enthusiastic team member from the Canary Islands and is in his second master year in Bioinformatics. Within the team he works on a model that describes the inhibition of horizontal gene transfer. Since the start of the project, he was a big supporter of the idea to save the bananas, which includes the daily wearing of banana-yellow shirts with monkeys on them. For lunch he enjoys his daily rice salad, although the definition of rice salad is still somewhat ambiguous.
How will we remember Miguel:

Tjaša Marolt
Tjaša (Ti-asha) is our Slovenian import currently in the second year of her master in Biotechnology. Her tasks in the team are the expression of chitinase in P. putida and the addition of the necessary fluffiness to our wiki page. Originally, Tjaša joined the Wiki team to contribute her creative talents but soon developed a passion for coding. Next to those tasks she is responsible for the lab-safety and to keep the spirits up by feeding the whole team “super sweet” pastries and explaining the “super exciting” features of SnapGene to everyone who couldn’t leave the room fast enough. Tjaša’s newest passion is the 3D-printer she saw a few weeks ago and we are looking forward to hearing about it every lunch.
How will we remember Tjaša:
“Uuuu! Me likey, likey!”
Walter de Koster
Walter just finished his Bachelor in Biotechnology and will start his Master this fall. Within the team he works on the metabolic model of the anti-fungal production and is active within the sponsor team. Even though Walter is one of our modelers he didn’t completely leave his laboratory background behind. When there wasn’t enough data in literature to validate his model he went right to the lab. Apart from this he’s always happy to grab a cup of coffee and hear you complaining about why your experiment failed again this time, patiently waiting until you’ve realized yourself what you did wrong.

Cooperation with USTC wet team
It's always a good experience working with our wet team through the whole summer. During the process of iGEM 2010, we learn from each other and help each other to achieve more! This year we cooperate with USTC team in modeling and human practice. Read the following sections for more details.
Modeling
This year the team of USTC focuses on the construction a Host-cell-free Reaction Chamber using Synthetic Biology methods. We help them to visualize an artificial organelle of capacity. For more details, please refer to our wet team's modeling page .
Human Practice
This year, we also had close collaboration with USTC wet team on human practice, for the simple reason that none of us is biology major and we had to resort to biology major fellows for professional advice. Besides, we had several activities together; we presented several campus lectures promoting both synthetic biology and IGEM, and we started our IGEM community together. The collaboration with them not only enhanced the quality of our work, but improved the biology knowledge of our own.
iGEM2010 China Meetup Shanghai
Something amazing happened at Shanghai this summer...
Help with surveys
Penn State & Warsaw Team
This year Penn State iGEM team created a survey about Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in Agriculture. The survey included questions about where and when GMOs should be used, GMOs containing a lysis device, and other questions dealing with the use of GMOs. USTC Software iGEMers are happy to be participants in the survey, and we wish a good result will come out! We also help team Warsaw fill out their survey forms.

ELISA
 
ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) is a biochemical technique used mainly in immunology to detect the presence of an antibody or an antigen in a sample. In our experiments ELISA was used to determine mouse serum IgG antibody response to the recombinant protein vaccination. 96-well microtiter plates were coated either with 50 µl of each recombinant protein antigen (conc. 10 µg/ml) or heat killed H. pylori preparation from 50 million cells in the volume of 50 µl overnight at 4°C. After blocking  with 3% BSA in PBST (150 mM NaCl, 7.5 mM Na2HPO4, 2.5 mM NaH2PO4, 0.05% Tween-20) overnight in a humid atmosphere at 4°C and washing three times with PBST, appropriate dilutions of sera were added to the wells, and incubated for 90 min at 37°C to enable specific IgG antibody binding to immobilized antigens. Following a washing step, horse radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies with a specifity for the mouse IgG class of antibodies were added at a dilution of 1:3000. After another 90 min incubation at 37°C plates were washed again to remove unbound secondary antibodies. Finally, ABTS (Sigma) substrate was added and after 20 min incubation the reaction was stopped with 1% SDS. Absorbance values were quantified at 450 nm in a multilabel plate reader Mithras (Berthold Technologies).
 
FLOW CYTOMETRY
 
Flow cytometry employs instrumentation measuring the fluorescence on individual cells. Cells are suspended in individual droplets, squirted past a laser that excites any fluorescent dye in them and past a detector that measures the fluorescence. Fluorescence measurement was carried out on a Epics Altra (Beckman-Coulter Electronics) Flow Cytometer Cell Sorter.

BIT,2014,Team:BIT-China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"Recent years, it is reported that a new form of biology is rising: “biohackery” [3]. Biohackery allows everyone operation the genome of bacteria in their home or garage with themselves. Without the regulatory of an International Association of Synthetic Biology, we can’t make sure that there is no threat coming from someone’s house or garden, isn’t it?
The interactions between environment and the microorganisms are also an important application of our project. If the “grey goo” disaster breaks out, we can provide a modus to minimize the harm.
Biosecurity
In economy, there are a number of probiotic microbes being used in the manufacturing of various food, biofuels and pharmaceutical products. In biotech industry, high-quality strains are always much expensive, resulting in high frequency of theft events. This problem seriously affected the development of the whole industry.
In contrast to a biohackery scenario that is driven largely by curiosity, another scenario enabled by the availability of this technology may involve illicit economic purposes.
A case on strains theft occurred in China in 2000. In this case, the strains theft caused heavy economic losses to a company. This upgraded the concerning of bio-economy problems to a new focusing level. We must take action immediately in order to protect our profit.
Various synthetic gene circuits are able to provide multiple abilities to industrial bacterial. But to protect the originality result of a research group, not only the patent protection is needed, it’s also necessary to transmit a “bio-lock” into the bacteria.

After reading DNA, let’s write DNA!
Since the discovery of the double helix in 1953, things have changed quickly in biosciences. The latest challenge is synthetic biology, in which new biological systems are built from standard, interchangeable parts. After 50 years of reading DNA, we can write it ourselves! Microbial landmine detectors, photographic bacteria, antimalarial drug producers,... Possibilities seem endless.
In the front line of the new biosciences buzz is the international Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) . Since 2004, the prominent Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US organizes the iGEM competition for multidisciplinary teams of students. What started as a small extracurricular MIT course, has now grown into an international competition with more than 80 teams from all over the world. During the summer holiday, the teams build a ""new genetic machine"" in their home university, both with computer simulations and in the real lab. In November, all teams present their project at the 2-day jamboree at the MIT in Boston.

Experiment:
29/09/16: Grown cultures of E. coli Top10 with RBS+nucA in pSB1C3 were    used to obtain the glycerol stocks and plasmid isolation was    performed (QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit) . Firstly, concentration of the plasmids    obtained was measured on Nanodrop. Secondly, plasmids were sent for    sequencing and then stored at -20°C.
Sequencing:
Plasmids RBS+nucA in pSB1C3 from colonies 2, 5, and 7 were sent for sequencing with the sequencing primers VF2 and VR. (See primer list ).
Conclusion:
Sequencing results showed that the nucA was cloned in the pSB1C3    backbone but the RBS was missing and the suffix was also incorrect. See    Figure 4. The nucA (BBa_K729004) received from the iGEM headquarters was    sent for sequencing as well. It turned out that the part BBa_K729004    does have the nucA gene but the prefix and suffix are incorrect . See    sequencing results in Figure 5 to 7.
Figure 4. Sequencing result of the RBS+nucA in pSB1C3     for sample 5, 7 and 9. nucA can be seen in pink. The prefix is     marked in red.
Figure 5. Sequencing result of the BBa_K729004 aligned     with the nucA gene.
Figure 6. Sequencing result of the BBa_K729004 aligned     with the prefix.
Figure 7. Sequencing result of the BBa_K729004 aligned     with the suffix.
Experiments
We wanted to improve the BBa_K729004 part by giving it the correct prefix and suffix. Unfortunately we did not succeed to complete this task.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html,"ding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of"

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

GFP coding device
This biobrick was used as a reporter for our donor cells during the conjugation. We chose to work with Bba_E0840 because it contained a weak RBS, and so it wouldn’t weaken the transcription of essential genes and/or of our low copy           conjugation plasmid.
Figure 1: GFP coding device
This device is composed of two subparts:
LacI regulated promoter Bba_R0010
This promoter comes from the Lac operon. It’s a strong promoter in absence of the expressed LacI gene. If this gene is expressed, the LacI protein can be inhibited by lactose or his non metabolizable homolog, IPTG.
GFP generator Bba_E0840 Bba_R0010
This part consists in a weak RBS ( Bba_B0030 ) ), a GFP gene ( Bba_E0040 ) and two terminators ( Bba_B0010 , Bba_B0012 ).

RFP Reporter – Receiver Cells
As a proof of concept, our idea was to target a gene encoding for a red fluorescent protein carried on a low copy plasmid in the recipient cells. Those plasmids were available in the iGEM 2018 DNA distribution kit as a composite part.
To perform our experiments, we studied three parts with different resistance genes :
pSB4C5 - J04450
pSB4K5 - J04450
pSB4A5 - J04450
Figure 3: RFP reporter plasmid design used in receiver strains
We further characterized the pSB4K5_J04450 system by studying its lifetime in DH5α. This allowed us to study whether the fluorescence loss was due to the natural loss of the plasmid or the cut made by our CRISPR Cas9 system.

And our team leader Hongshen Wang has gone to Germany as an exchange student.Therefore, she conducted some special human practice in Germany !
Dr. Simonis
    Our leader have introduced their project to Dr. Simonis. Dr.Simonis mainly works in the area of vaccine injection. Dr. Simonis   agrees that the paper-based test can really help the virus test conduct around refugees.The advantage of the test is its speediness and the convenience for both using and transporting. Dr.Simonis thinks that paper-based virus test has a cheerful prospect and suggests that we should focus on the accuracy of our test. Dr.Simonis also suggests”The reuse and reproduce of paper-based test can also be one of your advantages.And they can slash the cost.”

To prepare for the eventuality that the ligations, transformations and midi-preps of the cotC-GFP-smtA in pMUTIN4 worked, the ""Evening before transformations day"" steps of the Bacillus subtilis transformation protocol will be carried out too.
The plate containing the cadmium-sensor E. coli transformants will also be studied - if there are colonies, 12 of them will be prepared for mini-preps; if there is no success then ligation of the BBa_J33206 BioBrick (promoter removed) with the cadA promoter will be carried out - E. coli cells will then be transformed with this.
Practical Outline
Carry out mini-preps on the 12 colonies of potential E. coli + cotC-GFP-smtA (in pMUTIN4) transformants
Digest these mini-preps with BamHI and HindIII'
Analyse the mini-prep digests by DNA gel electrophoresis
If there are any successes, prepare midi-prep cultures from leftover overnight incubations
If no colonies present the desired DNA then conduct another ligation of cotC with pMUTIN4 and transform E. coli with this ligated product.
Carry out the ""Evening before transformations"" step in the Bacillus subtilis transformation protocol.
If there are arsR + cadA promoter (cadmium sensor) transformants on LB + ampicillin plate then prepare mini-preps from cultures. If unsuccessful:
Digest the arsR backbone (BBa_J33206 without promoter) and the cadA promoter with BamHI and NheI
Carry out overnight ligation reaction
Observations
The only observation that needs to be made now is: there are no colonies on the LB + ampicillin plates where competent E. coli cells, which we had attempted to transform with the BBa_J33206 BioBrick (which contains the arsR binding site and arsR gene) ligated to cadA promoter, were plated. This could be down to three things:
The ligation between the BBa_J33206 BioBrick (minus promoter) and the cadA promoter didn't work.
The transformation reaction didn't work
Both the ligations and the transformations didn't work

Blh+PR operon
We placed proteorhodopsin downstream of a composite part designed UNITN-Trento 2015 that expresses β-carotene 15,15’-dioxygenase under the J23100 constitutive Anderson promoter. This part both synthesizes proteorhodopsin and the blh enzyme that cleaves  β-carotene into the retinal chromophore needed for PR to operate as a light-driven proton pump. This is a simpler part than UNITN-Trento’s composite BBa_K1604025 but requires external  β-carotene to function.
Nox translational unit
In order to express and characterise Nox, the novel his-tagged protein coding gene was place under the J23100 promoter. This allows constitutive expression of NADH oxidase enzyme that can be easily purified from cell lysates using ELISA.

Flagellin are the constituent subunits of the helical filament substructure of bacterial flagella. In the flagellar-building process, flagellin are exported out of the cell sequentially by the flagellum-specific export apparatus. F. Vonderviszt et al. demonstrated through their work that the signal sequence responsible for allowing the flagellar export system to identify and export Salmonella flagellin is its 26-47 amino acid residue segment [ 18 ].

Delivery
A major part of our project involves investigating what is the best way to deliver our biofilm-degrading and antimicrobial enzymes to the site of infection in the urinary tract.
As we have mentioned above, patients with recurrent, complicated cases of UTI often get their infections from an already-inserted catheter which may have to be there and cannot be removed for a variety of other medical reasons. In view of that, we decided to conceptualize an initial delivery method which was centered on the catheter.
Our AlgiBeads design involves encapsulating our therapeutic, enzyme-secreting bacteria in sodium alginate beads. These beads are immobilized in a modified section of a catheter, from which the bacteria can secrete the therapeutic enzymes into the infected urinary tract. On our Design page, thorough consideration was given to the AlgiBeads delivery method, including issues of safety and practicality.
However, based on some preliminary data obtained for gene expression and diffusion rates, our computational models predicted that the equilibrium concentration of enzymes in solution based on the AlgiBeads delivery method would be too low when compared against the known concentrations required for biofilm degradation.
As such, we have had to instead consider an alternative delivery method - the introduction of our enzyme-releasing therapeutic engineered bacteria into the urinary microbiome, whereby the problem of low enzyme concentration in solution will be overcome by the close proximity between the therapeutic bacteria and the pathogenic bacteria. Another benefit of having therapeutic bacteria as part of the microbiome is of course that the treatment becomes preventive in nature, with the therapeutic bacteria now part of the bacterial community in the body constantly releasing pathogen-killing enzymes.
Of course, altering the microbiome comes with its own set of hazards,"

To interpret the above data, we first compare the constants of dissociation, Kd. In this context, Kd represents [Gzmbfree][Inhibitor]/[Gzmbinhib-Inhibitor] at equilibrium (Bisswanger, 2008); therefore, a lower Kd would represent better inhibition: more bound GzmB compared to free GzmB.
We can also analyze the Ka, the association constant. Ka is the inverse of Kd, and can be found as [Gzmbinhib-Inhibitor]/ [Gzmbfree][Inhibitor]. This represents the relative amount of bound molecules, so that a higher Ka represents stronger binding affinity. Compared to the mouse inhibitor Serpina3n, human ACT3m has a lower Kd and a higher Ka, which suggests stronger inhibition. This conclusion is in agreement with Marcet-Palacios et al., where this novel inhibitor was also compared to mouse Serpina3n (2014).
The Hill constant may also be considered to analyze the nature of the inhibitor-GzmB complex. With n>1, Serpina3n is likely to bind to multiple sites on GzmB (Weiss et al., 1997). ACT3m, in contrast, has a n<1, meaning that it likely binds competitively to selective and perhaps singular sites. This information is interesting; taking the association constants into account, this means that despite less opportunity to bind, ACT3m still acts as a better inhibitor than Serpina3n.
Inhibitor Concentration Calculator
The following equations were developed with a question in mind:
How much inhibitor is needed to bring GzmB levels back to normal?
Since there are many diseases that cause inflammation, and thus increased levels of GzmB, we created a calculator to determine the amount of treatment needed for any GzmB-related diseases. The model can show the relative percent decrease of GzmB as the inhibitor concentration increases. A patient could obtain information regarding their condition and calculate the amount of treatment needed.
Given that

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," are any shifts in the emission spectra of the cotransformants, if cultivated with and without the specific ncAA of the cotransformed aaRS. This test was done with the Prk-RS and the 2-NPA-RS and the results are shown in Figure 10.
The emission spectra when cotransformed with the Prk-RS showed a clear and a substantial shift, when cultivated with and without Prk, respectively (Figure 10, left). Without Prk there is a bulge in the emission peak at 475 nm, due to the presence of solely CFP-units, where the synthesis of the CFP-YFP fusion protein stopped at the amber codon in the linker. The maximum of the emission spectrum is shifted towards the maximal YFP emission of 525 nm but not located there. If cultivated with Prk the bulge at 475 nm is very small and the emission maximum is at 525 nm. This means that by supplementing the specific ncAA to the cultivation media, the Prk-RS couples more amino acids to the amber tRNA. This leads to a higher expression of the whole fusion protein and indicates that the Prk-RS is a specific and efficient aaRS.
Figure 10: Emission spectrum of three biological replicates. Each of cotransformants of the improved synthetase-test system ( BBa_K2201343 ) with the Prk-RS ( BBa_K2201201 ) left and the 2-NPA-RS ( BBa_K2201200 ) right. Three replicates were cultivated with their specific ncAA and three without it to compare the resulting shift in the emission spectrum.
In contrast, the emission spectra of our test system cotransformed with the 2-NPA-RS shows no strong shift when cultivated with or without 2-NPA (Figure 10, right). This indicates that there is not substantial more CFP-YFP fusion protein synthesized when the ncAA is supplemented to the media.  This does not mean that the synthetase does not incorporate 2-NPA at all, but the ratio of 2-NPA to native amino acids coupled to the amber tRNA cannot be described precisely. This means that the 2-NPA-RS is an inefficient aaRS.
By comparing the emission spectra of our improved test system when cotransformed with different aaRS, the efficiency of the aaRS can be determinated. Recording whole emission spestres is interesting but a bit time consuming if many aaRS should be testes for their quality. The results this far imply that a comparison"

At first, all the readings came out as zero. After analysing our device we located the bug in Denver Biolabs' code and wrote a short solution. We later also removed some redundant sections.
You can download the fixed code from Github , however we recommend you use our far superior design using instructions below .
Our fluorometer and densitometer
We significantly improved Aachen and Denver Biolabs' design, having redone the most of the wiring and parts of the software. But we wanted to go further; we made our own combined fluorometer and densitometer, keeping only Aachen's cuvette holder design and their measuring principle.
Here we document the design decisions we made, how we built and tested it, and Judd-UK’s input to the design.
For the measurements, check out the measurement page .
Components
Our design uses only off-the-shelf components except for the cuvette holder, for which we couldn’t find an alternative. Aachen 2014’s design was good for this so we used theirs.
The key component is the Digispark, a USB-based development board similar to an Arduino except much cheaper, and with the ability to communicate with a host computer by mimicking keyboard events. It acts as a bridge between the light sensor and our interpreter app.
The device plugs in via USB so is compatible with almost anything, including desktop computers, laptops, phones and tablets. We created an interpreter application to be used on the device it is plugged into that can save the readings and convert them into common units transmittance percentage.
Our design is completely open-source by OSI standards [1]
Our code for both the device and the interpreter is licensed under the GPLv3 license
Our circuit design is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0
The keyboard library used (Digikeyboard) is licensed under the GPLv2 license [2]

SSR, as an genetic engineering tool, is widely used to simulate and study pathological conditions                                     such as inactivational mutations and chromosomal rearrangements. For example, Barlow                                     et al. used Cre/LoxP mechanism to delete a part of the mouse chromosome 18 to study the                                     5q- syndrome in human, and they found that the deletion was associated with a change                                     in p53 level, providing insight on its disease mechanism.

We reported the effect of gene silence to our teacher. We found out some abnormal data in the diagram. Maybe we had some mistake in the step of mixing the solution. So we prepared to do the RT-PCR once again. But this time, unfortunately, we put PCR Tubes Strip in wrong way. So we plan to do the experiment again tomorrow. We believed that failure can let us go further.
We observed a strong fluorescence from the cells transfected yesterday.
Wednesday 19/8
We went to Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital of Guangdong Province for visiting patients and making a survey. We communicate myocardial ischemia with the patients. We prepared some questions to ask them and we hope to get some useful references about the disease. We asked in detail about the disease and encourage them to establish confidence, adherence to treatment. On the one hand, in this interview, some patients pointed out that the frequency of taking medicine quite bothered him, and almost every patient should take with the emergency treatment drug all the time. We found that most of the patients not only had cardiovascular disease but also had diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disease and so on. On the other hand, we know that the healthcare system of China were good but quite inadequate. It definitely reduced patients’ financial burden. But we found that there were still some problems in the healthcare system. We concluded four major problems, for example, low coverage, lack of unity, the high insurance beyond reality and a waste of personal account in the process of constructing the social medical insurance system. After the visit, we shook hand with patients and showed our gratitude to the doctors and nurses who gave us support.
In the progress of experiment, we detected the concentration of cGMP in the cells which we transfected the day before yesterday by ELISA. And we found that the content of cGMP in the third group increased by twenty percent.

We inoculated the shRNA puncture bacteria in different sites, the concentration of AMP in medium was 100ng/ul.

James removing the supernatant from the Eppendorf tubes
Goksel discards the supernatant extracted from the freshly centrifuged tubes
The procedure demanded us to centrifuge 3ml (at least) of the 10 cultures. However the Eppendorf tubes that are placed into the centrifuge dont't have that capacity. So we pipetted 1.5ml of the 10 cultures into 10 Eppendorf tubes, spun them, removed the supernatant and added a further 1.5ml of the cultures to the 10 tubes. This was spun and the supernatant removed.
The 10 pellets were then each resuspended in 300 microlitres of Solution I. Prior to this, we added 150 microlitres of RNAse A to the bottle containing our premade Solution I.
600 microlitres of the newly made Solution II was added to each of the 10 tubes. The tubes were then left (sealed, of course) in the rack for 5 mins.
250 microlitres of Solution III was added to each of the 10 tubes and the resulting solution centrifuged for 20 minutes. The resulting solution could be seen as a cloudy white precipitate of chromosomal DNA and protein. Instead of removing the supernatant and disposing of it, once the spinning had stopped we extracted 1ml of supernatant and placed them into 10 new Eppendorf Tubes (labelled '1S', '2S', '3S',...etc). The tubes containing the pellets were then discarded.
To the 10 tubes containing supernatant, 600 microlitres of prepared isopropanol was added. These tubes were then placed in the centrifuge for a further 15 mins.
The resulting supernatants for the 10 tubes were then removed and any droplets of solution were carefully removed by a vacuum pump (without disrupting the DNA which had gathered on one side of the Eppendorf tubes). To this, 500 microlitres of ethanol (at 70%) was added.
Making 70% ethanol:
35 ml of ethanol added to beaker
15 ml of water added to beaker
The resulting solution was then spun in the centrifuge for 5 minutes.
The supernatant was removed and the remaining droplets of solution removed without disrupting the transparent pellet the plasmids had formed. Once the plasm"

We have collaborated with UKC to image the adherence of E. coli and S.oneidensis MR-1 onto graphite and iron. In return we offered to model their proteins. This collaboration gave us a better indication of which possible cathode materials could be used in our electrochemical system when we have prepared our modified strains of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1.
At the iGEM Westminster Meetup we got into contact with the iGEM Kent team (UKC) and started discussing potential ideas for collaboration. We established an experiment which would address the adherence of S. oneidensis MR-1 onto potential electrode  materials. UKC would provide us access to their Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and in return we would model their proteins.
Figure 1: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) of S.oneidensis MR-1 on graphite (Figure 1A) and iron (Figure 1B) after 12 hours incubation. (A) S.oneidensis MR-1 adhered to the proposed cathode material, graphite, after incubation time of 12h in LB broth. Graphite discs were sculpted from 9B graphite pencil and glued onto 10mm Mica Iron discs. (B) S.oneidensis MR-1 did not adhere to iron after incubation time of 12h in LB broth, which acted as our positive result. Iron discs were Mica Iron 10mm discs purchased from Agar Scientific.
The AFM results showed that S.oneidensis MR-1 could adhere to graphite, figure 1A. Unfortunately, no S.oneidensis MR-1 adhered to iron which should have been the positive control, figure 1B. After discussions with Kent we determined that this issue could be due to the treatment of the Iron Mica discs used as sample slides for the atomic force microscopy i.e. it could be coated with a material that S.oneidensis could not adhere to. If we were to repeat the experiment we would use untreated iron or manganese as a positive control.
We modelled UKC’s native and non-native, proteins using the Phyre 2 server (see figure 2). The protein models showed low alignment, high disorder and"

Lethbridge_Entrepreneurs,2013,Team:Lethbridge Entrepreneurs#comp media_-_-_TEXT.html," that submitted business plans for the challenge.
While he has to be a bit cautious about revealing details because of the patent process – an expected six to eight-month timeline -- Ward said their idea will significantly improve the way in which hormones are detected.
""Hormones – and hormone imbalances – play very important roles in understanding behaviour and mental health, pregnancy as well as development and aging of all populations,"" says Ward. ""We are pursuing new technology for the detection of hormones that provides rapid results that are 93 per cent more cost effective than traditional antibody technology.""
The team's market analysis showed diverse applications and projections for growth, with a two to three-year timeline to produce a marketable device. The first test runs of this device will occur this summer at the Canadian Centre for Behavioural Neuroscience (CCBN) in collaboration with CCBN neuroscience researcher Dr. Gerlinde Metz.
Ward said the team came up with the idea to develop the company and the new biomedical device by using the skills they learned through the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) program.
""The internationally competitive program allows undergraduate students to gain hands-on experience in science,"" Ward said. U of L teams have claimed several top international honours at past competitions, and three of the Synbiologica entrepreneurs are off to Boston Massachusetts, toward the end of June as advisors to the U of L's high school iGEM team. The university-level competition takes place in October, 2013 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, MA.
""iGEM is run out of a student-operated lab provided by the department of Chemistry and Biochemistry here at the University of Lethbridge and coordinated by Dr. HJ Wieden. We have been encouraged at every turn by our professors and others to move this idea forward, especially by the people at Alberta Innovates – Technology Futures (AITF) who promote entrepreneurial engagement from scientific innovation.""
Ward cited advisors Dr. Gerlinde Metz (Department of Neuroscience), Dr. HJ Wieden (Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry), Dr. Roy Golsteyn (Department of Biological Sciences) and Michael Kelly (Erin Kelly's father and Manager of Real Estate and Land Development, City of Lethbridge) as being particularly helpful as they refined their idea.

Penn,2011,Team:Penn State#Lab#Safty_-_-_TEXT.html," coli should be addressed. If our bacterial dosimeter is to be used in the field proper safety and handling issues should be dealt with and are being factored into the design of our device.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, there are local biosafety groups at our institution, Environmental Health and Safety department at Penn State. This department is responsible for all safety aspects relating to environmental protection, occupational Healthy and Safety, and Radiation Protection. All researchers were required to attend a safety training program that informed us of lab safety procedures with regards to chemicals and biological hazards. The session was very helpful in providing safety information to our team.
Additionally, our team was required to submit a research proposal to a review committee called the Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC. This committee is responsible for research approval, advocating research safety, and promoting University research for commercial application. Our project idea was submitted to the committee for approval.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices, and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
To further enhance safety practices in the lab, all iGEM participants should be required to fulfill a safety requirement that is common to everyone. That way, standards to safety education can be determined and implemented that would ensure safe practices of all teams. A video lecture, developed by iGEM, should be made for all iGEM teams to watch. Then, once the video has been finished, a short quiz assessment should be filled to make sure that all researcher are knowledgeable on the procedures that video discusses.
Environmental Health and Safety has done a similar type of safety education program for our  researchers. Certificate of completion is available for all of the iGEM the team members.
Please use this page to answer the safety questions posed on the safety page .

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," HindIII-HF then ligated together to create pET29B-SP1-SP2. Both ligation products were transformed into chemically competent E.coli DH5ɑ cells.
Week 17 (August 21 - August 25, 2017)
There were plenty of colonies on both the pET29B-SP2 and pET29B-SP1-SP2 plates that Kaitlin and Sam had prepared last week. However, when overnight cultures and master plates of these colonies were prepared for screening, none of the preparations showed any sign of growth. It was suspected that there was a viral contamination in the LB + kanamycin broth used for overnight preparation. New LB + kanamycin was made, but nonetheless, overnight cultures and master plates of these colonies still showed no growth. From this, it was deduced that the LB + kanamycin broth was not the issue, and some other factor was preventing our transformants from growing. The same HindIII-HF/XhoI digests as in Week 16 were carried out in order to prepare a new set of pET29B-SP1-SP2 colonies that hopefully would not have the same growth issues and could be screened.
Lalit worked on another SDS-PAGE experiment to qualify phasin production in our BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pSB1C3-Phasin-HlyA Tag. BL21(DE3) transformed with empty pSB1C3 were used as controls. He sub-cultured overnights of the cells, induced them with 1mM IPTG for 4 hours, then lysed them in order to separate them into soluble and insoluble protein fractions, as well as a supernatant fraction. More details can be seen on our Experiments page. He will run the purified fractions through Sigma-Aldrich anti-FLAG M2 affinity gels (because our phasin-HlyA has FLAG tags) to isolate the phasin before running the SDS-page gels.
With the Process subgroup, Jacob carried out experiments to determine if PHB could be produced with synthetic feces supernatant that had been fermented at either 23°C  or 37°C  for 3 days. After the fermentation, the supernatant was inoculated with E.coli DH5𝛼 that had been transformed with pSB1C3-PhaCAB from Imperial College. E.coli DH5ɑ transformed with an empty pSB1C3 backbone was used as a control. Then, after overnight incubation at 37°C"

They have applied the method of intein targeting, a method which can also be found in our intein toolbox, to the N-Acetyl-Galactosaminidase protein. More about their project can be read in the very nice article they have wrote for our tumblr blog or on their own wiki .
In this collaboration, Tuebingen conducted a mass spectrometry analysis of our Lambda lysozyme to proof circularization. The data still has to be evaluated, but we will have them ready until the jamboree. There is a high demand for our expression vectors. Tuebingen had problems with expressing their constructs, therefore we send them some of our plasmids pSBX1K30 ( BBa_K1362093 ) and pSBX4K50 ( BBa_K1362097 ), as they showed to work really nicely even with big proteins like the Dnmt1 with 105kDa.
iGEM Team Freiburg
Three of our team members, Anna, Caro, and Charlotte visited the iGEM team Freiburg. We met the team right after a big team meeting, therefore we were able to hear their latest project developments. We spend the evening talking about experiences in the lab and about iGEM. It was relieving to hear that they faced similar difficulties in the lab.  The morning after we presented our project to the iGEM team Freiburg. Freiburg was very interested in our program iGEM@home as we offered them to promote their own human practice projects. You can also find an article about optogenetics on our tumblr blog. Both our teams are working with light inducible systems, manly the LOV domain. Although working in different organisms, the constructs were compatible, therefore we could interchange protocols for induction and preliminary results. Furthermore we gazed at their professional light induction box - we can definitely improved ours.
After cooperation with the iGEM Team Freiburg for two years in a row we are hoping to keep Freiburg as a reliable partner in the next years as well.
iGEM Team Marburg
The screensaver of iGEM@home is a great possibility to spread news and information about Synthetic Biology around the world. Lately, even other iGEM team have used this new option and filled our screensaver with slides about their own project. Marburg was able to promote their quiz app about Synthetic Biology.

Discourse
Approaching the public
From the offset we wanted to tackle a problem raised to us by the public. We sent out an initial questionnaire to the public to ask what big problems they wanted solving and to hear about what they thought about synthetic biology. We took the questionnaire to schools, to the streets and to our friends. Examples of their suggestions for the applications of synthetic biology included bacteria which:
Remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
Target and kill cancerous cells
Help treat Alzheimer's disease
Produce energy
Sew up holes in clothes
Produce teeth glue
Indicate how long someone has been dead
Combat antibiotic resistance
Antibiotic resistance
Of the responses to our initial survey, 40 of the 86 were related to Medicine and Health. Inspired by a talk given by Professor Dame Sally Davies: “A ticking time bomb: the infectious threat of antibiotic resistance” and the public responses, antibiotic resistance stood out to us as an issue we could tackle with synthetic biology. To confirm that we were on the right track, we approached the public again with the question: To what extent do you feel that antibiotic resistance is a problem that needs addressing in society today? This graph clearly shows that, according to the general public, antibiotic resistance is an important problem that needs solving.
Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)
It was our team member George Driscoll’s work at the Hornsey UTI clinic in London which helped us to select UTIs as a specific cause to focus on. Due to the unaesthetic nature of the infection, it often receives less attention with regard to research. Having worked in the clinic, George knew first-hand that UTIs are a problem for a significant proportion of the population, and that resistance to the antibiotics used to treat UTIs is growing. In fact the clinic’s primary treatment method is long, high-dose courses of multiple antibiotics to overcome long-lasting infections despite the clinic’s awareness that their treatment choice may lead to further resistance.
UTIs are the most common healthcare-acquired infection. Among UTIs acquired in the hospital, approximately 75% are associated with a urinary catheter . 2
Interaction with nurses
To learn more about catheter associated UTIs (CAUTIs), we visited the Churchill Hospital in Oxford. Our first visit to the hospital was to the outpatient clinic during which we spoke with Jan Harris, one of"

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html,"O is used as a calcium ion indicator, so as to visualise neuron activity(AWA for instance). In recent advances, calcium is a universal indicator for neuron excitation, because calcium ions are able to influx at action potential. GEM-GECO is capable of monitoring and responding to the concentration change of calcium ions due to the existence of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between two chromophores inside of the functional domain. The reason why GEM-GECO enables the response of disparate calcium ion concentration is that in the Ca2+-free state, the chromophore of this blue-green emission ratiometric GECO (GEM- GECO) undergoes excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) and emits from the lower-energy (green fluorescent) anionic form. [4] , while in the calcium ions bound state,two chromophores are less compact and photon transfer is blocked, resulting in blue fluorescent.

Bacillus BioBrick Box - Promoters
Fig. 1: Luminescence measurement of Anderson promoters in the reporter vector pSBBs3C-luxABCDE. OD600 (right), LUMI (center) and OD600 per LUMI (left) depending on the time (h) are shown for two different clones (green/blue). Data derive from three independent experiments. Curves were fitted over each other (t=0, OD600=0,3) and smoothed by taking average of three neighboring values.
Eleven of the nineteen promoters of the Anderson collection (J23100,J23101, J23102, J23103, J23106, J23107, J23113, J23114, J23115, J23117, J23118) were evaluated in the reporter vector pSBBs3C-luxABCDE from the BioBrickBox containing the lux operon as a reporter for promoter activity. The gene expression which correlates to the promoter activity leads to the expression of the lux operon with the luciferase. The luminescence which is produced by the luciferase can be measured with the plate reader (BioTek). Data derive from three undependant measurements (Fig. 1). Curves were fitted over each other (t=0, OD600=0,3) and smoothed by taking average of three neighboring values. OD600 values shown are plate reader units and about one third of the usual OD600 values. All clones show a usual growth curves.

Synthesis and analysis of collaborative engagement within the iGEM community
Introduction
Much like in the early times of Biotechnology scientists gathered and set for themselves some basic standards and practices on both ethical and pragmatic issues I believe that it is time we, iGEMers, do the same. As future researchers, we are entitled to have our word on how the field of synthetic biology (as well as the iGEM competition) ought to look like. Did you know that the President Obama asked last year for a report on bioethical issues regarding Synthetic Biology? The report came out in December 2010 and included a set of recommendations that the discussion panel deemed necessary. Good. Better yet: why not produce a more down-to-earth proposal on synthetic biology ?
As an interesting turn of fate 2012 happens to be the year in which both French and US Presidential elections are happening (and 2013 for the German ones), what if we could produce a unified document that could potentially change the face of how Science is done? Ambitious? Most probably BUT if we co-operate at a European -and even worldwide- level such an aim is completely attainable. The first thing is to get the frame of analysis, have clear steps to follow if coordination is to happen.
Please find the outline we propose for the co-operative project for an iGEM centered proposal on synthetic biology.
The more we are, the more questions we can tackle!
Everybody is welcomed.
Objectives
Create a full list of teams and their respective Human Practice projects
Identify societal issues mostly addressed by iGEM teams
Propose a comprehensive review on synthetic biology from the iGEM point of view
