Weimar-Heidelberg_Arts,2010,Team:Weimar-Heidelberg Arts#Diary_-_-_TEXT.html," wanted to get an overview about our project. Asking – of course – why we as artists and designers take part in a competition about synthetic biology. Well - I really do believe that we can start a discussion in society, to bring the new technology of synthetic biology to the peoples awareness by giving it a context , the feeling of “yes its here, its real, its every day life...”. Well – you may watch the interview online after the transmission in the beginning of november.
September 1st
The products „Perfect Body“, „AphrodiTec“, „Pit Crisp“, ""ciano fuel station"", and „AntPlantProtector“ should be finnaly visualized until the 17th, if possible also the Image film about the ""Super Cell Shop"" – so each product developer concretized concepts, met photographers and spent hours at the computer.
September 2nd
Preparation of our next meeting. Working on the roadmap and structuring the papers on the walls in our working room. We made product categories and pointed out how far we are and what kind of products are missing. As we have the list of things a product should fulfill everyone gets things as descriptive texts, contextualization and visualizations ready.
September 3rd
On Friday we went through our new roadmap which includes the topics „wiki“, „super cell shop“, „jamboree“ and „PR“ and structures the time from now until the iGEM Jamboree in November. It says clearly what has to be done until when and who has the responsibility. There is a hell of a lot to do but we can make it in time if we stick to the timetable.
September 5th
On the weekend and the beginning of the week we worked in our workspace, each on own products, to clear last open questions about the products to make the fiction feel real to the visitor of „super cell“.
September 6th
Two month until the iGEM Jamboree. Planning the image video of 'super cell' that should later on welcome the webshop visitors. Meeting with Jette who will take the pictures for some products and also meeting Tristan who might do the „ReCoBrain“ video spot. But as there are some problems in the coordination of the people from Weimar and the involved people from Heidelberg the future of „ReCoBrain“ is quite unsure at the moment.

Periplasmic GFP
Guide on how to visualize GFP in the periplasm
This is a guide on how to use biobrick BBa_K1067009 to acquire pictures of GFP exported into the periplasm. The guide can also be used if having GFP fused proteins directed to the periplasm with the Twin Arginine Translocation pathway (TAT). The guide is inspired by Skoog, Karl, et al.
The produre is as follows:
TOP10 E. coli was transformed with the constructed plasmid and plated on LB agar plates.
Colonies was visually inspected the day after. All colonies should be white.
The plate was induced with arabinose by using an atomizer with a 1%w/vol sterile arabinose solution.
The day after colonies where visually inspected under brief exposure to UV light; a colony with a yellowish red where picked and cultured in LB containing 0.5%w/vol arabinose. The culture volume was 50mL and it was kept at 37C with shake until it reached saturation.
The culture was harvested by centrifugation at 5000g for 10 min at 4oC. Supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed thoroughly by washing twice with fresh LB with no arabinose.
The pellet was resuspended in 25mL fresh LB with no arabinose and incubated additionally 3 hours and 40 min. to chase the cytoplasmic GFP to the periplasm. The incubation was done at 37C with shake.
Then the cells were harvested by taking 0.5mL into a centrifuge tube and adding a pinch of low melting point agarose. This was incubated at 50C for 10 min interrupted by vortexing middle ways.
The sample was vortexed and 20uL was loaded on a microscope slide and covered with a cover slip. This could then be stored at 4oC or immediately examined.
Pictures were acquired on fluorescents microscope with 100x lens"

They chose this BioBrick because it was in the distribution kit and was already well-enough characterized to ensure that the only variable they tested was whether the sheets were processed. The data they provided shows that less protein dissociation occurred from the processed sheets.
Beyond the Bench
Despite the time zone difference, we held several skype meetings throughout the summer to discuss our collaborations and get to know each other. We also got together early on during the summer, sharing our enthusiasm over IGEM and the potential collaboration between the two teams. To celebrate our collaboration, the Edinburgh team baked an IGEM cake when we had a joint party with Brooke and Liusaidh in California at the beginning of the summer!

Stuttgart,2018,Team:Stuttgart#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," germs. A coating which could reduce the number of the germs would result in an improvement of hygienic conditions.
Daily Life:
Most surfaces in workplaces or institutions (e.g. kindergartens, schools) host a surprisingly wide variety of germs. To prevent the attachment of disease provoking germs to surfaces (for example computer mouse or keyboards) the implementation of an antimicrobial coating seems reasonable.
Healthcare:
The persistence and spreading of multi resistant bacteria in hospitals is a threat to all patients, especially to patients with immunodeficiency. Nowadays, prevention of the spreading of these germs is one of the major challenges. Our coating could provide a significant contribution to face this problem.
Industry:
Aerospace industries and other companies involved in space expeditions need to consider the importance of germ free conditions. Space missions aiming to reach outer space must not contain any germs from earth to prevent disturbances of any kind.
How to produce TAGC?
Our bio-based surface coating consists out of three major compounds. Chitosan (scaffold) is synthesized in Escherichia coli. The production cascade is based on existing BioBricks from the iGEM Team Darmstadt 2017. The expression and detection of chitosan will be visualized by SDS-PAGE. We will focus on improving BioBricks (including productivity). The combination of chitin synthase (NodC) and chitin deacetylase (COD) will be established to create cells capable of producing chitosan.
Our antimicrobial substances are nisin and rhamnolipid. Rhamnolipid production is carried out in the well established non-pathogenic Pseudomonas putida KT2440 based on already existing BioBricks (iGEM Team Nankai 2014, BBa_K1331001 , BBa_K1331004 ). Further approaches to produce a mixture of mono- and di-rhamnolipids are investigated. Improvement of previous BioBricks will be accomplished by introducing rhamnosyltransferase II for the synthesis of di-rhamnolipids. Analysis is performed using CTAB-Agar plates, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and a mathematical model of production kinetics is developed.
The nisin operon is extracted from Lactococcus lactis (obtained from Prof. Dr. Oscar Kuipers from the University of Groningen) and transferred to an E. coli strain. The nisin is further modified to incorporate a tyrosine for linkage. We aim to insert a tyrosine residue into the sequence"

Mammalian cells
Mammalian cells are cells of higher eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cells have the ability to modify proteins post-translationally, and they contain a large number of membrane bound compartments such as mitochondria, endoplasmatic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus. Compared to microbes, mammalian cells are fragile, have a slow doubling time (app. 24h), and need complex and expensive growth media. The cells are also easily contaminated with mycoplasma, therefore it is necessary to work as sterile as possible, when handling mammalian cells (1). So what is the deal with these high maintenance cells?
Mammalian cell factories
Mammalian cell cultures represent a suitable and stable gene expression system and are often used as cell factories for production of biopharmaceuticals. Heterologous protein expression in an appropriate host is central in production of biopharmaceuticals. Heterologous proteins require complex post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, gamma-carboxylation, and site specific proteolysis, which only mammalian cells are capable of performing. Moreover, mammalian cells have the unique capability to authentically process, fold and modify secreted human proteins (1). Mammalian cell cultures are therefore widely used for production of therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies, growth hormones, and cytokines used for a wide array of diseases(4). The effect of post-translational modifications are protein stability, proper ligand binding, and reduced risk of immunogenicity (2), and most of the therapeutic proteins approved and currently in development are therefore modified (3"

Gluten is a protein (proteins?) in wheat that is in most breads and beers.  Many people have allergies to these proteins, and so have to carefully avoid gluten-containing products.  Maybe we could engineer a pathway to specifically break down gluten in the brewing process?

Bacterial interaction
Overview
Some kind of social behavior, like quorum sensing or self assembly based on communicating only with neighboring cells would be cool.  This would be a good way to take advantage of Advait's cellular automata expertise before he leaves.  This would also be somthing that would require good quantitative characterization of our genes and could be combined with the promoter characterization stuff, maybe.
Enhanced regulation of cellular replication
Overview
The implications of the ability to control cellular replication are tremendous.  The possibility of increasing or decreasing the rate of the cell division cycle via gene manipulation has very broad scope, from increasing metabolite production to decreasing or terminating unbounded cell growth.  In the arena of biofuels, it would be of enormous value to create a large mass of cells capable of producing certain metabolites of interest in a short time period.  Since cell replication uses large amounts of energy, it would be beneficial to reduce or terminate cell replication once a large amount of cells have been produced.  An idea mentioned by George involves manipulating the cascades of quorum sensing to achieve these purposes.
Regulate insulin gene expression in insulin producing E. coli
Overview
Chemical production companies find it useful to control the rate that they can produce their product.  This makes it possible for them to cope with varying rate of demand.  Insulin is a valuable drug that is mass-produced.  A simple way to control insulin production by E. coli would be a valuable tool.  We could use bio-bricks to insert the proper DNA sequences into E. coli to produce insulin then regulate that gene’s expression by manipulating either the promoter or the ribosomal binding site. -Kevin
Does anyone have any insight on the metabolic pathway for insulin and the enzymes that are involved.  Maybe like a paper to read or something?
Interesting suggestion, Kevin.  I don't know what promoter/RBS combination is used in front of the coding region for insulin in current biotechnological practice, but it could be possible that more powerful combinations exist and could be predicted using quality part characterization.  Since in this case the protein itself is"

NTU-Singapore,2008,Team:NTU-Singapore#Wetlab#Materials and Equipment_-_-_TEXT.html,"Maximal AI-2 production activity is typically observed during mid- to late exponential phase (Surette, 1998). Therefore, 4ml of samples corresponding to 2, 3, 3.333, 3.667, 4, 6 time points were collected and centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 10 min in a microcentrifuge to separate cell pellets from supernatants.  Cleared supernatants were filtered using 0.2 µm pore size filters to remove unwanted big proteins. Supernatants were stored at -20°C.
Bacteria strains and media
Bacteria used in all the experiments were LuxS mutants derived from the wild type E coli strain W3110. By knocking out LuxS gene, the cells were unable to synthesize AI-2. As a result, lsrA promoter could only be induced in the presence of external AI-2 produced by other bacteria rather than the host cells. LuxS mutants were first made chemically competent in order to be able to take in biobrick plasmids during transformation.  The media used for overnight growth of cells were Luria-Bertani broth (LB). Cells were diluted in M9 media to an OD600 of 1 before ready to be read under Fluorescence Microplate Reader or Absorbance reader.

All the plasmids used were in the standard biobrick form as regulated by the Biobricks Registry at MIT.  The plasmid containing plsrA-YFP was used for characterization of lsrA promoter, while plsrA-celE7-Terminator plasmid (detection system) aimed to show the lysis of cells when exposed to AI-2.

Stimulated Plastic Enzymolysis
We used Cut1, FsC, Cut1-sJanus-m(fusion protein) and Janus(sJanus&inJanus) we expressed to conduct PET hydrolysis experiments. We achieved a lot and met some problems as well.
Pre-experiment
Overview
We have found out appropriate concentration of the cutinase we made and suitable pH for our enzyme Thc-Cut1, the right time to detect the product of hydrolysis of PET.
Result
We use absorbance in 600 nm to measure the turbidity of the liquid in tube. We tried different concentration of enzyme with one piece of plastic(3*3*0.25mm), decided to use 2mg/ml to conduct our experiment afterwards.
Figure 1. This curve described the OD600nm after 3h’s reaction changes through the concentration of Thc_Cut1. We can see clearly that at 2mg/ml ,the curve reaches a peak, at which concentration we will compare the hydrolysis effect.
We also conducted our system in various pH, found that the activity of Thc_Cut1 doesn’t change much in different pH, so we chose pH 7.0 as one of our experimental condition.
Figure 2.  The curve shows the absorbance at 600nm changes along with pH. The activity of enzyme doesn’t change much in various pH.
In order to find right time to detect, we detect OD600nm in several time, here’s the result.
Figure 3.  The line clearly indicates that the hydrolysis rate rises along with time.
Considering we need an appropriate detect time to measure the hydrolysis effect, we set our detect time at 3h.
Main experiment
Overview
We discovered the right temperature to conduct various way to mix up our sJanus (or inJanus) and Thc_Cut1. And we have found out the best way to increase the hydrolysis rate.
Result
We conduct our trail in different temperature, realizing 50℃ is the proper temp for the enzyme and our Janus to combine.  
Figure 4. Different colors represent different ways of mix. Thc_Cut1+Janus means enzyme had incubated with Janus for 16h before the plastic was added into the system. And Plastic+Janus means plastic had incubated with Janus before adding enzyme. And we also conduct these incubation separately"
OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,2015,Team:OLS Canmore AB CA#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," a solution to fats and oils build ups, which are caused when fats and oils solidified in the drains. The side project to break down hair was intended “To solve the build up of hair that becomes trapped in plugholes in basins, baths and showers. Hair attracts grease and dirt particulates which build up in drainage systems and restrict the flow of water through pipes. Our project has focused on development of constructs that produce lipase and Keratinase enzymes to degrade FOGs and hair. These constructs are designed to sit within a small, under-sink bioreactor that will produce and feed them into the waste system as the sink is drained.”(https://2014.igem.org/Team:Sheffield/Project) Their construct was designed to break down hair by using a Keratinase that would break down the Keratin protein, however there project was unsuccessful. We started by using the University of Sheffield's construct and then optimized it by fixing the known cleaving issue, and secretion of the protein. Our collaboration with the University of Sheffield 2014 iGEM team allowed us to receive some input into our project and what we could do to make it even better.

To whom it may concern:
My name is Freya Morgan, and I am a member of the Our Lady Of the Snows Catholic Academy iGEM team. We are a small high school based based out of Canmore, Alberta, Canada. We are contacting you because we have chosen to tackle build ups of keratin in wastewater treatment, and well as the poultry industry as this year’s project, and you tackled this issue in your 2014 project. When talking about wastewater treatment, these build ups of hair can lead to clogs causing flooding and the breakage of water pumps and pipes, something very costly to repair. The only current way to deal with this issue is to have a worker manually remove the blockage, which is slow, unpleasant for the worker and inefficient.  Upon further research our team discovered that the reason hair is such a huge issue for waste treatment facilities is because of the protein keratin, which as you probably know is a very hard protein to break down due the tightly wrapped helixes and hydrogen bonds. Once we discovered this pressing issue we looked into keratin more and realized it is also a component of the basic construct of feathers. We learned that they too build up and are hard to break down. With more searching on the iGEM parts registry we discovered your project, as well as one other project, both of whom attempted to solve the keratin issue. With"

iGEM Community
We were delighted to co-host and participate in the iGEM Northern U.K. meet-up. There we got to present our project in its early stages to Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, and Newcastle. This fostered further discussions and of course gave us the opportunity to learn about some of the incredible projects that were happening nearby. As a result of the meet-up, we stayed in touch with the Nottingham and Glasgow teams in particular, and further collaborations are noted below.
Nottingham
We worked with Nottingham at various stages of our project. We stayed in contact using social media and Skype, and we got the chance to speak to them as we were going through formative changes in each of our projects. Furthermore, we also participated in helping them further test their cell rehydration system and give them more data on how well their product worked after being shipped.
Glasgow
Glasgow were very helpful to our team, as we lacked engineers but took it upon ourselves to develop a microfluidic device anyway. Glasgow also developed a fluidic device, and they were very helpful to our team, providing feedback on the design and build of our device during its early stages. Furthermore, they also met with Helena and Joe to improve the function of our 3D printed syringe pumps and helped us design software so the syringe pumps could function.
Technion Israel
Technion Israel got in touch with our team as a result of our collaboration request posted on the iGEM collaboration hub. While it was ultimately not efficient for us to collaborate in the wet lab, we were able to work together very significantly in the dry lab. Technion thought we could aide them in developing a model for their “kill-switch” construct, which utilised Cre/Lox, and we were very happy to try and apply our model to a new circumstance. In the end, our model was able to tell them what concentration of Cre would be required to activate nearly all kill-switches, which was influential in the design and conceptualisation of their project downstream. In addition, it further demonstrated the utility and accuracy of our model in another context. Check out a ""snapshot"" of our results below and read our modelling"

What is our chassis organism?
We used standard commercially available chassis organisms: E. coli strains T7 Express, T7 lysY/Iq, NEB 5-alpha, VH33.
Did we experiment with any other organisms?
We will experiment with the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, utilising a natural endogenous pathway (requiring sulfur deprivation and absence of light) to produce both oxygen and hydrogen gas.
How does our project work?
Our entire project is to do proof-of-concept work for a biologically produced balloon that can explore planetary atmospheres. This involves creating several membrane prototypes made out of latex, collagen, elastin, and p-aramid fibers. E. coli transfected with appropriate DNA will be made to produce these materials endogenously, then lysed so that the protein/polymers can be extracted and assembled into sheetlike structures. Additionally, E. coli will be made to produce melanin that can be linked to our various membrane types using a binding domain by taking advantage of E. coli's tyrosinase pathway. An additional project is using the natural gas production cycle of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to produce hydrogen and oxygen gas for flight in various atmospheres. Finally, for sensing we are using DNA-based aptamers and chromoproteins. The aptamers can sense for various target molecules in space, allowing us to probe the surrounding terrain. The chromoproteins undergo a conformational change that manifests as a physical change in color, allowing them to be used as a type of thermometer when many types of chromoproteins are used at once. They are produced in"

Add 1–50 ng of DNA (in a volume not greater than 5 μL) to the Single Step (KRX) Competent Cells. Move the pipette tip through the cells while dispensing. Quickly flick the tube several times. Do not vortex!
Immediately return the tubes to ice for 5–30 minutes
Heat-shock cells for 15–20 seconds in a water bath at exactly 42 °C. Do not shake.
Immediately place the tubes on ice for 2 minutes.
Add 450 μL of room-temperature SOC-Medium to each transformation reaction, and incubate for 60 minutes at 37 °C with shaking (approximately 225 rpm). For best transformation efficiency, lay the tubes on their sides and tape them to the platform.
For each transformation reaction, we recommend plating 100 μL of undiluted cells and 1:10 and 1:100 cell dilutions on antibiotic plates. Incubate the antibiotic plates at 37 °C over night.
Standard BioBrick Assembly
modified from Silver lab :  This assembly method can be used for BioBricks which are bigger than 150 bp. The BioBrick should be at least 500 bp bigger or smaller than the backbone. The BioBrick, which complies with these conditions, is used as the insert and is assembled into the prefix or suffix of the other used BioBrick, called vector. So you have to differentiate between a prefix and a suffix insertion.
Suffix Insertion
Digestion of insert: at least 700 ng DNA / 10 µL volume, 1 µL 10x Tango buffer, 0.5 µL XbaI , 0.5 µL PstI . Digest for 2 h to 4 h at 37 °C, afterwards inactivation for 20 min at 80 °C. Clean up the insert via gel electrophoresis. When"

Demonstrate
Gold Medal Criterion #4
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your project works. There are many ways in which your project working could be demonstrated, so there is more than one way to meet this requirement. This gold medal criterion was introduced in 2016, so check our what 2016 teams did to achieve a their gold medals!
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
What should we do for our demonstration?
Standard teams
If you have built a proof of concept system, you can demonstrate it working under real world conditions. If you have built a biological device that is intended to be a sensor, can you show it detecting whatever it is intended to sense. If it is intended to work in the field, you can show how this might work using a simulated version in the lab, or a simulation of your device in the field. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
Special track teams
Special track teams can achieve this medal criterion by bringing their work to the Jamboree and showcasing it in the track event. Art & Design, Measurement, Hardware and Software tracks will all have showcase events at the Giant Jamboree. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab."

Yuze WU
I will go to bed before 12 today!
Yuze is majoring in material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
He learns a lot in the project and is always inspired by his teammates. “I did many things I’ve never tried before. And when my teammates are taking pains, I do feel encouraged and believe that I have to work harder”, he says.
Yuze first worked in the lab, while later he focused on designing and making the hardware. He also took part in some HP activities. Attracted by biology science as a participants in iGEM, Yuze plans to minor in biology.
Besides, he keeps doing sport and sometimes play music for relax. He is interested in numerous things and enjoys a fulfilling college life.
Yunfan LI
Riding the subway with my MP3 is the most enjoyable thing I can imagine.
Yunfan is a sophomore majoring in biology in UCAS.
He gets a pretty memorable experience with his fantastic teammates and sapiential tutors and learns a lot in the lab. That really promotes his gcolumnth in both knowledge level and spiritual level. He also recognizes what he is truly interested in and figures out his future researching plan in cell oxidation and reduction.
He spends most of his time on fighting with the experiment in lab and draws the vestigial energy out for the hardware designing and circuit welding. The interlab work is also finished by him.
Like most schoolboys in campus, he loves computer games and sports and can play badminton quite well. Taking the public transport for aimless roaming is also his favor. However, no one can strip the comic out of his life. Remember! No one!!!
Shubo YUAN
If I rest, I rust.
Shubo is a junior majoring in biological science at UCAS.
He learns some experimental operation of molecular biology, some methods to organize material and data, and many routes from the lab to the school. He wants to make biological experiments more automated to liberate biotech hands.
He undertook most of the experimental tasks in the group of ammonia degradation. He spent most of his time adding samples. He also did some work of human practice, but mostly ended in failure.
Outside the lab he has little hobby in addition to watching anime. Learning and experimenting make him happy.

After tidying up and cleaning all the tables, the pupils gave us their      feedback about the workshop. All in all, this was a very successful afternoon, we learned       a lot from it ourselves, had fun and hope that we helped the pupils getting an insight in      the occupational field of genetic engineering. We want to say thank you to the Marie-      Therese- Gymnasium Erlangen and the biology teachers for letting us organize this      workshop, being so helpful with and enthusiastic about the idea. Of course, we were      mindful of safety, too. We worked in a biology room, where eating and drinking is      prohibited. Every student had to wear safety goggles and gloves, they had to change at      least two times, during the whole workshop. We used no harmful substances and had      safety sheets put on display.
Christian-Ernst-Gymnasium Erlangen
On Juli 11th, 2017 members of our iGEM team then visited the Christian-Ernst-     Gymnasium in Erlangen, giving a workshop on iGEM and genetic engineering. Alena,     Ann-Sophie, Benedikt, Hannah, Steffen, Ariane, Luise, Eva, Alex and Jonas met at     7:30am to get all the last minute preparations done. After Alena, Ariane and Steffen     informed the students about iGEM, genetical engineering and therefore ist risks and     benefits. But the workshop should not stay as theoretical is that – basic biologic work     techniques were coached by our team with the aid of a micro cake recipe: The students     were able to “bake” a cake under laboratory like circumstances. Afterwards, our team     members provided the students with information about university life and possible     courses of study. All in all: a verysuccessful human practice project!
Marie-Therese-Gymnasium Erlangen 2.0
On July 13th 2017 we once again used the chance to promote our iGEM-project to the     greater public: Again we visited the Marie-Therese- Gymnasium in Erlangen to offer our     DNA extraction workshop. But not we were standing in front of the crowd to explain –     but rather the students with whom we had held our workshop in May were pointing out     the important steps to the visitors of the school’s Project Day “TraumVision 2017”.

Collaboration:
This year, in order to accord to the standard of Gold Medal, we made contacts with other iGEM teams in China to exchange ideas, introduce each others’ projects and give advice to perfect them. Those teams that we cooperated with are NAU-CHINA , UESTC-software and JSNU-China .
We helped the NAU-CHINA producing a practical model designed by them through our 3D printing technology. Besides, we helped the UESTC-software team carry out a test of randomness and fault tolerance of their software Bio101 and build a mathematical model to analyze their compression algorithm bzip2 in the form of a software test report. We also worked with the JSNU-China team, shooting a flash video in order to let more people knowing iGEM Competition.
Collaboration with NAU-CHINA:
(https://2016.igem.org/Team:NAU-CHINA/Collaborations)
Before our meeting, we arranged a video conference, during which we introduced our projects and ideas briefly and planned the itinerary for meeting up.
On September 28th 2016, some team members of NAU-CHINA came to our college with their wonderful ideas and great interests to discuss our projects in details so that we could better understand both of our projects and dig into the part that we may need to cooperate. During the discussion, we talked about our understanding of synthetic biology, including its huge potential in benefiting human beings and all kinds of amazing breakthroughs that scientists made lately. Then we displayed and deeply explained our project, to which they gave some great advice such as taking time into consideration in case of traffic congestion to optimize our path planning"
BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Integrated Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," 95% confidence interval of the dependent variable means under the different levels of the independent variable, and then we can analyze the degree of the different levels. But the precondition is that the data should satisfy the homogeneity of variance, in other words, the variance of the data should be the independent identically distributed. In the next part of the modeling, we will use the one-way analysis of variance to analyze the data, and then deal with the data.
2.0 - The homogeneity test of variance
We use the SPSS to do the homogeneity test of variance with the data we got, the outcome is shown in the figure below:
Fig.2 The figure of the data’s homogeneity test of variance
From the figure, we can see the data’s variance is XXX, nearly zero. Therefore, we can think the data meets the requirement about the homogeneity of variance and we can use the one-way analysis of variance to deal with the data.
3.0 - Construct the F-test statistics
The independent variable is a classified variable which values 0 and 1 to describe whether the tax is added into the test tube. The dependent variable is the change of the micrutubule’ length, our modeling is shown below:
$$ y = u_i + \varepsilon_{ij} $$
y is the dependent variable, the change of the microtubule’s length.  is the j observed value of the independent variable under the i level. is the mean of dependent variable under the I level.  stands for the residual between dependent variable’s value and it’s mean value,  also obey the normal distribution  \(N(0, \sigma_i ^2)\)
Then we construct the F test statistics. First, we define the quadratic sum of the residual:
$$ SSE = \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (y_{ij}-\overline y_1)^2 $$
And the quadratic sum of the elements:
$$ SSA = \sum_{i=1}^k n_i (\overline y_{1}-\overline y)^2 $$
SSA reflects the variance between different levels and the difference is made by the different elements; SSE reflects the variance in a certain level and this random difference is due to the selected sample’s random. For example, the measured length of the microtubule will be different when we add the TAX into the test tube.
On the basis of the theory, our F test statistics is:
$$ F = \frac{SSA/(n-k)}{S"

What is flux balance analysis?
<p>Flux balance analysis, or FBA, is the method by which we determine the flow of metabolites, or flux, through the constructed metabolic network of a GSM1. FBA allows us to predict growth rates of an organism under certain media conditions, along with the production levels of targeted metabolites, such as ATP.

Sample FBA outputs for several E.coli strain models. Values are in mmol/(gram cell dry weight * hour)
*Note that the units for maximum ATP are tied to biomass; therefore the maximum ATP value for nitrogen fixing E. coli is  actually much lower, not higher, than the wild type values.
Mass balance constraints are imposed on each metabolite using the stoichiometric coefficients of each metabolic reaction and the assumption that the organism is in the logarithmic growth phase (i.e. its metabolic fluxes are at steady state). This assumes that the total amount of any compound being produced is equal to the total amount being consumed. Upper and lower bounds are also applied to constrain the maximum fluxes based on the directionality of the reactions.

Linear programming is then used to identify the flux distribution throughout the model in order to maximize the flux through the biomass equation, subject to the previously defined constraints.

Engineered TALEs
Our system had to be designed to only detect EHEC E.coli. We found out that Stx2 is the common gene between all EHEC organisms. This gene is responsible for production of Shigatoxin, which is the factor that causes illness in humans. Therefore, we decided to design two TALEs that bind to two regions of Stx2 gene. We have to remember that our TALE-capture system detects DNA; therefore, if the TALEs are not designed to exclusively bind to the Stx2 gene they could produce a false positive by binding to anything such as the DNA of a type of grass that the cow has eaten, cattle’s own DNA, or another type of microorganism living inside the cow’s gut. Furthermore, TALEs are not perfect. They can bind to a DNA segment if its sequence is close enough to their target site. This could especially be problematic if a piece of DNA has a high similarity with the nucleotides on the 5’ end of TALE’s target site.
In addition to specificity, we also tried to design TALEs that have the highest binding affinity as possible. This is important for both TALEs. The immobilized TALE has to be able to keep a relatively large DNA in place and keep holding on to it when the very large mobile complex also docks onto the DNA (TALE attached to a ferritin nanoparticle or beta-lactamase). The mobile TALE is fused to a ferritin nanoparticle, which in turn is fused to eleven other TALEs. So the mobile TALE has to be able"

Meeting with NTU-Taida
National Taiwan University which is the best and  most historic college in Taiwan joins the iGEMcompetition first time. Both NTU and NYMU located in Taipei.  As a result, this meeting was easily held on June 1st without any  difficulty. Besides, some participants were friends or classmates during senior  high school.
Unlike the traditional meeting, we, NYMU-Taipei  iGEM Team, treated the friends from NTU and made the meeting like party. So,  we, NYMU-Taipei team, prepared some drink and delicious food.
NTU-Taida team showed their team-work ability. I was surprised that they have good project-design, perfect bio-circuit and models. I couldn’t believe that NTU-Taida just participated in iGEM this year. Compared to National Taiwan University, National Yang Ming University is just a biomedical school which is lack of departments like economic, politics, electronic, etc. Owing to it, our report might not be more abundant than them. But I thought our team had more creative idea than them. Also, our team presentation was great.
Both NTU and NYMU classmates weren’t afraid of  asking questions to the reporters. The members of two iGEM teams shared their  interest in Synthetic biology and learning. The questions from classmates let  us have more experience and learn more. It is a good activity for iGEMers to  devote themselves into. I hope we can have a meetup next time as soon as  possible.

Fusion Protein
Here we will discuss the structural modeling of the fusion protein that we had planned in order to obtain a green chromoprotein . We used the bioinformatics tools developed by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (Swiss-Model [1]) and by the Xu group of Chicago University (RaptorX [2]).
Swiss-Model has given us three highly probable models. Two models for the first part of our Fusion Protein and another for second part of our protein. We chose the first model for the yellow chromoprotein (1st part) and the second model for the blue chromoprotein (2nde part).
The first part – Yellow chromoprotein:
The yellow chromoprotein used to create this fusion protein is nammed the fwYellow, a yellow chromoprotein ( BBa_K1033910 developed by iGEM13_Uppsala). Homology modeling via Swiss-Model for the first chromoprotein gives us a nearly exact match with amFP486 which is a cyan fluorescent protein from Anemonia majano (the same organism as the Uppsala's biobrick). Only 3 amino-acids change between the sequence of the two chromoproteins. These amino-acids are in the core of the protein. We can therefore hypothesize that at least three positions can be modified to change"
Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," course in Molecular Biology with Industry in which he achieved a first class degree. During this time he completed a one year placement with Pfizer in X-ray Crystallography and biophysical characterisation of protein-ligand complexes.  James also undertook a ten week summer studentship making cDNA libraries and conducting sequencing studies at the University of Liverpool.  Upon completion of his undergraduate, James was awarded a four year Wellcome Trust sponsored PhD at the University of Leeds.
Sarah Deacon
Originally from Harrogate, Sarah attained her BSc in Applied and Analytical Chemistry at Huddersfield, then moved on to her PhD in Molecular and Cellular Biology at Leeds, where she has since remained as part of the Membrane Proetien Structure initiative (MPSi) . The MPSi consortium develops techniques and resources for high throughput methods for the expression, purification, crystallisation and structure determination of integral membrane proteins, and Dr. Deacon's work within this looks at the development of antibody mimetics for clinical diagnostics. Sarah regularly works alongside Prof. Mike McPherson to this end, and her ample knowledge of antibody interactions is a great boon for the team.
If she's not too busy in her lab, Dr. Deacon often pops by to check in on the team, and is a reassuring face to see - and not only because she often comes bearing gifts of fresh coffee and biscuits!
Michael McPherson
Mike's background is molecular biology and in particular protein engineering. His current research focuses on (a) selection and applications of Adhiron artificial binding proteins (b) metalloenzymes and specifically copper containing oxidases (c) self assembling peptides (d) membrane proteins (e) synthetic biology.
Bruce Turnbull
Bruce's interests lie at the interface of carbohydrate chemistry and molecular glycobiology. In his work he combines synthetic chemistry and biophysical techniques to study carbohydrate-binding proteins. Although such interactions are essential for many normal biological processes, they also facilitate viral and bacterial infection, cancer metastasis, and entry into cells by bacterial toxin proteins. He is investigating the interactions between cholera toxin and cell surface oligosaccharides, and using this information to design small molecule inhibitors of cholera toxin using fragment-based approaches.
Steve Evans
Aside from being one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet, Steve is also head of the eponymous Evans Group, which focuses upon the physics of self organising molecular systems. OF particular interest at the moment are lipid microbubbles and membranes, and bio-functionalised inorganic surfaces. Study of the systems is varied, inlcuding the analysis of the physical transport of metabol"
Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html,"K cells that were stored in 10% and 25% glycerol. Initial trials of manipulating these variables showed 2% xylose, no shaking, and 10% glycerol to lead to greater growth of colonies and therefore better transformation. More trials need to be conducted before we can make definite conclusions.
Although there was colony growth for all of the variables tested, none of the colonies turned red despite the vector containing an RFP cassette. We conducted colony PCR and ran the products on a gel, on which bands of the right size appeared. Literature search is still being done as to the cause behind the colonies not turning red.
We further tested for the insertion of the thrC vector with the threonine test, in which transformed colonies with the thrC insertion would only grow on MNGE media with the amino acid threonine but we did not see any growth on this plate.
Week 13: July 21 - 25
The team decided on having each subgroup present their findings in the form of a work-in-progress presentation at the weekly meetings and the Transformers were the first group to present. We received valuable input from our advisors, such as having quantitative results for our transformations instead of qualitative ones that consisted of pictures of plates.
We planned on making serial dilutions of each transformation next week and repeating conditions we have already tested in order to obtain quantitative results. We also researched on protocols available to make spores. We found one protocol, but we are missing one reagent required to make a media. We are still searching for this reagent and once we obtain it, we will immediately start working on making B. subtilis spores.
Week 14: July 26 - August 1
In order to quantify transformation, we did 1/10 serial dilutions of B. subtilis transformed with thrC and tested 1% xylose vs. 2% xylose, along with shake vs. no shake. All of the colonies were red, suggesting successful transformation. The amount of colonies consistently decreased with each dilution, except for the 2% xylose + shake condition, for which colonies only grew on the the 100% concentrated plate. Qualitatively, the 2% xylose + no shake condition resulted in the most number of colonies on the 1/10 000 dilution plate, however there were too many colonies to count and this suggested that we should dilute the colonies further in the future.
When discussing the results with Dr. Schryvers, he recommended some changes to our protocol. One major change we considered was using a stock"

SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT-China#criticalThinking_-_-_TEXT.html," And at the same time, there should be a specialized department with specialized talents in charge of gene technology for professional supervision.
National Health and Family Planning Commission of Republic of China should bring the gene editing technology into the management of the third class medical technology. Think about how to regulate gene editing and therapy research by setting a threshold. For example, setting a specialized government department in investigating, registering, and supervising the total procedure of making research in gene editing and therapy is obligatory.
Actually there are many discussions about gene legislation in China and we can learn a lot from them. For example, for the lawmaker, general principle and reasonable exception rule should be kept in the lawmaking process preventing gene discrimination. Based on the general principle, employer should not require gene information from employee to prevent unfair treatment. And when it comes to the exception concerning the public safety, the employer can obtain gene information from employee but should make sure to keep the gene privacy.
[Reference：The Discussion on the Gene Discrimination from the perspective of the first gene discrimination case in China]
What can we do in advocating for political legal change?
Have a deeper investigation into gene technology legislation and prepare a comprehensive proposal for the Deputy to the People's Congress. In China, People's Congress is the lawmaker in a real sense, and if we want to emphasize the importance of starting the legislation process, we should draw the deputy’s attention with reasonable and sufficient preparation. But it’s really difficult to achieve so because of the deficiency our scholarly attainments and influence.
The other way to promote the lawmaking is to influence the government. In our country China, the government plays a role as the lawmaker to some extent even though government is administrative body. If we can make great achievement in our research about myocardial ischemia disease, we may have dialogue with the government to share our views of point in policy making. And the government may keep a watchful eye on the gene development to promote gene therapy, gene editing and synthetic biology, a subject booming since the beginning of 21th century by government subsidies, government procurement and financial allocation.
To our surprise, during the conversation with Dr. Huang, an expert in legal filed, he suggested us to have more communication with the law professors in our university, South China University of Technology, because law professors in our school are always invited to draft a law with the legislative institution. The more specialized knowledge about gene we exchange with our professors, the more information about biology like the synthetic biology and gene therapy will be shared with them. And they will have a clear understanding about the importance of gene legislation. Perhaps one day our team can serve as technical consultants to"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," perform a highly specific covalent binding reaction, which we wanted to incorporate into our target protein. Therefore, we created a library of aaRS with random mutagenized amino acid binding sites and a selection system to select for the aaRS that specifically incorporates the ncAA. In parallel to the libary and selection based approach, we modeled the aaRS which could incorporate our new amino acid CBT-asparagine. We demonstrated that both ways are suitable for the evolution of aaRS.
Although incorporation of ncAAs through the amber codon works, there are challenges associated with this approach. The repurposing of codons leads to the decrease of the growth rate of E. coli and it is only feasible to incorporate up to two different ncAAs. Therefore, we took a new way to incorporate ncAAs. The incorporation of an unnatural base pair into the DNA generates 64 new codons. Our first challenge was the uptake of the unnatural base from the media, because E.coli has no nucleoside triphosphate transporter and is not able to synthetize the bases itself. We cloned a nucleoside triphosphate transporter that enables the uptake of both bases from the media. Furthermore, we analyzed the transcriptome  of the plant Croton tiglium, which produces the unnatural base isoG. The transcriptome revealed an enzyme for the biosynthesis, which was  cloned and characterized for the biosynthesis of isoG in E. coli. To detect the unnatural base we developed two orthogonal systems. A restriction experiment based on the software tool M.A.X . and an adaption of the Oxford Nanopore sequencing , which were combined into one software suite .
To demonstrate the possibilities offered by the incorporation of ncAAs, we developed a toolbox containing five different tools. We chose seven different ncAAs for these five tools and demonstrated interesting applications for them. These ncAAs can be used for various approaches in basic research, medicine and manufacturing. Furthermore, with our submitted parts , every iGEM team can incorporate these ncAAs into their target proteins.
Regarding our project, two of the ncAAs that are part of our toolbox perform an autocatalytic reaction upon irradiation with ultraviolet light. Therefore, we decided to build our own LED panel that allows us to perform experiments with these non‑canonical amino acids under reproducible irradiation conditions.

Dominican Republic Trip | March 30, - April 6, 2018
Summary Points
Would our project be relevant in real-life situations?
How can we improve our project to address critical needs in developing nations?
How dire is the water crisis?
Is there a detection mechanism already available? Is it specific? Is it inexpensive?
Impact of drinking water from contaminated sources.
Prevalence of Helminth infections and cholera cases.
Several Lambert iGEM alumni and current members traveled to the Dominican Republic, specifically the city of Hato Mayor, to work on a water filtration project.
We met with Dr. Rainyer from the Ministry of Health; Dr. Rainyer emphasized the lack of practical mechanisms available to detect waterborne diseases in contaminated water sources. According to Dr. Rainyer, there is no proactive treatment mechanism available for waterborne diseases in the city of Hato Mayor. After informing him about our project, Dr. Rainyer stated that having an efficient, inexpensive detection tool would be extremely useful for field testing.
A majority of the residents living in Hato Mayor did not have access to clean, drinking water and buying bottled water was a financial burden. While installing water filters, iGEM members had the opportunity to speak to the residents living in Hato Mayor. In the city, trash invaded the resident’s homes, gardens, and water sources.
We asked the residents how and where they retrieved their water. They said that the only way to get clean water was to drive down to the markets to buy bottled water; however, they emphasized how much of a financial burden this was.  Since many of the residents did not have access to transportation, they would have to pay for the costly trip.

Hong_Kong_UCCKE,2016,Team:Hong Kong UCCKE#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," The numerator [T-C] is the number of worms which made response due to the effect of the tested substances.
The index value will range between -1 and 1. If the index is negative, it means the tested chemical is a repellent; in contrast, positive index means the tested chemical is an attractant.
Positive Control
We tested our assay and response index by chemical diacetyl, a known strong attractant to C. elegans. And the result is promising that the Response index of volatile is close to +1.00, which means that assay and response index can show diacetyl is a strong attractant.
Negative Control
We also tried using water as negative control for the assay. The Response index is +0.07. Which means the assay can show that the worms have no significant response, neither attraction or repulsion, to water.
Assay on pure substances
We tested on pure chemicals of cinnamaldehyde and phenylpyruvic acid to check if our assumptions about the attractiveness were correct.
The result is that index of cinnamaldehyde is -0.81 when concentration is 1. Phenylpyruvic acid’s index is +0.34. With the evidence provided by the tests, the results are clearly shown. Cinnamaldehyde is a strong repellent and phenylpyruvic acid is a moderate attractant. Please refer to the result page for a more detailed assay results.
Assay on bacteria synthesized chemicals
We did a similar assay on bacteria synthesized cinnamaldehyde and phenylpyruvic acid. Other than testing the bacteria synthesized chemicals, we also conducted assay to test on bacteria containing backbone-only plasmid as a negative control with water remaining as a control. This is to ensure it is the bacteria synthesized chemical which affect the assay result instead of the plasmid or bacteria itself involving in the results. The response indexes taken in assay on bacteria synthesized phenylpyruvic acid and backbone-only plasmid bacteria are +0.83 and +0.63 respectively. Please refer to the result page for a more detailed assay results. The result indicates that the plasmid and bacteria itself is already an attractant to C.elegans. However, on top of the attractiveness produced by the bacteria with plasmid backbone, phenylpyruvic had increased the overall attractiveness. For cinnamaldehyde, we were not able to clone the genes into a plasmid and do transformation and thus we did not conduct any assay on bacteria synthesized cinnamaldehyde.

Device Design
This device incorporates two key elements of mechanical engineering design: simplicity and functionality. Key concepts from fluid mechanics are applied to pump water into and out of the encapsulation as efficiently as possible. The system can be placed in or out of the water, which makes it easy to use in any situation. The sleek aluminum casing offers a durable resistance to the ever-changing surroundings and environment. Overall, the simplicity of the design makes it user-friendly and adaptable.
Our design is very similar to commonly used fixed-bed adsorption and ion exchange columns in that it involves flow of a fluid down through a packed bed that removes a solute. However, an important difference is those types of columns contain chemical resins or adsorbents that can become saturated (i.e. reach capacity) as they adsorb solute. Since we use encapsulated bacteria whose ""capacity"" is only limited their lifetime, our device has the added benefit that the mass-transfer zone (the part of the column where the solute is removed) doesn't move down the column due to saturation. This also means that we don't need to alternate between adsorption and regeneration cycles.
Scalability
Based on the small-scale experiments we conducted in lab, we calculated a few values that will be useful in scaling up our process to a pilot-plant size. Shown above is a simple process flow diagram (PFD) for a pilot scale wastewater treatment process utilizing our encapsulated bacteria. An in-depth scalability analysis is linked below, and the results are quickly summarized on this page. A residence time of 8 hrs is used as a first approximation based on small scale time-point studies of 1 mg/L methylmercury degradation. For a flow rate of 0.1 m3/h, which is within the range used in other pilot-plant studies, a 0.8 m3 packed bed will be needed, with a diameter of 0.6 m and a length of 2.8 m. Based on a SEM characterization of our beads and an approximation for how they would pack in our reactor, the pressure drop across the reactor was calculated to be 5970 Pa•s, equivalent to frictional losses of 5.97 J/kg. Based on these calculated values, it is concluded that our encapsulation technology can be used in a larger scale plant. Click here  for more detail!

Looking at the coefficient a, b, we find it to have dimensions \([a]=1m^3\), \([b]=1m^3\). This allows us to use only the ln(x)-part of the integral as the left side of equation (A) has the same dimension. Then we do an approximation:
(D)
We find this to have the same dimension as a left part of integration (A):
(E)
The oil used for droplet production has a surfactant dissolved in order to reduce the interfacial tension. In the same way the oil used for spacing the re-injected droplets must have the same fraction of surfactant to make sure their surface keeps saturated with surfactant molecules. We postulate the lowest thickness of the drainage film can be equal to the size of the surfactant monomer [2]\(a \approx 2 nm\). Placing back the thickness of the drainage-film \(x=T\), and rewriting the equation for \(T\), we get a function \(T(t)\):
(F)
Here \(T_0\) is the initial thickness of drainage film at time \(t=0\).
The initial thickness T0 is found from a continuity condition stating the total flow rate in a system is constant. The flow rates for two populations of droplets are expressed as following:
(G) [Re-injected emulsion of droplets V1 with spacer oil]
(H) [On-chip produced emulsion of droplets V2 with oil]
(I) [Emulsion of droplets after coalescence]
Here \(Q_{sp}\) represents the spacer oil flow rates for two droplet populations. In our experiments of droplet coalescence, the flow rates of liquids are tuned in a way to have droplets of two populations flowing into a fusion chamber at 1:1 ratio. We might assume the number of droplets per time unit is equal to one. This means the time in equations (E)-(F) has to be changed into coalescence time tc. The time for two droplet injection is the same unit time \(\varDelta t\), while the time unit for droplet fusion is \(\varDelta t + t\). In our system with idealized-conditions, the volume of spacer oil comes between two droplets through a channel of dimensions H×W1. This unit is then injected into a wider chamber H×Wch (See Fig.2).

The field of synthetic biology is often dealt with in the media and often the possible consequences of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food is discussed highly controversial. One main reason for the high controversy is the lack of communication between researchers and the public. On September 17th, we invited 40 pupils in their final high-school year from the Mildred Scheel Schule Böblingen to our institute. Our aim was to introduce the practical and theoretical background of synthetic biology, our work and discuss related topics. In the practical part of the school@lab day we teached some widely used methods like  PCR and restriction digestion.
We performed an experiment to prove the existence of CRY1Ab, a corn gene that encodes for a delta-endotoxin. These CRY-toxins form pores, which are naturally produced by Bacillus thuringiensis. Their incorporation into the corn genome helps to perish the European corn borer, a corn parasite, during corn cultivation as these CRY-toxins have a insecticidal effect.
In the theoretical part we gave an overview to synthetic biology and introduced widely used methods. We tried to demonstrate insights into the implications of GMOs and gene technology in general. In the practical part we extracted  DNA from food samples, which were used for PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). The PCR products were then separated via agarose gel electrophoresis to check on CRY1Ab. Restriction digestion was used to identify one out of five given plasmids.
This little exercise on the interpretation of scientific data, and the test on the cry1A(b)-gene were well received by the pupils as they were able to figure out what it is like to analyze their own results and draw conclusions from that. We discussed together what might have gone wrong and what information they got from the  corn samples.They were excited to learn methods like PCR and gel electrophoresis, because such experiments are usually not carried out in school. Especially the loading of an agarose gel was very fascinating for them and led to a lot of questions concerning the theoretical background.
The pupils learned how to interpret scientific data and test for CRY1Ab was used to teach analysis of their own results and draw conclusions from it. We discussed possible errors"

Zeaxanthin (CrtZ)
Zeaxanthin belongs to carotenoid family and is widely found in the nature. It is also a natural color making corns, carrots and marigolds yellow. Moreover, zeaxanthin is an essential nutrient substance to human’s eyes, and some healthy supplements are made of it. Most of green plants produce zeaxanthin as an intermediate in carotenoid pathway. However, some photosynthetic bacteria such as cyanobacteria lack of zeaxanthin. Therefore, we try to transform zeaxanthin-related genes to cyanobacteria to make them yellow6.
After literature search, we did not find research articles on this subject. Under our instructor’s help, we develop a way to make cyanobacteria yellow. We compare the complete carotenoid pathway with Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 whole genomic DNA on KEGG and we find every zeaxanthin-related gene is included in PCC 7942 genomic DNA except beta-carotene hydroxylase (crtZ) . And we find crtZ coding sequence with ribosome-binding site is an igem released part (BBa_I742158), which is from a plant pathogen, Pantoea ananatis5.
We had successfully transformed CrtZ to Escherichia coli to reproduce massively, and then transformed CrtZ with pPIGBACK to Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. After a week, the transformed Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 expressed more yellow than the control group. To test whether the photosynthetic efficiency is better, we used iodine to measure starch concentration and compare it with wild type.7, 8

As a sophomore, this is my first year to be an iGEMer. Through the past whole year, I gradually knew the meaning of this competition. I felt amazed about how attractive and challenging this competetion could be. In terms of the experiments, I worked in the CecropinXJ expression group. During the whole process, I gained not only the experimental skills, but also the importance of team work. I do appreciate the unforgettable experience which this competetion offered me, and I believe it will be a precious gift through my life.

Ashlee and Emily met with Dr. Richard to discuss research using his biomass hydrolyzer and using a HYSYS model of a biorefinery plant to evaluate the economic benefits of increasing the threshold of furfural/HMF toxin bacteria can tolerate by inserting the HMF-ABCDE catabolism pathway. We will begin manipulating the Aspen Plus model and Economic analysis from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) .
Plan for continuing codon optimization project is supported by the advisers. Clay updated notebook online as well as the document diagramming the design process of the project.More RBS calculations run. Problem with RBS library calculator at this point is that using no initial condition (only N's in the  constraints field, followed by Pst1) the calculator does not mutate the Pst1 site that needs to be part of the dRBS, but yields very low TIR. Using a strong initial condition, followed by Pst1, the calculator yields acceptable TIR but mutates Pst1. Inserting Pst1 into these calculations after the fact, and then using the ""evaluate"" function of the calculator shows that TIR drops precipitously. Calculations were run in single RBS forward engineering mode to determine max TIR that can be found using only N's and Pst1. Culture of pFTV harboring cells inoculated.

Ashlee performed a transformation of Plasmid 1 into DH10B Escherichia coli electrocompetent cells via electroporation and plated this on Kanamycin plates. This was done to regenerate our Plasmid 1 so we can digest it and insert the dCas9 and Lambda Red Recombinase systems. She updated the Notebook and Project pages, and is constructing figures for her design process. She is having trouble with ""div"" functions in HTML and is consequently frustrated. We met with Dr. Salis and Dr. Richard for our biweekly iGEM meeting and Ashlee presented the work on the website, presentation and Emily's demonstration idea for the Center for Science and the Schools, and current progress on the project.

The growth curve of IPTG-induced and Arabinose-induced E. coli BL21
To ensure when we should add the inducer, we measured the growth curve of BBa_K2623026 (IPTG-induced) and BBa_K2623027 (Arabinose-induced). According to figure 1a, we found that after incubation for 5 h, the OD600 of BBa_K2623026 (IPTG-induced) reached to about 0.6, which is suitable for adding IPTG to a final concentration at 0.5 mM. Figure 1b shows that after incubation for 5 h, the OD600 of BBa_K2623027 (Arabinose-induced) reached to about 0.6, which is suitable for adding Arabinose to a 0.2% final concentration.

Incubated in 37 °C for 2 hours.
I ran the digested products in an agarose 1 % gel 80 V.
DNA Ladder: FastRuler™ Middle Range, ready-to-use, 100-5000 bp Fermentas
Arrangement on gel:
I ran a new digestion since the first one did not indicate wether or not the digest had worked or not. The second digest I altered the amounts in the mixture into those values that I have used previously when digesting.
Second digest:
Incubated in 37 °C for 1 hour (PCR prod) and 3 hours (vector).
I ran the digested products in an agarose 1 % gel 80 V.
Ladder: GeneRuler™ DNA Ladder Mix, ready-to-use, 100-10,000 bp Fermentas
Arrangement on gel:
I still don't get reliable results that the enzyme has cut, therefore I will run a gel tomorrow with an uncut vector to compare with the cut vector sample, this should show if the enzyme can cut and from there I know that the site directed mutagenesis tyrosinase samples have been succesful in altering the restiction site for"

Meeting other teams
iGEM UGent
It is always a pleasure to collaborate with our compatriots. Indeed, both of our teams were very pleased with this collaboration. We tried to review each other work as much as possible and one week before the Jamboree, we also met in order to discuss each other presentations and posters.
Finally after this incredible adventure, we plan to organise a conference on synthetic biology, here in Belgium. This would be the perfect opportunity to fill in Belgian students about what is iGEM and how this contest brings so much hopes to synthetic biology.
Aalto-Helsinki
One member of our team (Pierre-Antoine) spent his second semester (January-May 2016) in Helsinki for an exchange. He made the most of it by contacting the Aalto-Helsinki iGEM team to organize a meeting with them. It was rewarding for both teams as they could discuss about ideas and organization in general.
Meeting other scientists
One conference from the UCL research institute ‘ISV’ which stands for Institut des Sciences de la Vie (Life Science Institute)  was dedicated to our iGEM project under the theme ‘Our First Scientific Adventure’. It was presented by Antoine Godeaux and Joaquin Guzman on the 7th of October 2016 .
Meeting other students
Short presentations about iGEM and our project were organized before or during the break of several courses at the University. The purpose was to inform and draw the attention of students to iGEM and synthetic biology.
Meeting our sponsors
One of our Sponsor provided us with Corn Syrup (See Homemade product ) used for our test of selection for our leaky porins. We could also work with them in order to analyze the different products through chromatographic analysis.

As the digestions of the transcriptional unit (TU) of EaDAcT were incorrect, we repeated the process from the ligation step.
We transformed the same TU in a E. coli competent strain (DH5α). Then, the transformants were cultured in LB media and Spm and stored at 37°C overnight.
Finally, in order to obtain the FAO1 gene, we want to extract the Candida tropicalis genome, so we have picked a colony of C. tropicalis. To check the extraction protocol, we used a yeast previously tested, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have cultured C. tropicalis in YPD media and S. cerevisiae in YPDA media at 28 °C (5 mL).
07/23/2014
Candida genome extraction
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used as a control in order to see if we followed the protocol correctly. We aren't really sure if this protocol is going to work in Candida.
Cultures measured at 600 nm:
S. cerevisiae Abs = 1.07
C. tropicalis Abs = 0.39
S. cerevisiae is recultured with new media (1:2) because the previous media was saturated. 2.25 mL of YPD media were mixed with 2.25 mL of S. cerevisiae culture. The mix has to grow at 28 °C until the exponential phase is reached.
The absorbance was measured again:
S. cerevisiae Abs = 0.52
C. tropicalis Abs = 0.40
Buffers needed for the genome extraction were prepared freshly.The genome of both strains of yeast were extracted following the protocol:
Grow yeast in 2 or 5 mL YPD to exponential phase.
Collect cells in 1.5 mL eppendorf-cup (centrifugation 20 s, 6000 rpm).
Wash once with 1 mL sterile water.
Resuspend cells in 200 μL protoplast-buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 1000 units Zymolyase/mL, 10 μL beta-mercaptoethanol/mL; prepare freshly!). Incubate at 37°C for 1-2 h and finally resuspend by turning the cups.

As a new team, with limited knowledge of iGEM competition, we desperately needed instructions and suggestions on how to start and manage a team. We have met obstacles and setbacks and we have been seeking advice from 3 teams.
NUDT-China: We invited iGEM NUDT-China that has participated in iGEM for three times to answer our puzzles. During the meeting, NUDT-China introduced the iGEM process, and shared their experience in team building in detail with us. At the same time, they gave comments on our project, and put forward a lot of good ideas.
Nanjing-China: After proposing some initial ideas of our own project, in order to polish up it, some of our team members went to Nanjing University to obtain experience. In Nanjing University, both teams gave a presentation on their project design. As a veteran team, Nanjing-China gave us constructive suggestions which were significant to us. From then on, we gradually became clearer in thoughts and got started with our work.
UESTC-China: The UESTC-China post some plasmids and introduced to us some details about the iGEM.
Counseling
Biosafety issues
Doctor Li Ming is experienced in doing research in horizontal gene transfer and teaching the lecture on biosafety for undergraduates. The biosafety issue is one of the major concerns of both participant teams and organizers of iGEM. Before we started in the wet lab, we asked Doctor Li to evaluate the biosafety issues of our whole project. He introduced the biosafety classifications of different organisms and protection practices among different biosafety level labs. The Vi antigen project was his major concern and he gave us valuable suggestions. He also communicated with Doctor Cong Yanuang to confirm our lab procedures, making sure we were not going to culture S.Typhi but just to extract the genomic DNA of S.Typhi. He helped us analyze whether there were potential transposable elements among the His targeting locus, and the result proved to be negative, which meant the device integrated into the His locus would not be horizontally transferred to other bacteria. At last, he brought up with several biological containment strategies, including the metabolic auxotroph, suicide genes and kill switches. We really appreciate Doctor Li’s instructions on biosafety issues and his thoughtful ideas helped us a lot.

Our team believes that the key to synthetic biology is to use engineering-based models and designs to improve the development of biochemical systems. Therefore, the engineers in our team have worked with the biochemists every step of the way to design initial project ideas, analyse in detail the expected response of the system, and interpret the results of the various types of experiments that we have run.
This means that, unlike some teams in the past, our modelling is interspersed with our biochemistry information to give a feel of the real interactions that have taken place between the specialities in our team. To aid the viewer, all modelling sections have pink header bubbles, all of the biochemistry sections have light blue header bubbles.
We have also worked very closely with the policy and practices team and influential figures in industry to look at exactly how this project could be implemented in the real world. Included in this has been the 3D CAD (computer aided design) of the expected product and the 3D printing and circuit building of the biosensor unit.

Characterising a genetic network
We used stochastic and deterministic genetic circuit modelling to help the wet-lab team in characterising a previously unknown genetic circuit. Find out more here...
Optimising a genetic network
We used these genetic circuit models to predict the fluoresence of the system as a response to thousands of different combinations of inputs. This allowed us to optimise the input levels and advise the biochemists on the construction of the system so that we could develop the best possible system in the amount of time available. See what we found out...
Analysing the native bacterium
We constructed a model based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics that could inform us how much DCM the native bacterium would be able to degrade and also what the pH change of the system would be. This further convinced us to use synthetic biology to solve the problem of chlorinated waste disposal. See how we did it here...
Analysing microcompartments mathematically
We used spacial modelling to determine an estimate of various parameters to do with the microcompartments. We then gave this information to the biochemists to help them analyse their results with expressing microcompartments in E. coli and P. putida.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2015,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#HumanPractices#Education_-_-_TEXT.html," Usually professors, scientists, students are stamped into the frames of what is possible and what is not. Visits in schools were a great opportunity to step out of these frames. There we realised that bacterial senescent may be very important and be applied in various fields. The main applications, which were suggested by students, were related with curing diseases. We took this crazy idea and thought that we really can make something huge. And controlling GMO is pretty big. When the team was taking first steps we didn't know that we are able to solve such a big problem and create something that will help the world. High school visits helped us to realise that.
We brought up topics such as genetically modified products and their use in our society, that is why our team and high school students discussed advantages and disadvantages related with the science of synthetic biology.
We asked them questions as:
Do you know what is synthetic biology?
Do you know what is it used for?
What do you think about genetically modified organisms in general?
What do you think about genetically modified food products?
In what cases, in your opinion, they are good, and in what cases bad?
Have you changed your mind about GMO food products after the talk?
We did a survey regarding students' opinion about GMO before and after our discussion.
Initially many of the students agreed that they would not like to buy genetically altered products, especially food. However, after our talk students felt much more confident about genetically modified organisms – more than 60 % of the people we visited said that they will start considering them more wisely and, if the properties of the food are way better (e.g. tomatoes that do not rot or more nutritious rice), they would consider buying it. On the other hand, not all of the students initially thought that GMO food is so bad, and there were, of course, a part of students that would still say 'no' to any GMO food or product, despite if it is of better quality than natural or not.
It is worth noticing that we did not have any intentions to make students believe that all genetic alterations are good and GMO food is always better. One can agree that this field is still under a lot of investigations and scientific researches. Most of the students also said that the main thing, which keeps them a bit afraid of genetically engineered products is the fact, that this kind of science is relatively new, therefore all the experiments are under construction, which makes using GMOs kind of experimental. This is one of the biggest ethical issues of synthetic biology. However, we did intend to start a conversation about using these products in everyday life. Our discussion with the"

Angela is a sophomore in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. This is her second year in iGEM. She wanted to return to iGEM because she craved the experience of working with a group of fellow undergraduates that shared the same passion for synthetic biology. She also wanted to acquire the valuable experience of managing a team to create something extraordinary in synthetic biology.There are two things that make her happy: seeing transformed colonies on her culture plates, or seeing the ominous red ink traced in a shape of an ""A"" at the top right hand corner of her chemistry exam. Aside from academics, Angela enjoys volunteering around the world. She is able to extend a hand to those less fortunate as well as learn more herself in the process. When she feels depressed, she likes to lock herself in her room with a pint of chocolate ice-cream.

NUS_Singapore-A,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-A#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," hexamers of the consensus promoter in E. coli, creating the blue light repressible promoter PBLrep As a result, EL222 acts as a repressor, blocking the binding of RNA polymerase and repressing gene expression in the presence of blue light. In the dark, monomeric EL222 is unable to attach to its binding site, and RNA polymerase can now bind to drive gene expression (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Mechanism of the EL222 blue light repressible promoter PBLrep.
Biology
Originating from the marine bacterium Erythrobacter litoralis HTCC2594, EL222 is a photosensitive DNA binding protein, with a N-terminal light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA binding domain.
Characterization of New Part
To characterize this promoter, we used a common reporter gene, RFP (red fluorescence protein). However, we quickly found that the expression of RFP cannot be regulated by this promoter, as its expression profile did not follow induction patterns. Therefore, we altered the sequence of the coding region to obtain a degradation rate optimal for this promoter to work. This improve its functionality as users can now a have better knowledge on how to use this promoter. To achieve this, we attached different degradation tags to RFP, and performed characterizations using various blue light on-off patterns. PBLrep can be regarded as a constitutive promoter when blue light is absent, i.e. in the dark, as dimerization of EL222 will not take place.
Methods
All plasmids confer kanamycin resistance, and all constructions and characterizations were done in E. coli TOP10.  Three composite parts were used: PBLrep-RFP (original part), PBLrep-RFP-DAS and PBLrep-RFP-YbaQ. All three were tested simultaneously in each experiment. Engineered cells were inoculated in 5 mL of LB with kanamycin overnight. The next day, 5 uL of cell culture was refreshed in 5 mL of fresh LB with kanamycin until OD600 reaches 0.05, upon which 1 ml of cell culture was transferred to each well of a 12-well plate. Cells were then incubated in 37°C at 120 rpm under different light conditions depending on the experimental setup. Fluorescence of the cells was measured at 1-hour intervals using BioTek Synergy H1 microplate reader.
Cells were characterised in 12-well-plates in this experiment"

Come meet Maia, the sweetest, stylist night creature New Jersey has to offer. Now a junior, majoring in Operation Research, Maia is the only person who can handle two project teams while still function like a real person. She works on the business team on iGEM. If you ever seen our cute quarter zips, you know who ordered them :) Besides iGEM, she is an acapella ethusiast and mac&cheese addict. This girl is ready to take on any challenge and she is on FIRE!!

Meet Swathi: a Chipotle-loving wet lab wizard and CS prodigy. Having a great passion for iGEM, the only thing she doesn’t love about the team is that she can’t bring coffee into the lab space. She likes coffee a lot. Seriously. She brings her French Press with her to statistics class. When Swathi isn’t coding, in the lab, or drinking coffee, she’s exploring the great aisles of Costco or lifeguarding in Helen Newman.  Don’t let her size fool you, she will probably stop you from drowning one day.
Taylor Song
Mechanical Engineering '18
Hailing from South Korea (or was it New Zealand?), Taylor bit the bullet and settled down in rural Ithaca New York to puruse her passions at the intersection of biology and engineering.  She is the only person ever to say in an interview that her spirit animal was a pig, and anchors the team as (currently) Cornell iGEM's only mechanical engineer.  Despite being a queen of CAD, Taylor keeps it real in her spare time, playing tennis, listening to music, and enamouring the gentlemen of Cornell Engineering in lecture halls across campus.

Some say he’s worshipped in certain circles as the Shaker Whisperer, and that he did deal out Righteous Spicy Justice to the unfaithful in his apartment while cooking one night. All we know is he’s called Amith Punyala, our resident miracle maker. Hailing from Atlanta, Georgia, Amith enjoys relaxing with a cool cup of bubble tea after a long day of gracing many of Weill’s halls.

InterLab Data
Collaboration is an important part of the iGEM experience. Some teams may not have access to equipment that other teams may have freely available to them. Through collaboration, teams can accomplish more work together than they could on their own. During the course of our work, we worked with a number of teams, both in and our of the lab.
Boston University WetLab
We worked with Boston University for a lab-based collaboration. The Boston University team perform quantitative analysis on the fluorescence of our wild type and ACG mutant eGFP, both containing a plasmid for RFP to indicate the presence of our guide RNA. The flow cytometry data obtained from this collaboration was necessary to confirm two things: that our GFP reporter worked and that our method of microscopy analysis was valid. In order to confirm that our GFP based promoter and it's mutant ACG GFP protein functioned properly, we needed flow cytometry data on how much our normal GFP and mutant GFP fluoresced when compared to a non-altered eGFP protein. Secondly, we needed flow cytometry to confirm that the measurement method we used to analyze our fluorescing cells (imaging the cells at set exposure lengths) using a program that measured fluorescence values of the image, was a valid method of obtaining data.
Results of our Flow Cytometry collab are shown below.
The flow cytometry data gathered from the BU Wetlab team confirmed the differential expression of the GFP protein between the normal ATG GFP and our ACG GFP mutant. The collaboration also confirmed that our fluorescent microscopy technique for analyzing our cells was also valid, as the flow cytometry data closely matched the data from microscopy.
For our contribution to their lab work, we provided microscopy visualization of the transfections that they had done. We analyzed the fluorescence of several of their reporter proteins to confirm their findings. Specifically, we analyzed cells expressing different combinations of GFP,RFP, and BFP. Each set of cells was analyzed for green, red, and UV level fluorescence and their images were sent back to the Boston University Wetlab team for analysis.
