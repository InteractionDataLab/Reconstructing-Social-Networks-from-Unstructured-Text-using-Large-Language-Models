1.HBUT&BNU
In our collaboration with Beijing Normal University (BNU), we helped induce the expression of mCheery by salicylic acid(SA), measured its fluorescence intensity to determine the optimal concentration induced by SA and the optimal induction time at the optimal concentration. And the BNU-China helped us develop a mathematical model of the Nickel Hunter 2.0.

HBUT: Experiment
Overview
Bioengineering uses stable, highly productive mutants, target strains, which contain foreign genes. However, screening these mutants costs vast time and workforce, and it is difficult to avoid using antibiotics. The  philosophy of BNU-China team is to use salicylic acid to induce glucose dehydrogenase expression to enhance the strain's pentose phosphate pathway, giving the strain a growth advantage. EmrR protein can inhibit the role of the downstream promoter PemrR, so that the gene downstream of PemrR can not be expressed, but salicylic acid (SA) can bind to emrR to eliminate this inhibition. BNU-China team sets the gene of PemrR downstream to gdh, using SA to control this route. After the BNU-China team replaced gdh with mCherry, we helped induce the expression of mCheery by SA, measured its fluorescence intensity to determine the optimal concentration induced by SA and the optimal induction time at the optimal concentration.
Protocol
I. Determination of the optimum concentration of SA for induction
Process:
1. Pick a single colony from the top of the board, expand it with liquid LB containing Amp, and control the time at about 11h.
2. Prepare for SA induction verification:
(1) The whole experiment can be done in 3-5 parallel groups. In the ultra-clean platform, the expanded liquid is divided into several 20ml large centrifuge tubes, each tube is filled with 2ml. Pay attention to the cover of the large centrifuge tube when filling the bacteria solution, wrap it with the sealing film, and tighten the rubber band (because the sealing film can be ventilated, if the cover is covered with oxygen, it will be insufficient).
(2) Adding SA, so that the concentration of SA in the"

Using a temperature gradient and DMSO, all of the fragments were eventually obtained. The BioBrick backbone pSC1B3 was isolated from an existing BioBrick part taken from the distribution plate using PCR and the codes for the BioBrick prefix and suffix as primers. This successfully produced the pSC1B3 plasmid, into which the six different fragments were inserted using Andrew Ng’s CPEC protocol.
The now complete plasmids, backbone plus insert, were transformed into the E. coli strain XL1 Blue and plated on LB plates. The E. coli were cultured overnight, and four cultures from each plate were selected for colony PCR the next morning. The colony PCR indicated some positive results, and the plasmids were extracted from those strains, digested with the enzymes XbaI and SpeI, and confirmed with a gel.
Only two of the BioBricks showed correct bands from the enzyme digest. After all of this was complete, it was discovered that all of our prospective BioBricks including the two successful ones, all contained one or more illegal restriction sites, thus invalidating their submission.

Elan_Vital_Korea,2015,Team:Elan Vital Korea#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," growth inhibition assays performed in broth or by agar disc diffusion. For clinically critical bacteria, diagnostic laboratories perform phenotypic-based analyses using standardized susceptibility testing methods, usually in accordance with the guidelines published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.
Using the culture-based approach, it can take 1—2 days to produce results for fast-growing bacteria such as Escherichia coli or Salmonella, but several weeks for slow-growing bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Moreover, culturing only works for a small fraction of microbes; although most pathogens can be cultured relatively easily thanks to years of accumulated experimental experiences, the vast majority of microbes cannot grow outside their host environment, including pathogens such as Chlamydia or Trypanosomes.
Using newer molecular detection techniques for antibiotic resistance such as quantitative PCR (qPCR) or microarrays, we can determine the presence of specific resistance genes within hours, and obtain improved diagnosis results. However, these culture-independent approaches target well-known and well-studied pathogens or resistance-causing genes only, and cannot be easily used for broader spectrum screening.
The CDC dramatically innovated the detection process by adopting the Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD) technique, which combines the latest pathogen identification technologies with bioinformatics and advanced epidemiology to more effectively understand, prevent and control infectious diseases. Using those technologies, it is possible to rapidly look for a microbe's match among thousands of reference samples in a microbe library. If no match is found, the whole genomic sequence of the microbe's DNA code can be taken, then quickly analyzed using disease detective works and bioinformatics to answer critical disease-response questions. However, this new method, despite being an interesting area of study, is not to be completed until 2020, still requires incubation, and is very expensive.
Our Hypothesis: Possibility of Using Quorum
Sensing for Early Detection
Our team, Elan Vital Korea, addressed the problem of rapidly detecting antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We were interested in a rapid and efficient method of antibiotic resistance detection, and we believed that such a method could be engineered using quorum sensing. Our hypothesis was that we would be able to use quorum sensing – a method bacteria use to communicate with each other – to make the cells quickly report the existence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
By quorum sensing, bacteria can perform many cooperative functions, such as biofilm formation, antibiotic production, motility, swarming, virulence, and much more. While most quorum sensing takes place between bacteria of the same species, there are cases of interspecies quorum sensing. Auto-inducers affect the gene expression of"
Lethbridge,2017,Team:Lethbridge HS#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," developed a different expression construct specifically for use in E. coli BL21(DE3) which takes advantage of the T7 RNA Polymerase expression construct in the DE3 cassette. This will provide tighter epxression control and help to prevent leaky expression of the tyrosinase. Additionally, the double terminator B0015 was added to increase control over the system. In order to maximize production of the tyrosinase and limit unnecessary energy expenditure by the cell, a transcriptional terminator will ensure energy is not wasted on transcribing an overly-long mRNA transcript. The melA expression construct is the improved part that we were able to characterize the most (see Results ).
The crtY-crtZ parts, containing RBSs native to Pantoea ananatis had been previously developed by Chris French of the iGEM07_Edinburgh group  (2007-10-24, parts BBa_I742155 and BBa_I742158 ). These had previously been expressed under constitutive promoters such as J23103 but not under a T7 promoter that can be used in E. coli BL21(DE3). We kept the native RBSs on these genes and incorporated it into a new part under the control of the T7 promoter ( BBa_I712074 ) and the terminator BBa_B0015 . As with the melA expression construct descried above, these new control elements will allow users to specifically control when expression starts through an IPTG induction system, as well as limit leaky expression.

8.26 Mutagen Concentration Test - Eighth Protocol
I) Purpose
To mutate T7 phage for selection of different capsid sizes.
II) Expected Outcome
A decrease in phage viability with increasing mutagen concentration.
A few random mutations that produce smaller and larger phage which can then be isolated.
III) Reagents Used
5-bromodeoxyuridine stock in freezer labeled T7 (10mg/mL)
Uracil solution (2.5mg/mL)
Adenine solution (5mg/mL)
8.24 phage stock
x2 top agar, x8 agar
LB
IV) Procedure
1) Propagation of T7 bacteria phage (8.22-8.25)
Phage concentration of 7.19 T7 stock decreased during its storage in the fridge. Thus, we needed to propagate T7 in preparation for mutagenesis.
Propagation procedure: 4mL of LB and 1mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight were added to 2 separate test tubes. To the test tube labeled +phage, 10uL of 7.19 T7 stock was added. Both test tubes were incubated on shaker at 37 Celsius for approximately 2 full days.
After propagation, phage solution was aliquoted (1mL increments) into eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 3000rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was removed and 100uL of chloroform was added to each.
1:10 dilution series was performed to generate -1 through -7 sample. Spot test followed when we spotted "
Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#test#human practices#elderly mediaction report_-_-_TEXT.html," constraints increase as people age. 5) Dr Rohan A. Elliott highlights the need for the doctors prescribing the medication to be more aware of the complexity of medication regimens. Dr. Elliott comments that elderly people are prescribed multiple drugs per day, having to take medications at different times with a combination of before food, after food and different doses. 6) Dr Paula Rochon adds weight to Elliott’s argument, commenting that optimising drug therapy is an essential part of caring for an older person. 7) Lind Andrist, Patrice Nicholas and Karen Wolf give suggestions on how to ensure drugs are appropriately prescribed for the elderly. They comment that it is appropriate to start most drugs at half the usual dose and prescribe drugs that need to only be taken once daily as a single combination pill instead of several different pills. 8) This reflects the need for medication that is prescribed for elderly patients to be simple 1 pill doses with easy to follow instructions.
In conclusion, the analysis of the literature has demonstrated that elderly people do have difficulties in taking prescription medication. A lot of these difficulties link to pre-exisitng health conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer’s, however it is also important to note the role played by physical constraints in the elderly and the complexity of medication nowadays. When exploring how to integrate this research into our project, it suggests that it will be most effective to deliver the phage therapy as a 1-dose capsule table that can be taken by elderly patients. This will address the difficulties that elderly people face in taking medication by reducing the complexity of prescription medications.

Nonetheless, upon combining two supernatants and incubating for 4 h, a new protein band with ca. 70 kDA shows up (lane 8 and 9). This is the definite proof, that the mini. SpyCatcher and the Spytag are functional and mediate the covalent bonding of the mCherry constructs.
Figure 10: SDS gel with crude and purified supernatants. Expression of the multi copy mCherry constructs was induced with 1% Xylose and the supernatants were harvested after 16 h of incubation. The his-tagged proteins were purified with Ni-NTA agarose beads. Lane 1 was loaded with 3 µl of NEB´s “Color Prestained Protein Standard Broad Range” ladder. Crude (c) and purified (p) supernatant of wild-type (WT) are shown as a control in lane 2 and 3. Lane 4 and 5 contain the supernatant of B. subtilis producing mCherry-mini. SpyCatcher fusion protein (36,6 kDa). Lane 4 and 5 contain the supernatant of B. subtilis producing mCherry-SpyTag fusion protein (31,9 kDa).  The crude supernatants of the two mCherry producing strains were combined, incubated for 4 h, purified and loaded onto lane 8 and 9. The fusion product of the mCherry constructs is visable in the crude and purified supernatant.
Conclusion
Our team succeeded in the production of self conjugating protein complexes using B. subtilis secretion capacity’s. Even though the system could not yet be tested in Peptidosomes, we are very much sure that our vision to facilitate the production process of tuneable protein complexes can be achieved. Peptidosomes as a novel platform for cultivation and B. subtilis powerful secretion are a promising combination that should be studied further.

We found that the interlab study was a good way for us to learn the lab techniques that we used during the development of our own project. However, it seemed challenging to manipulate the bacteria by dilutions as specified in the methods, as our results seemed to vary.
aGEM AND OTHER CONFERENCES
Canmore aGEM
The first place where we publicly presented our project was at the aGEM in Canmore. Our project at that time was focused on desalination. However, after conversing and doing a few calculations with the judges, we soon realized that our system would be incompatible with salt removal. As a result, we decided to change the focus of our project to the capture and removal of metal ions in tailings instead. This pivot turned our potential users from places requiring potable water from seawater, to tailings and wastewater treatment plants. At Canmore, we received the award for “Best Opportunity Analysis”, as well as a prize of $1800.
North American iGEM Kickoff
Our team had the opportunity to go to Calgary for the North American iGEM Kickoff. We were able to present a basic outline of our project, as well as listen to the projects from collegiate teams. This allowed us to expand our knowledge and interest in synthetic biology. At the Kickoff event, we were able to improve our project from the judge’s feedback, as well as gain advice from other iGEM teams in North America who participated in the conference. For instance, we received contact information for different people as this would help us for the future integration of our project. From this helpful information we were able to improve our project over the summer for aGEM in September.
Calgary aGEM
After the North American iGEM Kickoff, our next stop was aGEM in Calgary. At aGEM, we presented our project to a panel of judges, along with other Alberta iGEM teams. At this event, we received valuable insight and gained more experience with answering questions; this helped us improve our system in the final stretch before the Jamboree.  At aGEM, we received the award for “Best Modelling”, as well as $1000 for the work on our project.

Tokyo_Tech,2014,Team:Tokyo Tech#Policy and Practices#Our questions about biosafety_-_-_TEXT.html," asked questions related to safety. All the people with those questions had things in common; they all thought it would be a big business chance if genetically engineered E. coli can be released safely in human and nature.
By listening to our presentation, many audience were impressed with the technology of synthetic biology, and acknowledged it as a research which estimates future prospects. We are planning to present in this workshop again after this year’s Jamboree, so we will be glad if more people from a variety of fields come to attend. In the next presentation, we are planning to introduce the trends in iGEM2014.

5.Visit to Elementary School
Our team members (Paniti, Ayaka, Ryu, and Miyabi) took part in a catered lecture on September 8th at Ohyamaguchi Elementary School. The aim of this visit was to let children know how important DNA and protein are for our human beings, as well as the essence of synthetic biology, which is: combining genes.
Fig. 6-1-13. Group picture with the students
iGEM card game
For this event, we created “iGEM card game” which represents the essence of synthetic biology by combiningcards. This card game has several series of cards. Each series consists of 3 to 5 cards, each card represents the key parts of an iGEM project.
The rule of this game is like poker. When we gather a whole series of cards, we can get points. By gathering them together, the player can understand how the combination of different genetic parts can be used to create living organisms with new and desired function.
Fig. 6-1-14. Our group member playing iGEM cards with the students
For example, one series represented Tokyo_Tech 2013’s project, “Mutant Ninja coli”. The aim of this project was to design a story by using a state switching circuit in E. coli to represent the life of ninja: switching between the state of mimicking civilian and battling with samurai. There are three characters, E. ninja, E. Samurai, and E. civilian in this story. This series consists of three parts: “state switching”,”receiving signal molecule from E. Samurai” and ”attacking E. Samurai with Shuriken”. Each of the cards represents one of the three parts (Fig. 6-1-15).
These cards not only represent the nature of synthetic biology, but also has many illustrations. Therefore, the card game"
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," persists.
This however, doesn't represent the entirety of the problem; bacteria are able to transfer genetic material between one another. This is termed horizontal gene transfer and allows bacterial species to acquifer resistance to multiple antibiotics. This results in the so called superbugs such as MRSA.
As such, over time, the available antibiotics to treat a given bacteria infection begin to decrease. For instance, in the case of the STD chlamydia, only azithromycin is now effective. The pressure therefore is very real and it is highly likely that no current antibiotic will be effective against such a common infection in the near future.The historical tactic to solve resistance is to develop new antibiotics that target the same bacteria in a different way. An example of this is ampicillin. Related to penicillin, it acts to prevent bacteria from producing functional cell walls. It does this by inhibiting a different enzyme : transpeptidase, rather than DD-transpeptidase. This strategy, while in the short term effective, does not solve the inherent problem of resistance, but merely delays it. The problem is costly with an estimated billion pounds a year spent on treating resistant infections by the NHS alone; globally, resistance presents a cost of trillions.
Over recent years, there has been a shift from developing new antibiotic compounds to considering targeted solutions to the most subborn cases of antibiotic resistance. This new focus is made possible by new technologies in synthetic biology. This is an emerging science that utilises genetic engineering and molecular cloning. The purpose is to genetically modify bacteria in order to use them as functional agents. The applications are diverse; modified bacteria could be used to detect cancer cells inside the body or provide targeted drug delivery.
Our project involves using E. coli to target the main causes of UTIs, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa and pathogen ic E. coli, both of which form an antibiotic resistant film inside the urinary tract. Our bacteria sense specific molecules secreted by these bacteria and, upon doing so, release therapeutic agents that disperse the biofilm and subsequently kill the bacteria. Our project represents a more complete method of treating the infection. A biofilm provides resistance to antibiotics due to its composition. As such, the use of biofilm dispersing agents removes the bacteria's defences ensuring the entire population is destroyed. In contrast to conventional antibiotics, this reduces the chance of a few bacteria surviving due to resistance and so removes the risk of repeat infections.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," how troubleshooting works in the wet-lab as well as the responsibility of students in peer-education.
Chris Arumainayagam Interview
As we started developing the MoClo Planner and also our outreach projects, we realized that the theme of creative troubleshooting occurs repeatedly in research laboratories, and that a variety of organizing tools were used by different professors in related fields.  Professor Aruimainayagam from the Wellesley chemistry department suggested to us to look at Quartzy as a potential inspiration for lab organization tools.  In addition, in our interview he spoke extensively on visualizing troubleshooting trees, software that can be used to record citations and track related works, managerial tools his lab uses on different mediums, and also how organization and student-leadership works in his laboratory.  Professor Aruimainayagam reminded that while it is important to design application using cutting-edge technology, there must exist a balance between innovation and user comfort.  If a synthetic biologist is not comfortable with the design product, regardless of how advanced in technology our tools are, it is of no use in increasing understand of synthetic biology research, research efficiency, and advancements in the field.  Thus, we needed to think about current technology prevalent today, and how people’s interactions with tools such as iPads, smartphones, tablets, and other devices could shape what users think should be intuitive in our software designs.
Interview with professor Sequeira
Professor Sequeira from the Wellesley biology department also sat down with us, and gave further suggestions on how to visualize a troubleshooting tree and how graphics can enhance scientific research.  This interview was especially interesting because Professor Sequeira had just finished a long-term biology project taking several years, and was able to speak about trouble-shooting with long-term goals in mind.  While we originally thought troubleshooting in a lab mainly involved supervising day-to-day tasks, Professor Sequeira reminded us to think in larger scopes.  Would the visualization techniques we had in mind work for keeping track of project statuses over the span of not just days, but months, and years?  How can technology help us find results and data we’ve had from the past, say, in puling graphs from a notebook entry recorded several months ago?  Can the projects we build be easily accessed and understood by people who are not domain-experts in computer scientists, namely synthetic biologists?  Those are just several of many interesting questions that were brought up in our interview.

USTC,2015,Team:USTC#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"PR spacers, which is quite similar to RNA interference(RNAi) discovered in eukaryotic organisms. Cas9, which is CRISPR Associated Protein 9 in brief, is an RNA-guding DNA endonuclease enzyme associated with the CRISPR segments derived naturally from Streptococcus pyogenes and other bacteria. It has been shown that Cas9 plays an important role in memorizing, interrogating and ultimately cleaving these foreign DNA. Mechanism of cleavage is to unwind the foreign DNA and check whether there is a about 20 bp fragments which is complementary to guide RNA (gRNA, in brief). When the recognition result turns to yes, Cas9 will cleave the foreign DNA. Nowadays, with proper modification, CRIPSR/Cas9 has become a common gene editing tool, being able to cut the target gene with gRNA design.
When it comes to artificial design of CRISPR/Cas9 system, how to sucessfully achieve recruitment of Cas9 depended on the structure of gRNA. In general, gRNA consists of 2 main parts, the former part is about 20 bp RNA sequences, which is exactly complementary to target genes, and it will be more impressive if these complementary sequence is at the beginning of the transcrption sites of gene. And the latter part is a secondary structure part which finally forms as hairpin used to recruit Cas9. During engineered section, this structual part can directly import from iGEM parts and what we need to take care is the fragment complementary to efflux system gene.

What Material we Implement?-Theoretical Analysis
In order to produce slight deformation on the polymer film, we need to find a proper material to make it. According to our modeling, see more in Modeling-Film Candidate , pressure caused by adhesive bacteria is about 10^-4 Pa. Consequently, the wavelength of laser about 650nm is able to detect um-scale deformation. Plus considering cm squared film, we need the Young's Modulus of the film is less than 1GPa.
Film Candidate, from Wikipedia
The Young's Modulus of polypropylene is about 1.5Gpa, so it is selected as our candidate polymer film.

Tianjin,2018,Team:Tianjin#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," above, inhaling limonene may also have positive influence on our health, with the potentials to prevent cancer and dissolve gallstones. We originally hoped to construct a caffeine-limonenoe cell factory. Unfortunately, the caffeine gene provided in parts showed unclear problems, deterring us from making this idea into reality.
We got the three genes controlling caffeine production (BBa_K801070, BBa_K801071 and BBa_K801072) from the work of Technical University of Munich in 2012 . Unfortunately, the caffeine genes provided in kits showed unclear problems, deterring us from making this idea into reality. By PCR we found it seems not to contain the right sequence. As we can see in the gel photo below, three 1200bp-long sequences are shorter than supposed.
However, we have successfully assembled gene expression cassettes of limonene synthase onto the pRS416 plasmid named pGLA, and transformed pGLA into the S. cerevisiae we have constructed with the KaiABC system to form the limonene cell factory. The newly-built cell factory working with the KaiABC circadian clock systemhas achieved to periodically produce limonene during subjective nights only to help repel mosquitoes. We have constructed a biobrick(BBa_K2637044) encoding limonene sythase expression cassette, which was verifed via SDS-PAGE to tiral its function. You can see the results from here .
Overall, our cell factory proves to be an novel application for Kai ABC circadian clock system and other similar oscillators. We also hope that our work could provide inspirations for both researchers and companies from food, pharmaceutical or other relevant industries. And we would be extremely honored if anyone could transform our design into reality completely in the future.

Purified n-luciferase and c-luciferase are mixed together, after that, we add luciferin B into the system and test the light absorption at 560nm via spectrophotometer. The intensity of background light when monomers do physical collision in solution can be calculated, and we can verify whether active n-luciferase and c-luciferase can be expressed in prokaryotic expression system.
Fusion PCR technology is applied in the further construction of our bio-bricks. The n-luciferase is ligated to N/C terminal of α-tubulin respectively. Similarly, c-luciferase is ligated to N/C terminal of α-tubulin. These four sequences above are the foundation of expressing “α-tubulin-nluc” fusion protein and “α-tubulin-cluc” fusion protein. Moreover, a GGGGSGGGGSGGGS protein linker is also established to the fragment between two target genes(Fig.2.1). Then, we ligate these fragment to pET30a(+) vector, expressing and purifying our target proteins.
Fig.2.1 The fused construction of tubulin monomer and luciferase fragment
At the same time, we use Gateway large-scale cloning technology to construct nluc-β-tubulin and β-tubulin-cluc gene sequences, ligating them to pET30a(+) expression plasmid(as shown in Fig.2.1). Our target genes are inserted between T7 promotor and his-tag. Nluc-β-tubulin and β-tubulin-cluc fusion proteins are expressed and purified with the same method mentioned above. Since α-tubulin and β-tubulin can combine as heterodimer spontaneously in vitro, we mix α-tubulin-cluc or cluc-α-tubulin with nluc-β-tubulin as system1, mix α-tubulin-nluc or nluc-α-tubulin with β-tubulin-cluc as system2, and then add luciferin B to both systems. Microplate reader is used to detect the absorption wavelength at 560 nm. It can be determined whether n-luciferase and c-luciferase maintain the normal function after fusing with tubulin monomer by observing the fluorescence exists or not.
The proteins who are verified successfully are applied to the further research. In order to reduce the nonsense collision between protein molecules and reduce the background fluorescence, we use semi-solid"

- Run gel 90V 40min.
Results
Lane 1 and 2 contain the PCR reaction PAL2. No fragment was amplified, this is most likely due to incorrect purification of the genomic DNA. Lane 3-6, 8-13, 15-20 contain the restriction samples of both pMEL16-Aga2tar and pMEL16-Aro10tar. 2 bands are expected due to Bcl1 cutting the plasmid 3 times with insertion of the target sequence. As only one band is visible no positive hits seem to be present. However, after further inspection it was found out that Bcl1 cannot cut methylated DNA. It was decided that the region of interest would be sequenced to verify.

Discussion
Due to some restrictions in wetlab, we only finished the above-mentioned experiment. We found that the number of Hela cells who possesses high copy number is   comparatively low. We also noticed the circuit C’s output is higher than expected in Figure 1.This may cause wrong judge when use the design to detect miR-21. Some measures will be taken to solve this question. Besides, we are going to endeavor to construct the other networks mentioned in modeling work.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Calibration
Growth Curves
As soon as the GCODe Mini was assembled and calibrated, we put it to work. To find out whether GCODe could actually measure optical densities in a reproducible manner, we tested it in Prof. Dipshikha Chakravortty’s lab under the supervision of Jeswin Joseph, her PhD student.
Our growth curves used Salmonella typhi, with the optical density measured every three hours with GCODe and an ELISA plate-reader.
The dark blue line is the OD measured by GCODe, and the red line is the OD as measured at 600nm with a spectrophotometer. While the absolute values of the OD differ, due to the different wavelengths of the LEDs, normalizing with the ratio of ODs at 12 hours (green line) or 24 hours (cyan) shows near-perfect agreement !

Assembly from Instructions
In order to test whether our written instructions, images and design files were clear and complete enough to actually allow biologists to assemble our device, we invited first year undergrads from our university to test them out. We provided them with parts (since that would have been too much to ask) , and the instructions you see on our wiki. In less than two hours, they successfully assembled the GCODe Mini!

Inspirations and Future Plans
Our project builds on the work of the 2014 Aachen team, but improves on their work in several ways
We added an LED current driver, which is vital to maintaining a steady illumination in countries with fluctuating power supply voltage
Our lab-scale (as opposed to micro-scale device allows the use of large quantities of culture, and via dilution and flushing, can work with organisms like yeast that would otherwise clog the pipes.
….
GCODe can be applied to bacterial systems, yeast and other fungi, and any microbes whose growth can be measured by OD. It can be used to run complete growth curves and produce graphs without any human intervention, and can alert you when your cells reach the stage of growth that you want.
Improvements we want to make
depends on what version/stage we actually finish
add reagents
miniaturize
flask unit
maintain code/ make app

Introduction
Stockholm team is working on cancer diagnosis by engineering of a bacterial sensor which could detect trace amounts of cancer biomarkers.
Stockholm Abstract:
""Synthetic biology offers many potential cost-effective healthcare technologies. One of those could be new ways to diagnose and treat disease at an early stage. Current techniques for biomarker detection (e.g. ELISA, RIA) are time consuming, expensive and require specialised equipment.
We intend to design a microbiological system for the detection of low quantities of biomarkers. This assay aims to be easier and more cost efficient than existing techniques and possible to perform in modestly equipped settings. Initially, we will focus on the expression of a receptor for the desired biomarker. Depending on the nature of the biomarker, the receptor will be either be native or designed.
Upon biomarker detection, signal amplification will be triggered by our receptor system to activate a read out/detection system (e.g. Luciferase, GFP) inside the microorganism to artificially amplify the extracellular signal. In the next stage, the team will go on to design a read-out system to measure the concentration of biomarkers in body samples. Finally we want to investigate if we can make this system transferable to other biomarkers, changing only the receptor part of the system.
The system would be cheap, fast and possible to distribute without advanced equipment. Our motivation is to improve patient prognosis and quality of life and to improve efficiency and reduce costs within the healthcare system.""
Our assistance to the team is to express an GPI-anchored Affibody [biobrick number??+link] on the plasma membrane of human cancer cells, which can then be specifically targeted by a compatible drug or toxin (Fig. 1).

- Bacteria used: Escherichia coli JM109 and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Both organisms were obtained from cultures in Chris French’s lab at the University of Edinburgh. S. oneidensis cultures were grown on LB agar at room temperature not exceeding 30°C. Plates were subcultured each week. E. coli cultures were grown on LB agar in a 37 degree incubator overnight and then left to grow at room temperature and subcultured by lab staff when needed.
- PCR: most PCR reactions were performed using the following OpenWetWare protocol CFrench: KodPCR . Optimal annealing temperature for S. oneidensis genes was found to be around 50-52°C while E. coli genes showed good results with annealing temperatures in the range of 50-55°C. S. oneidensis cell suspension in sterile water was used as template for mtrA, MtrCAB, S. oneidensis ccmA-E and ccmF-H genes.

Specific Safety Concerns
We must be concerned with the safety implications that our project could subsequently have on the natural environment, as we are modifying the genomes of organisms to produce novel functions. We have designed and are implementing a number of biological safety mechanisms to prevent the spread of potentially harmful genetic material to the environment. This includes a recombination system to remove and degrade engineered portions of fungal genomes before using the fungus for packaging production, as well as a killswitch to induce our organism to halt its own growth upon the addition of a very specific chemical cue. We have corresponded with our corporate collaborators to determine the sorts of precautions that may be necessary for commercial deployment and are working to incorporate them.
Laboratory Safety
Our project involves regular use of ethidium bromide, a DNA-intercalating agent known to cause cancer, as well as the use of powerful UV light, for visualization of gel electrophoresis. We must prepare culture media with antibiotics, which could be harmful to humans in large doses. We also work with ethanol lamps to maintain a sterile environment, which do involve having an open flame on the benchtop.
Chassis Organisms
The wet lab subteam regularly works with a non-pathogenic strain of E. coli; as part of our project this year, we are also working with two fungal species, Ganoderma lucidum and Cochliobolus heterostrophus, as well as Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Aspergillus niger, to a limited degree.  These are all Biosafety Level 1 organisms and are therefore safe to work with within our existing lab space; however, these all require special precautions"
Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," cadmium sequestration.
Our Bacillus spores are coated in the metallothionein by making a fusion protein with cotC a major spore coat protein, our metal sponge should locate to the spore making the cadmium bio-unavailable.
Stochastic switch
We developed a tuneable, heritable stochastic switch to stochastically control cell differention and fate. This switch encodes a heads or tails device that can be biased using two inducible promoters and by controlling the rate of degradation of the protein responsible for the switching, Hin recombinase.
In our project we used the switch to make a decision for cells to be a metal container and sequester cadmium, or continue to normal vegetative life. This cell fate decision is given based on a number of stochastic parameters. Hin Recombinase is a protein from Salmonella that is able to invert a segment of DNA between two inverted repeats of DNA (Hix sites). The Hin recombinase CDS is also included in this flipping region. This promoter's activity and direction determines the cells' fate. We carried out stochastic modelling of the system in order to fine tune it to produce a 'biased heads or tails' switch.
The unique part about our stochastic device is that it is controlled in three ways; 2 variable strength promoters (which we tested using inducible promoters Pspac and XylR), and a degradation controller sspB, and so tuning of Hin expression (and thus flipping rate) can be tightly controlled.  We have modelled this degradation control, which we believe is novel within the iGEM competition.
The following diagram shows the device either BEFORE flipping has taken place, or after the stochastic decision has determined it to be in this orientation...
Therefore the germination genes are complemented and we get bacillus cells germinating and carrying out a vegetative life cycle, whilst extra cadmium efflux channels are expressed to ensure cell survival.
The following diagram shows the device afer the stochastic decision has taken place, orienting the flipping region to the right...
Therefore extra KinA is expressed which phosphorylates the master regulator protein Spo0A, activating it and increasing sporulation rate. As well as this, the CotC-Metallothionein (smtA) fusion is expressed, which 'soaks up' cadmium and locates it to the developing spore.
We developed the following bricks associated with the stochastic switch and entered them onto the parts registry:

HUMAN-PLANT
As far as communication is concerned, a bidirectional channel must be established. In our project, we evidence that is possible to deliver stimuli light orders into plants. An optogenetic circuit was designed to establish a reliable communication channel between humans and plants. We can control both plant development and behavior with the aim of helping to achieve a future sustainable agriculture
One of the main challenges in plant platforms is using light to precisely control cellular behavior. Recently, it started to be addressed and ChatterPlant aims to contribute to this knowledge. In order to control in time and space protein expression levels accurately, light irradiation can be used due to its easy manipulation and precision.
Therefore, we resolved designing a light-inducible system based on red/far-red light in order to control the genetic expression on any desired protein (Müller, Naumann, Weber & Zurbriggen, 2015). Therefore, we will be able to regulate plants at genetic level accurately, contributing to the development of a more efficient and sustainable agriculture in our world.
OPTOGENETIC SWITCH
Control of gene expression is carried out using a red/far-red light-switch (Müller et al., 2014), allowing us to activate the genetic circuit with red light (660 nm) and turn it off by subsequent illumination with far-red light (740 nm). The molecular response of this optogenetic switch is based on the interaction between phytochrome-interacting factor 6 (PIF6) and phytochrome B (PhyB).
The photoreceptor (PhyB) was isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana and it can integrate light signals, as well as it participates in the control of floral induction and germination. Despite this, this protein was found to be useful as a tool for Plant Synthetic Biology. As a photosensor"

Uracil is the activator of inducible urg1 promoter, that regulates the expression of marker protein GFP. Addition of this thee chemical leads to inhibition of silencing proteins expression, decompaction of nucleated structure and finally synthesis of the marker protein, in a short interval of time, less than half an hour, due to chemicals and promoter activities ( Bähler et al, 1998 ; Watt et al, 2008 ).
Figure 1. Representation of ON and OFF states in the epigenetic switch.
OFF state: To reach this state it is necessary the drug wash out (doxicycline, thiamine and uracil). For that reason chemical must be removed from the medium by sequential washing in cell culture. After washing out these compounds it will begin the expression of silencing genes and the repression of GFP expression. Synthesized proteins get back to the nucleus and stochastically find tetR operator sites and form a nucleation point. Spreading of SP produce a total repression of reporter module. Due to promoter characteristics, around 10-12 hours are needed to reach this state ( Bähler et al, 1998 ; Watt et al, 2008 ).

Sedation is also often needed to ease the discomforts during the test, which also inevitably leads to side-effects such as numbness and being unable to commute. Likewise, tests of fecal sample have chances of producing false results that can possibly hinder patients’ treatments, even though they are inexpensive and relatively easier to be performed [7].

The Limitations of Treatments for Colorectal Cancer
    Through more improved treatment and more advanced early detection, the group of cancer survivor is growing on a consistent base. Therapeutic advancements are shown to improve the survival rate to a great extent and the current five-year survival rate of colorectal cancer in every stage is approximately 65%, which is ideal with regards that it is one of the world’s most common cancers [9]. This figure, however, shall not keep us blind from the fact that cancer survivors are subject to both long-term and short-term side-effects during and after the treatments, let alone the patients who are still undergoing treatment. These can include: nerve damage, infertility, increased risks of other cancer, cataracts, osteoporosis, lymphedema and so on. Although the extents of aftereffects vary from person to person, their significance in disturbing people’s lives should not be ignored [10].
Therefore, our team is committed to design a new model based on new biomarkers that can diagnose colorectal cancer with specificity, accuracy and ease, which also has the potential to be used in cancer treatment in the future.
 
What is the microRNA?
microRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding single strand small RNA molecules of about 22 nucleotides in length that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and control many critical cellular processes, including cancer[11]. miRNAs’ levels often been reported to be altered in cancer patients and have being discovered in body fluids (serum, plasma and others) [12]. Recently, miR-21 is reported to have high sensitivity and specificity in identifying colorectal cancer. Meanwhile, miR-21 served as a therapeutic target by targeting PTEN, PCDC4, TGFBR2 and CDC25A, all of which involved in proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration in colorectal cancer [13].That has inspired us to use the miR-21 as the new biomarker to be used in diagnosing and treatment colorectal cancer.

Discussion on current ideas 
BMC drug delivery mechanism, using E-coli to release a drug and act as a ‘smart bomb’  
Was   discussed about creating a Bio yoghurt and using BMC to deliver to the   gut however was decided that this may not be a commercially viable   option as it is being done already using bacteria not BMC. 
Instead it was suggested a simple BMC could be created that contains an antimicrobial peptide.  This would be ingested and the BMC would not be   broken down through digestion, protecting the peptide, until it reached   the gut where it would naturally be degraded and the antimicrobial   peptide released. 
Mark Sheppard suggested creating this type of BMC would be one of the more simple ideas.  Using that as a base a more complex approach could be added to the project.   
If we went with the antimicrobial peptide idea we would need to think of the following; 
Which peptide would we want to use? 
Which organism do we want to target 
What’s the selling point/ novelty of the project? 
Another idea suggested was in the area of Biofuels.  Trying to increase higher yields of Biofuels.  The industry is struggling to produce shorter chains and possibly we could create them using e-coli bacteria. 
This suggestion however was dismissed due to the fact there are better adapted organisms than E-coli such as clostridium already carrying out such work making this idea difficult to pitch to the judges. 
Odours and perfumes was an additional idea bought to the table.  
- MIT in 2006 engineered E-coli to produce banana and mint fragrances at different points of its life cycle.   
- It is suggested we could try and improve existing bio bricks to create perfumes and fragrances that did not work in the past .  
- Ways that we could pitch our fragrance idea to the judges could be;  
- new smells/ novel"

Alex: So what kind of parts does it contain now?
Dev: Well the fact that people can now access the registry, and be completely creative with their projects has given the registry a vast array of parts with many different functions. You can affect the motility of a bacteria, use sequences that can use cell-cell signaling and quorum sensing so that cells can talk to each other, and there are many others even including sequences that makes bacteria produce scents such as banana. The best part of the registry is that each contributor can build on the work of others. If you go to http://partsregistry.org you can browse every part for yourself.
Alex: Yeah, and although most parts are made for use within e. coli, the registry is also growing in the types of organismal hosts that parts are made for.  Bacillus subtilis, bacteriophage T7, and even yeast which is a eukaryote have parts made for them within the registry. But Dev this is the synthetic ethics podcast, and I can already see the concerns that are associated with making synthetic biological systems.
Dev: Yep the registry would be an example of what is known as “open source biology”. This is a term coined by one of iGEM’s founders, Drew Endy. This is the idea that biology can be developed using open intellectual property models just like open source software, like the firefox browser, or linux.
Alex: Well I think the benefits of open source biology in this context are very apparent. It supports the belief the idea that biology develops best when ideas, data, and resources are shared openly.
Dev: But I think to many of our listeners, the dangers of making synthetic biology not only easier to access, but also creating a large collection of easily accessed parts is also very apparent.
Alex: Making biology convenient and available to more and more people, and inviting the general public to start coming up with ideas not only maximizes the amount of creativity and cooperation within synthetic biology. There is the risk that people accessing this technology such as hackers, amateurs, and even terrorists could develop malicious systems.
Dev: Yeah our iGEM team went on a visit to DRDC Suffield. Which stands for Defence Research and Development Canada. DRDC Suffield specializes in chemical and biological threats. When we were there we explained the iGEM philosophy of standardization and the cooperation of teams through the registry of parts. In a round table"

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

Other new technologies, such as lithography or photoengraving, were also protected under this new act, further emphasizing how these laws adapted over time to meet new societal and technological changes. [11]
While significant, the industrial and technological advancements responsible for the adaptation of IP law listed above pale in comparison to the changes in law brought about by the development of computers.  Even so, synthetic biology will probably make even more substantial changes to society than computers ever did. For this reason, we will next study how computers and software impacted IP laws, from which we can hopefully make some conclusions on how IP laws will change to reflect new synthetic biology technologies.

Best New Basic Part
The 2016 BostonU iGEM team was a nominee for the Best Basic Part Award.
To create the Gemini parts library, we made use of two “classes” of plasmids: guide RNA expressing vectors and guide RNA operator reporter vectors. When these two plasmids are co-transfected with a dCas9-VPR plasmid into a mammalian cell line, a gene of interest is expressed. Our work for iGEM dealt with fluorescent proteins; specifically, GFP for the parts submitted to the registry.
The guide RNA expressing vector can be considered a basic part. Its design consists of a hU6 promoter upstream of a guide RNA sequence, which has a target recognition sequence and a scaffold sequence for dCas9 binding, followed by a polyT terminator. This basic part, whose data can be found on BBa_K1875012 , was based off of the work by Feng Zhang at MIT and the x330 plasmid. Our part here expresses gRNA 8 (g8) from the Gemini parts library. It represents what we feel is one of best basic parts in our library due to its consistency in experimentation."

This test shows a reversible color change for all 12 chromoproteins at lower temperatures than seen in cell lysate tests and also shows this heat testing can be done multiple times with consistent results. Because of the range of temperatures the chromoproteins lose color at there is the application for a paper base thermometer. The temperature results were slightly different for the 4 chromoproteins we had previously tested most likely because the 4 chromoproteins had been sitting longer on the bench top after purification than the other 8 chromoproteins.

In the interest of moving towards a biologically based paper thermometer, we also did a Gibson Assembly to add a cellulose binding domain to the end of our chromoprotein. This was first done successfully with AE Blue from the iGEM registry. Once this construct was successfully transformed and expressed in bacteria, the protein was extracted and dialyzed. The concentrated protein was then pipetted onto cellulose sheets and underwent a series of heat tests. It was found that, while this protein initially appeared blue (Figure 25), it begins to turn purple at 55 °C (Figure 26) and this purple color becomes more pronounced as temperature is increased (Figure 27). Interestingly, when allowed to cool back to room temperature, the blue color returned (Figure 28).

This sticker was then fixed to a glass container using double sided tape. Hot water was added to the glass container and after 1 minute of exposure to heat, the AE blue-CBD fusion protein turned purple (Video 1). Cold water was then added to the glass container and the AE blue-CBD fusion protein returned to its original blue color"

BBa_K2559005 /BBa_K2559009
The part BBa_K2559006 has a sequence improvement on the basic part submitted by iGEM07_Peking (BBa_l714891) which encodes the SDY_eGFP. However, we found out a 16 bp nucleotides redundancy in the eGFP starting coding region in BBa_I714891, after checking the sequence of BBa_I714891 from NCBI. Therefore, we decided to delete the redundant 16 bp nucleotides in BBa_I714891 to amend the length of eGFP coding sequence. The amended eGFP coding biobrick is the BBa_K2559005.
To test the function of BBa_K2559005, we designed a new E.coli expression vector containing our new part termed as BBa_K2559003under a strong E.coli endogenous promoter (PrplJ). Therefore, the amended eGFP in BBa_K2559005 was driven by PrplJ promoter, and expressed in DH10B. In addition, we also applied the BBa_K2559005 in the promoter intensity analysis of our other two new parts, the BBa_K2559004 and BBa_K2559011 which are relatively weaker E.coli endogenous promoters (PdapA and PcaiF) (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Fluorescent intensity of amended eGFP driven by by PrplJ, PdapA, PcaiF promoter.
We summarized that our improvedpart, the amended eGFP coding biobrick BBa_K2559005 worked well in DH10B. We also hoped that our improvement on the BBa_I714891 can help their future applications by other groups in the future. However, it is difficult for us to perform additional experiments with BBa_K2559005 and BBa_I714891"

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," potential that arises from an amalgamation of pure, scientific inquiry fostered in a socially considerate context.  If we are serious about ethics in synthetic biology and it isn’t just a cheap PR move, then the responsibility rests with us to work towards making such policies integral to the area now, through debate, open collaboration and partnerships with civil society groups, social scientists and all community stakeholders, an understanding and drive to form an appropriate framework of legislation for regulation and economic purposes.  And in that context, there can be a little better forum to shape such initiatives than that of iGEM and the students who may be the first generation of graduates to define themselves as “synthetic biologists”.
Finally, perhaps it may be of use to all parties, research groups, state departments, private enterprise and NGOs to recall the words of Adam Smith, the much quoted thinker held in part responsible for the development of our current economic model, ‘[H]e is certainly not a good citizen who does not wish to promote, by every means in his power, the welfare of the whole society of his fellow-citizens.’(Smith, 1759)  A citizen, so part of a society, must use “every means”, not selective whenever it is felt like, to promote the welfare of the entire society and “fellow-citizens”  equal members one and all, not separate or inferior than those from the company, government or society one is a part of.  Hardly a simple thing to try to do, but ethical action has never really been considered easy, even though it may hopefully become considered normal.

Jiangnan,2018,Team:Jiangnan China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," metabolic process, cellular process in biological process. And pathway analysis shows that deferentially expressed genes are mainly involved in amino acid biosynthesis, metabolic pathways, fatty acid metabolism and carbon metabolism.
    This is a rough direction judgment of the mechanism and helps us to further analyze. In the analysis of the acid resistance mechanism, it may not be more substantial than the information in a large number of documents, but it is still a good reference. When analyzing a new component with fewer references, the two analyses will make a big difference.
    In general, the establishment of our model uses a statistical approach, in which the PCA dimensionality reduction algorithm is the point. The results of the model are basically consistent with the LLNZ-RS02280 obtained from the experimental results, and the accuracy is very high. Therefore, the model can be used to identify the key genes of the target mutant and to explore its possible mechanism. However, there is a small amount of data loss in the process of PCA dimension reduction, so the accuracy is not 100%. The results also need to be verified by experiments with several genes with higher ratios.

3.The recovering effect of CbeA towards CbtA validation
Result:The Abs600 values were measured within TA group and vector group from 0 to 16 hours and the Abs600 curves were drawn (Figure 7.A and B). After adding IPTG, the growth rate of TA group is significantly larger than that without the addition of IPTG. However, in vector group, the growth rate is smaller.
Discussion: After adding L-Arabinose, bacteria in TA group is poisoned. After that, the addition of IPTG accelerate the growth of TA group. So we think that CbeA can release the toxicity of CbtA in some degree. However, the value of Abs600 is smaller than that of normal growth group at last. We think it is because the measuring time is not long enough. Just like previous observation, in vector group, the addition of L-Arabinose first accelerate then slow down the growth rate. Then the growth rate recovers to normal condition. However, the existence of IPTG lower the growth rate.
Figure 7. Detoxication curve. The growth rate with addition L-Arabinose and IPTG in vector (A) or TA group (B). When OD600 value reached 0.15, L-Arabinose was added to induce the expression of CbtA. After the OD600 values remained unchanged for a while, IPTG was added simultaneous to induce the expression of CbeA. The growth curve was drawn at indicated time.
cellular morphology observation
Result:As Figure 8. shows, bacterial shape in control group didn’t have evident change in 1.5,3 and 6 hrs, all in rhabditiform. Arabinose induction group appeared bacilliform in 1.5 hrs. In 3 hrs observation, part of bacterial turned into roundness. In 6 hrs observation, most of bacteria became rounded. The arabinose and IPTG co-induction group appeared bacilliform, in 3 hrs observation, part of bacterial turned into roundness. In 6 hrs observation, most of bacteria were bacilliform.
Discussion:E.coli in control group didn’t express inducted heterologous protein. Thus, they appeared bacilliform. While in arabinose induction group, part of bacteria became rounded in 3 hrs and most of them turned into roundness in 6 hrs. we can consider that toxin CbtA led to the transformation in bacterial morphology.Part of bacteria in"

Release of our spores for application
One aspect of our spores is the idea, that the spores are not able to germinate (details about GerminationSTOP here ). That has the simple technical reason that the fusion proteins would lose their function if the spore were to become a vegetative cell. But also it means that our Sporobeads are no longer viable cells.
We have a lot of ideas what to do with our spores, but how realistic is it?
Is it enough to show it in our lab that the spores are not able to germinate? What are the official requirements?
In order to get a professional statement about the safety aspects of our project and how realistic it would be to release our spores in the environment, we invited the Commissioner for Bio-Safety in Bavaria to speak with us.
In a two hour discussion, we explained the details of our projects and asked the Commissioner all of the ""what ifs"" on our minds. Most of the applications with our spores that we discussed dealt with the filtration or degradation of molecules in water, blood or the human gut.
What regulations, laws or aspects would we need to keep in mind:
during construction of our Sporobeads ... (antibiotic resistances, toxins,...)?
during purification of our Sporobeads?
Which laws apply for which application?
Is our Sporobead a GMO?
Here is our summary of the meeting:
In any type of genetic modification project, there are many safety considerations to keep in mind. We were interested in the legal safety aspect of our project idea. To learn more"
Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#History_-_-_TEXT.html,"5. After considering all the feedback we received from experts in the field of wastewater treatment management, we decided that the point of implementation of Biotic Blue will be right before the biological stage.
Figure 5. Integration of Biotic Blue in the wastewater treatment process. (The top part of the illustration i.e. the main treatment process, is a redesign from Natuvardverket: Wastewater in Sweden 2016 [20].
Since radical changes in WWTP infrastructure are impractical and highly costly, implementation of Biotic Blue was designed to be compatible with the existing equipment and practices. More specifically, its implementation as an additional step before the flow of the sewage to the biological treatment can be materialized by deploying in essence, an extra water tank, a magnet, a collection chamber and a pump. An integrated aeration system would need to be added to the water tank, which will bear the wastewater with the magnetic beads as well, in order to adequately secure mixing conditions. Therefore, with air bubbles spurt from the bottom of the tank, the possibilities for the enzyme-substance reactions to take place increase, and the precipitation of the magnetic beads is avoided. Besides, continuous supply of oxygen to the laccase is essential for its activity, and the aeration system provides it in a constant manner. The magnet that would be used needs to have an elliptical shape and its strength needs to be sufficient to attract and separate the magnetic beads from the water. It is important to highlight that the pipes bearing the wastewater along with the beads after the tank, would be Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) pipes. Unlike steel and iron, materials commonly used for water pipes, PVC (plastic polymer) has low magnetic permeability and, therefore, does not have any magnetic shielding properties. Due to the strong ferromagnetic properties of the beads and the smart structure of the magnet and pipe setting, the beads separation process would be smooth and continuous, as it is illustrated in Figure 5. The collection chamber in which the magnetic beads will end up after their separation from the water needs to have an inlet for the washing buffer used for the recovering of the enzymes before their re-use. Finally, the chamber will be connected with a pump transferring the recovered beads to the initial water tank. It must be highlighted that the proposed closed system is modular and it can function in fully automatic mode.
Below, in Figure 6 our 3D printed prototype is displayed. Note that the prototype does not bear all the features of the implementation of Biotic Blue as it was developed due to time requirements before its design reached the current state.

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Human Practices#HannahArendt_-_-_TEXT.html," and her interpretation of the notion of judgment as it is found within Immanuel Kant's philosophy.
The Public Judgment and Common Sense in relation to Synthetic Biology
The iGEM-team from Heidelberg in 2008, concluded that ""[o]nly a well-informed public is able to develop a non-prejudiced and profound opinion about synthetic biology” (iGEM team Heidelberg, 2008). They argued that it was necessary to inform the public about the uses, potentials and practices of synthetic biology and therewith enable the public to have an informed opinion on the developments in synthetic biology. The students from Heidelberg are not the only ones that feel the need to close to gap between the public and the scientist concerning developments related to genetic manipulation and the synthetization of DNA. In much of the recent literature it is argued that in order to bypass the hostility of the general public towards new developments in genetic engineering, a new approach has to be found which brings the scientist and the citizen closer together (Schmidt et al, 2008) (Sture & Whitby, 2012). This paper will investigate how the public may judge developments in synthetic biology based on a reading of the philosopher Hannah Arendt and her interpretation of the notion of judgment as it is found within Immanuel Kant's philosophy. It appears that Arendt's understanding of judgment is close to the goals of iGEM and that of particular teams aiming to popularize science and make the scientific process more transparent. However, her focus on the need for a common sense of the public as a prerequisite for judgment points to possibly significant problems when spreading knowledge on synthetic biology.
It is commonly agreed that recent developments within synthetic biology are in need of ethical consideration because the potential of this new science is huge and the accessibility of this novel technique is not yet fully regulated and can easily spread. Most reviews on ethical issues in synthetic biology concern themselves with the biosafety and biosecurity, and if you are lucky it also discusses justice related aspects of synthetic biology. Biosafety deals with threats to humans and the ecosystem that might occur in the case of accidents, whereas the biosecurity aspect deals with the danger when an individual, group or government with bad intentions lay their hands on this new technology in order cause harm. Next to the fact an ethical evaluation based on these two aspects seems to be a quite narrow interpretation, namely a risk-analysis, of what an ethical evaluation ought to be, it most often does not discuss, or dismisses, the concerns that the synthesization of a genome has on the public that feels weary about the possibility of creating new life forms.

Making more competent cells
We made the MG1655 Roche and Parent strains competent. The Roche strain has been modified from the parent strain in order to upregulate the pathways that produce the precursors for the orange pigment. We aim to transform both of them with the orange plasmid from Duncan and the orange pigmented biobrick in order to compare the difference in pigment intensity.
We also started the procedure to make strain BW27783 competent.  This strain constitutively expresses arabinose transporters and is perhaps better suited to arabinose induction for the amplification project.

Werfpop
On the 8th of July we organised “Drawing with bacteria” at Werfpop, a free music and art festival in Leiden. We were invited by Science meets Business to                                                   organise a workshop involving some crazy                                                   science. We decided to do some bacterial painting with coloured bacteria. Werfpop visitors used cotton sticks to scrape some bacteria from the petri dishes we brought and drew on a small plate.                                                   Although                                                   nothing was visible while painting, the drawings magically appeared after three days as the bacteria had grown. We were really impressed by all the amazing works of art people made!

Training Workshop  iGEM _CIDEB
iGEM-UANL team conducted a training workshop to enlist the team CIDEB-UANL Mexico to the iGEM competition for its participation in iGEM HSD 2012 . They did great! They came 2nd runner up in the competition and were awarded with best model and honorable mention for best presentation.
The topics that were included in the workshop were about molecular biology related with the nucleic acids function and the proteins involved in the “Central dogma”. About the laboratory, different techniques of molecular biology in the laboratory that are used in the genetic engineering and the synthetic biology, were taught to the students and a Practices Handbook was given to them elaborated by the instructors of the workshop.
Description
Objectives
• To prepare the high school students from the CIDEB that are interested in participate in iGEM in the High School Division (HSD) of mentioned workshop in its version 2012 with introductory topics to molecular biology, engineering, nucleic acids manipulation, biology with data processing and synthetic biology.
• To present to the interested students in an easy, clear and precise panorama about the principal laboratory techniques that are used in synthetic biology in order to make them develop the ability to work in the laboratory.
• To aid the students with the doubts that can be presented during the workshop in order to increase their interest in molecular and synthetic biology.
Activities
During the Training workshop week, some activities took place:
1. During the 5 days of the workshop some theory classes were given to the students with an approximate duration of 3 hours and a half.
2. Before starting work with the laboratory practice, an explanation was given.
3. The participants were divided in groups and there was designed a instructor for each group to help them with some doubts they can have so they were able to perform the practice by themselves.
The TOPICS in the Training Workshop were the following:

However, like with any consumer good it should always be regulated for safety purposes and to avoid any ethical problems. The development background should always be made available to the consumer.""
Do you think that GMOs have the capacity to help the problem of overpopulation?
""Yes. I think they do. I think the public opinion of GMOs needs to be radically re-educated. I think a lot of people don't understand that it is completely natural occurrences as in DNA is involved in everything we eat. Everything we eat is organic, carbon based, and biologically occurring. Synthetic biology is the manipulation of living things which is what agriculture essentially is just over a much longer time period, and people still view it with a negative stigma.""
Beaverton, OR | Community garden
""My opinion of synthetic biology is that it will have a positive impact on the world. I think it will help solve some of the big environmental problems we face such as pollution and depletion of some of our natural resources. I also believe it will be very important in developing new treatments for disease. I think there is lack of public support in this area of research because many people do not know much about it.""
Do you have any concerns regarding genetically modified food?
""My concerns with genetically modified foods are that we start producing them for profit only and don’t carefully weigh the potential hazards. I am confident that the genetically modified foods we buy today are safe and have been properly regulated by our government, but I worry that as more and more are developed some governments may not properly regulate them.""
Ithaca, NY
What do you think about GMOs?
""I think that it depends on the situation. I think synthetic biology is definitely something that we can't really turn back from anymore because we are always trying to progress as humans, but I think in a lot of cases we should be really cautious and not use it necessarily just because it's there. When I'm talking about food, a lot of times GMOs aren't really unsafe food, but it's still the idea that we are constantly trying to be better and progress and I think as with anything else, sometimes we should stop.
For example they made crops that are herbicide resistant so that they could spray more herbicides onto the crops so that they could grow more, and they really didn't need to grow more of those crops but they would save money if they did, so they did that and now they are spraying more chemicals. So the GMO resistance isn't really bad for us, but it encourages us to do more industrialized farming that isn't really necessary.""
So where"
KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Human Practices#HannahArendt_-_-_TEXT.html," take other perspectives into account. Arendt writes that a judgment is only possible if we are a member of a community. There is no reason for me to judge developments in synthetic biology if there is no one that listens or that has a different opinion.
The notion of common sense is interesting because, at first sight, it seems to have an enormous democratic potential. Instead of having only experts judging the work of synthetic biologists it opens the door to a wider public that can judge these developments (given that they are informed). However, this is also where some difficulties come in which problematizes the public's ability to judge developments within synthetic biology ethically. Our judgments are rooted in common sense, that is, according to Arendt, the way of thinking that takes other judgments into account and can therefore easily be communicated (Arendt, 71). This implies that one shares the standards by which one judges a certain event, which was according to Kant the idea of progress. Interestingly, for Kant, this progress was not human driven but was the progress of nature. Yet, when we enlarge our mind with the concepts of synthetic biology it is clear that it becomes very difficult to talk about such a thing as nature. After all, are we not creating the life forms that one would formerly categorize as nature?
Of course Kant was living 200 years ago and could not have envisioned the enormous “progress” science would make and which would enable humans to create life forms from scratch. The Kantian notion of progress might still be shared among many people and be a part of our common sense, but it can no longer be applied to synthetic biology because the concepts and developments within this field are in conflict with a notion of progress that is inherent in “nature”. Moreover, it seems that other ideas that are part of our common sense, namely our understanding of what it means to be a human being, how nature is opposed to culture and how machines differ from animals are in conflict with what is happening in the field of synthetic biology. Hence, it becomes questionable as to whether one can easily enlarge one's mind with the concepts used in synthetic biology if they are in conflict with the notions, ideas and oppositions that are present in common sense and which enable people to communicate with each other. When someone says that it is inhumane to treat another human being like that, one does not need to discuss the idea of a human being in order to understand what the other means. Instead, we understand it because the idea of a human being is part of our common sense.
Hence, at first sight, the notion of judgment as provided by"

This year, we have improved 2 previous projects. The one is the project of WHU-China 2014, and another one is the project of XMU-China 2016. And we have improved 5 BioBricks, BBa_K1334005 , BBa_K1334015 , BBa_K1334016 , BBa_K1334017 and BBa_K1960103 .

In the project of WHU-China 2014, they made attempt to deal with formaldehyde pollution, but they ended with a failure. This year we conducted a new system on the basis of WHU-China's effort, redesigned and improved their project with our methods.
I. Improvement of the Street Cleaner System
In the project of WHU-China in iGEM 2014, they tried to absorb formaldehyde using The Street Cleaner System, which contains formate dehydrogenase (BBa_K1334016) and formaldehyde dehydrogenase ( BBa_K1334017 ), but these two genes did not express.
Figure 1. The Street Cleaner System designed by WHU-China 2014
This year, we redesigned the Street Cleaner System by replacing the PADH and FADH with another coding sequence, which codes formaldehyde dismutase, BBa_K2310900 . This enzyme enjoys high catalysis activity of translating formaldehyde into carbon dioxide and methanol. Although XMU-China 2016 also designed another BioBrick, BBa_K1960103 , which also codes formaldehyde dismutase, there are still some problems with that part. The sequence of BBa_K1960103 is from Halomonas sp.JC-5B, a formaldehyde tolerance bacteria in Pacific Ocean, and this kind of bacteria is different from E.coli, so the efficiency"
UiOslo_Norway,2015,Team:UiOslo Norway#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"ose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps) and 6-phospho-3-hexuloseisomerase (Phi) are the two enzymes involved in the fixation phase. Hps and Phi are found in most methylotrophes, but different methylotrophes have different genes involved in the cleavage and rearrangement phase. Nerveless the different variance found within the other two phases of the RuMP cycle can all be expressed in E.coli too. Reason for this is that the variants are needed for processes are already present in E.coli such as glycolysis, Entner-Doudoroff pathway or pentose pathway. What this means is that only two additional genes, Hps and Phi, have to be added to E.coli in order for RuMP cycle to perform its function. The other pathway to consider is the serine pathway. Serine pathway differ form the RuMP pathway in many aspects. One aspect is that serine does not utilize formaldehyde directly, but it is added into the cycle in order to form serine. All enzymes needed for the serine cycle, except three are present in E. coli. However, there is no known activation enzyme or sufficient flux for the process of condensation of formaldehyde2. Compared to the serine cycle the RuMP cycle only needs two additional genes added to E.coli compared to the serine cycle that needs three. An additional factor is that the serine cycle needs multiple CO2 reduction reactions, where RuMP pathway only needs one, making the RuMP cycle energetically more favorable.
Summary:
Our team wants to engineer E. coli in order for it to break down methanol to biomass by cloning and expressing the genes methanol dehydrogenase (Medh2), Hexolose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps), and 6-phospho-3-hexuloseisomerase (Phi)
Medh2 is NAD+ dependent and oxidizes methanol to formaldehyde
Hps and Phi are both part of the fixation phase of the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway and convert formaldehyde to hexolose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate respectively .

Using an inducible hybrid light-sensitive promoter for heterologous regulation of the nif cluster
Benjamin Huang, Jeffrey Lee
Introduction
Traditionally, gene expression has been induced through chemical means. However, this method requires expensive chemicals, and can have deleterious side effects on cell health. In Tabor et. al (2010), it was shown that it is possible to induce expression of a reporter gene with light in E. coli using light sensitive proteins (CcaR/CcaS) from the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis S. 6803. Light induction has several advantages over chemical induction, including: long term cost of chemical inducers, ability to tune expression levels with different light intensities, and most importantly, can be turned on and off easily. The ability to control genes of interest has important applications in engineering nitrogen fixation. The end goal of our project is for plants to fix nitrogen on their own within their chloroplasts--the true powerhouse of plant cells, where the most ATP is present to overcome the high costs associated with breaking nitrogen’s triple bond.
Objectives
Synechtocystis PCC6803 (hereafter S. 6803) is a strain of cyanobacteria that is of particular interest to us. S. 6803 is important because it is the first cyanobacteria to have its complete genome sequenced; and it is easily manipulated via homologous recombination. S. 6803 has highly characterized photosynthetic genes that are light regulated, which would be useful if we want plants to eventually fix nitrogen. Based on the Endosymbiotic theory, chloroplasts and mitochondria are thought to have been cyanobacteria that were engulfed by cells. Thus, S. 6803 is an important platform from which further manipulation of the nitrogen fixation can occur.
Recently it has been shown that one can induce via green light, the expression of a phycobilisome-related gene [2]. Instead of regulating gene expression via proteins, having to worry about different concentration levels, potential cross effects, etc., regulation via light can be easily tested for and"

PSB1C3-TlpB CLONING
First of all we planned to cloning our gene that we ordered from IDT as a G-blocks to the PSB1C3 plasmid for multiply our genes and also for submitting to the iGEM as a biobrick in PSB1C3, for this purpose we cut both our PSB1C3 vector and G-Block of TIpB with EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Then we inserted these G-Blocks to the plasmid with used T4 DNA ligase enzyme and we transformed our plasmid to the BL21 competent bacteria.
For verifying our cloning process we did colony PCR with Verify Forward and Verify Reverse primers. If we got the cloning results wrongly we should see 314 bp band but if we achieved the cloning we should see  band.
After Colony PCR, for the clonings that we thought positive we put our bacteria to the 16 hours liquid culture and we isolated plasmid DNA with miniprep isolation method. We cutchecked our plasmid DNAs that we got from our isolation for controlling of cloning second time with using EcoRI restriction enzyme.
pET45-TlpB CLONING
After we cloned our genes to PSB1C3 plasmid successfully then we planned to cloning our genes to an expression vector pET45-b for high amount of protein synthesizing. For cloning our gene to this vector, we extracted our genes from PSB1C3-TIpB plasmid with using BamHI and XhoI enzymes. We performed ligation with pET45-b vector which is cutted with the same enzymes, then we transformed our plasmid to the BL21 competent bacteria which has a T7 RNA polymerase.
For verifying our cloning process we did colony PCR with T7 Promoter Forward and T7 Terminator Reverse primers. If we got the cloning results wrongly we should see 360 bp band but if we achieved the cloning we should see 2007 band.

What’s more, bioluminescent detection through lux gene is easy to achieve, and it is fast, simple and sensitive.  Hence the bioluminescent detection method has extensive research and application in gene transduction, expression and regulation, environmental chemistry and its toxicity detection,etc.

Metals can pose a particular problem to bacteria,because essential metals may be limiting in the environment, requiring active uptake mechanisms to import minimum concentrations of essential metals (Butler 1998; Outten et al. 2000).Bacteria can encounter purely toxic metals, such as Hg, Cd and As, which have no beneficial role in cellular metabolism, and must be avoided, removed or neutralized metal. The key first step in how bacteria respond to varying levels of both toxic and essential metals in the internal environment of the cell is due to the metal sensor and regulator proteins that they encode. There are several known types of prokaryotic metal ion sensing regulators. These include the MerR and Fur families of regulators, the ArsR/SmtB family repressors and several other structural regulator types .
MerR – a mercury sensing gene activator
A key class of prokaryotic metal ion responsive activators is the MerR family, of which the mercuric ion sensing MerR is the archetype. The closely-related 144 amino-acid MerR proteins from the mercuric ion resistance (mer) operons from transposons Tn501 and Tn21 have been the most heavily studied of these proteins (reviewed in Summers 1992, 1986; Hobman & Brown 1997;Outten et al. 2000a; Barkay et al. 2003; Brown et al.2003, and references therein), and the mechanism of Hg(II) resistance is now well known (reviewed most recently by Barkay et al.

High School Visit
August 26 and September 22, 2014
Our team members visited middle and high schools some of us graduated in Osaka and Shiga prefectures and gave the students lectures about iGEM and what our team is doing. We designed the lecture so that younger students can fully engaged in and understand, in a sit back and relaxed atmosphere. Before the lecture, the students said genetic engineering is something unknown worrisome. So we specifically talked about what it is and how safe it can be, without using too many terminologies.

La sûreté pour la Biologie Synthétique
Avant Propos
La biologie synthétique est une nouvelle approche de la biologie qui vise à synthétiser et à designer de nouveaux composants et systèmes biologiques ou à redésigner des éléments biologiques préexistants dans le but de créer des systèmes réalisant une fonction précise.
La biologie synthétique a connu un développement très rapide : elle a permis l’essor de nouveaux marchés et la réorganisation de différents acteurs des secteurs de la biotechnologie, de l’énergie, de la pharmacie, de l’agroalimentaire et de la pétrochimie. A l’heure actuelle, les activités de ces entreprises sont séparées en deux groupes distincts : celui des Gene Foundries qui synthétisent des gènes et des systèmes plus complexes à la demande, et celui regroupant les entreprises développant des microorganismes capables de produire des biocarburants, des médicaments ou des produits chimiques.
Ces nombreuses applications mettent en évidence l’intérêt de la biologie synthétique pour l’industrie et les nombreux bénéfices qu’elle pourra apporter à la société dans le futur.
Cependant, ces avancées ne doivent pas se faire au détriment de la sûreté et de la sécurité pour la société. Il convient donc d’étudier de manière approfondie la balance bénéfices/risques avant de développer une nouvelle utilisation de la biologie synthétique. La prise en compte de tous ces éléments est nécessaire afin d’établir des solutions et des protocoles performants pour rassurer la société et assurer ainsi le développement durable de cette nouvelle approche de la biologie.

When our teammates doing experiment during our Igem project or our school works, we found that the operation of many undergraduate students, even few overgraduate students is not meeting the requirement of Biosafety, such as, speaking before the bench, eating or drinking in microbiology lab and so on. Besides, in our daily life, people not in biology major always seem biology research as a mysterious, strange and frightening major. They don’t make any sense of biosafety level. Besides, on the CCIC conference we attended, professor Haoqian Zhang and xxx and xxx also emphasized the importance of Biosafety.
Therefore, we had the idea of spread the knowledge of biosafety and biosafety level among people.
We did a survey to investigate whether this phenomenon around us is prevalent. As we predicted, regardless those ordinary people or undergraduate students in biology major are not familiar with the word ‘biosafety’.
Here is our survey results:
Firstly, we investigate the education level of our survey subject. As the picture shows our questionnaire is mainly for college students, and there are also some doctoral student involved into our survey.
Then we investigated the way our subject acquire biological information in their daily life. As the picture shows that people prefer to get information from book, Internet and cell phone.
Next, we asked their impression to biological genetic research. As the results show that the public are more likely seem this as a creative and mysterious thing. Besides, most of them agree that biological research need to specify the protocol to guarantee the safety.
Then we investigated the population of biosafety and biosafety level among the public. As following results show that the public doesn’t know biosafety knowledge well but they do have a will to acquaint with it.
Finally, we want to know the actual understanding of the survey subject for biosafety level. We gave several creatures and required survey subject match biosafety level with these creatures. These creatures are Cobra, mouse, cat, black widow, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As the results shows, the public confused by this question. We agree that the public don’t have a clear definition of biosafety level in their mind.
Coming to a conclusion, we investigated the issue of biosafety by questionnaires. We asked the public their views about biology, their understanding of biosafety and how much attention they paid"

Best Human Practice Advance
This has been the first presence of Trieste in iGEM and this meant quite a hard venture in building up a team, finding money, finding a hosting lab, designing and developing our project.
We students have made it all, obviously with the support of the University of Trieste but mostly with our passion and determination.Here in Trieste, for its history and location, we found an ideal place in which young students like us could undertake this innovative approach to research that iGEM represents.
We invested a great amount of energy on human practices because we aimed at creating the right environment to make iGEM a core activity among the first steps of the future researchers.
We decided to talk about iGEM and about our experiences as iGEM team through different channels and in different ways referring to a wide range of audience.

IGEM more than a competition is a life experience; it involves you at all, sometimes it is hard sometimes funny but above all it is by far the best experience which a student could done during his undergraduate studies. The UNITS_TRIESTE Team is an “Handmade” team, no advisors working in synthetic biology field, no company linked to synthetic biology business only 6 students and their mighty wish to take their place in a worldwide acknowledged competition as IGEM is.
Synbiome is made of  ""undergraduate"" thoughts  and it has been realized by ""undergraduate"" hands.
As any researchers know three months are nothing, only 90 days tu build up a new, innovative and competitive project to face the world of synthetic biology.
We decided to do it as it must be do, no shortcuts: 6 month of preliminary work making reality the wish to partecipate at igem, learning about  everything as biobricks, sponsors, registry, registration,  human practice, tracks, jamboree, team and whatever else but mostly we thought about the project, tons of rough ideas falling down as bricks (Not yet so “Bio”J), looking for the best way to handle our first partecipation.

Genspace,2015,Team:Genspace#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," might prove useful for detoxification of pollutants. This required a bit more thought and strategizing since Genspace is a BSL1 facility and we cannot amplify samples of uncharacterized microbes from the environment.  In addition, the canal water has environmental toxins in it and so it was desirable to avoid direct contact with the water.
After extraction of DNA from the samples, the purified DNA did not pose a risk. However, it was originally our intention to preserve this genome diversity by cloning it into a cosmid library in E. coli K12, then doing functional screening.  After thinking about it, we realized that if the pathways contained promoters and ribosome binding sites that our strain of E. coli recognized, there might be production of products from the library during the process of creating the library and growing up individual clones for testing. Amplifying a single clone might result in production not only of beneficial functions and molecules, but also potentially harmful ones. , we realized that we might inadvertently clone some pathways producing toxins into the K12, since we had no control over which DNA ended up in the cosmid library. This presented a risk that we might multiply a toxin-containing organism during library generation.
How did we address the safety concerns in the Microbiome Mining part of our project?
Previously, Genspace had launched a citizen science project called Enquete Gowanus where we collected samples from the canal bottom sludge, extracted DNA from them using a MoBio soil kit, and sent the DNA for sequencing analysis. We followed this protocol for sample handling, which was reviewed and accepted by our Advisory Board:
Gloves, rubber boots and full body Tyvek suits were worn. Two sets of samples were collected, one set in glass Ball jars and one set in polyprop 50ml tubes for microbiome sequencing analysis. The collected samples were sealed into biohazard bags and transported to Genspace. Data from our previous Canal collection shows no exotic pathogens in the Canal samples (unlike the subways!), but typical sewage bacteria such as E. coli and pseudomonas. There were also some intriguing results that pointed to organisms capable of metabolizing carbon compounds found in coal tar oil, one of the pollutants that was dumped into the canal for many years.
In order to mine the microbiome, there were several strategies considered. We consulted a member of Genspace’s Advisory Board, Dr. Claudia Mickelson of MIT.  Direct growth and testing of the sludge microbes was not permissible in a BSL1 environment. So on Dr. Mickelson’s advice we decided not to do direct functional testing on samples but to extract"

To what extends have this experience changed the way you conceive your future job?
I really loved to work in a team, and carry out a project from the very beginning to the end. I wanted to be a R&D engineer and the iGEM experience convinced me on this way. Also, meeting start-up creators convinced me to work in a small business.
What comes to your mind when you are told about biotechnologies?
For me, it regroups all kind of sciences that uses biology as a tool to create innovation. It encompasses all bioprocess, biosynthetic and many more fields … Unfortunately, biosynthetic approaches have a bad reputation and scarred people, especially when you explain you are working with GMOs. Because of the lack of knowledge on this science, when you talk about cloning, many people think you will clone blue rabbit or something crazy like this. There is a lot of work to do to inform people on what really is the biosynthetic science.
Angeline Pelus
Why did you take part in iGEM?
The iGEM competition is at the same time a scientific experience and a human experience. It permits to apply our knowledges and also to learn intensely new methods. It is also a good way to discover others skills apart from Sciences.
What was your responsability during this project?
One of the most part was to manage finances (search of financing, place orders, negotiate prices), but also to do laboratory work.
What did you learn from this experience?
The iGEM was one of the most complicated experience of my life. In fact, the scientific side was very interesting and enriching. But I had more difficulties with working in group because we are all different. This obstacle permitted me to know more about myself and to take on me to resolve conflicts.
To what extends have this experience changed the way you conceive your future job?
Before iGEM, I knew that project management interested me. And this experience confirmed it and I am going to do another year of studies to specialize in this way. Even if Sciences still interest me, I do not think I will pursue in scientific research.
What comes to your mind when you are told about biotechnologies?
Biotechnologies nowadays are widespread and the fields of application keep on expanding and are varius. Unfortunately, people know little about it and what is going on in the scientific area, which is regrettable and a problem because that makes them more unwilling to new technologies.

Today (Saturday), Bing, Nade, Richard, and I came into the DOP Center. With the exception of Richard, everyone was here to close as many bugs as possible before the next beta build on Monday. Richard was here to work on the plug-in tutorial and materials.
In general it was a pretty successful day. We closed all the ""easy"" bugs and got to most of the critical other ones. In general I think it is a pretty solid version for the wet lab to start with. The major missing piece right now is a way for someone to delete entries in the database. This is an issue since you need to decide what to do with all parts that refer to the newly deleted item. Should you fill those pointers to ""null""? If so, we need to make sure none of the tools will ""break"" if they read a null value (this should be done anyway). Another option is for a more elaborate delete. For example if I delete a biobrick, perhaps I should delete all samples which refer to it as well?
Anyway, those issues will be taken care of next time:)
Here is the list of bugs we found on Thursday. It is now broken down into those that are ""fixed"" and those that are ""open"". While the open list looks large, really most of these are not bugs bug just comments from the group. I kept these around so we would have a record of them.
