Virginia,2012,Team:Virginia#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the ceiling to environmental stimuli influencing dream incubation have strong  effects on innovative output (e.g. Kraft, 2005; Anthes, 2009). Biomedical and biological sciences  may be particularly susceptible to the so-called “tragedy of the anticommons:” excessive  fragmentation of knowledge too far upstream by intellectual property enclosure strongly inhibits  follow-on research (Heller and Eisenberg, 1998). An especially strong ethos of open innovation  exists within a large segment of the synthetic biology research community in part due to a  justified fear of the effects of excessive patenting in the field (Torrance, 2010).
The application of synthetic biology to biomedicine in particular deserves special  attention, as it represents an extremely active field of synthetic biology research, many  theoretical successes, and astounding promise for the near future (Weber & Fussenegger, 2012).
Although often heralded as the single resounding success of patent policy,  pharmaceutical research more broadly is dramatically skewed toward low-importance, high-  profit drugs at excessive consumer cost (Love & Hubbard, 2007). Overall, roughly $50 billion  per year in private medical R&D spending is incentivized by the social cost of $400-480 billion  per year in additional royalty costs due to patent monopoly pricing (Love & Hubbard, 2007)  . Status quo legal configurations can be expected to produce similar outcomes in medical  applications of synthetic biology.
Alternatives
Alternative policy futures for intellectual property in synthetic biology are diverse and  unpredictable, but include the status quo, abolishing gene patents, and the formulation of a sui  generis legal framework for synthetic biology innovation. Criteria for evaluation include  political feasibility, effectiveness of increasing innovation rate, alignment between incentives  and social utility, and distributive justice measured in terms of consumer cost and fairness in  distribution.
Status Quo
The existing policy configuration remains the subject of intense criticism from a variety  of perspectives. Gene patents are opposed on principle by a variety of groups that view them as  commodifying life (Andrews & Paradise, 2005), scientists and researchers believe that the  current patent landscape harms openness of research (“Who owns science?” 2009), and the  courts have recently challenged prevailing notions of gene-patentability . Since these and other  principled concerns are highly unlikely to dissipate in the foreseeable future, we can anticipate a  continuing degree of legal uncertainty about the largely court-defined patentability of synthetic  biology gene products. As explained above, the status quo will likely inhibit research, skew"

Although we do expect some public concern about our goal of increasing the radioactive resistance of E. coli, we do not anticipate any safety issues with our work. We have no intention of releasing any bacteria into the human body or the environment at any point in the iGEM competition. While some of our speculative future applications would require exposing bacteria conferred with radioactive resistance into the environment, such as for the bioremediation of toxic waste sites, this is of no concern regarding public safety. As stated above, neither our plasmids or insert genes associated with radioresistant pathways will affect the virulence, infectivity or host range. Even if it did ""escape"" from our lab, the bacteria is effectively harmless. From inception, our team has considered and discussed the possible ramifications of creating bacteria resistant to large doses of radiation. We recognize that the additional resilience of this trait is a potential hazard if transferred to a virulent species. Careful consideration and caution would be necessary before implementing any public application.
2. Do any of the Biobricks or devices we've made raised safety issues.
Our Biobricks to boost the radioresistivity of DH5-alpha E. coli will not affect their virulence, infectivity or host range. For most scenarios, and as long as it only involves non-pathogenic bacteria, increasing the resilience of E. coli when it comes to radiation resistance has no harmful implications. One real issue that we have considered is food irradiation. The process of exposing food to ionizing radiation to kill bacteria is occasionally used by countries around the world. If a pathogenic bacteria were to somehow pick up the ability to resist high doses of radiation exposure, it could no longer be destroyed through means of irradiation. We took the utmost precautions in the laboratory when designing our Biobricks to ensure safety.  More importantly, our Biobricks have the potential to solve tremendous environmental issues posed to us today. In the United States alone, the Department of Energy states that there are ""millions of gallons of radioactive waste"" as well as ""thousands of tons of spent nuclear fuel"" and also ""huge quantities of contaminated soil and water"". E. coli hold the potential for breaking down many of the toxic waste to harmless derivates. Engineering E. coli that can function within the radioactive waste would allow for their clean up.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at our institution?

Grow Together with iGEM in My Freshman Year By Yaran, Zhizheng, Bihong
1. The Accident Beginning
In October 2013, I just graduated from the high school and started to get familiar with the college life while enjoy the warm autumn in Guangzhou. One day, I saw the iGEM conference banner accidently and at that time SCUT team hoped to recruit new member who was passionate with biology. And I started to know iGEM held by MIT is an international competition on the basis of synthetic biology and attracted more than 200 universities all around the world.
2. The Decisive Participation
From my perspective, as a student who majors in biology, I should devote my passion to science and I applied for it immediately and prepared for the interview. During the interview, all the candidates tried to show their ability to make the team. Luckily, I was selected into the lab group. Obviously, and the lab group is the best option for me as I’m a biology student. Hence, the most significant adventure of my school life started.
3. The Hard Training
Owing to enhance the multiple capacities of the new members, and have a deep-going understanding of iGEM competition, the team leader adopted the way which 3 people in a group, one week limitation to present the classic project of iGEM. It’s an unforgettable experience, first problem is English paper, due to lack of vocabulary I had to spend more time on the dictionary. Second, because my limitation of profound knowledge in biology, I had a really difficult time. During this time , some of the members thought it is an impossible mission and gave up moving on. But, with the love of biology, I persisted in my dream, and after one month training, I had a better understanding of iGEM.
4. The Start of iGEM Life
In the Spring Festival, every member returned to school very early, and started to design the project. From then on, iGEM life began. About one week later, the team was divided into three groups including environment, energy and medicine. And we started to read all kinds of project related to this and searched the Internet for useful information. Everyone devoted themselves to the team, and one month later, we started to have a concept of our project.
At that time, some fellows can’t overcome the intensive life, and the team"

Lots of examples show that human over-exploitation of the natural world, as a significant amount of debt owed to nature, will always suffer because they cannot repay the revenge of nature in the whole human history. Industrial society will do more damage to the environment with a larger scale and higher speed consuming natural resources than agricultural community.
According to the book named ""Limits to Growth"" written by DH Meadows, coal, oil, metals and other non-renewable resources will exhauste 2100 ago. Even though this estimate has some exaggerated factors, we could not pass up these resources for centuries in any case. In another side, renewable resource, such as fertile land, forests, flora and fauna, air and water, has suffered a permanent damage result from the development of industrial world. The global wildlife has been facing a major crisis.
Perspective on the current level of industrial development: In the past 10 years, papers from biotechnology and medicine are 49% of the natural sciences all over world; recently, about 40% to 50% of annual Top Ten scientific and technological achievements are in life scientific fields at home and abroad. biotechnology industry based on biotechnology and life sciences makes more progress, and has introduced new products and new patents. Biotechnology industry has become an international technological competition as well as the focus of economic competition, and it will also become a powerful weapon to help humans live in harmony with nature.
June 1972, ""The First Human Environment Conference"" was held in Stockholm, Sweden sponsored by the United Nations. It make progress for international environmental. ""Declaration on the Human Environment"" than was passed in this meeting is the first global international documents in"

They show a similar behaviour in pertaining to the groth curve. PliaG has an activity maximum of about 100.000 Lumi/OD600 during the pass from logarithmic to the stationary phase. PlepA shows an maximum of about 400.000 Lumi/OD600. Comparing these two constitutive promoters the activity of PlepA is about four times higher than the activity of PliaG. In the late stationary phase the activity completely disappears.
Fig. 4: β galactosidase assay and growth curve PliaG (black) and Pveg (grey) in the reporter vector pSBBs1C-lacZ. β galactosidase activity (Miller Units)and growth curve are the average of two independant clones. Experiment shows representative data which was obtained in the same way from three independent experiments.
The β galactosidase assay of the constitutive Bacillus promoters Pveg and PliaG was repeated three times. Data show one representative result. Two undependant clones of B. subtilis with the same construct were measured and their mean with standard deviation is show in the graph. In the beginning of the growth curve both promoters show a small activity. But then it raises to a maximum before it decreases to the begininng level after about seven hours (Data not shown). Summing up the course of activity of both promoters Pveg and PliaG is very similar based on the growth curve. The highest beta galactosidase activity and therefore the highest activity of the promoter Pveg can with an maximum of 65 Miller units be found during the transfer from the logarithmic to the stationary phase. This is about five times higher than the acitivity of the promoter PliaG with an maximum activity of about 12 Miller Units.

Disclaimer: The characters and US presidential setting is just a figment of our imagination. When: 2016 (Election year!!) Where: The USA Who: Mr. Bill Smith, Virginia Senator (Independent) and Presidential Candidate (Independent) Slogan: HELP ME. HELP YOU…TOWARDS A HEALTHIER TOMORROW FOR ALL. Personal statement from the candidate: “Scientists and researchers work tirelessly, trying to find cures for diseases that are killing and/or debilitating people. For some of you, this is personal because you, or your family member, are dealing with one of these diseases. Now is the time, to shift our focus, and redirect our resources investing in companies focusing on research and development. In some cases, vaccines and cures are on the brink of being discovered, but the lack of financial resources directly dictates the amount allocated to disease recovery and treatment. And If elected, I will pass bills to aid in the research and development of diseases and to ensure our focus is on developing vaccines, cures, and treatments…” Along the campaign trail: While caravanning through various states, Mr. Smith, receives a call from his wife that the results were in, it has been confirmed…his 8 years old son has Lowe syndrome. Now, it was suspected that this was something that his son acquired while they were on a family vacation in a tropical region of SOMEWHERE. A tick bit his son while they were camping. His son visited many doctors and was finally enrolled in a trial for a cure. However, 12 months before Mr. Smith decided to run for president, the trial ended due to lack of funding. He and his family were devastated. And Mr. Smith knew he had to do something.
Back at the campaign office: Mr. Smith and his team were in the process of declaring his platform. Therefore, with the recent outbreaks of Zika in Brazil and the more recent cases confirmed in the US, Senator Smith knew that he could get people to rally behind the need to invest in research and development. That way, the money needed would be resourced back to research facilities"

Team
The third-ever Washington University in St. Louis iGEM team is composed of four undergraduate students majoring in biology, biochemistry and biomedical engineering. With the help of two mentors, Dr. Joe Jez and Dr. Gautam Dantas, and several graduate students (Brian Landry, Bert Berla, and Larry Page), the team developed and carried out a project of its own devising – namely, the synthesis of the components of saffron in the vector Synechocystis.   This year’s team was assembled at the beginning of the spring semester.  Through weekly Wednesday morning meetings, the team brainstormed ideas with the mentors, eventually forming a concrete plan to be implemented over the summer. With most of the planning done during the semester, the team was free to spend the summer first ironing out the finer details of the project and then implementing the project.

The greater amount RNA express, the higher its fluorescence density is. We can use mathematics  modal to calculate the expression level through the   fluorescence intensity, thus enables the early diagnosis of the breast cancer by using serum albumin.

This allowed our message and work to be shared by the university and various social media accounts. Dr Sara Burton has also given us very useful advice on how to engage more with the public. We would like to thank Dr Nicky King for allowing us to attend the two science fairs. We would also like to thank the three work experience students who helped develop our project, both in Human Practices and in the Lab.
Equality and Diversity-
We are very grateful that Dr Andrew Griffiths, Dr Eduarda Santos, Dr Ceri Lewis, Dr Sharon Dixon, Dr Rob Wilson and Professor Michelle Ryan could take time for us to interview them on equality and diversity. Without these interviews and experiences shared, we wouldn’t have had most of our equality and diversity work and we wouldn’t have been able to develop our own views on equality and diversity. The Athena Swan Group and the Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity group at the university gave us the statistics necessary to back up the accounts given by the academics we interviewed. We would like to thank all those involved in helping us, especially those at XTV and Xpression FM for helping to host the equality and diversity in science panel discussion (Particularly James Woolcock and James Cunningham). Furthermore we would like to thank the panel: Dr Rob Wilson, Dr Alison Hill, Alec James and Laura Howard, for helping us inform the public on the issues of equality and diversity and provided well grounded opinion and understanding.
Integrated Human Practices: lab-
We are very grateful of the insight and feedback from Marcus Geshater, Dr Tom Ellis and Professor Richard Titball, allowing us to change and adapt our lab work according to its potential use in academic research or industry. We also wish to thank Prof. Robert Beardmore for his advice early on in the process about the prospect of kill switches being mutated against within a relatively short time-frame. Without his help, we would not have looked into using the ministat to create a continuous culture, testing the mutation rate of kill switches.

Hi
My name is Anika. I am currently studying Microbiology and Biochemistry in the Master program in Göttingen. That is where I also wrote my Bachelor thesis about the necessity of the citric acid cycle in Bacillus subtilis (by the way, it is not necessary ;) ). I am fascinated about the little organisms like bacteria and also pathogenic fungi. During my bachelor thesis I became more and more interested in the field of synthetic biology and that is why I joined this year’s iGEM Team.

Human Practice
Don’t aim for success if you really want it, just stick to what you love and belive in, and it will come naturelly.
As a worldwide event, iGEM is not only a competition for us, but also a chance to influence and even to change this world. NKU_CHINA has been working hard to practice the topic that the society impacts experiments and experiments that affect society. At the beginning of choosing the project, we hoped to benefit more ordinary people and to make some contribution to the community through synthetic biology. Therefore, we searched for the projects which had strong applications. With several discussions with the professors in our college, we finally chose Screening Strains with high glutamic acid concentration intracellular by intelligent metabolic pathways as our major concern. In order to make our project not only be restricted to our own, we carried out a series of activities around education and propaganda, team communication, market research, Communication improvement, and transformation of results.
We mainly performed and enhanced our project from the following aspects:

On June 24th, 2018, the Lotus Festival, a campus open day was held in Nankai University, our iGEM team participated in this event and successfully propagandized knowledge about synthetic biology as well as iGEM, let a lot of high school students and their parents for the first time knew about our competition and synthetic biology. We built a bridge between iGEM and the public.
Investigation and Propaganda in Western China
To investigate the education and the popularization of biological science in western China, we went to Yinchuan, Ningxia from August 1st to August 7th, 2018. We went to Minning Middle School to teach students some funny knowledge about synthetic biology. Through the research, we found that people in the western China knew little about biological knowledge, and we need to increase publicity and popular science.

- Today I have worked mostly on implementing a bubble sort style algorithm for invertase placement.  I'm not quite sure that it is completely possible to imitate a bubble sort given our problem.  Obviously, the difficulty with implementing bubble sort is that every swap must be independent, which is not the case for this problem.  Whenever we make one switch, it inverts any sites contained within that segment, rendering any switches using those sites impossible.  However, my attempt at implementing this has raised quite a couple questions in my mind.
Questions
1.  Are there sorting methods (other than bubble sort) that lend themselves well to our problem?  Can they be imitated?
2.  Can we imitate a sorting network?  (I attempted this.  Every swap in a sorting network is ordered, meaning that certain swaps cannot be made before others.  This makes these networks predictable.  It is difficult to do the same with invertases!)
Today has also helped me clarify my current problem.  After Swapnil and I talked for a bit, we decided that there are two problems that must be solved.
1.  Find scalable algorithms that work for n parts.
2.  Take any set of permutations and find an invertase design tailored to hitting those permutations.  This can be done a number of ways:
A.  Bottom Up Approach - Take each permutation and decide what switches need to be made in order to sort that permutation.  By recording these switches for each permutation, we can then compare the necessary switches for each permutation and merge invertases;
B. Top Down Approach - Use a scalable algorithm that hits every permutation.  Then, based on which permutations the user is interested in, eliminate the unnecessary invertases.
Based on all of these thoughts, I have decided this is my plan of action.
Future Plans
1.  Design at least one scalable algorithm for n parts.
2.  Work on using that algorithm to figure out a top-down approach for problem 2.  During this time, continue working on other scalable algorithms.
3.  Try my hand at the bottom-up approach.
I have decided on this approach because I am already in the middle of designing scalable algorithms so it seems natural for me to spend at least until the end of this week figuring out the details.  Then, this gives me a good place to begin tackling problem 2.
At the end of this summer, I would be happy with a set of algorithms that work for n parts, and either a fully fledged top-down or bottom-up approach to creating custom tailored"

Gibson Assembly preparation
For gibson assembly, reaction mix was prepared according to the conditions of NEB. The overall reaction volume was 20 µl. 10 µl Gibson MM were mixed with 0.02 – 0.5 pmol of the DNA fragments. The reaction mixture was filled up with ddH2O. For calculation of the molecular weight of the fragments, NEBioCalculator was used. The respective length of the fragments was extracted from the awesome_sheet. If the insert contains under 200 bp, the respective amount was multiplicated by five. The reaction mix was incubated at 50 °C for 15 min (2-3 fragments) or for 60 min (4-6 fragments) and the resulting sample was stored at -20 °C. For the following transformation, 2 µl of the assembly mix were used. For further information, please visit Gibson Assembly - NEB .

Evry,2012,Team:Evry#GB_-_-_TEXT.html," the community. Overhall, the idea of standardized parts that tends to loose its strength with the time will gain again in interest in the long run.
Conclusion
This year our team  created a new cloning format for the PartsRegistry that dramatically speeds up the cloning time and opens new perspective. This includes simple protein fusion methods and DNA shuffling that were not possible using the current BioBrick format. At the moment, we are working very hard to demonstrate the possibilities of the technique and come up with efficient and reliable protocols. If the process proves its interest, we will submit an RFC to the PartsRegistry and propose the GoldenBrick progressively substitute to the current BioBrick format, which will renew the interest for people on standardized biological parts and standardized assembly over gene synthesis.

This observation was confirmed by going through the literature Levskaya A, Chevalier AA, Tabor JJ, Simpson ZB, Lavery LA, Levy M, et al. Synthetic biology: engineering Escherichia coli to see light. Nature. 2005;438(7067):441-2. .
Figure 17. Fluorescence microscopy of RFP controlled by the OmpR-regulated promoter on a high copy vector in E. coli strain SØ928 ΔOmpR.
On the basis of this finding, the relE gene controlled by the OmpR-regulated promoter required a low copy plasmid or insertion into the chromosome. Protein expression of RFP in pSB1C3 with a copy number of 100-300 plasmids per cell, and pSB3K3 with a copy number of 10-12 plasmids per cell, was studied by flow cytometry. As for the determination of noise levels in the weak, BBa_J23114 , and strong BBa_J23102 constitutive promoters, , the experiment was carried out in both LB medium and M9 minimal medium, the latter supplemented with 0.2% glycerol. In the LB medium, selection was carried out by the addition of 30 µg/mL chloramphenicol, 30 µg/mL kanamycin, or 50 µg/mL ampicillin, depending on the resistance, and for M9 minimal medium, the concentrations used were 60 µg/mL chloramphenicol, 60 µg/mL kanamycin, and 100 µg/mL ampicillin. Excitation of RFP was at 561 nm, and emission was measured around 580 nm. Expression levels in both E. coli MG1655 and E. coli MG1655 ΔOmpR were studied to determine the baseline of the leaky expression not influenced by intrinsic pathways including the OmpR transcription factor.

Gurpal Bisra I am an engineering physics student, in my final year of undergrad, interested in pursuing bioengineering or biomedical engineering. I joined the iGEM team to further develop my biological skills and apply my engineering skills to a real life biological problem. I have traveled to 14 countries so far and my thirst for adventure never ceases! For our wet lab component, I developed a yeast cell to contain the mutant erg20-2 gene and made ERG20 and erg20-2 bio-bricks. I also helped develop plasmids that contain the K6R-HMG2 and IDI1 genes. My contribution to modeling was to simulate the biochemical pathways for our genetically engineered yeasts. I programmed simulations using MATLAB. Furthermore, I am helping to develop another model which shows the spread of the pine beetle using ARCGIS.
Daisy Ji I am a Pharmacy student interested in translational research. One of the interesting aspects of iGEM is the multidisciplinary approach it takes towards a whole variety of problems. My project consists of expressing 3-carene synthase in yeast and also submitting the 3-carene synthase as a biobrick part. Also, I will be truncating the 3-carene synthase to increase the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. I am also working to characterize the composite limonene synthase part from the Parts Registry by expressing it in C41 DE3 cells and assaying its limonene production in vitro. I enjoy reading books and playing chess. I also enjoy working out at Birdcoop and ballin'.

Ethics
First of all, we recommend that in the future, scientists and media work closely together to overcome these issues.
Secondly, both for biosafety and for biosecurity the scientific community has expressed its perception towards the risks involved in synthetic biology and they believe that additional regulation can limit or even reduce these risks.
At last, with our survey we aimed to raise the awareness on ethical issues mainly focusing on the extreme application of the reductionist and bottom-up approach. We got great feedback from many participants and when looking at the amount and the content of the open-answers, most people find this subject very interesting and seemed to appreciate the survey. Although no consensus will be formed on questions like whether life can be explained materialistically, the ongoing research in synthetic biology and specifically on the principles of life makes us obliged to keep the debate going and possibly prepare ourselves for whatever science will bring us next.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Instead, it calls for “regulatory parsimony”: no more surveillance than strictly required to ensure justice, fairness, security, and safety, as this may hamper progress of science and technology and may even prevent the development of safeguards. SYNBIOSAFE is more careful with respect to dual-use. They believe that the risk of intentional misuse has been neglected in previous discussions.
In this context, it is problematic that we cannot control the type of applications that we will facilitate with Gelcatraz. This means that we may potentially facilitate the use of GMO for harmful ends. However, the question is whether people using GMOs for dark purposes will benefit from our design, as we designed Gelcatraz with an emphasis on safety. People aiming to abuse GMOs probably do not care much about safety and may therefore not turn to our platform.
SYNBIOSAFE also addresses the possible diffusion of synthetic biology to amateur biologists. Considering that Gelcatraz has been designed not only for safety but also for convenience, it may offer an interesting platform to amateurs. This may be worrisome if amateurs are not aware or do not care about appropriate safety measures. We therefore agree with SYNBIOSAFE’s call for regulation and training in biosafety techniques. However, our platform has been designed as a platform for the use of already manipulated and tested bacteria. This means that only ‘amateurs’ capable of the initial steps needed to, for instance, equip their bacteria with the required adhesin. We therefore do not believe that our platform will attract fully inexperienced users.
4. Democratic deliberation
The presidential commission stresses the importance of an ongoing public debate and the search for common grounds on a topic so controversial as synthetic biology. The commission argues that decisions need not to be binding, as new information may challenge those decisions. Instead, the deliberative process should be ongoing. However, the commission seems to assume that the general public knows enough about synthetic biology to formulate an opinion. We think that often, the required knowledge is missing. Therefore, it may be good to inform people about the field of synthetic biology before asking them for their opinion. It is important that the provided education is objective. We believe that the democratic deliberation process is very much encouraged by the iGEM competition in the form of education and outreach, and feel that it is reflected by our outreach efforts .
5. Justice and fairness
The commission calls for a fair distribution of benefits, burdens and risks across society and globally. We opted for an application which is relevant for people all across the globe, as Staphylococcus aureus is everywhere (4) . To fairly"

iGEM teams are leading in the area of Human Practices because they conduct their projects within a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the Human Practices Hub .

Mekelle University
While meeting with Mekelle University in Ethiopia, we were able to speak with two members of the Department of Dryland Crop and Horticultural Sciences in the College of Dryland Agriculture and Natural Resources: Teklit Yohannes Hailu,
the Department Head, and Abraha Gebretsadkan Berhe, Assistant Professor In Nematology/Plant Pathology. Our team discussed our general project idea with the researchers and received feedback regarding the impact it would have on the region. They shared that rust causes devastatingly low wheat and garlic crop yields year after year in the region and a project like ours would be greatly appreciated and used.
Wheat in particular is a crucial crop in Ethiopia because of its use in the production of injera, a staple food in the Ethiopian diet. Wheat is consumed in all three meals of the day for 80-85% of rural Ethiopians. Most of their wheat production is for domestic use as it is consumed or sold to other families and friends. As a result of this, rust infections affect the local community by harming food security alongside creating disastrous economic losses. The researchers noted that rust contributes to 30% of food insecurity in Ethiopia by decreasing yields by an average of 50%. In extreme cases, entire fields of crops can be destroyed.
The devastation caused by rust is exacerbated by the lack of education and resources within the community. Farmers often apply insecticide or a lethal dose of"

People who step back show maturity, because they understand where their limits are and choose to rely on other people to overcome them.
In the first months of our project, we were contacted by the iGEM team of Kyoto which was working     on a project similar to the predecessor iGEM team Aachen Salt Vault Their project consists in genetically modifing yeast S. cerevisiae to take up sodium as well as chloride ions      to desalinate water and therefore recover fields which have been floated by the sea. Because one of our team mates has been part of the previous iGEM team Aachen, we decided to advice them.
We shared expertise, results and modelling information in order to help them as much as possible and make their first iGEM experience as a team both as enjoyable and       smoothly as possible.
Bhopal
Mentoring and liaising of contact
We had the pleasure to work with iGEM IISER Bhopal from India.     They also work on a cell based biosensor, but to measure the methane concentration of the air.      It was interesting to talk with them about our different approaches to this topic and to give each other thought-provoking impulses. For example sharing our approach of how to do a cell free biosensor via LSPR gave them an idea on how to make a biosensor more practical.      Our Engineer Jan Swetschinski instructed this Indian team on how to do the modeling for their project.      He recommended them a modeling program and showed them how to use it to feed the information into the programme.
We also exchanged our human practices experiences and ideas with each other and iGEM Bhopal gave us the opportunity      to ask some questions to Dr. Puneet Ghandi, an Indian professor in Medical Biotechnology.      As she researched on DNA instability in neurodegenerative disorders, we asked if she had come across the correlation      of an imbalanced melatonin production and neurodegenerative disorders in her studies.      She investigated Hurler's Syndrome and Huntington's Chorea and told us that the role of melatonin was more studied in these diseases recently.      Based on her current work on CNS tumors, Dr. Ghandi thought it would be useful to measure the concentration of melatonin in these disorders.      Through this contact, we were reassured that a malfunction of melatonin production is a worldwide important topic      in medical research, therefore a simplification of the measuring"

1. Concept -E. coli with humanity-
In order to make E. coli with humanity, we decided to engineer E. coli that can communicate with other, recognize the crisis situation other might be facing and show its sympathy toward it by rescuing it from dying...
Below we pictured our desired behavior of E. coli with humanity. Two kinds of cells are assumed. In normal conditions, they are competitors for survival because they are grown together in a single medium where the growing resources are limited. While in crisis conditions, such that one is dying, another cell would notice the crisis of dying cell and rescue it. The recovered cell appreciates the help by producing “apples”.
fig.1-1  1.They are competitors.  2.One is dying, another cell notices it.  3.Fine cell rescues dying cell. 4.Dying cell recovers and she gives ""Apples"" as expression of appreciation
2. Apple reporters
Our E. coli with humanity gives “apples” as expression of appreciation. It’s really difficult to make E. coli producing real apples. However, we succeeded in synthesizing two components of apples.
2-1. Color -Carotenoid synthetic pathway complete!-
This year, our team expanded the project of Cambridge 2009. We succeeded in synthesizing zeaxanthin by adding crtZ into crtEBIY likewise astaxanthin by crtZW. We identified them by TLC.
Astaxanthin is the final metabolite of carotenoid synthetic pathway. (See more…)
2-2. Fragrance -We create Apple flavor in E. coli-
We designed apple fragrance expression device with MpAAT1. MpAAT1 is able to produce ester compounds with apple fragrance using some alcohols and Acetyl-CoA.
(See more…)
3. Artificial Cooperation System
We built Artificial Cooperation System to engineer E.coli with humanity. In this system quorum sensing and chloramphenicol generator activated by LuxR are very important. First, we constructed and characterized several promoters regulated by LuxR and 3OC6HSL. We designed and constructed a new LuxR repression promoter. In addition, we characterized the functions of a LuxR repression promoter and a LuxR activation promoter already existed in the registry. Second, we constructed a new chloramphenicol resistance protein generator which is regulated by LuxR activation promoter. We confirmed that the cell with the chloramphenicol resistance gene generator survived in high concentration of chloramphenicol"

We already had many answers in France and the Greece Team proposed to share it in their country. Here we provide results of this survey in both countries.
96% of people who answered to the survey in Greece are from scientific studies while only 70% for France. Despite that, it looks like french people answered with more accuracy than greek people. But it may be because of statistics, indeed, we received approximately 550 french answers and only 100 greek answers.
Postcard project
Done for : Gröningen Team
Description
The Gröningen Team set up a project to exchange postcards about synthetic biology. Each participating team creates its own postcard.
Our postcard
We chose to draw our logo on a petri dish with orange and yellow E. coli. Indeed, after a brainstorming was done in May, we still had two iGEM projects. One about cholera/crocodile and the other about modifying bacteria depending on light so it could form a drawing. We ended choosing the crocodile project so this postcard was the opportunity to mix our 2 main projects: crocodile and art.
Database of host organisms called ChassiDex
After filling out the survey of IIT Madras Team they sent us their database and asked for help to fill it. Indeed, ChassiDex is a database to gather the main information on organisms in order to modify them easily. Information such as biosafety level, genotype of strains, protocols of transformations and also iGEM BioBricks already available are collected to help future iGEM teams to quickly choose their organisms and to find relevant literature about it.
In the context of our project Croc’n cholera we entered data for Pichia pastoris SMD1168H and Vibrio harveyi JMH626
Meetups
We participated in the European iGEM Meetup in Delft on the 7th of July and also in the French Meetup in Paris on the 22nd of July.
It was obviously a nice way to practice our presentation and our poster before going to the Giant Jamboree, but it also enabled us to discuss our project with other iGEMers and scientists. As we presented the context of cholera and our ideas of a solution with synthetic biology, we got to confront with a lot of questions about ethics, safety and usefulness of our project. People gave us interesting feedbacks and it made us question our solution from other perspectives.

Safety
Note: Do not do this at the lab or home
It is vital that any iGEM team not put itself or others at any risk through its work. The Hardware track has fewer associated safety risks than would be found in a purely biological project. In fact, our project involved significantly fewer transformations and much less handling of biological materials than a typical iGEM project. Nevertheless, we considered any possible risks that our project could pose and adopted a number of practices in order to minimise these.
The nature of our project makes it inherently impossible for anyone, even with malicious intentions, to cause harm to others or the environment.
Safety concerns in our Project
Lighting
Some fluorescent molecules require UV light in order to excite them. UV light can be potentially harmful to the eyes and skin if not used with caution. In the project only near-UV LEDs are used, which have a peak in emission at 395nm and are considered safe, as this lies out of the range of 260-270nm [1], which is most harmful to humans. Regardless, all LEDs in the final design of OpenScope are contained within the plastic casing, so the user would not come into contact with any direct light.
Electronics
OpenScope is a digital microscope, and as such is based on a number of electronics: Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi camera, Arduino, stepper motors, etc. The Arduino and the Raspberry Pi boards have 5V/2A power supplies, or alternmatively can be plugged into 9V batteries. These components are to be handled as typical home electronic devices. Detailed wiring instructions are available on the Make Your Own page to ensure that any potential users do not misuse the equipment.
Biological
The biological side of our project involves standard, routine transformations with fluorescent proteins. For testing of some of our equipment pre-transformed, GFP-expressing Marchantia polymorpha was provided to us. However, as part of our collaboration"

Plant Synthetic Biology
Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
Here are a few examples from previous teams:
2016 Cambridge JIC
2016 SCAU-China"
Michigan_Software,2017,Team:Michigan Software#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," lab. To address this, we have built a favorites system into ProtoCat, which allows users to signify a select set of ""favorite protocols"". Now, the PI only needs to update his favorites, and then when the students check the favorites section they'll find the new protocol.
Group Accounts
ProtoCat 3.0 enabled users have accounts, with which they can establish an identity in the ProtoCat community through uploading protocols, leaving comments, and rating other users' protocols. In ProtoCat 4.0, we've expanded these capabilities to include favorite protocols as well. However, what about organizations? Suppose we had the head of a lab who also works with a company? It would be difficult to separate the protocols just at the user level if the user simply favorites the protocols for his/her work; the distinction needs to be done at an organizational level. So, 'Group Accounts' were added to ProtoCat, allowing for favorite protocols at the lab (instead of individual researcher) level.
Improved Security
Security is important in any online domain; web security is especially important when dealing with sensitive information such as protocols. In addition, insecure websites can result in their users information being leaked. We have taken steps to ensure our site is safe and sescure, shown by our site receiving an A grade by SSL Lab's Server test, the results can be found at this link . These results are comparable to sites such as Google and Facebook . To get maximum security, we would need to disable encryption methods used by older browsers and disallow them from accessing ProtoCat; we opted for a wider audience at the cost of a marginal security increase.
Other Improvements
In addition to the above changes, we have also improved our searching service, our server infrastructure, as well as our internal team structure. ProtoCat now searches more fields when retrieving protocols, in order to make finding the relevant ones more effective. We have also improved our ProtoCat server, switching to a more scalable infrastructure. Lastly, we have adopted pair programming techniques in order to ensure that as our current members graduate and move on, that the knowledge of how ProtoCat works is not lost.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html," plan an experiment (one to two weeks), where we reproduce the results of the paper [<bib id=""pmid23377039""/>]. After mixing the Acidovorax complex medium (ACM) and adding 4g Chelex-100 resin / 1L ACM  we prepare 25 agarplates (0,5 L ) and two media for liquid culture (1L +0,5L). The second day is about the resuspending of the strain D. acidovorans in 5 ml [recepy in methods] and letting it grow over night. The next day 5 agarplates are inoculated with D. Acidovorans by fractional streak and 5 agarplates with streak over half of the plate. In addition to these 10 agarplates, also the two flasks with the liquid media are inoculated with the strain. The rest of the resuspended cells is stored in a glycerol stock. After 3 days of culture growth (shaking at 190rpm, at a temperature of 30°C) the cells are big enough to start with the delftibactin purification (liquid culture) and the fast test on the agarplates. For the fast test on the agarplates we prepare an soft agarose solution (0,5% agarose and 10mM AuCl3) and incubate every plate with 10 ml solution for two hours at rooms temperature. If delftibactin is present there can be observed a ring structure around the cells.
For the purification of delftibactin, the liquid culture will be centrifugated at  7000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant will be treated with HP20 resin (20 g/L) and then shaken 2h at 220rpm. With the Buchner funnel filtration the resin will be collected and washed with 400 ml dH2O. Afterwards the resin is again washed with 400 ml methanol which will be evaporate under rotary vacuum. The leftover is resuspended in 2 ml of ddH2O:MeOH (1:1). The solution is added to a HPLC column and the HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) is analysed in a mass spectroscopy facility. The mobile phase consists in 2%-14% acetonitrile and  98% water +5 mM (NH4)2CO3.

Sustainability
Our project is focused on sustainability. The current practice of mining phosphorus to use for fertilizer is unsustainable in multiple ways. We researched the sustainability of our project online and through meetings with environmental, agricultural, and waste experts such as Dr. Jay Garland from the EPA; Angela Andrews from the City of Lafayette Water Pollution Control; Dr. Terry Semmel from Monsanto; Dr. Craig Stow from the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab; and Dr. Sara McMillan from the Purdue ABE Department.
Mining strips land, produces waste, and threatens water supplies (1). Our project would reduce this issue by recycling available phosphorus, reducing the need to mine it.
Runoff causes eutrophication, or excess nutrients in water bodies that lead to elevated levels of plant growth.This elevated plant growth, often algal blooms, can kill plants and animals in affected areas; taint drinking water supplies; degrade recreational opportunities; and produce neurotoxins and hepatotoxins (3). Our project would reduce this issue by removing excess phosphorus from the water.
If no additional collection measures are taken, agricultural demand for phosphorus will eclipse readily available phosphorus supplies within 30 to 40 years and as a result cause agriculture to spread onto new land (2). Our project would reduce this issue by delaying phosphorus shortages and decreasing the need to use new, previously undisturbed land for agriculture. If the phosphorus reclamation module (PRM) was self-sustaining, then modules could be deployed into large bodies of fresh water to gather up more dilute concentrations of phosphorus.
Fourth, current fertilizer application practices result in a large portion of the phosphorus applied to farmlands running off and only about a fifth makes it to the food humans consume (2). Our project may exacerbate this issue, however, by continuing to provide phosph"

PSB1C3-DAMP-PEXIGANAN/TEV PROTEASE CLONNING
We thought to ,ligate our gene sequence whichs ordered from IDT with the g-BLOCKS form, PSB1C3 firstly to clonning and submittions.  Therefore we digested both PSB1C3 vector and Damp-Pexigan and TEV protease-G-blocks with EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Then we aimed to insert these cuted g-BLOCKS into plasmid with using T4 DNA Ligase. Following ligation, the resulting plasmids were transformed into BL21 competent bacteria.
We did colony PCR in order to check the accuracy of cloning with Veritification Forward and Veritification Reverse Primers. If the clonning resulted negative expecting band would be 314 bp. On the other hand if we succesfully clonned these parts, for DAMP-Pex. Expected band would be 1006 bp, for TEV Protease it would be 1062 bp.
After colony PCR consequences we have put the positive resulted clonnings 16 hours liquid culture  after that we isolated plasmid DNA with miniprep plasmid izolation method. We make cutcheck to our attained plasmid DNAs for put a second control step. Our restriction enzymes those we used are EcoRI and PstI.

Gel electrophoresis and purification of digested mutdCas9 and biobricks; Repeated miniprep and digestion of biobricks
Goal:
Gel elecrohoresis of yesterday’s digested mutated dCas9 and biobricks
If visible, gel purification of bands at appr. 2000 for the biobricks (= pSB1C3 backbone) and 5000 bp for dCas9
Measure quantity and quality of purified product (Nanodrop)
Procedure:
Gel electrophoresis, purification and nanodrop
The restriction enzymes in each sample was heat killed at 80 °C for 20 min. 4 μL loading dye was added to the samples and the total volumes of each sample (24 μL) were run at 80 V for 45 min on a 0.8% agarose gel containing GelGreen. Since neither of the biobrick replicates (B1 and B2) gave any visible bands, only the 5000 bp bands for two of the mutated dCas9 replicates (1.1 and 1.2) was excised from the gel.
The gel purification was conducted following the ZymocleanTM Gel DNA Recovery protocol, using 216 μL and 252 μL ADB buffer for dCas9 sample 1.1 and 1.2, respectively. The quantity and quality of purified product using Nanodrop.
Addition to the planned goal: Miniprep of BBa_K592009 and BBa_K592010 transformed bacterial cultures
Since the biobricks did not give any visible bands on the gel, bacterial cultures with cells transformed with BBa_K592009 and BBa_K592010 were miniprepped again. The cultures were diluted to a final OD600 value of about 1, and then two of the cultures containing BBa_K592009 and one culture containing BBa_K592010 was minipre"

Hamburger Team wurde Publikumsliebling
Auch in der Kategorie „Undergraduate“ (U23) war ein europäisches Team bei iGEM erfolgreich. Hier verbuchte das Team vom Imperial College London den Gesamtsieg für sich. Die Londoner haben sich in ihrem Projekt „Ecolibrium“ mit der Konstruktion von mikrobiellen Ökosystemen im Labor beschäftigt. Auf den Plätzen folgen das Team Sydney und SCAU-China.  Einen Sonderpreis heimste das Team Hamburg ein. Für die Hanseaten gab es den begehrten „iGEMers Prize“, der von den tausenden Teilnehmern des ""Giant Jamboree"" als Publikumspreis vergeben wird. Das Projekt ""Finding Clamydory"" - dessen Website-Gestaltung an den Kinoblockbuster ""Finding Dory"" angelehnt ist, war offenkundig ganz nach Geschmack des Plenums. Das Team hat einen Biosensor entwickelt, der Erreger der Art Chlamydia trachomatis gezielt aufspüren kann. Chlamydien sind Auslöser von Geschlechtskrankheiten, sie werden meist ungezielt mit Breitband-Antibiotika behandelt. Ein präzises Testverfahren, wie die Hanseaten es ausgetüftelt haben, könnte die Therapie verbessern.
Viel Edelmetall für die deutschen Teams
Auch der Medaillenspiegel der deutschen Teams ist einmal mehr beeindruckend: Es gab fünfmal Gold (Aachen, Bielefeld, Düsseldorf, Freiburg und München), sechsmal Silber (Bonn, Darmstadt, Nürnberg-Erlangen, Göttingen, Hamburg und Marburg) und zweimal Bronze (Hannover und Tübingen). Damit haben die deutschen Hochschulteams die seit vielen Jahren äußerst erfolgreiche iGEM-Geschichte fortgeschrieben. Hier kann man die Projekte aus der Saison 2016 im Kurzprofil nachlesen. pg""

Additionally, we aim to translate this into production of human proinsulin in Y. lipolytica.
Compute
To maximize the chance and extent of success at the products group in producing insulin and other heterologous compounds, we aim to analyze all the relevant sequences for restriction sites and suboptimal codons and return the sequences in codon-optimized form. Furthermore, we will use beta-carotene as an example for applying genome-scale modeling aiming to predict the optimal substrate conditions for maximization of production. Finally, we build a combined fermenter and OD600-measuring device controlled by an Arduino, in order to facilitate easy and fast inoculations with plenty of data to analyze, eventually helping the other groups obtain results.

Inducable promoters
For inducable promoters the maximum transcription rate has to be multiplied with a factor to integrate the effect of the transcription factors. Our system includes two types of DNA binding proteins: repressors and activators. These proteins bind certain regions in the promoter DNA. This binding can either repress or activate the promoter activity, affecting transcription. The repressors used in our system are the cI protein of the lambda phage and the PenI protein. The activator protein is LuxR, which should be activated by AHL. All proteins first need to form homodimers before being able to bind their target DNA.
DNA binding will be simulated using the Hill function : ${\theta} = \frac{{[L]}^n}{{K_d}^n + [L]^n} = \frac{1}{1+(\frac{K_{d}}{[L]})^{n}}$. $\theta$ is the amount of DNA bound by the protein, $L$ is the amount of protein, $K_d$ is the dissociation constant and $n$ is the Hill coefficient. This Hill function has values between 0 and 1 and acts like an ON/OFF switch.
For repressors we are interested in how much of the DNA is still unbound and active: $\frac{1}{1 + ({\frac{[Repressor]}{K_{d}}})^{n}}$
For activators we are interested in how much of the DNA is bound and active: $\frac{1}{1+(\frac{K_{d}}{[Activator]})^{n}}$
The Hill coefficient gives an idea about the strength about the interaction between the DNA and the protein and is sometimes used to estimate the amount of proteins that bind the DNA but caution is needed in using it. Indeed, the Hill function has knwown shortcomings, but it is still very useful because of its simplicity (citate paper).
The constants needed for our model are $K_d$ and $n$. :

La Paillasse has a much more personal learning-by-doing approach than MadLab, which currently mainly hosts workshops. A general rule is: “Don’t touch what you don’t understand” and “Ask questions”, which new members do in abundance. So far, the founder Thomas Landrain remarked there have been no problems regulating member activity. Every project in La Paillasse must be transparent to other members and written up on a wiki, which also ensures that no genetic modification takes place. Learning at La Paillasse mainly happens through talking, sharing and collaborating.
Funding and Collaboration
MadLab has just completed a one-year collaboration with Manchester Metropolitan University funded by the Wellcome Trust.
La Paillasse has a nominal membership fee of €20 per year, but they have received an impressive amount of equipment by in-kind donation. Some of this equipment comes from companies, but a lot was found in an abandoned laboratory owned by the City of Paris, who gave the community permission to take the equipment. La Paillasse’s founder Thomas Landrain estimates the value of the equipment at about €200,000.
Collaborations and Public Outreach
MadLab’s collaboration with Manchester Metropolitan University led to a number of structured public outreach workshops, jointly planned in advance. Even now, after the collaboration has finished, ties to the university remain. When MadLab hosts a new workshop, they always receive academic feedback on their plan to ensure there are no safety issues they overlooked.
La Paillasse would like to engage in more public outreach, but these activites would first require a larger space.
Biohacking contributions to science?
MadLab has proved to be a fantastic place for public outreach, which underlines the point that citizen science is often seen today as a means of in-depth public engagement. While this is true, Biohacking might also have additional benefits for science and academia.
Biohacking spaces are usually based within wider Hackerspaces, where a diverse set of people from Electronics, Engineering, Computering, Design, Art, etc. meet. This can lead to facilitated cross-fertilization between subjects. Biohacking is much less compartmentalized than traditional science.
Location: Citizen science communities are often closer to the communities and their needs and can react more appropriately. For example, artists and Biohackers in Indonesia developed safe alcohol fermentation protocols after a surge in methanol poisoning deaths following an alcohol tax increase. Another example, La Paillasse uses French rather than English to be"

Introduction
iGEM teams are leading in the area of Human Practices because they conduct their projects within a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the Human Practices Hub .

What is chitin?
Chitin(C8H13O5N)n is a modified polysaccharide which contains nitrogen. It is an abundant polymer found ubiquitously in nature and consists of long chains of N-acetylglucosamine, a derivative of glucose and is similar to cellulose in structure. It forms the main cell wall of many fungi, the exoskeleton of insects and crustaceans (such as crab, lobster and shrimps), the beak and internal shell of cephalopods and the radulas of molluscs. Hydrogen bonding between adjacent polymers gives chitin-polymer matrix increased strength.
In insects, chitin is often modified and embedded in sclerotin (a proteinaceous matrix which forms much of the exoskeleton). This composite material may also be combined with calcium carbonate to produce the much stronger composite of crustacean shells.
Serratia marcescens
Serratia belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae. They are gram negative rod shaped bacteria and are common of many environments from soil, bathroom showers and as a biofilm on teeth.  Isolates are also known to be pathogenic to humans. 
 
Chitinases from Serratia marcescens
 
We were kindly gifted the three chitinase genes isolated from S. marcenscens by Prof. Frank Sargent of the Dundee iGEM 2013 team ( http://www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/people/frank-sargent ). In 1969, J.Monreal and E. Reese  found that S. marcescens was the most efficient chitin degrader among 100s of other microorganisms.  We therefore decided to design a chitinase expressing E.coli which would attach out bed bugs.
 
Mechanism of chitinase activity
 
There are three main enzymes involved in Chitin degradation in S. marcescens. These have been designated as Chitinase A (ChiA), Chitinase B (ChiB) and Chitinase C (ChiC) Another molecule, CBP21, is also involved in chitin degradation.
ChiA and ChiB primarily bind to chain ends (exo-action). The protein structure of ChiA and ChiB reveals that carbohydrate binding domains are opposite in the 2 enzymes suggesting the two enzymes degrade the polymer from different ends, ChiA from the reducing end and ChiB from the"

Tomorrow I plan to continue with the replication animation as well as the entire molecular cloning mission. I believe I will try to get the timing organized for the different parts of the replication display so that everything will happen in the correct order and I will finish of obtaining the substrings I need from note cards for construction.

1. Overnight cultures
Purpose: To do a miniprep on cells containing these plasmids, we have to grow an o/n culture. K082003 is being isolated to complete the reporter circuit of Pqrr4+RBS+GFP+LVA. So far, Pqrr4 + RBS have been constructed, and now I have to miniprep GFP+LVA, and construct the final reporter circuit.  Q04510 is being isolated so that Jeremy and Jamie can construct our final response circuit.
2. Restreak of K082003 (GFP + LVA tag) and Q04510 (Inverter)
Purpose: Because some of yesterday’s restreaks did not contain single colonies, I restreaked them again so that I can get single colonies to work with if the single colonies in 1 do not contain the plasmid of interest.

Wrapping Up the Second Life Lab
I got together with Katie and we listed out all the things I needed to make available as components for Transformation and Restriction digest. Those have been completed. Unfortunately, the ‘fridges’ in the lab have become increasingly crowded as a result. To make it easier to see, I will be changing the hover text color, and am also considering making a mini ‘map’ on a texture that will show people exactly where things are kept. (EDIT: now that the font has been changed and the boxes more organized, a map is no longer necessary)
Katie also incorporated the necessary components for the lab missions in the PCR, restriction digest, and transformation activities. I’ve completed the un-edited notecards for DNA extraction and all 3 lab missions, so as a result, we are done the notecards necessary for lab and will be sending the rest of the set to you tomorrow (hopefully).  All the ‘lab mission packages’ have been assembled with instructions, necessary starting parts, and accessories (wearable pipettes  :D)
Tomorrow, Katie and I will be testing out all of our"

and that they bind at a 1:1 ratio (2) . Therefore the ratio of free lanosterol synthase to total lanosterol synthase will be:
$$ \large{ \begin{equation} \frac{LS}{LST}=\frac{1.56}{2.56}. \tag{Eq 8} \end{equation} } $$
By substituting (Eq 8) into equation (Eq 6) the ratio between \(K_{1}\) and \(K_{2}\) can be found:
$$ \large{ \begin{equation} \frac{K_{1}}{K_{2}}= 0.78\quad \mu  M^{-1}. \tag{Eq 9} \end{equation} } $$
For (Eq 3) , (Eq 6) and (Eq 8) can be used to find the ratio between \(K_{3}\) and \(K_{2}\):
$$ \large{ \begin{equation} \frac{K_{3}}{K_{2}}=1. \tag{Eq 10} \end{equation} } $$
From Goodman's 1964 paper (3) , it can be calculated that the suggested initial concentration of squalene is: \(SE_{0}=\) 0.82 \(\mu M\). It is then assumed that this will be a reasonable estimate for the initial concentration of squalene epoxide found in fingerprint residues. Therefore, from (Eq 9) and (Eq 10) the estimated values for \(\lambda\) and \(\gamma\) are found to be:
$$ \large{ \begin{equation} \lambda=0.64, \qquad \gamma=1.\tag{Eq 11}  \end{equation} } $$
By running the ode23 solver over one hundred different values for both parameters and the ratio \(v_{0}\), sensitivity analysis can be performed. The range of values has the mean as the estimated values, (Eq 7) and (Eq 11) . The results are shown in Figure 6 , where the centre of the plot represents the suggested concentration of complex formed when the suggested binding rates are used.

Wageninger UR Team collaboration
The Wageningen UR Team contacted us asking for help with their human practices, as they are developing a diagnostic test kit for Zika and other diseases, they wanted to know more about the issues in dealing with infectious diseases and whether their technology could help to tackle some of these issues. We talked about personal experiences and also managed to speak to Tatiana Mingote, from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and forward her answers to the dutch team's questions. We also exchanged thoughts and experiences about our projects and got some ideas of complementartity of our technologies, which both aim to help the fight against infectious diseases.
IONIS-PARIS Team collaboration
We had a great skype talk, followed by further conversations, with team IONIS-Paris which is working with temperature driven sensors to cope with climate impact on agriculture. For their Human Practices , they had a plethora of good questions about GMO regulation laws as well as the innovation atmosphere in synthetic biology in our country. It was great to contribute to such an interesting human practices approach."

The utility of threshold limitation
Much as excessive signal levels can destroy a radio transmitter, excessive genetic expression can cause damage in living systems.  While cells are usually well-equipped to modulate their own transcriptional behavior, an investigation into pathological gene expression indicates that many situations arise wherein the expected regulatory response fails.  Our device is designed to augment endogenous gene regulatory pathways.

To get back to the analogy of smart phone OS, Google has kept certain parts of their Android closed or has closed them off again to make more money.

Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," GMO procedures, such as obtaining approvals from several ministries or labelling your final products in a predescribed manner. Environmental release of GMOs is also given serious attention although the procedures are not as tight, just as in the case of contained GMO use. Usually, the target use also dictates which Ministry will be responsible for the evaluation and approval of the planned GMO use. These could include Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Food, Fisheries, Forestry, Environment and many more.
In Korea, the procedure is also similar but it requires a payment of a examination fee that costs 4000 dollars. In the USA, GMO plants are considered equivalent to non-GMO plants and do not require much further approval; only if the plant express a protein that is significantly different from any protein originally expressed, will a respective institution be required to approve of such use. In Chile, on the other hand, it is forbidden to commercialise GMOs as only seed exportation is allowed.
*Click on each flag to see the response of each individual team!*
Under FDA regulations, most plant GMOs are considered equivalent to non-GMOs and do not require much further approval. However, if the modified plant expresses a protein that is significantly different from any protein it originally expressed, then the business must get approval from the FDA.
To receive EPA approval for GMOs with the Bt toxin, the business must conduct a food-safety analysis and verify that the toxin will be safe for the environment. GMOs without this toxin can be freely used.
If it involves Health Products it must go through:
• Review and evaluation. (ie. pre-clinical trials in vitro, labelling of the product, etc).
• Compliance and Enforcement Activities which include fulfilling areas in Education, Consultation, and Information; Compliance Monitoring; Compliance Verifications and Investigation; and Enforcement.
• Monitoring and Tracking involves the process of continual monitoring after a product has been released to the market. This allows the public to interact with the product and provide valuable feedback.
If it involves Food Products it requires:
• Pre-market assessment is required under the Food and Drug regulations and is a science-based safety and nutritional assessment where the food product must fulfill a criteria.
• Letter of no Objection must be sent to the product developer and outlines that the product is able to be sold in Canada for a specific mentioned reason as well as include the limitations on the product as provided by Health Canada.
• Labelling of Foods Derived from Biotechnology is required to all foods whether created through genetic engineering or not. It is absolutely required if the food has any health or safety issues such as allergens.

Both concentrations increase             when extracellular [AHL] increases above 10−7, which can be attributed to the higher net diﬀusion             of AHL into the cell independent of the activation of the positive feedback loop itself. However, it can also be seen that the addition of asRNA reduces the response of the system at high concentrations of AHL and so its main advantage is in the sharp boundary between on and off concentrations.

Who We Are
The Team
Mark Stewart
is a computer science and biochemistry student at the University of Maryland. He is interested in software development, particularly with respect to application tools for the research sciences and social media. His other interests include data visualization, scientific futurism, skeptical inquiry, and kittens. D'aw, kittens. He will graduate in 2012 and be pursuing a career in software development.
Mandy Hagen
is a rising junior at the University of Maryland, College Park. She is studying bioengineering with a concentration in drug discovery and delivery. During the school year she works in the Neuromuscular Bioengineering Lab as a researcher and at the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center as a bartender. She is the Recruitment Chair for the Society of Bioengineers and an active member of Alpha Omega Epsilon, the engineering sorority. She participates as a Engineering School Ambassador and as a Honors College Ambassador in her spare time, of which she admittedly has very little. When not studying or engaged in academic activities, she plays club field hockey and enjoys napping. Following graduation she will either attend graduate school for biomedical engineering, pursue a career in professional engineering, or earn an MBA and go into industry. She'll be sure to let you know once she figures it out. Cheers.
Adam Grose
is a student at Bluefield State College in Bluefield, WV and is a Biology major. His aspiration is to attend graduate school in the medical field, possibly studying medicine.  His academic interests include microbiology and physiology; he is an automotive enthusiast, enjoys spending time with his family, and likes taking his dog, Cody, for a swim.  This is his first research experience, and he has found it to be very rewarding to bridge academia with practicum.  He is thankful to be a part of of the iGEM team at Virginia Tech.
Swetha Pasala

Alberta,2009,Team:Alberta#Project#Gene Selection_-_-_TEXT.html," Still, these lists provide an important foundation for basic components that are required in an essential genome list.
Constructing the BioBytes Preliminary Essential Gene List
The preliminary essential gene list is based on literature sources. As described in the modeling section of this wiki, the metabolic genes from this preliminary list were used as a starting point for the computer model and were greatly altered based on the model's suggestions.  The following criteria were used for selecting genes from a literature source:
Genes must be present in more than one literature list unless there is particular reason to suspect they are essential.
The BioBytes metabolism is modeled after the minimal metabolism proposed by Gil et al 04, with the addition of cell wall, fatty acid, heme and ubiquitin synthesis, as Gil assumed these would not be necessary in a mycoplasma like minimal cell.
Additional genes required for metabolism were selected based on pathway information in the Ecocyc database. Redundancy of pathways is likely why these genes don’t appear essential in Baba, Gerdes and PEC.
Antitoxin genes are not essential as toxin genes would not be present.
The basic functional groups of genes which were selected can be seen in the next chart and a detailed list of processes which were included follow.
Essential Gene Functions
Genes for the following processes were included:
DNA replication and cell division, but no DNA repair
Chaperones, but no heat shock or membrane stress response system
Transcription
Translation
Glycolysis
PMF generation via an ATP synthase consuming ATP to export protons.
Synthesis of acetyl-CoA from pyruvate
Fatty acid synthesis
Methylerithritol pathway (for undecaprenyl phosphate and a ubiquinone side chain)
Synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine, but no other phospholipids
Pentose phosphate pathway (converts 6 or 3 carbon sugars to 5C sugars, such as ones needed in nucleotide biosynthesis)
Lipoprotein synthesis (Int and lolB are lipoproteins and essential)
Synthesis of nucleotides (deoxy and oxy) from nucleosides
Attaching lipid and biotin groups to protein
Transport:
PTC transport system (imports and phosphorylates glucose)
Inorganic phosphate transport
Nucleoside transport
Sec system (exports proteins to periplasm), including SRP for cotranslational membrane insertion. secB chaperone does not appear essential. There is NO tat system, which would be used to export cofactor containing folded proteins.

The notations for both of these tools is the following:
Let's say we have the following design:  I0 A B C I0'
In this design there is one invertase, Invertase 0.  This is represented by I0 and I0'.  The ""'"" indicates that the invertase is facing a particular direction.  We can imagine I0 to represent an open bracket ""["" and I0' to represent a closed bracket ""]"".  When Invertase 0 is added to this design, it flips everything enclosed in these open and closed brackets.  Thus, as an example, the first tools produces the following information when Invertase 0 is added (Directly copied and pasted from my tool).
Obviously, this tool allows for much more complicated designs and inversions as well.

- Today I reworked a portion of my checking tool.  It is much easier to use and now works much faster.  I believe that speed will be an issue with this tool so Jenhan and I spent a portion of time today discussing better architecture that will speed the tool up.  For example, if we have 10 different invertases, and we would like to test every permutation/combination of these 10 inputs, the number of input test vectors is more than 10!.  Currently, every single test vector is tried, however if we know that certain test vectors do not work, there is no reason to continue down that path.  For example if the input vector 123 works but 1234 does not work, there is no reason to try any permutation that begins with the test vector 1234.  Tomorrow Jehnan and I will try to implement a number of fixes like this.  Currently, the program handles 10 inputs in a matter of 3 minutes or so, but scaling this up to 11 inputs means a huge jump in testing time.  With this tool, I have tested a number of designs but I believe that my simple algorithms thus far might require 11 invertases for only five parts!  Clearly this is not optimized, but our first task is to just find an algorithm that works even if it is an expensive one.

Regulation of killing ability
I Introduction
    Even though we have orthogonal gene circuit, the killing ability of two warriors may have great difference. (Fig.1)
    Sometimes, to mimic situation we investigate in real world, it may be necessary to regulate killing ability to an appropriate level, for example, to make two warriors have same killing ability. What can we do to regulate the killing ability of warriors?
    Intuitively, many potential factors can influence the killing ability, like the catalysis rate of AHL synthase, cross-membrane rate between AHL molecules. Then what factors can we change to regulate the killing ability of warriors? Our model suggest that it is possible to regulate the killing ability of two warriors by just changing the promoter intensity of some proteins.
II Evaluation of warrior’s killing ability
    First, to simplify the evaluation, we will have some hypothesis at first:
1. The increasing rate of two warriors are the same.
2. The environmental capacity (it is mentioned in the famous Logistic model) of two warriors are the same if the environmental conditions and the initial amount of resources are the same.(By these hypothesis, we can ignore influence of growth rate on killing ability, which will make things more complicated.)
3. Also, we could only consider the condition that there is glucose inside the medium and there is only warrior lived in the medium.
4. RFP intensity is used to indicate the amount of LacI (More details why we detect RFP intensity but not OD600 directly in the model can be seen at Fluid Model ), so it"

Highlighting the biological significance of dimerization:
Dimerization is only too common in cells. Monomers assembly into dimers for further functions all the time, some interactions strong, some interactions weak. Function-less newborn peptides piece together and get to work, forming so-called tertiary structure; activated kinases reach each other and mutually phosphorylate; transcription factors, when forming homo- or hetero-dimers according to different stoichiometry, leads to varied downstream responses and distinct cellular fates…
Yes, we know which proteins dimerize. We understand how proteins dimerize as well, by interaction of domains like leucine zippers and so forth. But why? What is the point of dimerization?
Previous researches have underlined the important advantages of dimerization, including differential regulation, specificity, facilitated proximity and so on. [citation needed] The influence of dimerization in noise propagation is hardly touched due to the difficulty in controlling experiment variables. Synthetic biology provides powerful tools to carry out experiments otherwise impossible in designed systems. This is exactly what we do.
Traditionally, we evaluate the impacts of noise using variance-related statistics, such as coefficient of variance. These quantities can only describe how concentrated the output is around the mean value, but cannot tell us how well we can infer one of the correlated random variables from the other. Channel capacity makes a better criteria of noise because it more scientifically depicts the information dissemination process.

We firmly believe the diffusion and understanding of science is a huge area of opportunity in our country, this being said, we took huge responsibility on creating spaces where we could establish a public dialogue about synthetic biology, create the ability of discussing the science behind synthetic biology and mainly, create new scientific curiosity in people of all ages and races.
As a team, we didn't want what happened in the lab to stay in the lab.
We invested months of hard work into the Public and Education Engagement component of our project, accomplishing an outstanding reach of over 200,000 people through our social media impact and the different activities we conducted, such as: a National Congress of Science, an After iGEM networking event, a National Education Tour, Workshops, a video collaboration with Curiosamente (an educational youtube channel with over 1 million subscribers), articles in magazines of national reach, three national presentations in science conferences, one international presentation at GCURS at RICE University, attendance to two iGEM meetups and a college credit class: Science Seminar.
National Congress of Sciences 2018
Dates: September 14 & 15, 2018
General description
The iGEM National Congress of Science was the biggest event organized by iGEM Tec Monterrey, it reached the participation of over 200 undergraduate and graduate students who came from 18 different states of México to our university: Tec de Monterrey, Campus Monterrey.
We chose to organize and host this event because we firmly believed it was the best way we could give students like us the opportunity to learn from proficient people in specific areas such as: chemistry, nanotechnology, biotechnology, nanomedicine, synthetic biology, and sustainability.
We aimed to inspire the attendees, hoping to interest them in getting more involved with science and technology with the hopes that they will, in turn, inspire others.
The iGEM National Congress of Science was also a great learning opportunity for us. We had the chance to attend several of the conferences and workshops; but most importantly we met new people from all over Mexico with whom we were able to establish a two-way dialogue and share ideas.
Objectives:
To promote science among Mexican undergraduate and graduate students to encourage, both their personal development and the development of our country through science.
To have the opportunity to interact with the scientific community of all around our country, for understanding different points of view and perspectives about the present and future of Mexican research.
To gain a wider network of people with research related affiliations and having the opportunity"
SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html,"40 copies to allow for lag in activation. This is of course an oversimplification, but it is not a problem that activation and dormancy are defined at different levels, since the exact number of RelE molecules required to induce dormancy is unknown.
The Impact of Promoters with Different Production Rates on RelE Expression
During the implementation of RelE, gene expression was simulated for promoters with different strengths, which were chosen through an iterative process. Promoters with production rates of 3.5 and 10.5 molecules per minute, both induce dormancy rather slowly, with the latter inducing dormancy in approximately 50 minutes. In cells cloned with a promoter producing 35 molecules per minute, the cells will enter dormancy in about 10 minutes, while promoters producing 105 and 350 molecules per minute both have a negligible timeframe. In the simulated dormancy system, the three strongest promoters exhibited similar results, indicating that a certain threshold value had been transcended. This means, that not only was the gene expression disproportional to the promoter strength, but the risk of overshooting was also increased tremendously.
Figure 1. The increase of free RelE molecules in E. coli cells, after activation of the artificial RelE production, shown logarithmically. The condition for induced dormancy is an amount of free RelE molecules around tens of copies. The three highest levels of RelE production, correlating with the highest promoter strengths, show little difference in the time at which dormancy occurs. When the RelE production is set to 10.5 molecules per minute, dormancy is induced more slowly and stabilises at lower concentrations. The lowest RelE production value does not trigger dormancy, and has only little effect on the system.
RelB is Required for Activation of Bacteria after Dormant State
If RelB was not expressed, the bacteria remained dormant for hours after RelE production had ceased, making it clear, that production of the antitoxin RelB was necessary for activation. Considering the stability of RelE in non-growing conditions, it was not surprising to find that RelB production would be the primary element in sequestering free RelE.
Figure 2. The logarithmic plots shows that the decrease in free RelE in dormant bacteria is low without artificial expression of RelB. None of the simulated bacteria reentered an active state within the modelled time.
Appropriate Ratio of RelE and RelB Expression is Essential
Different expression rates of RelB were combined with production rates of RelE at 35 and 100 molecules per minute, corresponding to relatively medium and strong expression levels"
