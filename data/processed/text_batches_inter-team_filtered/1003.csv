Finally, we used a syringe to draw a line with each ink across Whatman paper (Figure 4). The acetone based inks were more prone to bleeding than the water based inks. The water extraction of the cranberry tablets yielded a more vibrant colour on paper than the acetone extraction, and the water extraction of lutein/zeaxanthin was more uniform in colour an darker than the acetone extraction.
Figure 4. Demonstration of the inks application to Whatman paper.
Using the ink in old fountain pens was attempted, but we found contamination with previously used ink in the pens were interfering with our results. The creation of our ink for use in fountain pens does not need to be as precise in terms of viscosity as it would need to be for printers. This is because there are no mechanical or moving parts or significant movement of ink within the pen, all we need is for the ink to be able to come out while keeping the amount of solvent as low as possible to prevent bleeding of the ink. This allows us to just attempt a few proportions of pigment, resin, and solvent for the pens.
Quality Control of Ink
After our interview with Dave Warwick of Warwick Printing in our hometown Lethbridge AB, he raised a few questions about the quality of products he uses. He stated that a few of the qualities a consumer is looking for in ink are: consistency in color, a variety of colors, lack of bleeding and bleaching, and the cost. For more information concerning the Warwick tour and interview, click here . We intend to solve or address all of these qualities and hopefully surpass the existing inks in any and/or all of them. For the consistency of color, we intend to make sure that we have added the correct proportions of pigment to resin to solvent and to mix thoroughly to ensure an even spread of all substances in any amount of ink. For color variety, we addressed this issue in our research, we have made pigments that correspond to the CMYK in any color printer. CMYK stands for cyan, magenta, yellow and black and these four colors can make any color in existence. To address bleeding we will be testing our produced ink on many substrates to ensure that the volatile solvent evaporates before the ink can bleed through the substrate, and if there are any problems we will need to change the proportions of our ink. For bleaching we will test our pigments against current inks"

Bisphenol A degradation
Sequencing results
The iGEM team from the University of Alberta sent in BioBricks for BPA degradation in 2008 (<partinfo>K123000</partinfo> and <partinfo>K123001</partinfo>). Sequencing of these BioBricks by the iGEM HQ and by us led to negative results so the sequences entered into the partsregistry are not correct although these sequences are the ones from Sphingomonas bisphenolicum AO1 (compare genbank entry ). In addition, there are ""illegal"" AgeI and NgoMIV restriction sites in the BioBrick which are used for Freiburg BioBrick assembly standard ( RFC 25 ). After translating and comparing the original sequences from the partsregistry and the sequences from our sequencing results in silico we saw, that the amino acid sequences were identically. These BioBricks were probably synthesized in the Freiburg assembly standard 25 because they have the accordant restriction sites and they were codon optimized for Escherichia coli but the original sequence from S. bisphenolicum AO1 were entered into the registry because amino acid sequence of the real sequence and the sequence that was entered are identical. The alignments are shown in fig. 1 - 4.

TD: What do you think are the advantages of co-cultures and co-cultivation in general?
Sh: I think co-culture and co-cultivation approaches can give us a lot more information about bacterial behavior than isolation based techniques. By culturing bacteria with other organisms we introduce a factor in its environment that can result in a number of reactions or interactions, both positive and negative. Hence such techniques can lead to novel compounds being produced by the involved bacteria.
TD: Thank you very much, for your precious advice and time. You helped us a lot!"

Nobody can do science on their own, so collaborating is a necessity. We had a lot of contact with the other Dutch iGEM teams, via e-mail and at the different meet-ups we attended. Our biggest collaboration is with the team from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, with whom we had a lot of contact in the past months. Furthermore we attended three international meet-ups, in Delft, Wageningen and Leuven, where we had a lot of good conversations about science, iGEM and life.
Collaborate
University of Nebraska-Lincoln
After the UNL iGEM sent around there iGEM survey, The Amsterdam team and the UNL iGEM team got into contact about combining their knowledge and explore the possibilities of a combined future application of their projects.  In this collaboration, the UNL iGEM team and the Amsterdam iGEM team joined forces to come up with a way to reduce methane emissions. Methane emissions have a huge impact on climate change. iGEM team UNL and iGEM team Amsterdam explored the possibilities of feeding fumarate to cattle, in order to reduce methane emissions. We can conclude that fumarate seems a promising molecule for this application. However, since the literature about the possible effect of fumarate is not consistent, the physiology of cattle opposes some challenges and the maximum fumarate yields in certain organisms under our specific conditions are not yet defined.  Actual empirical research must show if this promising route can lead to lower methane emissions and a more sustainable world!

Introduction
In this collaboration, we combine the knowledge on genetic engineering to produce fumarate (team iGEM Amsterdam) and the knowledge on the possible impact of fumarate on cattle physiology (team iGEM UNL). Together, we explore the possibilities of using microorganisms to produce fumarate in cattle intestine, to reduce methane emissions by cattle. We explore the possibilities of ways to deliver fumarate in the cow digestive system and the hurdles to overcome with these strategies. As iGEM UNL"

Biobrick alcohol acetyltransferase, which catalyzes the conversion of butanol or 2-methylbutanol to butyl acetate, was successfully transformed. The corresponding plasmids were purified and the gene was amplified via PCR.
July 8-12
The 35s promoter, NOS terminator and HCHL gene were double digested. The HCHL gene was successfully ligated to the NOS terminator. When run on an electrophoresis gel, a ~ 950 base pair was observed. A pure HCHL gene was also run as a control and the ligated band was clearly bigger than the control.
July 15-19
The construct of containing the HCHL gene and NOS terminator was amplified via PCR.  This construct was successfully ligated with the 35s promoter. When run on an electrophoresis gel, a ~ 1500 band was observed.
July 22-26
The construct of the 35s promoter, NOS terminator and HCHL gene was amplified via PCR using forward primer of 35s promoter and reverse primer of NOS terminator. An electrophoresis gel confirmed the successful amplification of the construct, proving that our ~1500 band is our desired construct.
July 29 – August 2
Attempted to ligated construct containing the 35s promoter, HCHL gene and NOS terminator in pCambia p1281z and p1201 vectors. Later transformed into competent cells.  No colonies were observed.

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Podiumsdiskussion mit Dr. Strittmatter, Dr. Deplazes-Zemp, Erik Schliep, Herrn Karberg und Prof. Bölker (von links nach rechts)
Hauptpunkte der Podiumsdiskussion:
Das Internet ist die Hauptquelle, um Informationen über Synthetische Biologie zu erhalten, aber Medien haben einen starken Einfluss den Fokus auf dieses Thema zu lenken. Häufig haben Artikel provokative Überschriften.
Synthetische Biologie ist in der Gesellschaft noch nicht sehr bekannt, daher wollen Leute auch nicht mehr Informationen, aber Leute mit direkten Kontakt (z.B. Bauern) erhalten gute Unterstützung.
In Deutschland gibt es noch kein Bedürfnis nach genetisch verändertem Getreide. Firmen, wie die KWS, akzeptieren diese Ansicht.
Genetisch veränderte Medikamente sind akzeptierter als genetisch verändertes Getreide, weil keiner in Europa hungern muss, aber Medikamente eine wichtigere Rolle spielen.
Ein Label ""mit Gentechnik"" auf Produkte sollte nur in die Praxis umgesetzt werden, wenn...
.... Leute diese Kennzeichnung wirklich wollen.
.... die Produkte reelle Risiken darstellen, ansonsten würde eine weitere Kennzeichnung in einen Zertifikatsdschungel führen.
Es sollte nicht nur eine Kennzeichnung geben, um die Produkte zu brandmarken, sondern wirklich eine Gefahr bestehen, wenn dieses Symbol angewendet wird.
Produkte sollten dann aber auch mit einem Label ""mit Pestiziden"" gekennzeichnet werden, weil diese gefährlicher sind.
Es ist nicht jedem möglich, toxische Gene zu bestellen, weil die DNA-Synthese-Firmen ihre Kunden kontrollieren.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
First,
Prepare DM minimal medium with ammonium chloride as a nitrogen source.  Add 0.745 g NH4Cl to 1L of prepared DM medium.
Start overnight cultures.
Prepare test solutions for ammonium, nitrite and nitrate kits.
Label eppendorf tubes and test tubes for colorimetric samples.
Grow E. coli top10 overnight/ P. aeruginosa in 10mL of DM medium + NH4Cl prepared in step 1 at 37oC.
Take 4mL of E. coli/P. aeruginosa overnight culture and add to 200mL fresh DM medium + NH4Cl.
Grow the cells at 37oC in 200 RPM until OD=0.35 (about 3 hours; about 5 hours for P. aeruginosa).
Pellet down the 200mL culture, 3000g for 4 min (Cool down the centrifuge if it is needed for 30 min at 4oC).
Wash with 5 ml cold Modified DM minimal medium and centrifuge again.
Pour off the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 200mL Modified DM Minimal medium in a centrifuge tube and pour samples together if they were made in more than one tube.
Measure OD of the 200 mL cell suspension and add Modified DM minimal medium until OD=0.3 (note the exact value).
Pure the 200 mL of the OD=0.3 suspension to a bottle.  This is the experimental flask.
For the control: Remove one aliquot of 200mL of DM medium (without the added NH4Cl).
Make the anaerobic experiment by saturating with pure N2 following the Sparging with N2 method , for 5 min the nitrite stock solution and 10 min the cell suspensions and control.
Start the experiment by adjusting the NO and N2O electrodes in one flask at a time.
Put the flask on the magnetic stirrer and start with 270 rpm at 37oC.
Remove 2 mL as the first sample t=0 colorimetric analysis.
Add 0.5 mL of 50mM nitrite stock solution to 100 ml of the cell suspension.
Watch the concentrations of NO and N2O, and continue adding nitrite when they are not changing (about 10 min).

Even with contamination, we can tell that most of the plates formed plaques at -6. To verify this result we will further dilute the samples and perform another spot test.
4) Spot test to determine phage concentration
Experiments in LB produced a much higher titer of phage as compared to M9. This could be due to phage death during mutagenesis or its storage in the fridge. But for the CsCl gradient to work we need a higher titer of phage, at least 108 pfu/mL. Thus we'll use LB from now on.
VI) Conclusion
The purpose of this experiment was the determine whether M9 of LB will better support the mutagenesis of phage. Although we predicted that the M9 would be a better choice, considering phage concentration, we will have to use LB instead.
The second purpose of this experiment was to generate mutagenized phage for the phage purification team. Their experiments this time did not go so well, thus we will proceed with 8.14 Mutagen Concentration Test - Seventh Protocol to produce more phage for them to work with.

And this is our basic idea to propose a new way to identify reaction parameters by means of system identification and reverse engineering.
Choose a reaction network contaning the desired interaction parameters. Note that the reactants and products must exist in databse constructed above.
Search substances to find all possible reactions in the bio-network.
For each substance, every reaction will contribute none or one term of interaction at the right end of the ODE equation concerning this substance with respect to reaction's type recorded in reaction database.
Build up the ODE array to fully describe the reaction network.
Identify parameters of every term in the ODE array with accordance to the experimental data of the time course of the network's all substances' concentration. Algorithm might involve classical system identification and reverse engineering.
The identified parameters, if fall in between acceptable error region after repeated identifications, can be accepted as a standard parameter of coressponding substance.

With PKU
All experiments were conducted at Peking University with team PKU. Team members from Peking University provided us many beneficial suggestions on experiment designing, inspiring us to solve problems. Without their help, we would not be able to complete all of our experiments with the same efficiency.
With UCAS
We lent the lab shaker to team UCAS since our campuses are very close to each other.
With SHSBNU_China
We shared our unique E. coli strain, E. coli Nissle 1917, with team SHSBNU_China, enabling them to realize their test in human gut.
Special Thanks
There are many institutes and people that helped us overcome many obstacles.
The microbiology technology company, Bluepha, has provided us technical support. Especially Haoqian Zhang, Bluepha’s CTO, leads us to a more mature circuit design as well as a logical presentation. He also lent us a HPLC though we did not use it to measure the final result.
National Institute of Metrology lent us the Amino Acid Analyzer that allowed us to measure the concentration of GABA. Their instructions enabled us to measure GABA with higher precision and efficiency.
Mr. Kai Sheng Hee from NUS Synthetic Biology for Clinical and Technological Innovation (SynCTI) shared us E. coli Nissle 1917, which is our main chassis.
Yan Wang from Maryland University helped us with illustrating icons.
Tsing Hua University Laboratory of Structural Biology helped us with our induction, ultrasound bacteria lysis, protein purification, SDS-PAGE and most of the protein-related process.
Our instructors, Miss Xiaoling Yao, Dr. David Brackett, Dr. Ruoting Tao, and Mr. Yihao Zhang have given us many great suggestions on project design. Mr. Zhang helped us specially on experiment conduction and problem solving. Dr. Brackett proofed read all of our wiki contents and helped us with academic writing. Miss Yao and Dr. Tao gave us many suggestions on our presentation.
We are also thankful for School TV Station and Imaginist, the school magazine for facilitating us promoting iGEM and our team.

-I left the plates in overnight to allow them to grow up
-Helped Garrett prepare for the intial CRISPR tests
September 8, Michael Abboud
Ran the last sewing PCR reactions on gel.  The purified, low-melt cut-out did not produce enough DNA for subsequent sewing PCR reactions. Therefore, sewing PCR reactions will directly serve as the primer for the next reaction without running on low-melt gel or purification.
Michael Linzey 9/9/14
-I used the plasmid purification kit to extract the mutated plasmid
-I prepared a sequencing test so we could see if a mutation had taken place

Sewing PCR: Primer #3 added to Product #4,5,6 from original batch (did not go through low-melt and purified).
- Garrett Jensen. 9/10/2014
- On Monday we decided to focus on testing the effectiveness of our CRISPR system as well as performing mutagenesis of our CRISPR so that we can submit it to the iGEM registry. These are our priorities as we have to submit the part to iGEM by mid october.
- Today we performed a 1:10 serial dilution of E coli phage T7 out to 10e-8. We will use this on Wednesday to test the effectiveness of our CRISPR system in E. coli. We are not completely sure if T7 will infect E coli Dh5a so"

Paris_Saclay,2015,Team:Paris Saclay#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," last year iGEM Paris-Saclay 2014 project. We decided to continue the story by creating a sculpture made by the 2015 iGEM Paris-Saclay team in collaboration with the sculptor Pascal Masi . The project of the iGEM Paris-Saclay team 2014 aims to create reflexion around the following questions:
What will you eat in 50 years?
How could synthetic biology change your way of thinking about the living?
Moreover the iGEM exhibition presents synthetic biology and invites public to explore the new frontiers of living. We have planned an interactive installation made by seven posters designed by the 2015 iGEM Paris-Saclay team: describing history, principal and functional applications of synthetic biology.
Also in collaboration with Fablab Digiscop , we printed a set of 3D Biobricks Legos composed of a promotor, a coding sequence and a terminator.
To complete our eye-catching exhibition, a video will be available. These short movies present key moments extracted from several interviews made by our team in Paris. The video first shows people’s reflexion about what synthetic biology could be used for and then what ethical issues they think it raises. This is a good way to simplify and integrate concepts of biology engineering and make it accessible to the targeted public of this festival: families, children, youths, students, scientists and artists and all those who want to discover this original project that push the boundaries of art and science.
iGEM Community
6th July - Meet up iGEM Pasteur
Attending the Parisian meetup hosted by iGEM Pasteur team, was an opportunity to interact with members of the Parisian teams. The presentations on the different iGEM 2015 projects, although not yet fully accomplished at that time, were sufficient to understand the origin, reflexion, and main challenges of each project conducted by the involved teams ( Ionis , Evry , Paris-Bettencourt , and Paris-Pasteur ). Additionally, since the meet-up took place at Pasteur Institute, we visited the Pasteur Museum and the house of Louis Pasteur which brought us an overview about his main contributions to biology. Finally we had a funny extra collaboration with Ionis iGEM team: they filmed a short video in which we presented the main lines around our SafetE.coli project.

The Voyages of Plasmo, Molecular Defender
×
It can be difficult to get kids and teens excited for science. Whether it be chemistry, biology, physics     or any other class on the physical world, kids just don’t look forward to learning about those topics. Our     team sought out to change this perspective. What better way than through an action-packed comic?
Everything in biology relates to one idea; the Central Dogma, as it is often called. Put simply, this is the idea     that DNA turns into RNA, and RNA turns into Proteins. This idea is drilled into school-aged individuals from middle     school up until college. So we aimed to center our comic around this idea in hope of making it a little less complex,     and a lot more exciting.
Two members of our team tackled this project: Kyleakin Helm wrote the script for the comic. She created the     story and brought the characters to life. Katherine Amick created the character concepts and began drawing the     comic itself. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, the comic was not finished. Because the script is     complete, the team hopes to get the comic moving again for next year.
Summary: Plasmo is an up and coming scientist. He wants to be apart of the Synthetic Biology world, but he must first understand the basics to work up to that. He gets shipped to a faraway world to learn about Replication, Transcription, and Translation. He is guided around the world to view all the different components that go into the Central Dogma Process. Along the way he meets a variety of characters (such as Modus: Creator of Phosphodiester Bonds, Clyde: The Director of the Cell and Primasero: The Great Base Pair Salesman), encounters epic battles between the DNA and the RNA world, and learns to fully appreciate how much time and effort is put into the Central Dogma Process.

We take the diffusion rate for AHL equal to 0.23 1/s. For leucine we make a difference between inward and outward diffusion. Since leucine is an amino acid, a cell does not want to lose its leucine but it will want to take leucine in. Inward diffusion is thus facilitated by transporters, so we choose this value to be the largest. The inward diffusion rate is estimated at 0.05 1/s and the outward diffusion 0.0005 1/s.

System
After this extensive literature search, we can finally set up our complete system of ODEs for every cell.
Cell A
The designed circuit in cell A is under control of a temperature sensitive cI repressor. Upon raising the temperature, cI will dissociate from the promoter and the circuit is activated. This leads to the initiation of the production of LuxR and LuxI. LuxI will consecutively produce AHL, which binds with LuxR. The newly formed complex will then activate the production of leucine and Ag43. Leucine and AHL are also able to diffuse out of the cell into the medium. Ag43 is the adhesine which aids the aggregation of cells A, while leucine and AHL are necessary to repel cells B.

The research done with iGEM has been a great learning experience for me, as synthetic biology is not a research field I have focused on before. I think it is very important to gain insight into different areas of science, and feel that iGEM has greatly contributed to this.  I am very happy I got the opportunity to participate in the 2014 iGEM competition.

I started my research in a laboratory at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand with Professor Julian Eaton-Rye and Associate Professor Martin Hohmann-Marriott. I completed of my Master of Science degree in 2012 in the field of Biochemistry, focusing on renewable energy studies in photosynthetic organisms. I then moved to Trondheim, Norway to undertake a Ph.D. research fellowship under the supervision of Associate Professor Martin Hohmann-Marriott in the department of Biotechnology, at NTNU. My Ph.D. research looks at using cyanobacteria (and other photosynthetic organisms) as a source of energy/biofuels.
As a consequence, this iGEM project our team has undertaken is of up-most interest for me personally, as I believe that photosynthesis holds the solution to a lot of the problems our society will face in the coming years.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Parts Improvement_-_-_TEXT.html,"592023 and BBa_K592024 . However, we discovered that they did not put a terminator after the mTagBFP CDS. We wondered if the observed fluorescence outputs will be different with versus without a terminator. Therefore, we decided to perform an experiment for comparison. The experimental results showed that the observed fluorescence levels were lower without a terminator.
Given our results, we would like to caution future users in referencing the relative promoter strengths reported by Uppsala Sweden 2011, as their measured expression levels, generated by parts without a terminator, may not fully represent the true strength of the tested promoters.
THE INVESTIGATION
We hypothesized that the expression level of mTagBFP is affected by the presence or absence of a terminator.
An experimental construct was built where the mTagBFP generator ( BBa_K592100 ) was driven by a constitutive promoter (BBa_J23101) and a medium RBS (BBa_B0032). It was compared against its counterpart which harbored a terminator, BBa_B1006 3’ to the CDS. Constructs without promoters served as controls for auto-fluorescence. We then performed the same experiment but used BBa_B0034 as the RBS instead. Both of the results showed that the observed blue fluorescence outputs were lower when the transcription was not properly terminated.
Figure 1. Comparison of the expression levels of a BFP generator with and without a terminator. (a) Circuit diagram illustrates experimental setup of the experiment harboring BBa_B0032. (b) Experimental results of the experiment harboring BBa_B0032.(c) Circuit diagram illustrates experimental setup of the experiment harboring BBa_B0034. (d) Experimental results of the experiment harboring BBa_B0034. Error bars represent SEM of 3 independent experiments on 3 different days.
Our results indicated that the proper expression of mTagBFP requires a terminator; thus the previously submitted part BBa_K592023 (BBa_B0032-BBa_K592100) and BBa_K592024 (BBa_B0032-BBa_K592100) are translational units only and should not be considered as acceptable alternatives to mTagBFP generators, which have terminators.
In this experiment, we have improved BBa_K592023 (BBa_B0032-BBa_K592100) and BBa_K592024 (BBa_B0034-BBa_K592100) by adding a terminator BBa_B1006 3’ to these parts. Both of the improved parts, BBa_K1899001 ("

Very irregular band sizes in the ""lower"" region, making no sense. Sizes not at all corresponding to what was expected.
Higher up very regular bands. This is even more puzzling, since different primer pairs were used for each PCR reaction. Although concentration of plasmid should be too low, the bands seen may be undigested and digested N-CPP plasmid. A too large plasmid concentration may in turn be the cause of the unspecific bands seen lower down in the gel.

As the polymerase is temperature sensitive it should only be removed from the freezer for short periods of time, therefore add the polymerase as the final part of your mastermix. When the polymerase have been added to your mastermix, it is important to keep the mastermix on ice. When the mastermix is complete it should be mixed thoroughly by pipetting, not by vortexing since this can ruin the polymerase. The mastermix is aliquoted to individual PCR tubes and the tubes are transferred to a thermo cycler. The annealing temperature should be 5 °C below the melting temperature (Tm) of the primers, this step can be tricky as most Tm predictors tend to disagree. Depending on the polymerase used the elongation time should be 30 seconds per kb of the longest expected fragment. All the primers used in our experimental work, together with their sequences and assigned names, are listed here .
Plasmid Purification
Plasmids were purified from a 2 mL LB culture with the antibiotic that is used as the plasmid’s selection marker, grown at 350 rpm and 37 °C overnight. Good aeration is important for obtaining high plasmid concentrations, so tube inclination should optimally be 45 °. The purification was done with a Zymo Zyppy Plasmid Miniprep Kit, by following the manufacturer’s manual.
Preparation of Competent Cells
2 mL LB is inoculated with cells from a single colony and incubated at 37 °C O/N at 350 rpm
200 mL of preheated (37 °C) LB is inoculated with 10 ul culture from step 1 in a shake flask and incubated at 37 °C and 350 rpm until OD 600 reaches 0.3 - 0.6
When OD600 reaches 0.3 - 0.6 the shake flask is chilled in an ice-bath until the culture is completely cooled. All steps from here should be kept as cold as possible.

There are 15 student members, 5 instructors and 2 advisors in our team SCUT Champion Park. At first, we didn't think that our team would be so large, but with more and more talents join us, we are almost able to set up a company.
Our operating model is designed to deliver faster decisions. Each of us has clear duties and tasks. The 15 student members are divided into three big groups, and they are experimental group, social practice group, visual design group.
There are 6 members in the experimental group. Tao Deng is the group leader. The experimental group still divide into two smaller groups, core experimental group and biobrick group based on their experiments.
Social practice group has 3 students. Each member is a project manager for two to four projects. As the manager of these projects, they collect data, make plans and are primarily responsible for their own projects.
There are 5 members in the visual design group. Three are responsible for art and two are responsible for program design. Yuyu Tang is the leader of the visual design group. When other groups have accomplished some work, they summarize it and send it to Yuyu Tang. Then the designers will design these materials and the programmers will make them into web pages.
Jin Jia is the leader of SCUT Champion Park. He participates in all the parts of the total work and ensure them work well.

This is what Nelly did for the whole day: Check this out . She tried to organize all the models she had on file into a document. Hopefully it is easier to navigate in this format. She also uploaded all the codes, functions, scripts etc. She uploaded it in a folder under Patch Modelling.
Followed up with Dr. Nezhad because he has not responded for 6 days.
Finished first draft of the powerpoint about our project. Check *presentation under *device for it.
Tiffany talked to Dr. Mayi concerning optimizing the diffusion assay
Instead of an eight hour interval of taking the sample, we will run the project over a seven day period, taking samples at 24 hour period to mimic the patch.
As well, we are now measuring the the optical densities over a spectrum as no literature points to a wavelength for saline solution/distilled water
Wednesday, July 20th
Tiffany continued working on the diffusion assay and got initial results to determine the wavelength needed to determine the optical density of saline solution
The falcon tubes containing LB, B. subtiliis and E.coli were removed from the saline solution
Saline solution was used as a blank
Wavelengths of 260 nm, 300 nm, 600 nm, and 700 nm were used to measure the absorbance of the saline solutions contained in the erlenmeyer flask

Went to the machine shop to see if they can help us manufacture patches for prototype testing.
Although they were not super clear about what we wanted initially they figured out the basics of what we needed from them
They took care of 3D printing for free for us as we are a student based project and they resolved the issues for us
Tiffany is in contact with them and will hear back from them in a couple of days
In addition, we learned that the machine shop cannot manufacture the patch. What they do recommend is the easiest way would be to proceed with something similar to the thermoforming method
About the thermofolding method
Suggested we cast a mold that they can help us design using metal. The mold would consist of two parts for the backing layer and the semipermeable membrane
We would then heat our materials and lay them onto the molds to conform to their shape. From there we place the molds together and inject our media into the mold and heat seal the entire patch together
Unfortunately they can only help us with the mold. They"

Nowadays, fermentation industry is crucial for a country’s economy. In China, fermentation industry output reached 2,000 billion RMB in 2011, and till 2013, this number has increased to 3,000 billion RMB.(Figure 1.) Fermentation industry’s output accounts for about 3 percentage of GDP in China, and it’s predicted that the output will reach 10,000 billion at the end of 2015. As a result, optimizing fermentation process and improve productivity is important
However, problems concerning fluctuation of pH in fermentation is usually knotty. Firstly, enzymes produced by microorganisms can be tremendously influenced by environmental pH. The activity of enzyme will plummet at an improper pH, and eventually the fermentation effectiveness will decrease. Worse still, different pH can entirely change a microorganism’s fermentation products. For example, Aspergillus niger can produce citric acid at pH 2.0~3.0, while the product will be changed to oxalic acid at pH 6.5~7.5. As for corynebacterium glutamicum, the product is glutamate at pH 7.0~8.0 while at pH 5.0~5.8 the products are Glutamine and N-aceglutamide. Therefore, a suitable environmental pH is a key factor for higher fermentation productivity.

To maintain fermentation pH range, people have found some methods to regulate the pH of fermentation liquor, such as probe detection technique combined with computer programs, and adding acid and alkali into fermenters straightly. However, environmental interference can strongly interrupt probe detection, and increase reaction time. What’s more, adding large amount of acid and alkali may cause unbalance pH in different areas in fermenter. Those problems will decrease fermentation productivity and effectiveness. More importantly, all of these methods which heavily rely on electrical technology will increase factories' costs and energy consumption, but none of them considered function of microorganisms themselves.

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," found that I really enjoyed working on the mathematical modelling and presentations for our project. After high school, I want to study aerospace engineering at MIT and become an astronaut. When I have free time, I like to read books, play soccer, and fly airplanes. I’m also an intern at Amino Laboratories, a local biotech company.

Sydnee Calhoun
Undergraduate
Hi, my name is Sydnee and I am a fourth year biochemistry student at the University of Lethbridge. I will be finishing my B.Sc. in the fall and applying for genetic counselling programs.  This is my third year advising the high school iGEM team. I love the opportunities and experiences that iGEM can give to students while they are still in high school. I have always enjoyed conducting human practices work and I think it is important for our students to understand the implications that their work can have on society. Outside of iGEM, I enjoy coffee, hanging out with my friends, working in the lab, and coffee.
Chris Isaac
Graduate
I joined iGEM in 2012 to take a chance on something new. Since then, I’ve had the pleasure of continuing to participate, mentor, and explore new ideas in synthetic biology. The best part of iGEM is the ability to engage in a meaningful multidisciplinary project and develop solutions to emerging challenges. In the future, I want to be able to bridge the worlds synthetic biology and public policy to make sure that we do the most good possible at the least cost.
Erin Kelly
Graduate
My first High School iGEM experience was actually when I was in grade 12 and participated on the Lethbridge High School iGEM team in 2012. I then went on to be an advisor to the high school team in 2013 when I started my undergraduate program. I am excited to be back instructing HS iGEM again! My favourite part about iGEM is designing genetic constructs because these molecular biology systems are so elegant. I am pursuing my MD and have completed my MSc, and hopefully maintain an emphasis on biomedical research and engineering.
Luke Saville
Undergraduate
My name is Luke Saville and I am from Calgary, AB. I have just completed my second year as a biochemistry major at the University of Lethbridge. I also do RNA based research at the University of Lethbridge.  I joined iGEM because it seems like a good way to be surrounded by cutting edge science that is constantly growing.

Transformation of endophytic bacteria
After a series of transformation attempts, a transformation protocol was developed which could be consistently used. About 25-50% of colonies on later plates are transformants.

Plant persistence tests
A key test of the effectiveness of an endophyte to impact its host if the endophyte can persist in and on the plant. FCP2-01 was isolated from the roots, and therefore we examined ability for the endophyte to inhabit the roots of Brachypodium distachyon. Seeds were inoculated by submerging in bacterial culture, then grown axenically in glass culture tubes in a growth chamber. Confocal micrographs were acquired at intervals of 1 week for 1-5 weeks post-inoculation. Bacteria were observed on roots at weeks 3 and 4 most clearly, but overwatering may have been responsible for no visible colonies in week 5.

Aim Grow the cellulosome-strains on cotton
Common cotton pads were purchased from a local supermarket and 20 mg cotton was weighed and transferred into glass tubes. The tubes were subsequently autoclaved.
Glass tubes with 2%, 0,2%, 0,02%, 0,002% and 0,0002% galactose were prepared. Both with and without the cotton. 10 ml of Verduyn medium (supplemented with the appropriate vitamins, trace elements and with uracil) was added to each tube. As a positive control, LB and E. coli bacteria were added to a glass tube containing cotton, to exclude non-growth because of chemicals in the cotton pads. Also, Verduyn medium containing 2% glucose was added to one of the glass tubes with cotton, to ensure viability of the yeast strains.
Colonies of CB1883 and CB1882 were taken from the plate and inoculated into the tubes. The cultures were incubated at 30℃, 150 rpm.
Results Growth in both positive controls, no growth in the remaining tubes.

The iGEM York Cell
Since the iGEM Team York_UK is also doing work related to microbial fuel cells this year, we offered to send them one of our fuel cells to conduct their experiments in. Our design did not fully meet their requirements, especially since it was too large. After consulting with two of their team members, we constructed a small fuel cell based on the 3rd generation design and sent it to York.
Figure 13: The Fuel Cell designed for the iGEM Team York.
Dimensions per chamber:
height: 25mm
width: 25mm
depth: 12 mm
volume: 7,5 mL
The Stack
In order to increase the power output of the fuel cell, a fuel cell stack was built based on the third generation design. It consists of alternating anode and cathode chambers, five of each, placed between two cover plates. Using copper wiring, the five chamber-pairs are connected in series. Physically, they are separated by 1 mm thick stainless steel tiles, which act as bipolar plates.
Figure 14: The Fuel Cell Stack.
Dimensions per chamber
(10 total):
height: 50mm
width: 50mm
depth: 12mm
volume: 150mL total
3D printing
To make the microbial fuel cell accessible to everyone, an additional model was developed which can be produced using a 3D printer. 3D printers are becoming more and more common and if none is available, the model can be ordered online from a 3D printing shop.
For our 3D printed microbial fuel cell it was important to apply material that does not inhibit microbial growth. To make sure this is the case, E. coli KRX was cultivated in the presence of two different kinds of plastic commonly used for 3D printing. These materials were acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA), which are both thermoplastics that become moldable when heated and return to solid once the temperature drops.
A proper material for gaskets is essential as well, so different kinds of polysiloxane were tested in the same way. The rubber gaskets used in second and third generation MFC designs were also probed.

Integrated Human Practices
As mentioned before, we developed something our team calls The Ethics Package. In this we first went to experts to discuss ethical issues of our project. Then we talked to the iGEM community in our webinars and lastly we reached out to general public in our panel discussion and lectures. Out of all these parts and our own research we compiled Ethical guidelines for iGEM teams with a list of questions that every iGEM team should answer to ethically asses their project. You can read more about our Ethics Package in our Ethics page.
Improve a previous Part or Project
This year we were working with several parts from previous iGEM projects. Most notably with Zeaxanthine strain from iGEM Slovenia 2010 (BBa_K323122) . We decided that the production was too unstable in such a large plasmid and adding more steps to it would be too risky. Therefore, we used lambda red recombeenering to add the parts into the chromosome. You can read more about this part of the project at the Zeaxanthin page.
Another improvement to a previous BioBrick is BBa_K2423008 which is an improved version of BBa_K1033112 developed by iGEM Uppsala 2013. We decided to optimize codons of the BioBrick, add His-tag linker to ensure proper folding and easier purification and to add two stop codons to make transcription smoother and more effective. You can read more in our Results page . Specific details on our improvements can also be found on our You can read more in our Improve page .
Model your project
The enzymes we identified for the crocin pathway were poorly characterized without determined structures. In addition, we were only able to find enzymatic parameters concerning one of the enzymes, UGTCs2. Via homology modeling we could draw the conclusion that UGTCs2 and CaCCD2 are monomers while CsADH2946 is a tetramer. We could also ensure that the N-terminal was facing outward from the protein and could safely put a His-tag there for purification. Furthermore, the extensive 100 ns molecular dynamics  (MD) simulation of our models verified that the models were stable in solvent and that we could further work with the models"

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.

UMaryland Mini Jamboree
On July 22, 2016, the University of Maryland (UMaryland iGEM) hosted their second annual Mid-Atlantic Mini-Jamboree. Several teams from the East coast came together to present their progress and learn from other iGEMmers. During this conference, our team was presented our progress in a fifteen minute presentation, and conducted an educational forum on the topic of biocontainment. Through this forum, we were able to teach teams about the need for and various methods of biocontainment, in addition to fielding questions about biocontainment as it related to their specific projects. The responses in the forum were extremely informative for our team in the generation of our iGEM-wide survey and addressing relevant concerns in our pamphlet."
Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Modelling#Gold Recovery_-_-_TEXT.html," the so called flux space. Maximization of a linear objective function using linear programming returns a vertex of this polytope. (from [3])
Interestingly, the constraints define polytopes in a high-dimensional space, which is usually called the flux space. One can easily prove that polytopes are convex sets, which is a property that makes them amenable to several manipulations, such as random sampling based on artificially centered hit and run algorithms [5]. These polytopes are usually represented as follows (Fig.3):
$$ S\cdot v = 0 $$ $$ v_{min} \leq v \leq v_{max} $$
where $S$ is the stoichiometric matrix, $v_{min},v_{max}$ describe lower and upper bounds of the metabolic fluxes.
As this polytope is high dimensional, methods have to be applied in order to determine probable flux distributions or to compare flux spaces corresponding to different cells or states. The usual procedure consists of the maximization of a linear objective function $c^T\ v$ subjected to the constraints defining the polytope. This concept is based on the assumption that biological systems have evolved in order to maximize a certain objective for example the growth rate of the organism. To convert this principle into linear programming the following algorithm is formulated: Maximize $c^T\ v$ in respect to the above constraints (Fig. 3). This method is usually called Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and the linear objective maximized is in most cases the so-called biomass reaction, though it can also take other forms, such as ethanol production or ATP maximization, depending on the context.
Although linear programs can be solved quickly with an optimal objective function value returned, there can exist many alternate optimal solutions, of which available solvers return only one. In order to capture this alternate solution space, flux variability analysis (FVA) can be employed [6]. In FVA, for each reaction $i$, the flux $v_i$ is maximized, then minimized, subject to the previous constraints and $c^Tv \geq s \cdot \max(c^Tv)$ with $s \in [0,1]$ and usually equal to 1.
Most of the constraint based modeling approaches have also been implemented in diverse software packages. Here, the very popular COBRA toolbox for Matlab [7] was used.

Figure 10.Three mono-colony expressed both Aeblue and amilGFP yellow chromoprotein
4.4 Attach lva/aav tag to chromoproteins
To perform a smooth color change from the combined green to the single expressed blue/yellow, we’d better shorten the half life of the chromoproteins so that it can quickly degrade after its expression is repressed.
At the beginning spy catcher and spy tag were took into consideration to solve the problem. However, it may overload the host. Then we adopted another method, adding specific oligopeptide to the c-terminal end of the chromoprotein to make it more vulnerable to the attack from endogenous tail-specific proteases. Two tails were chosen for our testing, LVA tag and AAV tag with the sequence of RPAANDENYALVA and RPAANDENYAAAV respectively (Andersen et al., 1998). Due to the time limitation, only Aeblue chromoprotein was tested. The construction was shown in

Three groups were used in experiments: AeBlue chromoprotein, AeBlue chromoprotein with AAV tag and AeBlue chromoprotein with LVA tag. Two mono-colonies were chosen from each group. 300ml LB was used to culture 6 colonies at 37 degrees Celsius for 4 hours. Then 300ul IPTG was added to induce at 16 degrees Celsius for 12 hours. The data was collected from 5 hours to 12 hours, totally 13 points. For each point, 20ml colony liquid was obtained from the 300ml LB culture. 4ml of them was used for OD measurement at 600nm and the rest 16ml was used for protein extraction.
Firstly, 16ml bacteria were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 minutes. Then the supernatant was discarded and 10ml PBS was added to resuspend the sediment. After using ultrasonic wave to break the cell, 4ml of mixture was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 5 minutes"

Overview
Mathematical modeling and experimental research are complementary to each other. We established a novel visual selection for device knocked into the genome of L. lactis. We also optimized the nisin controlled expression (NICE) system, the protein surface display system. In the NICE system, nisin was used as the food grade gene expression inducer. However, nisin is also an antibacterial peptide. A low concentration of nisin will lead to a low expression of the target protein. However, a high concentration of nisin will inhibit the growth of bacteria, which will also decrease the total expression level. To resolve the dilemma we incorporated the nisin immunity or resistant genes nisI or nsr into the NICE system. However, it is still difficult to directly determine whether our products are produced sufficiently, and to evaluate the total expression amount at the community level.
To resolve these problems, we build 4 models to predict the gene expression rate, the growth rate, the protein production and secretion rate, and the total protein expression amount at the community level under different concentrations of nisin. To help readers understand the specific theory behind our model, we also wrote notes for all the modeling techniques.At last, we expect to improve mathematical modeling to make it more convenient to use. So we collaborated with UESTC who helped us to post a visual interface of our model results on the web page. Click here to know more about the imformations.
Model 1:The Gene Expression Rate
Introduction
In order to predict the protein expression rate and amount under different nisin concentrations, we treated the bacteria in isolation, which means at the single cell level. This prediction will be incorporated into the equation to calculate the total protein amount at the community level.
Modeling
In the NICE system, the PnisZ or PnisA promoter controlled gene expression rate depends on the concentration of nisin. We try to predict the gene expression rate under different nisin concentrations. In one research, the quantitative relationship between the extracellular concentrations of nisin and the efficiency of PnisZ were measured (Guo et al., 2013). We retrieved the data (Table 1) to get a fitting equation, which will be used in the protein production model.

Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#Ontour_-_-_TEXT.html," the weekend was held.
friday afternoon was filled with talks followed by a poster session. Within the breaks we rushed to get more coffee - we were still trying to combat fatigue - and a few delicious pretzels. Later on a city tour through Munich organized by the iGEM Team Munich filled the evening. We were also able to visit the 'Hofbräuhaus' in Munich which is quite huge and was full of people laughing and having a nice time together.
The program for saturday started at 9 am with breakfast and the first talks of the day. In between breaks we were able to discuss the talks with members from other teams. During lunch break we had longer conversations with other teams and were able to network a little more.
Saturday afternoon was a little different. A few teams, including us, prepared workshops. They were in parallel with the poster session in the afternoon which is why we had to split up. Two of us led the workshop and the other two stayed at the poster and had more conversations about our project.
The workshop we prepared was about virtual cloning and the usage of the Yeast ToolKit and the CIDAR toolbox. Both are toolboxes using the MoClo cloning method and work with Golden Gate. To explain these methods and the toolboxes were the topic of our workshop. The participants had a lot of questions and we showed them using a few examples how to deal with virtual cloning, how to design the needed primers and so forth.
After the long day we finished up with another cup of coffee to stay awake in the evening hours.
On the last day we met again for breakfast and listened to some last talks and of course had a lot of conversations regarding the topics. At the end we were surprised by a video the hosting team Munich had prepared during the weekend. Also the head of the iGEM Headquarter had some motivating and interesting words to the teams in the audience. We were very impressed and thankful. During our poster sessions on friday and saturday we received new impressions from other teams and helpful comments regarding our own project. We want to to thank everyone again for the advice. The iGEM Foundation also presented us nice ideas for our project and poster which we are very thankful for as well.
All in all, this weekend was full of meeting interesting new people, socializing, talks and discussions about current topics in biology, insights on other iGEM projects, receiving opinions to our project and last but not least a lot of fun - and of course coffee.
Thank you for this amazing experience!

Meanwhile, the delivery of a new drug is challenged. To keep drug activity in the transfer process, reduce drug side effects and improvement of the target. Since European medical treatments developed more, the carrier of the drug is intended to explore more, to go to a higher level of progress.
D. Cancer
Cancer is likewise a heated topic in the Health and Medicine track. In this field, Asia leads the most entries overall, a total of 8.In other regions of the world, North America has 7 entries followed by Europe and South America each with 4 entries, while Africa has only 1 entry. The total number of projects is increasing every year. At the same time, we have conducted research on cancer. According to the corresponding estimates from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) ,the total cancer deaths in 2012 were 8.2 million (about 22,000 cancer deaths a day) – 2.9 million in economically developed countries, and 5.3 million in economically developing countries. And there were 14.1 million new cancer cases in 2012 worldwide, including 8 million occurred in economically developing countries. However, the place with more new cases does not always have higher mortality. In our opinion, the difference can be attributed to several factors. Different population densities in different regions creating the great difference of new cases. Moreover, the different levels of development between the various regions of the world which lead to non-uniform medical standards result in difference detection and treatment of cancer. What’s more, the risk of being diagnosed with cancer increases substantially with age, so there will be more newly diagnosed cancer cases in developed countries than in developing countries. According to IARC, the top3 regions have the highest incidence of cancer is Asia, Europe and North America, which fit the regional distribution of the projects.
As a matter of fact, a considerable amount of cancer can be prevented and cured. Through investigation, we found that some cancers are caused by the following factors: tobacco use and heavy alcohol consumption, overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, and/or poor nutrition. So people can change their habits to keep them. In addition, many of the cancers related to infectious agents, such as human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), could be prevented through behavioral changes and infection controlling.

Last year the breaKERs asked how we could implement our project into the real world and this year our goals for implementation have become a reality. In the previous year we have brainstormed several ways to implement our construct into the wastewater and poultry industries, finding that bioreactors are used both in water treatment as well as in the poultry industry. We realized we could utilize a containment system in order to create an environment where the bacteria can express the keratinase, the enzyme can be nurtured, and the keratin can be broken down, all in a controlled setting that allows us to ensure safety. A bioreactor by definition is an apparatus in which a biological reaction or process is carried out, and was the perfect fit. We found that the bioreactor system is an adaptable solution to all of the problems that our implementation model posed, and we could run numerous trials to alter the design before planning for implementation.
Last year while working on our construct we brainstormed potential methods for implementation, but at the time didn’t really emphasize implementation, as it fell under “future goals.” This year, we completed a lot of brainstorming and designed a prototype model.
Brainstorming
As we considered designs for our own bioreactor we researched the bioreactors that already exist in industry and took visits to our local wastewater treatments plants in Canmore and Banff. There we observed their massive bioreactors that they use for the treatment of the water, these bioreactors were able to hold gallons of liquid, enzymes, and microbes. Further research into these reactors revealed that Canmore has a pressurized filter system and Banff has a large bubble reactor.
At most plants they use so many different kinds of bacteria in the treatment of water that it seems that we could safely implement a keratinase expressing bacteria into their systems. The Canmore treatment facility used bacteria with rock and sand filtration systems, so we could easily implement a bacteria into their system, but would have to alter where to house it in our plans. The sand filters use a porous rock called biolite to house the bacteria that filter the water.  At the Banff Water Treatment Plant, they mostly use eukaryotes and not specifically bacteria, but there is nitrifying bacteria involved in their processes, so"
Exeter,2014,Team:Exeter#Regulatory Sequences_-_-_TEXT.html," system (eg. For example, it is common that we utilise dual Lac and IPTG inducible promoters in the design of gene circuits).  Our promoter construct’s incredibly simple design compared to previous teams proposes the idea that by identifying the binding site of a repressor protein, anyone could theoretically make a promoter of any level of expression strength that is responsive to any chemical stimulus found in nature, and likely many that are not.
We aim to demonstrate this future possibility through the creation of our TNT-responsive NemR-sensitive promoter. Any strong output could therefore be inhibited or, alternatively, a weakly expressed gene could have its rate of expression enhanced by identifying the correct gene sequence. Alternatively, any construct could theoretically could be made to respond to a very specific chemical signal, such as TNT. If we are able to prove that our TNT-specific promoter is successful, it will provide the proof of concept to apply this theory to millions of other chemical signals which gene circuits could be designed to be receptive to.

I began to do the characterization for CrtEBI(K274100) and CrtEBIY(K274200).
CrtEBI(K274100) and CrtEBIY(K274200) were ligated to constitutive promoter (BBa_J23103) and terminator (B0015). All the protocols followed protocols above. Unfortunately, I failed in ligating the CrtEBIY and terminator (B0015) though I did this experiment many times in different conditions. The conditions included

Formal Lab Session - 23rd July 2009
Introduction
Today we will carry out one of the last tasks remaining from our practice lab sessions - precipitating the ethanol from our DNA samples so that gel electrophoresis can be carried out. This can be seen at this link - Introductory Lab Session (23/07/09) .
Today also marks the beginning of the real lab work sessions in which the work will be directly involved in implementing our system. The first real task involves growing up E.coli cultures containing the plasmid backbone pMUTIN4, which will allow us in the near future to transfer our chosen BioBricks from the E.coli cells we are working with into Bacillus subtilis.
Another task which we have to complete is to prepare the BioBricks which are needed for our system and are found in the Spring Distributions. These include:
BBa_C0056 – cI repressor (lambda phage)
BBa_B1002 – Terminator sequence
BBa_C0077 – CinR activator
BBa_C0076 – Autoinducer synthetase
BBa_R0077 – Promoter (CinR and HSL regulated, RBS+)

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#OurSensor#Linker_-_-_TEXT.html,"/K3 coiled-coil heterodimer viewed as a cross-section based off of a similar figure created by Litowski and Hodges (2002). The peptide chain propagates into the page from the N- to the C- terminus. Hydrophobic interactions between the coils are indicated by the clear wide arrows. The intermolecular electrostatic interactions between the coils are displayed by the thin curved arrow (eg. Between Glu15 and Lys20) Letters a, b, c,and d designate the positions of IAAL repeat in the heptapeptide. The e and g positions are occupied by the charged residues.
What did we construct?
The first construct we created involved attaching the previously mentioned E coil biobrick to the fusion of heavy and light chains of ferritin. ( BBa_K1189018 , BBa_K1189037 ) (Figure 4). This construct would assemble to form a 12-subunit nanoparticle with E coils on the outside that would each bind a protein containing the respective K coil. This means we can simply attach the K coil to a protein of choice, such as a TALE in order to bind it to the ferritin scaffold ( BBa_K1189018 , BBa_K1189037 ) Therefore we constructed the respective K coil-TALE fusion constructs, BBa_K1189029 and BBa_K1189030 (Figure 5 & 6).  The ideal result of this system is that BBa_K1189029 and BBa_K1189030 will be bound to ferritin, resulting in a protein complex containing 12 TALE proteins bound to the ferritin scaffold through E/K coils. This system then allows the proteins to properly fold while at the same time allowing the ferritin nanoparticle to assemble without interference.
Figure 4. Schematic for the ferritin disubunit-E coil fusion protein ( BBa_K1189018 ).
Figure 5. Schematic of the TALE A fused to the K coil ( BBa_K1189029 ).
Figure 6. Schematic of the TALE B fused to the K coil ( BBa_K1189030 ).
So do These Coils Actually Bind?
After putting in gratuitous effort to build parts containing these coils and successfully purifying these proteins we wanted to determine if the E and K coils interacted with each other. In order to characterize coil-coil interaction we performed an immunoprecipitation (IP) assay. We built a GFP with an E coil ( BBa_K1189014 ) and we also built TALE-B with a K coil ( BB"
Newcastle,2013,Team:Newcastle#Notebook#calendar_-_-_TEXT.html,"Confirming Transforming Switch BioBrick into HBsu-(x)fp B. subtilis has Worked
Aim:
To confirm that the switch BioBrick has transformed into B. subtilis containing HBsu-(x)FP.

UCC_Ireland,2016,Team:UCC Ireland#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," drug needs to be stable at high temperatures. For this, a cold chain is required i.e. during the process of transferring the vaccines from one place to another, they are maintained at a temperature of approx four degrees celsius. However, as this can be very costly, our vaccine could be made as freeze dried powder and formulated in a capsule. It can then be transferred at ease and at a low cost.
With a disease such as Leishmaniasis, social stigma is bound to be prevalent especially, in poorly educated and traditional underdeveloped countries. Dr Acosta mentioned that in the Middle-East and Honduras, an unsafe treatment practice exists, known as Leishmaniasation. Many young girls proceed through this as cutaneous Leishmaniasis leaves a lifelong scar which is highly stigmatised, in their society. Military soldiers also go through this process, a mass experiment was carried out in the Islamic Republic of Iran during the war between Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq. This was so that the recruited soldier would be immune to the disease for the duration of their service.
During the process of research, one of our team members who is originally from Nepal discovered that Leishmaniasis is another name for the disease “Kala-azar”. It translates to Black fever as characterised by darkening of the skin. This Leishmaniasis present in Nepal is of the visceral type, due to the vector species L. donovani (which was discovered by Dr Charles Donovan whose family was originally from Cork, Ireland).
In 2005, at the World Health Assembly, Nepal along with India and Bangladesh committed to a strategy to eradicate Leishmaniasis from the 3 countries by 2015. This programme was implemented in 12 districts where the most cases of Visceral Leishmaniasis were reported.
Above: Visceral Leishmaniasis trend in Nepal from years 1994 to 2010.
Source
Leishmaniasis is prevalent at the eastern and southern (central Terai region) districts of Nepal. These districts are economically and educationally under huge disadvantage. According to the annual reports of the Nepalese Department of Health Services for the fiscal years 2014/2015, out of the 12 districts in the programme, the district of Sarlahi made up 63% (449 cases) of the overall cases in 2010 (708 cases). This was mainly the result of a mass migration from nearby villages into the suburbs. The poor waste management due to lack of knowledge is one of the key reasons of transmission of Leish"

The tripartite split-GFP is composed of two twenty amino-acids long GFP tags (GFP 10 and GFP 11) and a third complementary subsection (GFP 1-9). The tags will be fused to the two dCas9 previously quoted. A functional GFP would be formed when the tools would be close enough to allow the three split-GFP parts reunion and the fluorescence emission. This fluorescence system avoids poor folding and/or self-assembly background fluorescence. With this system, only two sgRNAs associated with their dCas9s fused to their specific GFP tags were necessary instead of nearly 30 with mundane GFP due to background fluorescence.
We designed three biobricks [Fig4] to achieve this part of the project:
BioBrick n°3: dcas9 from N.meningitidis fused to GFP-10 expressed by a constitutive promoter, a RBS and a double terminator
BioBrick n°4: dcas9 from S.thermophilus fused to GFP-11 expressed by a constitutive promoter, a RBS and a double terminator
BioBrick n°5: The third part of the GFP 1-9 expressed by a constitutive promoter, a RBS and a double terminator
The biobricks would then be inserted into pSB1C3 by digestion/ligation using the restriction sites EcoRI and PstI.
Fig 4: Biobrick designs for the visualization tool. Scheme for the three biobricks corresponding to the visualization tool. The three biobricks have the same promoter, RBS and terminators. dCas9 from Nesseria meningitidis is fused to GFP10 and dCas9 from Streptococcus thermophilus is fused to GFP11.
Then, we considered to establish a composite biobrick composed of the three biobricks in the same pSB1C3 plasmid (cf Fig5). This plasmid would have been build using the iGEM restriction site technique.
Fig 5: Visualization tool mechanism. Tripartite split-GFP allows fluorescence only if the three parts are maintain close enough.
We chose to express sgRNAs on another plasmid pZA11 (cf Fig6) which is compatible with pSB1C3, as it is resistant to ampicilin and do not have the same replication origin.

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.

How the collaboration was formed
In the beginning of July, we arranged a social event with the other Danish iGEM teams; Copenhagen and DTU-Denmark. The Technical University of Denmark and the University of Copenhagen are geographically located close to each other. At this event each team presented the outline of their project followed by feedback and discussions. The gathering was very rewarding and productive, and it resulted in an excellent collaboration with the team from Copenhagen University.
The project idea of the Copenhagen Team
The Copenhagen team has two interesting and ambitious project ideas.
One project focuses on removing pollutants derived from pharmaceuticals and personal care products from water. The idea is to introduce different types of membrane bound human cytochrome P450's (CYP) into E. coli and following investigate if the cytochromes have an impeding effect on the estrogen level in water.
The second project focuses on a biological system that utilizes cytochrome P450 79's from plants to produce small molecules called oximes, which inhibit mitochondrial peroxidases in fungi. The system is intended to be introduced into E. coli, which would be able to inhibit the capability of the fungi to break down the hydrogen peroxides. Thus E. coli would be able to kill the fungi.
The collaboration
As is often the case with eukaryotic gene sequences, the CYP sequences from humans and plants contained numerous illegal restriction sites according to the Standard Assembly of BioBricks.
This is generally a big problem when working with DNA sequences originating from plants, fungi and mammalian cells. The Copenhagen team had some problems with acquiring sequence information of the human CYP's, which unfortunately delayed their cool project. Furthermore, the elimination of the illegal restriction sites by site-directed mutagenesis caused a"

In the next step, the preliminary products cellubiose from the first layer would diffuse to the middle layer of Sugarfilm due to concentration gradient. Beta-glucosidase BglX (from Cytophaga hutchinsonii, BBa_K118028 , iGEM08_Edinburgh) expressed in the middle layer would now work to degrade the disaccharide into glucoses. As the simplest saccharide and the starter substrate of many synthesizing pathways, glucose can diffuse to the upper layer of Sugarfilm and set off the last step of the reaction system.
The upper layer of Sugarfilm is capable of being designed to host any synthesizing pathway starting from glucose. Except for the versatility, such design can protect cells from being harmed by synthesized products detrimental to the cell. Since the procedure happens in the top layer of Sugarfilm, the undesired by-products in the system could be got rid of quickly, which would lead to death of only a small amount of cells in the biofilm, ensuring the integrity and functionality of other regions of the system.
 
Generally, with proper medium flow outside the biofilm, final products and wastes would leave the system immediately, and the continuous nutrient input provides good conditions for upper layer renewal. In ideal conditions, Sugarfilm could stick tightly to the substrate sheet surface until the whole sheet was degraded thoroughly.

Under high concentration of copper ions, bacteria significantly grow slower than that in normal water. It revealed that the high concentration of copper ion is indeed harmful to the growth of bacteria.
Figure 6.4: Growth curve of bacteria carrying vector/oprF-CBP/oprF-GS-CBP in culture environment with different Cu2+ concentration.
Contrary to our expectation, the growth of bacteria carrying oprF-CBP grew as normal as control bacteria carrying pET28a vector in Cu2+ environment. The possible reason is that fusion-expressed CBP and oprF are so close to affect the function of CBP. Without CBP capable of binding to copper ions, the E. coli carrying oprF-CBP loses its tolerance of high concentration of Cu2+. Meanwhile, the expression of heterologous protein reduces the competitive advantage of our transformant. These two mechanisms work together to result in the slow growth of E. coli carrying oprF-CBP. To cope with the problem, we added a GS-linker between oprF and CBP to reduce the spatial interaction. We were very excited to see that our method works! The growth of E. coli carrying oprF-GS-CBP is significantly and consistently better than that of E. coli carrying oprF-CBP or pET28a vector. It proves that 1) a GS-linker is necessary for the normal function of CBP when expressed as a fusion protein with oprF; 2) our oprF-GS-CBP motif can effectively increase E. coli's the tolerance of Cu2+.
 
 
Device
7. Rotating Biological Contactor (RBC)
The removal of heavy metals from diluted industrial sewage is impractical due to the inadequacy of traditional treatments (e.g. chemical precipitation and evaporation). Luckily, we have Bio-adsorption now, an alternative method that is highly efficient and produces no secondary pollution. The rotating biological contactor (RBC), which is very potent, efficient and can make good use of byproducts like sludge, is now widely used in sewage treatment. In RBC, toxic metals are sequestered and adsorbed onto biological materials, which are cheap and easy to deal with. In this way, the adsorbed metals can be recycled and the biological materials can be reused. However, traditional RBC can only be applied to domestic sewage. To expand RBC's application to industry, in our project, we redesigned and improved the traditional RBC.

Abstract
As renewable, ecologically and biologically unobjectionable energy becomes more and more important, we decided to create semiconducting biofilms for solar cell applications. Curli fibers constitute the key element, serving as a scaffold for the growth and stabilization of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide nanoparticles along these fibers. We worked on the optimization of the structure and thickness of the hybrid layers. Absorbing molecules such as organic dyes and fluorescent proteins are added to this initial system to expand the spectral range. The result of our research may pave the way to a novel class of solar panels mainly fabricated by living cells, which can lower the overall costs.
