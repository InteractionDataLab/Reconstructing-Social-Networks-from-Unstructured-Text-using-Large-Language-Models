Peking,2012,Team:Peking#HumanPractice#Review_-_-_TEXT.html," to model the core repressilator system, Edinburg 2010 inventively utilized a stochastic agent and rule-based language called Kappa. In Kappa, proteins, DNA, and RNA are represented as agents that can be used to hold state or interact with other agents. And with kappa, they are able to assimilate the oscillation of the population of bacteria and the level of proteins.

What to taste something more than traditional dynamic modeling? Paris Bettencourt 2010 showed us an outstanding example of kinetic modeling and it came along with a real-time video illustration for readers to directly understand what is going on with the diffusion process.

Only developing a set of functional beads is in itself incomplete, as the key to a useful tool is to let others characterize the beads in their own projects. And this originally developed software, BSim, is not only user-friendly, but also perfectly characterizes the behavior of their beads.

5 Meritorious Projects: Demonstration
Colors and light should always be something attractive on an iGEM competition. And the Cambridge team of 2010 and 2009 certainly understand this and take it to their advantage.
Cambridge 2009
Their 2010 work of lightening cells with different luciferases and their 2009 work of transmitting different pigments of different colors are both applicable and charming projects for the competition. A simple array of colors and lights would just tell the whole story.
Cambridge 2010
Now here goes the project of Bristol 2010. The incorporation of engineered E. coli into beads will not only extend the territory of this biobrick, but also will help with possible commercialization. The combination of field application and lab design will always remain the most exciting part of iGEM!
BCCS-Bristol 2010
What would happen when electricity meets synthetic biology? Valencia 2009 team presented a wonderful combination of electrical engineering and voltage-sensitive cells. And the idea of iLCD gives a visual impact illustrating the characteristics of their biopart and the charm of interdisciplinary research.
Valencia 2009
DNA scaffold? Aligned proteins? Is ELISA the only way to characterize its function with those boring curves and numbers? The 2010 team of Slovenia said no! Spatially related fluorescent proteins would undergo a process called Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer. And seeing the emission of fluorescence sure catches more intention then those curves, right?

RBS+nucA in pSB1C3
One approach to delete the key from the genome of B. subtilis is making   use of the nucA BioBrick ( BBa_K729004 ). The nucA is a nuclease gene which has   its origin in the genome of Staphylococcus aureus. It is capable of   digesting genetic material. The RBS is from BioBrick ( BBa_B0030 ). The   combination of these two BioBricks is the first step of achieving our nucA killswitch, which consist of the tetR repressible promoter ( BBa_R0040 ), the RBS   controlling the nucA gene ( BBa_B0030 ) and double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ).
Obtaining RBS ( BBa_B0030 ) and nucA ( BBa_K729004 )
Experiment:
01/08/16: The RBS ( BBa_B0030 ) was obtained from the part distribution 2016,    the plasmid was transformed to E. coli Top10 using this protocol . The nucA ( BBa_K729004 ) was requested from    the iGEM headquarters. Colonies from these transformations were    cultured in LB medium. Grown cultures of E. coli Top10 with RBS and nucA were used to obtain a glycerol stocks and plasmid    isolation was performed (QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit) . The concentration of the    plasmids obtained was measured on Nanodrop. The plasmids were stored at    -20°C.
Restriction digestion
Experiment:
28/09/16: On this day restriction digestion of RBS (BBa_B0030) and nucA (BBa_K729004) was performed. The backbone RBS (BBa_B0030) was    digested with SpeI and PstI. The insert nucA was digested with XbaI and    PstI.
RD mixture:
20 μl RD assay was performed according to the following protocol .
DNA Electrophoresis:
The digestion mixture of backbone RBS in pSB1C3 and insert nucA was    loaded on a gel to extract both parts. For detailed information on how    to prepare and run agarose gel see following protocol .

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"0$. And some genes that have a constitutive promoter cannot be described by Hill function. We just set their production rate to be a constant.
The translation and degradation processes in our model are based on following reaction:
For translation process, the protein production rate is proportional to the corresponding mRNA concentration $K_{tl}\cdot mRNA$. $K_{tl}$ is determined by the efficiency and concentration of ribosome, the sequence of RBS and the concentration of amino acids in the cell, which can be considered identical under the experiment condition. For degradation process, the degradation rate is proportional to the substrate. The proportion for mRNA is $K_{R}$ and the proportion for protein is $K_{P}$. So we list the following equations, \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \frac{dmRNA_{Y}}{dt}&=\beta_0+\beta_1\frac{[TF]^n}{K^n+[TF]^n}-K_{R}\cdot mRNA_{Y} \text{  (activation)}\\ \frac{dmRNA_{Y}}{dt}&=\beta_0+\beta_1\frac{K^n}{K^n+[TF]^n}-K_{R}\cdot mRNA_{Y} \text{  (repression)}\\ \frac{dY}{dt}&=K_{tl}\cdot mRNA_{Y}-K_{P}\cdot Y. \end{aligned} \end{equation}
2.2 RNA interaction
Different riboregulators have different regulation mechanisms to control the gene expression. Here what we used is a classical engineered riboregulator designed by Isaacs and his colleagues in 2004. This riboregulator can control the gene expression at post-transcription level. More details can be found in the input module section .
We describe the RNA interactions by this reaction:
which means \begin{equation} \frac{d[RNA\ duplex]}{dt}=k_2\cdot [taRNA]\cdot [crRNA]-k_{-2}\cdot [RNA\ duplex] \end{equation} This reaction is much faster than gene expression, so the equilibrium state can be reached quickly, \begin{equation} \begin{split} \frac{d[RNA\ duplex]}{dt}&=0 \\ [RNA\ duplex]_{st}&=\frac{k_2}{k_{-2}}\cdot [taRNA]\cdot [crRNA] \end{split} \end{equation}

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," for blue-white screening.
(BBa_P10500) . We appreciate the approach of using part entry plasmids with dropouts but, for two reasons, we think that LacZ is not an optimal reporter. First, blue white screening requires the two expensive chemicals
IPTG
and
X-Gal
which have to be added to the agar plates. Second, blue-white screening is restricted to E.coli strains with an incomplete laci> operon that is complemented by the LacZ alpha fragment that is expressed from the plasmid (Langley et al. 1975.) . Consequently blue white screening is not compatible with a V. natriegens wild type strain

A
sfGFP
dropout cassette is flanked by BsmBI recognition sites. During the cloning of LVL0 parts with BsmBI, this dropout cassette is replaced by the desired part
We overcame both drawbacks by replacing the LacZ alpha dropout of (BBa_P10500) by a
RFP
and
sfGFP
dropout and thus created the two parts BBa_K2560001 and BBa_K2560002 , respectively. Like (BBa_P10500) , our two new dropout parts are located in a derivative of pSB1C3 which is extended with two BsaI recognition sites. The dropout parts are flanked by BsmBI recognition sites that are required for replacing the dropout by the desired LVL0 part. The resulting LVL0 parts are classified as PhytoBricks and are
RFC
10 and
RFC
5 compatible, assuming that the part itself does not contain prohibited recognition sites. The resulting plasmids can be used to clone and store all LVL0 parts. However, for resistance parts a different approach enables more convenient LVL1 cloning. In the LVL1 golden-gate-reaction, at least eight parts are combined in a single tube together with the required enzymes. All parts, except the resistance part, are stored in the previously described pSB1C3 derivate which confers a chloramphenicol resistance. Obviously, the plasmid that provides the new resistance cassette for the LVL1 plasmid (e.g. a Cas9 plasmid with kanamycin resistance), has to contain the same resistance cassette (kanamyicin in this example). Because cloning is never 100 % efficient, re-ligation of LVL0 plasmids is a common event"

Also, we needed to design our genes that we wanted to insert in a way their products wouldn’t harm humans, and it was necessary to decide which therapeutic proteins we were going to produce as tumor toxins. From our past project and bibliographical research, we found out that the soluble part of the protein TAT-Apoptin (<a href="" http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1166005 ""target=""_blank"">BBa_K1166005</a>)was a protein that has an antitumoral activity with high specificity leaving healthy tissue in its majority unharmed. Nonetheless, the protein’s activity could be enhanced by using a survivin siRNA, which overexpressed by tumoral cells; thus, we needed to regulate the expression of it. This was accomplished by using a  hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) promoter (<a href="" http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K404106 "" target=""_blank"">BBa_K404106</a>), which is induced by several transcription factors found in cancerous cells, which will stop the siRNa from activating in a healthy cell.  For more information, you can check <a href=""#tab_module4"" target=""_blank"">Module IV</a>.
Then, the bacteria was designed to produce its recombinant bacteriophage under a quorum sensing system, which is described in <a href=""#tab_module2"" target=""_blank"">Module II</a>. Also, the strains that are being used in the project cannot survive outside laboratory conditions for more than two weeks because they are derived from E.coli K12. Therefore, the probability of producing bacteriophages outside the laboratory conditions is very low.
Finally, its important to recall that the project is not ready to be used as an industrial product, as more research is needed. This knowledge will be generated after all the experimental tests on this strain are finished, which must include in vivo and clinical trials, outside the reach of a one-summer test. Also, a construct without antibiotic resistance is yet to be developed and the use of an auxotrophic dependence construct needs to be developed previous to its release.

Primer Design Tool with LMU-Munich
We worked with LMU-Munich 2011 iGEM team this summer on the testing and development of their PrimerDesign tool.  To learn more about it check out their website .
An example of the output from the tool based off of input from our luxC biobrick, multiple primers with various melting temperatures are given
Software Testing
We helped LMU-Munich test their primer design software by sending our primer data and comparing it with the output of their automated designer. To do this, we compared the sequences of the primers used to amplify out parts of the LuxBrick with the primers that their software designed and concluded that their software works as expected.  Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to order the primers that the software designed to test it ourselves. Overall, we found the tool easy to use and potentially very useful for future primer design.
Implemented Bug Fixes & Features
Added cyanobacteria to available genomes
Switch coding sequences in the primer designer to allow for the user to incude a stop codon in a coding sequence. Before, software insisted that coding sequences not include the stop codon
Made primer designer default to only check for biobrick restriction enzymes. Before, Primer Designer defaulted to checking  for all restriction sites, making the user scroll to the bottom of the page for results
Added support for FASTA files with headers
Added descriptions for each column of the Primer Designer output.
Original vs. Revised Output
Original Output
The original output identified every commercially available enzyme recognition site by default.  This made it annoying to reach the bottom of the page where the primer info was.
Revised Output
New, more useful default output with only searching for BioBrick enzymes, and providing labels in the output

Ethical Perspective
Until now we did not look at the ethical perspective of our project. After our conversations with the public and some other professors it is not surprising, that synthetic biology, which adapts and designs living organisms with many different applications, has a broad ethical dimension. An ethical dimension, an ethical discussion … ethical questions … ethics?
Many of us maybe heard about ethics, because of their philosophy courses or because of their religious education at school. Some of us maybe saw an ethic expert in television or in some TV discussion rounds. But what is ethic exactly?
Ethic is a branch of philosophy and refers to well-founded standards of right and wrong. Normally it defines what humans ought to do and what is wrong about their actions. Ethics is about trying to give answers to questions about how we have to react to or act in specific situations, what we have to consider to develop a well- founded decision or what is wrong about the way we handle different topics.
As we do not know so many aspects related to ethics and because of our non-objective perspective, we started to contact different experts in Germany.
The interview with Dr. Ach who talked about the responsibility of scientists and the importance of integrating ethical considerations in the development of a project, can be found here .
Perspective of Professors
Interview with Our Supervisor Prof. Schwaneberg
How do You evaluate the iGEM competition in general and the influence which the former iGEM teams from Aachen had?
In general, I see the iGEM competition as a very good opportunity for students to learn how to work and act in a team by proposing ideas, fighting for them, getting exposed to their consequences. In essence, it is a very good training for students to learn how to take over responsibilities and to work in and as a team. I strongly support"

Occurrence
Lead is a heavy metal with widespread occurrence. The relatively simple extraction methods and several desirable properties have made it useful to humans. Lead and lead compounds are used in a high variety of products, such as pipes and plumbing materials, solders, gasoline, batteries, ammunition and cosmetics. Therefore, lead plays a major role in the industry and is one of the most used metals. Compared to other metals its occurrence is relative low. Lead can be detected in different parts of the environment, like air, soil and water.  A high concentration of lead in drinking water is often induced by obstruct pipes that consist of lead or that has a part of lead, respectively. This allow water to be easily contaminated. That is often a problem in houses, where lead is used in household plumbing. Due to the fact that lead is also occurring in water, it could result in adverse health effects (WHO: Fact sheet number 379, Lead poisoning and health).
Health Effects

AMR STRATEGY
MEETING WITH AMR COMMITTEE
The 5 Year Plan
Antibiotic resistance is clearly a problem that needs to be tackled on a global scale. However, global plans do not consider the more detailed aspects of tackling the problem, whereas national strategies have this at their core. The UK government is adopting the five year antimicrobial resistance (AMR) strategy; a collaboration between a host of organisations from the Government Departments for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), and the National Health Service (NHS) as well as the Ministry of Defence.
Click here for the AMR report
Together these organisations set out a number of action points for seeing a reduction in antibiotic resistance over the next 5 years, beginning from 2013.
The report listed the following as targets:
Good infection prevention and control measures to help prevent infections occurring become the norm in all sectors of human and animal health,
Infections can be diagnosed quickly and the right treatment used,
Patients and animal keepers fully understand the importance of antibiotic treatment regimens and adhere to them,
Surveillance is in place which quickly identifies new threats or changing patterns in resistance,
There is a sustainable supply of new, effective antimicrobials.
The government is also calling for quick diagnosis of infections in tackling antibiotic resistance - we feel we could answer this call with our device.
The Rapid Diagnostics Steering Committee Interview
To design our device according to the requirements of the UK government, we consulted a member of the AMR Rapid Diagnostics Steering subgroup, David Oglesby. Below is what we learned from our time with him.
David Oglesby,
Clinical Fellow and member of the Rapid Diagnostics Steering Group
According to David Oglesby, a device like ours would significantly aid national and global governments in combating antibiotic resistance. Our device uses the biomarker lipocalin-2, which is produced by a host in response to bacterial infections and is not pathogen-specific. Our device is unable to differentiate between different bacterial infections, and so we asked Mr. Oglesby if this is a limitation.
His response was “Absolutely not. When you look at the reports around that say where antibiotic resistance is coming from... one of the biggest [issues] you still find is that people [are receiving] antibiotics when [they have] viral infections…”
Furthermore, Mr. Oglesby said that the device would have to be accurate enough to give doctors confidence in the results,"
ZJUT-China,2018,Team:ZJUT-China#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," electricity is mainly converted into light energy and heat, so there is a need for further cooling systems. The equipment of our project requires careful consideration of the sensitivity of light and the occlusion of light.
Is it beneficial?
Public
Through online and offline surveys, we engage people in our projects. They are also involved in understanding the main goals of our project. They are also involved in gaining some knowledge of antibiotic resistance gene contamination. Public participation makes us feel that our project is very meaningful, which gives us great encouragement. During the survey, we learned about the current public perception of bacterial resistance and our projects. This is instructive for the next step of the project. The following two questions have a profound impact on our project.
Question 6: What is your attitude towards dealing with “super-resistant bacteria”?
Most public believe that the problem of super-resistant bacteria needs to be resolved, and the public's response corresponds to previous responses to whether they believe that resistant bacteria are harmful to health and the environment.
Question 7: Which of the following production activities do you think the “drug-resistant bacteria” mentioned above are mainly generated?
Most of the super-resistant bacteria are produced in medical waste, wastewater discharge, pharmaceutical companies and laboratories.

We are supported by the Chinese Academy of Engineering！
In October 2018, we had the opportunity to interview Shen Yinchu, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. He was the pioneer and founder of the Chinese biopesticide industry. Since the successful listing in the 1970s, he has led the research and development of the bio-pesticide Validamycin，which preferred pesticide to prevent rice sheath blight. We introduced the purpose and direction of our project and the working principle of the molecular machine to Academician Shen. He believed that our project was very innovative and practical. He also strongly encourages young people to innovate and think about some international problems in biological field. Academician Shen said that the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in nature is very difficult to control. There is currently no effective way to deal with the horizontal transfer of resistance genes, and the exchange of resistance genes between different strains of microorganisms can lead to very serious environmental pollution problem of resistance genes. It poses a huge threat to the service life of drugs. Academician Shen also said that our project can remove the molecular carrier of horizontal transfer of resistance genes from the source to a certain extent, and it is of great"

Characterizing the Growth of ΔcrcB at Various Levels of Fluoride in the Presence and Absence of the Wild Type E. coli
Wild type and ∆crcB were grown directly next to each other at varying levels of fluoride. As described in literature, ∆crcB should not grow when exposed to fluoride levels over 500µM. Unexpectedly, ∆crcB did grow on high levels of fluoride when placed on the same plates as wild type E. coli. Without wild type E. coli, no growth of ∆crcB was seen on 1mM and 2mM fluoride.
In order to figure out the cause of the unexpected growth, we reached out to Dr. Randy Stockbridge at University of Michigan for possible explanations. Dr. Stockbridge informed us of Fluoride’s dependability of pH. A low pH environment is necessary for Fluoride to enter cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that the wild type altered the pH of the agar to a more basic level, facilitating the growth of ∆crcB.
To confirm our hypothesis, we prepared similar set of plates, but with phenol red, a pH indicator, for visual confirmation.
Phenol red appears red at basic pH and turns yellow at acidic pH. In the absence of a buffer, wild type has a visibly basic pH. Therefore, once the entire plate became basic, ∆crcB showed fair amount of growth. On previous days, ∆crcB grew only at red areas (low pH).
To further confirm our results, we prepared the same plates with a MES buffer, which kept the agar at a 6.5 pH, which is slightly acidic.
Upon the addition of the buffer, the alteration of pH was significantly delayed, so F was able to enter the membrane of ∆crcB, allowing the strain to grow.
CHOP (Chloramphenicol Operon) and ∆crcB (E. coli without Fluoride Channel) were added to 50µ chloramphenicol plates and observed over the course of 4 days.
The plates had increasing concentrations of F with CHOP and ∆crcB to determine the level of fluoride that leads to the greatest growth of CHOP.
∆crcB was part of the control and did not grow because it"

Future development
As demonstrated, Rosetta provides us with the means to           redesign a chemoreceptor to bind new ligands. In the           future, this ability can be used in the same manner to           design dozens of new receptors. The critical step of the           design process remains the lab work required to clone and          test the variants, this step can be optimized by using a high           throughput chemotaxis assay. Aside from this, any receptor designed           can be further improved by introducing a directed evolution step, using the Rosetta software, to           improve its specificity for the new ligand.
Rosetta Guide for the iGEM beginner
During our work with Rosetta we encountered quite a few challenges that required us to browse           through the official documentation and the Rosetta support forums and also consult with experts           in computational design. These problems made us realize how difficult Rosetta can be to completely           new users, especially undergraduates lacking the necessary knowledge.
To make Rosetta more accessible to the iGEM community we decided to team up with iGEM TU Eindhoven           and compile a quick start guide complete with important links, protocols and information we gathered           from our experience with Rosetta.
We hope that this guide will help future iGEM teams and novice Rosetta users in general.

Overall, Dr. Pryzdial’s comments gave us many things to consider in the design of our construct and any issues that we might have to troubleshoot. He believes that our project is an interesting exploration in the blood clotting area.
University of Alberta Hematology Department
We gained valuable insight in the development of our project design from Dr. Bruce Ritchie at the University of Alberta. Dr. Ritchie focuses on Bleeding disorders and Thrombosis and has also synthesized “recombinant blood clotting proteins, both in E.coli, and in human tissue culture cells”, while completing his post-doctoral fellowship in Biochemistry at the University of British Columbia. He supports our proposal, especially since many other competing companies producing blood coagulants (Tisseel, Duraseal, FlowSeal) utilize components of human blood. Nonetheless, he also provided us with further suggestions to consider in our design.  Specifically, he raised his concern that “the venom proteins are likely to be immunogenic [,] caus[ing] an antibody response that will be a problem for re-treatment”. However, antibodies usually take 10-14 days to form, meaning that, since our goal is to prevent excessive blood loss in an emergency situation, the formation of antibodies is not as problematic in the acute phase. His advice did however lead us to infer that our product could only be used once per person because of the high chance of an immunogenic response from the body. Although we had considered designing our blood coagulant in a bandage and/or gel form, Dr. Ritchie also suggested another application method that we could consider. This would take the form of a pre-filled syringe that could be used to apply the product to the wound when needed. This application method is already being used by Pfizer’s blood coagulant, Xyntha, which “is preloaded in a syringe as a dried powder and a liquid solvent (typically water) that mix when the plunger is pressed”. Using the knowledge he provided, we eventually decided on using a pre-filled syringe containing our construct followed by a bandage for sealing it in place. Additionally, Dr. Ritchie suggested that our product design should be easy to remove from its packaging and apply, in addition to stressing the importance of storing and applying our blood coagulant in a sterile fashion. Overall, Dr. Ritchie’s expertise in the hematology field proved to be very beneficial in aiding with the design of our blood coagulant.

Also hearing that Macquarie iGEM is a newly built team, GU Xiang generously gave his ideas and experience in iGEM to Yagiz and Hilal, promoting them to build better wiki to let more people know about their ideas. Finally they three expressed freely about the issues in Biology and Life Science as well as the Chinese Culture, especially the Kungfu. They had a wonderful day!
The leader and all the teammates from Tsinghua iGEM were pleased with this visit and cooperation, they said they were willing to cooperate with Macquarie iGEM to build up and finish a BioSystem together, especially in such a contemporary society where cooperation is extremely of significance.
We hope that every team in iGEM could find this opportunity to cooperate with an other team to build up a system other than just by only one team. In this cooperation we Tsinghua iGEM got one new way to screen our antibodies which we never heard about and Macquarie iGEM supplied their system with another crucial application and even more applications based on this idea. Thus if all the teams in iGEM can cooperate with at least another one, or even more teams, we may can build up a wonderful Genetically Engineered Machine, definitely it is an international one, thus iGEM!!!

Purification of genomic DNA from Shewanella oneidensis and Salmonella sp.
July 25th
After a long break we finally started working on the actual assembly of parts - the mtr complex. Today Jonas ran a trial PCR on mtrB and mtrC part of the complex both of which are around the size of 2kb. GoTaq polymerase (Promega) was used, this is the polymerase we generally use for trials and colony PCRs as fidelity is not the main priority.
This is the gel from the PCR. Temperatures ranged 46-71˚C. It appears that the primers are sufficiently specific at even low temperatures. 1% agarose, SYBR-Safe(Invitrogen), QStep4 ladder.
July 26th
Trial PCR again, this time for three small (~500bp) synthetic DNA fragments - gBlocks (IDT), these fragments are highlighted below on the diagram as well as the overall view of our mtr gene.
The gel. Three different temperatures (51-61˚C)- all work. 1% agarose dyed with SYBR-Safe, however, due to poor practice the ladder is indistinguishable.
At this point Jonas arrived at the realisation that as long as the primers are specific enough, there is no point in doing PCR trials (silly Jonas). Therefore most of the PCRs done this day forth use a universal 58˚C temperature.
July 27th
This is the first day that we actually got some positive outcome from our cloning. Or so we thought.
All the fragments of our mtr complex were once again amplified via PCR but this time using Phusion polymerase for high fidelity (Thermo Fisher). Gel confirmed that everything went fine and specifically. Using"

We did our best to maintain a good equilibrium in being accurate without making things excessively difficult or confusing for inexperienced students. We encourage all expert students to give us their feedback so that we can improve this tutorial and make it even more useful for inexperienced students.
What will you learn?
iGEM wikis are becoming more and more good-looking and well designed each year. The most important objective for the wikis is documenting as much as possible iGEM projects instead of impressing the users with its design. In fact, iGEM provides the teams with a standard format in which teams could easily create a simple but fully functional and complete wiki, fulfilling the most important requisite of a wiki. However, creating a well-designed wiki helps to make the information more accessible and clear to the users and improving the navigation through the team’s project. Furthermore, styling the wiki gives a distinctive look to each project which can reinforce the objective of the project. In this tutorial, we are going to show how to use Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework for designing websites. This will facilitate creating a distinctive look easily while making the information readily available to future teams.
This tutorial requires a prior background knowledge in HTML and CSS. Javascript it is not required since the Bootstrap framework provides the wiki with enough responsive elements to make it functional and attractive. This tutorial is not focused on teaching how to code a website, but on giving and teaching how to use some tools that make wiki editing more simple. Therefore, we suggest inexperienced users of this tutorial to look up for learning resources about HTML and CSS on the internet, like the ones found in W3schools or Sololearn. We also recommend learning just the basics of both languages, since during wiki editing it is always possible to look to a HTML and CSS reference to learn how to do specific things. In fact, wiki editing is a very nice opportunity to learn hands-on some front-end development.
The tools explained in this tutorial are very useful to edit the wiki locally and by multiple team members. The tutorial is focused on teaching how to edit the wiki locally (in order to take advantage of the tools that can not be used in the online wiki editing site) always keeping in mind the requirements of the iGEM wiki in the MediaWiki context. Users taking this tutorial will learn how to use a professional code editor like Visual Studio Code and take advantage of their features, how to use a version control system like Git, how to edit the wiki in collaboration with other team members using Github and how to use the Bootstrap framework from its source Sass files to style their wikis.

Bielefeld CeBiTec
Midway through the iGEM season, the Bielefeld iGEM team discovered that our teams share a significant overlap in our projects: both teams are engineering synthetic single domain antibody libraries and using a bacterial two hybrid system for antibody selection. Naturally, we were very interested to collaborate in order to discuss and overcome obstacles in the laboratory and compare our library and selection designs. We discussed these details in five separate video conferencing calls. During the ensuing discussions, we were able to identify several important design considerations, such as theoretical antibody library complexity, methods for maximizing cloning efficiency and selectable markers for positive hits in the two hybrid. Additional details regarding our conversations have been recorded in our joint Collaboration Notebook.
In addition to our discussions, we also exchanged control parts as well as DNAs encoding different target epitopes to raise antibodies against. The Bielefeld Team provided us with their anti-GFP control samples which included an antibody with sub-optimal binding which may be used to assess the sensitivity/stringency of the bacterial-two-hybrid detection system. In turn, we provided the Bielefeld Team with an influenza capsid protein antigen. The purpose of the latter would allow our two teams to compare the efficacy of our respective antibody libraries and/or selection systems to identify antibodies with high affinity and specificity towards a common ligand.
Lethbridge High School
This year we collaborated with the Lethbridge High School iGEM Team. We provided mentorship for the team by teaching them lab skills at a GeekStarter workshop held at the University of Lethbridge. We also helped them troubleshoot issues with their lab work. In return, the high school team helped us by prepping lab materials that we would need for later experiments. As well, we helped each other by working out any issues on our wikis. Overall, collaborating with the high school team solidified the iGEM community around the University of Lethbridge."

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't"
Nanjing-China,2015,Team:Nanjing-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," also ourselves to turn wastes into resources.
Unlike water has a strong nature balance itself, heavy-metal’s nature circulation is much slower. We need to use man power to turn every waste kind into resource. In this concept, seawater desalination combing heavy-metal recycling will be the key to build the heavy metal’s balance.
The origin of heavy metal comes from the river, therefore, it is hard to control from the origin. Most of the study dealing with heavy metal in seawater focus on recovery and has to work in an open condition. The efficiency of absorption largely depends on the mobility of seawater. IT also brings some safety concern by introducing new species to original ecosystem.
For example, the main recovery method focuses on mangrove in China. Mangrove is salt-torrent and absorb heavy-metal naturally. However, because it is plant, the study and application of mangrove will be relatively slow.
Seawater desalination is one of the few seawater alternating technology that pumps in the seawater. It also has complicated process, and part of it could be replaced by Nanjing’s project. Thus, we should look at two projects’ combination as environmental restoration and seawater alternation using the same artificial water flow.Back to circular economy, this will increase the force that heavy-metal waste change into resource with a low cost adding.
Journal
In March, we founded our team and recruited our team members, after with we divided our team members into several groups and each group is responsible for one part of the competition. We were also busy brainstorming about our project and signing up for iGEM competition.
In April, we confirmed our project. A majority of the team members wanted to deal with problems related to heavy metals. Then we searched online and read many articles related to our project. We also made a plan about the procedures of all the experiments.
In May, we were busy with kit construction and part construction. We were also contacting different authorities and scheduled for interviews.
In June, we went on with kit construction and started the homologous recombination part. We also interviewed with a government official.
In July, we were engaged in adhering the engineered bacteria onto the material that we used. We also tested for the four kinds of bacteria adhesion materials. Some members were busy with modeling. We also started our collaboration with Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
In August, we were doing experiments about heavy metal adsorption and busy with the test of our designed device. We also attended the CCiC conference in Beijing and presented our project to Chinese iGEM teams. Besides, we also interviewed with a college professor,"
SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Concept2_-_-_TEXT.html,", as we saw previously. The protein D is exposed on the entire outer surface of the capsid, that is why, it is an ideal candidate to be fused to a cellular internalization protein.
The D protein is organized as a trimer. Each monomer is distant of 5,1nm in a trimer. The crystal structure of the protein D, as a trimeric form, shows that the Nter and Cter ends, are exposed at the capsid surface, and are very closed from each other. The Nter and Cter ends are exposed at the mature capsid surface, which allows the choice for the location of the fusion protein (Nter or Cter). However, several studies have showed that the fusion to the Cter end, allows better results.
The internalization protein, called polypeptide III, is issued of the adenovirus penton base. This one allows to the cell vector to be internalized in the interest cell, and to induce the endosomal escape.
The penton base is a pentameric protein strategically inserted in the twelve peaks of the adenoviral capsid. Its monomer, which the length is around 60 kDa (571 aminoacides), is present in 60 copies in the viruses. More than its structural function in the capsid, the penton base has a fundamental property: it contains an RGD motif (arginin - aspartic acid - glycin) conserved, responsible of the interaction of the virus with the integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5. This motif is located at the penton base surface and is exposed to the outer of the capsid.
The exposition of 5 RGD motifs carries by the penton base, allows the simultaneous association of several integrin molecules, which initiate the incorporation of the adenovirus by endocytosis, principally mediated by clathrin vesicles.
The integrins gathering via the RGD motif is necessary for the internalization phenomenon. The gathering needs to several polypeptides III monomers. This can reveal a problem, indeed, only one monomer of polypeptide III is fused to one protein D, so the endocytosis could not happen.
However, since a crystallography study, the distance between two RGD motifs on one penton base is equal to 5,7nm. The distance between two proteins D is similar (5,1nm), so the integrins gathering can be achieved and induces the internalization and the endosomal escape.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#CFPS_-_-_TEXT.html," compared our CFPS setup with commercially available S30 T7 cell-free expression system. To do this, the manufactors protocol was scaled down from a 50 µL to a 15 µL scale.

CFPS on Paper – Results
At first, we tried to conduct the reactions without any further processing of the paper discs. No signal was seen. We supposed papers were full of RNases which would have adverse effects on the RNA in the reaction.
By autoclaving the paper discs three times, we hoped to reduce RNase contaminations. When we repeated the experiment with autoclaved paper, results were far better. Although the standard deviation was quite high, probably because of little differences in the shape of the paper discs, we demonstrated that it is possible to conduct a CFPS reaction on simple autoclaved paper.
The fluorescence signal depended on paper type. In total, we tested five different paper types on suitability. CFPS worked on every paper tested, however, for subsequent experiments we decided to use the two paper that worked best: 827B from Macherey & Nagel (M&N) and C350L from Munktell. Interestingly, when we used the commercially available S30 T7 cell-free expression system at the same scale, the resulting fluorescence signal was far lower. This may be attributed to the fact that the commercial system is not designed to work under these conditions.
CFPS reaction with self-made E. coli extract on different types of autoclaved paper. Basal fluorescence of different papers were subtracted. Fluorescence signals of CFPS reactions were then normalized on sfGFP containing lysate that was applied on the respective paper. M&N: Macherey & Nagel

We wondered if it was possible to lyophilize the paper discs together with the CFPS reaction, like Pardee et al. did. The 15 µL reactions were applied on paper discs, put into microcentrifuge tubes and flash-freezed in liquid nitrogen. Lyophilization was carried out for 24 h. Afterwards, the paper discs were rehydrated with tap water instead of RNase free water.
The results were once again beyond our best expectations."

USTC,2015,Team:USTC-Software#Medal_-_-_TEXT.html,": Here are our demo page and validation page demonstrating several realistic examples on our wiki. We also have automated unit testing , documentation of test coverage, bug tracking facilities and documentation of releases and changes between releases on our GitHub.
Gold
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, our team have achieved the following 2 goals:
R1: iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We  refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
E1: We had done the Human Practices in outreach. More information and pictures are on our Human Practices page .
R2: Address a problem that you would like to co-develop with a wetlab team. This should be a collaboration where the wetlab team posts a problem they are having and your team addresses the  issue by creating an online software solution.
E2: Yes. We address an issue for USTC team about fringe detection in their project, and we created an online software , where you can use to compute the interference series.
R3: Re-use and further develop a previous iGEM software project (or parts thereof) and demonstrate how future teams can continue this trend through good code documentation, use of open source materials and creation of great instructional materials.
E3: Yes, we inherit and develop the idea of 2007 team of USTC, they developed many Boolean gates and planned to employ knowledge from digital circuit to create cascade of Boolean gates. And our software reuses the framework of last year's USTC-Software team and the separation of front-end and back-end completely and REST API as the interface between them. Moreover, developers could easily develop their own software based on our project. More specifically, we could provide developers an easy-of-use API for further development. Here are the two examples below.
* Graph API. Software engineers could easily use our python code to build a gene circuit based on a truth with just a few lines.  More specifically, developers just use the code `import biocircuit` to import our package and then use the following code to  converting a truth table(a string) to some gene circuits with score.         expr_from_back = biocircuit.string2expr(expr)         circuit_from_back = biocircuit.create_circuit(expr_from_back)         scores_from_back = biocircuit.circuit_score(circuit_from_back, biogate.d"

In the meetings we presented our projects to one and another and discussed what the best ways are to give a conveying message. Hereby it was very useful to get feedback from people who are not involved in our project directly.
Let the symposium begin
The day of the symposium Jack Pronk, from the TU Delft, gave an extensive lecture about the developments in the field of synthetic biology. In his lecture he gave simple and understandable examples to indicate the progress that can be made with the use of modified organisms, such as insulin production. Bart Wesselink from the RIVM continued to discuss the developments in synthetic biology, by which he mentioned algae producing oil and proteins. Next, Dirk Stemerding, from the Rathenau Institute, scrutinized what different faces of the discussion about synthetic biology are. Finally one of the companies suffering the consequences of the controversial attitude of society towards synthetic biology, Ecover, presented their experiences. As a closure, and to introduce the audience to actual developments and present them topics that raise concern in the young generation, each of the iGEM-teams presented their projects. Thereby we also proposed the possible applications of our device. The presentation was followed by a discussion about societal problems that play a role when considering synthetic biology.
Afterwards there was space for people to discuss our projects and ask questions about it. Thereby people could give their feedback about the different application scenarios. Multiple people were enthusiastic about the use of our device in pesticide-secretion. Some of them highlighted economic advantages and stimulated us to make a calculation of the costs now and expected costs using our system. A couple of people had substantive questions. Thereby they wondered how we could make our device for detection of intestinal diseases specific and why we chose for the use of 2 separate components. We have involved the advices and critiques from the experts into our project, which really helped us to bring the COMBs to a higher level.
A report of this day can be seen here Special thanks to the RIVM and the Rathenau Institute for involving us in the organization and to Loesje Pratijken for making pictures.
Human Outreach: Wisdom of the Crowd

Historical background
Richard Roberts and Jack Szostak from Harvard developed this technique in 1997. They were able to generate and identify a myc epitope starting from a random mRNA library using this technique (Roberts).
What is it?
mRNA display is a technique used to select for proteins that bind to specific targets. It allows for the identification of these selected proteins because they are covalently attached to the DNA that codes for them (Roberts).
Overview of mRNA display (Liu)
How does it work?
A library of DNA sequence variants is generated using error prone PCR or PCR with variable primers.
The DNA library is transcribed in vitro to an RNA library.
Using a DNA splint, RNA strands are ligated to single stranded DNA oligonucleotides with puromycin at the 3' end
The RNA-puromycin fusions are then translated in vitro
The Puromycin mimics a tRNA and is incorporated into the A site of the ribosome. However  the puromycin has a non hydrolizable amide bond, therefore terminating translation and releasing  the polypeptide, which is still bound to the RNA template through the puromycin. This results in a library of proteins covalently bonded to the RNA that coded for them.
In order to create a more stable structure, the RNA is converted to a DNA-RNA duplex through in vitro reverse transcription.
The library is screened for the protein that best binds to the target molecule.
Identification of the protein will be simple, as the corresponding DNA strand is still attached to it. PCR of the DNA followed by sequencing yields the exact identity of the protein at the DNA level.
What does the Mtd have to do with mRNA display?
The Mtd protein is the scaffold for our mRNA display experiment. Most proteins are not capable of undergoing the large number of mutations necessary to create a large"

Igem Team Collaborations :
We performed our experiment at an open lab named “La Paillasse”. When we learned at the European Experience that The Ionis team also happened to use this lab, we were excited to start. Since the end of July, we share the same bench, exchanging protocols, advices,reagents and materials such as tips, mediums, antibiotics, cells. We helped them directly with their manipulations, nanodroping and sequencing some of their samples when they needed to and they gave us competent DH5α E. coli when we needed it the most.  When we arrived at “La Paillasse” , they were highly helpful as they showed us around, taught us different tricks for our experiments and how to use the various equipment present. We believe that exchanging ideas between our two teams, helped both going through the competition.
One of our team goals was to raise awareness about the IGEM competition and to maitain the IGEM culture as a tradition for the various universities. To do so, we invited the IONIS team in a conference at the UPMC University, for students from the Molecular and Cellular Biology Master, where we knew we would have a large audience. The objective was for students to see the diversity of projects present in the competition, but also to promote collaborations between teams. Together, we presented the competition, our individual projects and our experience with every aspect of the competition. It was a successful meeting as numerous students approached us at the end and long after the meeting.
We also participated in surveys from different IGEM teams including the Evry team (“Let's PLAy: Polylactic Acid Plastic Revolution”), Göttingen team (“B₁₂ - Another Brick in the Wall”) and Munich United team (“Enabling Factors in Biotech”). Concerning the Evry team’s survey, as it was a survey directed to the general public, we also motivated other people to fill it. We are looking forward to see the results of these surveys. We show here the badge code we received from Munich United team and the Evry team!

H: Oh sorry. I just meant that synthetic biology changed so many lives all around the world. This technology enables efficient storage and transport for energy. We were able to close nearly all atomic power plant. Clever distribution of produced energy led to such benefits. I cannot believe what happened with our invention. Who could have thought of this outcome? If we just had known what will happen. Did we not do all test that are needed?
P: Wrap it up, Mr. Johnson!
H: Yeah what I just wanted to say. Scientists developed such a great technology which transforms energy into a power source with which we are even able to drive. It was a great idea. Can it be changed now? Can we alter what already has been altered in such a way? We have to return to the old days. What can be changed now?
P: But now we have a worldwide crisis, Mr. Johnson. You should wake up. African states founded the petrol federation to fight for their commerce. The middle eastern countries followed. The collapse of their economic gave rise to Chaos began to grow and terror rises upon civilians. They started to attack our camps and troops. We really have to fight them now. I did not want to start a fight like this but I have no choice. We have to defend ourselves. We cannot change what we have done. It is too late to rework our society.

Also, innoculated overnight cultures in preparation for more glycerol stocks and minipreps tomorrow.  This is for the same parts listed above, with the exception of pSB1AK3, which had no distinct colonies.
Ran a gel of all PCR products from yesterday.  Ran about 5 uL of each, added to 4 uL of water and 1 uL of loading dye. The gel was 1% gel, a large one with 26 combs of 9 mm spacing.  For this, mixed 100 mL 0.5x TBE, 10 uL SYBR Safe, and 1 g Agarose and poured it into the large electrophoresis device.  The gel was running for about 4 hours.
Imaging indicated that none of the PCR reactions had worked, apparently not even the positive control.  Could only see bands for the three ladders included, which were the 100 bp, the 1 kbp, and the 2-log ladders.  Given this finding, one might suggest that something went wrong either with the PCR itself or with the gel.  It seems unlikely that something was wrong with the gel given that a restriction digest for a different project run on the same gel appeared to have a distinct band (for a piece of DNA expected to be 1-2 kbp).
Made more LB + agar plates.  Some of this spilled out in the autoclave.  Estimated that there are still 800 mL remaining, so added 800 uL of ampicillin stock solution.
Made 20 plates.
A talk with Jamie convinced us that we should run the initial plate reader tests we had considered of the activator + reporter and repressor + repoter constructs.  These should be done in parallel to the construction of our real parts.
In terms of our ligations, we need to determine which promoters we will be using, which sets of binding sites, etc.  We need to determine a good inducible promoter for the entire device.  If we choose pGAL1, we will need to make it more tunable, which will require the yeast strain from Smolke that has a knockout. "
UESTC-Software,2018,Team:UESTC-Software#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,", BioMaster is far superior to others in terms of information. It integrated eight traditional biological research databases and provides users with sequence, literature, interaction and other information, saving users time to find relevant information. Second, more retrieval methods and more visual expressions enable users to work more efficiently with BioMaster. In the future, we hope that iGEM can be combined with more traditional databases for analysis, and that all the information needed by synthetic biologists can be retrieved in one database, allowing iGEM to be combined with big data and artificial intelligence.

Weeds and pests are the most important damages to agronomy system, which resulted in agriculture economic losses of more than $20.4 billion in 1972. Merely taking the United States as an example, the damage is $8.4 billion a year, while pests account for 40% and weeds account for 60%. In our country, China, the crop yield loss is almost fifty million kilogram per year.
Therefore, the prevention and management of weeds & pests are indispensable to guarantee the agricultural production. The common way to control them is spraying the chemicals termed herbicides and pesticides.
The first pesticide DDT appeared in 1939, which widely spread after the Second World War. People saw its tremendous potential through its high efficiency and lethality rate. Then synthetic organic pesticides quickly covered almost all fields where dedicates to controlling weeds and pests.
Resistance
At first, unprepared pest insects and weeds were easily killed, but this situation didn’t last long because of the resistance occurrence.
According to history, in 1989, there were 432 kinds of resistant insects in the world, and in 2008, the number updated to 589, of which 392 kinds were agricultural pests. What’s worse, beneficial insects, insect-eating birds, frogs and snakes are suffering as well from low selectivity chemicals.
As for wild grass, since the first one anti-2, 4-D wild carrots were found in the 1950s, weeds resistance problem has been always accompanying global agriculture development. Declared by Herbicide Resistance Committee( belongs to Weed Society Of America), as of May 21, 2014, resistant weeds occupied nearly 55% in total resistant organisms and they distributed among 65 countries, 82 kinds of crops.
Figure 1. International distribution of anti-herbicide weeds
Through figure 2, we can find that in the first 20 years, the occurrence of resistant weeds was very slow. But when getting into the mid and late-1980s, the number increased in a stunning speed and the growth rate shows a trend of nearly strait"

To show that PNCs can be used to deliver RNA-protein complexes, such as Cas9 protein loaded with guide RNA, we turned to the P22 coat protein once again. The Weidenheft lab at Montana State University has fused the Cas9 protein with the P22 scaffolding protein to encapsulate Cas9 when this fusion protein is combined with P22 coat protein. By co-expressing a desired guide RNA along with the Cas9-scaffold protein fusion, isolating the fusion protein, and combining with purified samples of the RNP with P22 coat protein, they managed to encapsulate a fully functional CRISPR/Cas9 system in the P22 PNC and went on to demonstrate that this system can cut dsDNA (Qazi et. al., 2016).

Biocompass 2.0
Abstract of bio-compass
The aim of our project is to build a brand new bio-navigational system that can be used by the ordinary people. The map information will be coded in DNA strand and do corresponding biochemical operations. The bio-navigational database will establish the relationship between biochemical operation instructions and traditional navigation instructions. In order to reduce workload in advance， BIO-COMPASS can also screen reaction conditions according to the road conditions. Furthermore, we try to update the system to adapt to the more complex path plans. For this, we design some special enzyme sites which differ from standard bio-bricks’ as the function interfaces. For example, “Logic Gate” genetic device can be inserted in our system to help us solve the path plan which include a transfer station between the start and the destination. BIO-COMPASS will find the best solution by using a variety of detection methods such as electrophoresis and reporter gene.

Insights
We must reflect on the type of customers and users we target.
We need a concrete idea to sell.
At the time, we considered using our living material as a glucose sensor. However, we received the feedback that many good glucose sensors already exist, so it would be difficult to distinguish our design from existing ones.
Follow-up
We decided to focus more on the living material itself and to highlight its potential by finding an application.
iGEM Team Eindhoven 2018 being awarded at TU/e Contest for audience prize.
II. Finding an application
Thanks to the TU/e Contest and various brainstorm sessions, we had settled on the living material project. Although we decided to focus on the adhesin system, we wanted to demonstrate the potential of our platform by applying it to a social problem. To find the ‘perfect’ application, we consulted various experts, interacted with the public and attended a biotech conference. We also reflected on the ethical consequences of our potential applications before settling on wound infections.
May 14, 2018. Dutch iGEM meetup RIVM and Rathenau Institute.
In May, we were invited to The Hague for a Dutch iGEM meet-up organized by two public institutes: The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM ) and the Rathenau Institute, an institute for technology assessment. The theme of the meet-up was Human Practices. As we had only just started our Human Practices trajectory, this day was a great way to get inspired.

May 14, 2018. Dutch iGEM meetup RIVM and Rathenau Institute.
day Our day started with a presentation on the different stages of a project. After the pitches by all six Dutch teams, we got the opportunity to speed date  with seven experts on the topics of biosafety, security, bioethics, policy and regulations: Zoë Robaey, Cécile van der Vlugt, Pim Klaassen, Niek Savelkoul, Pieter van Boheemen, Lilian van Hove and Jaco Westra. They provided us with helpful feedback on our plans and we discussed potential applications of Gelcatraz. They encouraged us to focus on previous iGEM projects that could have been improved with our platform. In fact, wound healing was one of the applications they mentioned! It was also great to meet the other Dutch teams for the first time and to learn what they were working on. We would like to thank the Rathenau Institute and RIVM for the inspiring day!

Day 33 05/08/15
We checked our overnight plates were checked for contamination. Following this, we transformed pVS105 and pVS72 into VS45, plated them out and then incubated them at 37ºC overnight.
Day 34 06/08/15
We set up overnight cultures of pVS105 in VS45 and pVS72 in VS45.
Day 35 07/08/15
As the colonies did not grow overnight, we set up more colonies in the morning, with the OD600 being checked in the evening. The transformation of pVS105 and pVS72 into VS45 was then repeated. The transformations were then plated out and incubated at 37ºC.
Day 36 10/08/15 - Waiting game
Our miniprepped plasmids (pSB1C3, pSB1A3, pVS105 and pVS72) were digested and run on an agarose gel. VS45 colonies containing pVS105 and pVS72 were resuspended in liquid LB and cultured overnight at 37ºC.
Day 37 11/08/15
First we checked the OD of the overnight cultures. We transformed pSB1A3 and pSB1C3 into Top10 cells. We made a glycerol stock solution of pVS105 and pVS72 to store it for future use. We spot plated the pVS72 and pVS105 separately onto plates for imaging. We then miniprepped pVS72 and pVS105 from the overnight cultures.
Day 38 12/08/15
First, we re-transformed pSB1A3 into Top10 cells. We then did PCR of pSB1C3 and pVS72.
Day 39 13/08/15
As PCR did not work properly the day before, we repeated the procedure. We also scanned the streaked Congo Red plates.
Day 40 14/08/15
We purified the PCR product, then digested it. We then measured the concentrations of our stock of pSB1A3 and pSB1C3.

- The test from Yesterday Didnt work. The plates with the phage on it were a little weird. There was only growth on half of the plate but not the other half. So I redid the experiment. Hopefully tomorrow we can see something.
- To make sure that its recorded, the small colonies that I tested from the plaques earlier did not have the CRISPR. I did a control experiment testing Dh5a and the iGEM plasmid pSB1C3. Both of these also gave the small colonies inside of the plaques. So I went back to the start and tested again.
Garrett Jensen 9/19/2014
- So today I got the results of the CRISPR test. Unfortunately it did not work. The plaques on the CRISPR plate were smaller than those from the iGEM plasmid control, but there were plaques.
- Talking with Dr. Grose the only things that we did differently than the paper we referenced for our work is that we put our guide region and CRISPR on different plasmids. We are going to try just cloning the entire CRISPR in and see if that works. I designed a new primer today to do that. The new primer is 5'-TACTAGTAGCGGCCGCTGCAGGCTGGATATTCGTATAACATGTTCCTTCTC-3'and is the reverse primer to remove the entire CRISPR set from LMD-9.

Tsinghua-A,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html," splitting up can bring about unexpected side effects. Gene regulatory circuits are highly dependent on quantitative properties, its complexity and nonlinearity contributing to hard-to-predict behaviors of biological systems. Once an important part in the system is chopped up, who knows what will happen next?
Our program quantitatively studies the behavior of such systems. Splitting up changes the circuit’s output-input function, alleviates leakage phenomenon, improving switch-like property, and increases fold change when induced by circuit inputs. Moreover, we use channel capacity from information theory to describe how well can they transmit signals. We find adding intein sequence tremendously beneficial in that it shifts the channel capacity to a higher level, thus ameliorating uncertainty.
When it comes to designing logic gates, our findings can lead the way. Not only can splitting achieve logic gate effect, but also can it improve sensibility to inputs and defend the system against detrimental interferences of noise when intein is added. Future work shall benefit from this fundamental investigation of basic synthetic biology blocks.
Highlighting the biological significance of dimerization:
Dimerization is only too common in cells. Monomers assembly into dimers for further functions all the time, some interactions strong, some interactions weak. Function-less newborn peptides piece together and get to work, forming so-called tertiary structure; activated kinases reach each other and mutually phosphorylate; transcription factors, when forming homo- or hetero-dimers according to different stoichiometry, leads to varied downstream responses and distinct cellular fates…
Yes, we know which proteins dimerize. We understand how proteins dimerize as well, by interaction of domains like leucine zippers and so forth. But why? What is the point of dimerization?
Previous researches have underlined the important advantages of dimerization, including differential regulation, specificity, facilitated proximity and so on. The influence of dimerization in noise propagation is hardly touched due to the difficulty in controlling experiment variables. Synthetic biology provides powerful tools to carry out experiments otherwise impossible in designed systems. This is exactly what we do.
Traditionally, we evaluate the impacts of noise using variance-related statistics, such as coefficient of variance. These quantities can only describe how concentrated the output is around the mean value, but cannot tell us how well we can infer one of the correlated random variables from the other. Channel capacity makes a better criteria of noise because it more scientifically depicts the information dissemination process.

Since it was so hard to walk now with my only foot, I thought it might be a good idea to float on the wind, so I took a diamond and bought a lot of bananas, coconuts, and dried insects for us to eat on our journey.

Below an example of a JavaScript generated graph is shown, based on this spreadsheet . Note that the two views of the data are linked (although at this time both the kind of graph and the link is not optimal) and that it would be possible to create templates for creating these linked graphs. The current demo is based on the Dojo Toolkit as it has more advanced charting capabilities at this moment than Google visualization (and it seems to be supported well in different browsers).

Loading graph ...
Questions that would have to be resolved include:
How can we make this easy to use?
The graphs can now be defined using a more or less normal Wiki page and allow the use of templates.
What kinds of plots do we need?
How flexible do we need it to be? (Layout-wise.)
Can we make it that flexible? (And still easy to use.)
Can we create a relatively easy way to let the viewer select different data for exploratory purposes? We will likely run more simulations than you would normally graph.
How to support axis titles?
Currently done using some custom code (created by someone else and submitted to Dojo's bug tracker).
 ???
Taking this idea (much) further it would even be possible to run simulations using JavaScript (and charting the results), based on SBML models. However, this would involve much, much more effort than just showing a few interactive plots.
Note that we did implement simulations in JavaScript, but based on a function that return the time-derivatives given the current state. In principle this is surprisingly fast (in some cases graphing was the bottle-neck, leading us to subsample the simulated time series for graphing purposes) and it should be relatively easy to adapt to other models. Note that we only used a very simple integration scheme though (so if your model requires a more advanced integration scheme you'll have to program it yourself).

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html," KAPA PCR of PstI was performed, to hopefully yield more colonies.
Week 17 (August 20 - August 24)
Decarboxylation
This week, we carried forth with the second and third mutagenesis sites of the CAR gene. Our new plasmid with our first PstI site was PCR amplified with the Kapa system and our EcorI mutagenesis primers to carry out the second mutation, to remove the EcorI illegal cut site from our gene. After the PCR was complete, we ran our product on a gel to see if the amplification worked. Bands indicated success, as shown in the gel below. Following this verification, we mixed our two seemingly successful PCR tubes with 1 uL of DpnI, and left them to incubate for one hour. The PCR product was then transformed into highly competent E.coli cells, and the plates were left overnight in the 37 degree incubator. Unfortunately a mistake prevented colonies from growing, but the process was repeated and our second attempt yielded many colonies. We made overnight cultures of 8 of these colonies, with 4 from each plate, with Kan as the antibiotic for selective growth. The next day, a miniprep was performed on each overnight culture to isolate the CAR+PET plasmids that had hopefully undergone their second mutation, of their single EcorI site. Once the plasmid isolation was complete, we performed a restriction digest using EcorI to cut, in order to verify that the illegal cut site had been removed and the plasmid could no longer be digested with this enzyme. Our success is demonstrated in the gel below. We immediately proceeded with the third mutagenesis, which would this time be performed on the second (and last) PstI site. Using our new plasmid now with two illegal cut sites removed, we performed an amplification PCR, using our PstI(2) primers and the Kapa system. After running this on a gel, we determined bands of success, as shown below. We then once again treated our PCR amplified tubes with DpnI for one hour, and then transformed into highly competent E.coli. The plates were left overnight to allow colony growth. Our second accomplishment of the week was successfully amplifying the OleT gene from Jeotgalicoccus, by using the Kapa system. This was very successful, as shown in the gel below. We then performed the cycle-pure spin protocol to remove contamination from our PCR product, and then proceeded to perform a restriction digest on the product with HindIII and"

The plasmid in which LovTAP is being express is pSB3K3 with a copy number around 20 to 30, while trpL-RFP construction is inside plasmids pSB1C3 and pSB1A2; both are high copy number plasmids (100 to 300 per cell). So there are many trpL binding sites that should be repressed by LovTAP. The ideal condition for this experiment would be to have LovTAP and trpL+RFP constructions inside the same plasmid.
Using the LovTAP constructions fused to promoters with different strength, it can be tested at what levels of expression, the LovTAP light regulation is better. It is already known that under high expression levels of LovTAP, trpL promoter is repressed even in dark. To test this scenario J23102 promoter was used.
Qualitative experiment
The qualitative approach was designed to observe and compare the RFP production in the cells harboring LovTAP exposed to light versus dark conditions, both in wild type and trpR mutant strains. Under blue light conditions, when LovTAP repressor activity is activated, it is expected to observe a lower level of RFP in comparison to the cells maintained in the dark state.
Experimental procedure
The samples used were: trpL+RFP reporter system in plasmid pSB1C3, Lausanne trpL-RFP reporter system, LovTAP under promoters J23117, J23114, J23105 and J23102.
Only one colony of each co-transformation was used along the experiment and was tested under light and dark conditions.
TrpR mutant and wild type cells were co transformed using 5 µL of each plasmid (trpL-RFP in pSB1C3/ pSB1A2 and each LovTAP construction in pSB3K3). For each co transformation one  tube containing 5 ml of  LB medium with Kanamicyn and chloramphenicol or Kanamicyn and ampicillin, was inoculated from  a single colony of DH5α. Cultures were grown  overnight (~15hrs) at 37°C with spinning at 250rpm in dark conditions. Then, 1 ml of broth was taken and transferred into 5 ml of fresh LB medium with antibiotics. The cultures were grown for approximately 13 hours under the previous conditions but some were exposed to blue light (470nm) while others were maintained in dark."

It is also possible to use PCR product as insert. Digest after PCR with corresponding restriction enzymes and clean up with PCR clean-up kit. This could lead to higher yields of insert DNA because a lot of DNA gets lost during the gel electrophoresis clean up.
Sometimes some BioBricks are hard to assemble. Then you have to clean up the vector by gel electrophoresis as well.

Modified from Silver lab and Assembly standard 25 :
This assembly method can be used for fusion protein assemblies with BioBricks which are bigger than 150 bp. The BioBrick should be at least 500 bp bigger or smaller than the backbone. The BioBrick, which complies with these conditions, is used as the insert and is assembled into the prefix or suffix of the other used BioBrick, which is called vector and needs to be available in the BioBrick Assembly standard 25 . You have to differentiate between a prefix and a suffix insertion.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," of the project did not allow us to do that as it was only until the later stages of the project that we came up with the idea of bead encapsulation. We also would have liked to have tested whether the bead could retain its shape and integrity outside of the CaCl2 for 3 months, as well as potential long term storage methods for the beads. Freezing the beads proved unsuccessful for us, but storing them in a cold room gave us promising results.
Another important consideration is that the gel we used had to be non-toxic to humans. Many medical devices are made from silicone due to its inert nature and the fact that it does not cause any allergies or side effects – this material seemed ideal when bearing in mind the safety aspect of our project. The fact that catheters themselves are made from it shows that silicone polymers are safe for use inside the human body.
Catheter Design
There are 3 main parts in the design of a catheter; these parts are discrete and modular so therefore anything from one to all three could be implemented.
This would be the overall design of the catheter with all three elements. It was designed while taking into account all the safety research we carried out.
AlgiBeads
Introduction
In order to stop the biofilm forming on the inside of the catheter it will contain beads that have our bacteria encapsulated inside of them however the protein is still able to diffuse out. This is needed as a way to contain the bacteria so they won’t be free in the urinary tract and therefore cause potential health problems for the patient.
Below is a diagram of our cells secreting proteins out of the beads that they are contained in.
These beads could also be contained outside the body inside a bag of sterile water; this bag would then be plugged into a 3-way Foley catheter. This solution would then be washed through the catheter and into the bladder, therefore tackling any infection that may be present in the lining of the bladder.
First attempt at making the beads using Sodium Algniate
To see our process of designing and making the beads, look here.
Proof of Principle
Chemistry in Making the Beads
The gel created to encapsulate the bacteria is made of Calcium Alginate; this is synthesised when aqueous Sodium Alginate solution is dropped into Calcium Chloride solution.
Calcium Alginate is a water-insoluble gelatinous polymer; therefore it forms beads when the sodium ions are exchanged with the calcium ions. Each calcium ion can bond with two alginate polymer chains; this is called cross-linking. As the sodium ions can only bind to"

The upper right dial shows the health of the gut, the left is healthy and the right is critically ill. In difficult circumstances, our E. coli needs to fight not only IBD but also colorectal cancer. Fighting, warriors!
4 The 5th CCiC
On August 27, we attended the fifth CCiC held by ShanghaiTech university.
We presented our project at this meeting and had communication with other iGEM teams.
While communicating with the SJTU-BioX-shanghai team, we learned about another pathway of perceived nitric oxide-mediated by the promoter PyeaR. We wanted to compare the performance differences between the promoter PyeaR they used and the promoter PnorV we used later. In addition, an iGEMer introduced the improved SYNB1618 strain obtained by E. Coli Nissle 1917 with better safety. We are prepared to use this strain in the future. Through this meeting, we made a lot of friends and got a lot of useful advice.
5 Visitation of pharmaceutical factory
We wanted to make the lab work available to the market one day, so we asked ourselves if there was a possibility of mass production of the drug in our program. It is what we need to think about. With such an issue in mind, we visited pharmaceutical companies.
While some of our outreach to our community was short-term, we worked closely with our community partners to ensure that our impact does not end with this project. We will construct an organization aiming to learn more about IBD and other intestinal disease,and to devoted ourselves into the cause of provoking people's awareness of these diseases.
During the whole process, the researchers introduced to us the production method of the drug Zhengchangsheng, which inspired us to make our engineered bacteria into capsules for oral use by patients in the future.

Project
  1. We standardized the SRRz lysis gene to build a novel visible reporter.
  2. We screened out a series of operons specifically responding to different kinds of heavy metal ions which can be expressed in E.coil BL21. And we make a collection of these parts.
  3. We linked our reporter with different heavy metal ion-specific operons, to create a series of new Devices, and transform these devices into Escherichia coli BL21, to construct a series of heavy metal ions bio-sensors.
  4. We verified that the Devices(BioBrick Parts) of our own design did work as we expected.
  5. In order to realize the quantitative analysis, we built a model which takes time and concentrations of heavy metal ions as arguments and β-galactosidase as dependent variable.
  6. We demonstrated our engineering bacteria under realistic conditions (water from natural environment added with heavy metal ions). Our devices could rapidly detect heavy metal ions in aqueous solution and the reporter is remarkably visible.
  7. We developed a kind of cell phone app matching to our method. With the app, our devices are able to detect the chemical substances quantitatively in a certain concentration range..
  8. In summary, we build a novel visible reporter and develop an efficient method that can be widely used in the field of detection.
Practices
  1. At the beginning of the project, we interviewed Guining Lu (Professor of School of Environmental Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology) to learn about the status of heavy metal pollution in South China and the existing means of detection. And we find the demand of the method to detect heavy metal ions more conveniently.
  2. We interviewed Xiongwen Yang (Professor of Law School, South China University of Technology) to learn about the China 's existing laws and regulations governing microbial products, which ensured the legitimacy and safety of our project.
  3. We interviewed the Environmental Protection Administration of Xiaolan Town to learn about the local situation of heavy metal pollution, verify the feasibility of our project and"

PmrB(LBT) is a engineered PmrB gene, where PmrB is a sensor histidine kinase present in the inner cell membrane of many species of bacteria, including E. coli and S. enterica. With a 30 amino acid periplasmic loop, it is capable of binding iron (III) and aluminium ions. The binding event induces a conformational change of the protein, which leads to ATP phosphate-derived autophosphorylation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, followed by transfer of the phosphate group onto the transcriptional regulator PmrA. As part of our project, the periplasmic iron/alumin ium-binding loop of the PmrB was substituted with a synthetic sequence - a lanthanide-binding ta g, intended to bind lanthanide ions, with terbium in particular. Such a binding event would then induce the aforementioned conformation change and phosphorylation of the PmrA, leading it to bind to the PmrC promoter, to allow for expression of"

It was a great opportunity to present for the first time our project to other people. We created a poster for the occasion. This experience permit us to challenge our project to different views and we have seen what the other teams are working on.
It was really interesting and we bonded with other teams thanks to the party organized by our french host.

Coupled with our wetlab observation, we outlined a production procedure regarding both Bottome-Up and Top-Down GenSniper Genome.
Production Scheme of GenSniper
Plasmid GenSniper Production Modeling
One of our subproject is the use nakes plasmid bound with a specified protein as the vector of gene therapy DNA. The normal replication process of plasmid will be disrupted due to the binding of specified protein(in our model,lambda repressor). If the protein has a high affinity with the plasmid we will have more fraction of plasmid protein complex however with less plasmid substrates. Considering production of the plasmid protein complex, we want to maxize the amounts of plasmid protein complex, so a balance between the amounts of plasmid and protein is needed. In this model, we want to find out the optimized parameters for this plasmid vector production process.
Plasmid GenSniper project design
Dimmer formation and dissociation between λ rep-fiber
parameters:
kdon =0.05/(M*sec) [1,6]
kdoff =0.5/sec
DNA protein complex’s binding and dissociation is a dynamical process
parameters:
kon =0.021/(mole*sec) binding rate of dimers to DNA
koff1 =0.04/sec  unbinding rate of cI dimer from Or1
koff1 =1.026/sec unbinding rate of cI dimer from Or2
koff1 =5.197/sec unbinding rate of cI dimer from Or3
Notes:we get these values from [2]. Cao.etc estimate these values  from experimentally measured protein diffusion coefficient in e.coli and Gibbs free energy. We give all the three unbinding rate of cI dimer from three kinds of binding sites to find out the best site we want to use in the experiment.
Replication of plasmid
plasmid replication is a complex process, here we use decay rate replication as a simplified model to mimic negative regulation. Three general classes of regulatory mechanisms have been studied in depth, namely those that involve directly repeated sequences (iterons), those that use only antisense RNAs and those that use a mechanism involving an antisense RNA in combination with a protein. For more detailed info about Control of plasmid replication and copy-number: [1] . An detailed mathematical model is described"
