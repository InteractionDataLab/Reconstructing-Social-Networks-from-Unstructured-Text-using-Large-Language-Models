Laccase is a kind of copper-containing oxidoreductase. In the reduction reaction, the electron from the oxidation is transferred to the other three copper ions. These ions form a trinuclearic cluster, which transfers electrons to the terminal electron acceptor oxygen [5] .
Figure 3. Laccase structure and catalytic reaction. The structure comes from PDB database. Laccase acts on diphenols and related substances as donors and oxygen as acceptor.
Meanwhile, laccase has the property of oxidizing a wide range of substrates such as phenolic compounds, so it can be used in sewage disposal. Our project used these two enzymes and transformed the cathode. We constructed the expression vector of RFP + laccase and transformed it into E. coli . The RFP can be used as an indication of laccase’s concentration and activity. According to the method of electron transfer, EBFC can be divided into electronic media electrodes and direct electrochemical electrodes. Considered that the latter has high catalytic efficiency and small restriction by environment, we tried to enrich the laccase on the cathode to enhance the redox potential of our EFBC.
We obtained the laccase from BBa_K863005 .                                     Traditional chemical approaches [6] of fixing laccase may affect the activity of laccase and are toxicological. So we hoped to find a better method!
A novel biology magnetic immobilization
Of course using synthetic biological methods is a great idea to achieve our goal. Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), a kind of bacteria that can be attracted by magnet, are a superexcellent choice for us. We noticed that MTB contain a fantastic structure--magnteosome. It is a magnetic nano materials covered by biofilm. And the magnetosome is essential to magnetotaxis.

After our investigation, we decided to connect laccases to the magnetosome's membrane to gather them on the cathode surface.
But there are two problems for us to solve. On one hand, MTB are anaerobic, it"

Potential targets
In our Human Practice, eliminating the potential pollution sources of EDCs seems to be impossible because there are countless cases need to be handled. All we can do is to ensure that our rivers and ditches are monitored all the time by governmental inspection. Based on these points, organic agriculture and exquisite aquaculture should be our ultimate goals to serve for and strive hard for.

Organic Agriculture
Take the application to organic agriculture, for example, it requires several field investigations for applying the organic certification. So far, we only focus on the design of EDCs detector, but with our current structure of Internet of Things (IoT) and smartphone APP, it is not difficult to integrate other detectors in the future. At present, we are also discussing with iGEM WLC about how to combine their test strips of Escherichia coli with our system. Then, back to the farmers, the main problems they generally encounter are the expensive application fee for certificates, the arduous accreditation process, remnant pollution in the midstream and downstream, the lack of post-tracking and so on. If we can use our instrument in the future, accomplishing the goal of detection, then it would not only largely reduces the cost but also saves a lot of time, and even executes a long-term real-time examination. For the government, the powerful examination system can help trace the pollutants based on the concentration gradient and find out the illegal factories. Moreover, it can also be used to discover potential farmlands for organic agriculture in order to elevate the land value. Under the fast-growing trend of the organic agriculture in the world, we believe that we can become a pioneer to accelerate its growth, to promote the competitiveness and to make more contribution to human’s health and environmental protection.

    However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage. Some even have distraction in main stone body. Meanwhile, there grows moss. Indoor stone inscriptions though are visible; there are obvious and irremovable cracks.
     Today, most preservation of lithic relics employ physical, chemical, or engineer approaches no matter where. It has been proven by reality that each of those approaches has fatal disadvantages for long-standing preservation of lithic relics, and those disadvantages would even lead to the ruin of lithic relics.
    Since forever, there are two categories of methods to preserve-- organic and inorganic. Organic materials cannot reach the standard of time to preserve relics such as epoxy resin, acrylic resin, silicone, etc.; inorganic materials would form hard shell that is not compatible or even react with the lithic relics, such as lime, barium hydroxide, and sulphuric acid.
     In conclusion, finding a long-standing, inexpensive, and efficient method to preserve lithic relics is an impending issue.

Principles of experiments
    The documents cited shows that even after natural weathering, biological decomposition, and acid rain erosion for a time period of time, some stone inscriptions, which are on rock surface containing calcium, remain in good condition because there is a thin layer of naturally formed semitransparent mineralised film that is hydrophilic and compact on such rock surface.
     In some part under the fine film, knife scratches on the stone from over a thousand years ago are still visible indistinctly. According to solid analysis, natural mineralised film is primarily composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate [Ca(COO)2·H2O] whose process of composition is interfered by microorganism.
     There are some advantages of calcium oxalate being a film as follows,
        1) In water, especially in acidulous water, the solubility of calcium oxalate is one order of magnitude smaller than normal calcium carbonate.
        2) Organically oriented calcium oxalate crystal's particles are fine and compact, which prevent the infiltration of toxic and harmful materials.
        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate"

Interview: María & Mehmet
Interview conclusions were:
It is difficult for artists to get in touch with scientists. Maria and Memo met by coincidence.
In this aspect, Printeria could help to approach artists to scientists.
Presevation of bioart plates is one of the biggest problems. The best way to preserve them is leaving the plates in the fridge. But using epoxy or other resins can help preservation.
We leave them on the fridge and we are trying to fix them by using transparent nail polish.
Consider working by layers when working with different types of bacteria. The slow growers should go first and after growing them, fast growers should be added.
As we are only working with E. coli, we are having no problems. But this piece of advice should be taken into account if Printeria ends up using other different chassis than just E. coli strains.
They don’t create their own GM microorganisms, so they think Printeria could be a useful machine to do so. Memo encourages us to write a manuscript out of this, even if the machine does not totally work. This could make people start using it so that Printeria could evolve.
The idea of doing a manuscript caught our eyes and we are planning to do so. It also made us think about creating the ‘Printeria user manual’ as well as an activity booklet for the user to learn even more about SynBio.
Do not only focus on creating colourful bacteria but on stand-alone scent pathways.
We achieved to create mint scented E.coli but we will continue doing some research in stand-alone scent pathways.
For doing bioart, just try different techniques: using glass beads, pipetting liquid cultures, using sowing handles.
We knew nothing about bioart and, thanks to Maria and Memo, we started developing our skills to quickly learn the basics about this type of art. We used the pipetting method to create Yturralde’s living art and the sowing handles for creating Printeria’s logo and for letting students create their own masterpieces in MAG.
Memo thinks Printeria is a nice multidisciplinary project. He encourages us to show who we are, and the way we learnt to speak a common language in which biotechnologists, engineers, designers and informatics, understood each other.
It is very important for people to know that Printeria is more than just a biotechnological project. It is a machine in which lots of different disciplines worked together with a single goal. And this piece of advice really helped us while creating our poster and while planning our Giant Jambore"

Quantitative evolutionary stability analysis of kill switches
Description

Abstract
Well constructed kill switches enable to safely keep genetically modified organisms in fermentation setups for long times.                     We develop a genetic algorithm based tool to quantify a kill switch design in terms of its evolutionary stability. A design                     providing redundant toxin regulation is found to reduce organism escape probabilities significantly. Thus, our advice to future                     teams is to incorporate redundant toxin regulation. We collected all kill switches ever implemented in iGEM in an online database.                     Our tool can be used by future iGEM teams to study their or already existing kill switch designs. Our collaboration deals with the experimental evidence of our theoretical predictions.
Kill Switch Database
Introduction
The fact that Synthetic Biology not only opens doors to a new era of science but also threatens humankind and the ecosystem                 we live in is widely known. The impact of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in nature can not be foreseen and are practically                 irreversible once having been in contact with nature.
Genetic constructs that kill GMOs on purpose once they escaped the lab environment unintentionally are a great way to reduce the                 threat through these organisms [1] . These constructs are called kill switches in analogy to their industrial equivalent (figure 1).                 It might be implemented into an otherwise already genetically modified organism. Once the organism escapes the lab, it will die. This                 way, it cannot harm the environment and applications of Synthetic Biology like our artificial endosymbiosis can be scaled safely                 to industrial level.
Figure 1. The kill switch analogy in industrial applications. It is pressed once an emergency happens so                 that the machines need to stop immediately.
However, one has to keep in mind that all organisms underlie natural occurring mutations. Therefore, the kill switch might be destroyed                 through mutations while the organism is under lab conditions. Subsequently, this problem causes that the GMO might threatens nature due                 to its survival after an accidental escape.
A kill switch is a genetic regulatory network. Such a network is built from biological components such as promoters and genes which                 are interlinked with each other. The network’s structure – also called its topology – plays a crucial role for kill switches: Weakly                 design kill switch topologies are prone to destruction through mutations. Therefore, a GMO's safety classification depends on its kill                 switch topology. This raises the need for a tool to quantify a kill switch topology's"

Abstract

Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the"

Software like Omni Outliner can help you sort out all the necessary points and arrange your thoughts when you are writing articles, and software like Mindmap can enable you to draw a succinct ""map"" of your ideas to clarify your thoughts and summarize the viewpoints. Therefore you can quickly extract a wonderful idea from the numerous viewpoints raised in the brainstorm.
Dropbox
During the project, all kinds of files were created unremittingly. To be specific, articles to read, work log to be displayed, finished program codes, relevant materials, photos of us, etc. How will you store the files? You don’t store all of them in only one person’s computer, for they are too many and other people may also need them. We have a great solution—Dropbox.
Dropbox is a cloud storage platform. It allows users to store files in the cloud, and thus any team member, knowing the password of the account, has access to these files no matter when and where. In the meantime, cloud storage is also very secure. Even if you accidentally spill coffee on your computer or the manuscripts, you can still keep your files safe.
Biological Cooperation
Fine communication in any field enhances the development of the field, especially when it comes to biological field. Nowadays, there are already some ways of communication in biology. They are traditional ways, however. Communication by literature publishing, meeting attending and emailing is relatively slow and hard to be used in global range. What’s more important is that communication in these ways will restrict a biologist’s research field. This suppresses the cross-field communication of biology. As we all know, communication of different fields will bring about amazing breakthroughs. Therefore, if the restriction can be broken, it will benefit the development of biology astonishingly.
BioPano is based on an online server, so it supports communication and cooperation perfectly. Users can release their research results on our software platform. BioPano will record the information and all biologists using the software all over the world can see the modifications. What’s better, we add group function usually in social software into BioPano. Biologists from different fields can form a group with BioPano. They can communicate more conveniently in the group. Meanwhile, BioPano offers other project co-management services to help biologists from different fields complete the research together.
Popularization of BioPano will surely improve the connection among biologists greatly and enhance the progress of biology. Furthermore, BioPano will change the frequency and pattern of research results updating of biology, and even show every single change of biology real-timely like Wikipedia. Every researcher"

In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace"
Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Human Practice#Panel Discussion_-_-_TEXT.html," Often articles have provocative headlines.
Synthetic Biology is not yet well known in the society, so people do not want more information but people who are in direct contact with this topic (e.g. farmers) get good support.
In Germany, there is no need of genetic engineered crops. Companies like KWS accept that mindset.
Genetic engineered medicals are more accepted than crops because nobody in Europe has to starve but medicals play a more important role.
A ""genetic engineered"" label on products should only be put into practice if…
.... people really want this labeling
.... products provide real risks otherwise labeling would result in a certificate jungle
Not only labeling to stigmatize products but rather there should be real risks if a symbol is applied.
Products also have to be labeled with ""pesticides"" because they are more dangerous.
It is not possible for everyone to order toxic genes because such DNA synthesis companies check their clients.
Microorganisms used in lab have some safety mechanisms which make them unable to survive outside the laboratory.
An open-minded research-sphere is desired.
The event was rounded up with a dinner in Sambesi restaurant, where we discussed further with the experts. All in all, we are very satisfied and proud of what we had organized and carried out. By asking some visitors of the event, we got to know that they liked it very much and they were grateful for the interesting information. We think our contribution to Human Practice was very successful and a good new feature to inform the public with current topics of science in a manner, they can follow.

GDP growth has averaged nearly 10 percent a year—the fastest sustained expansion by a major economy in history—and has lifted more than 800 million people out of poverty.” [10] A great deal of this growth can be attributed to intelligent government investment in burgeoning industries, compatible with the strategic opinions of Keynesian Economics. The rapid growth in the insulin market can be attributed to improved healthcare, diabetes awareness and the changing lifestyle conditions associated with prosperity. Further directed national investment could set the Chinese market on the path towards insulin independence, and eventually China may become a net exporter of the drug.[17]
India - Developing Nation, Very High Public Healthcare Expenditure
Insulin in India is heavily subsidised by the government, however this comes with a significant drawback.  The public burden for insulin subsidies in 2016 was 4.7x the allocated budget and growing at a rate of 20-30% per year.
Brand name insulin is virtually unaffordable for the majority of the 60+ million diabetics in India. [20]
Of the government response, a study by the Lancet says; ""Substantial attention has been given to the issue of access to medicines for communicable diseases; however, access to essential medicines for diabetes, especially insulin, has had insufficient focus."" [20]
Advertising to doctors by major pharmaceutical companies encourages the use of a multiple-insulin regime, despite the additional expense this engenders.
BioCon and Wockhardt offer a relatively affordable Regular Human Insulin [21] - we were unable to determine whether this is also subsidised;
Biocon - Insugen R: US$2.47/vial
Wockhardt - Wosulin R: US$2.79/vial
Figure 6.Alongside China, India is the world’s best hope for an Insulin Manufacturing Powerhouse - a net exporter that can rectify the market inefficiencies with an internationally recognised generic/biosimilar. Biocon and Wockhardt are home-grown companies struggling to overcome existing market barriers to their success. One possible strategy for protecting and encouraging local industry would be to set a maximum price on insulin within the Indian market.  As described by Wockhardt Chairman Habil Khorakiwala;
“Domestic companies make investments in the country and build facilities and the government is favouring multinationals by giving a higher price to imported products. They are enjoying huge premiums.""[22]

The protein has a 3xFLAG tag and since bonds are showing, OneProt is expressed. However, from this western blot, we cannot see if the protein has been cut, just that it is expressed.
Figure 2: Coomassie staining of E. coli expressing OneProt at early exponential phase (OD600=0.3), late exponential phase (OD600=1.5), stationary phase (OD=2.5) and an overnight culture using an empty vector as control. In order to check that we had the protein expressed in its full length, we did a coomassie stain on a SDS- page. Here we also wanted to receive information on the expression of the protein at different growth  stages of E. coli. We analyzed samples from early exponential phase (OD600=0.3), late exponential phase  (OD600=1.5), stationary phase (OD=2.5) and an overnight culture. As a control, E. coli with an empty vector  (PSC1C3) was used.
OneProt has a molecular weight of approximately 53.7 kDa. Unfortunately, there is no clear bond at this length. However, there is a bond at approximately 25 kDa, which is not detected in the control. We cannot  conclude what gives rise to the band, but it might be a cellular response to an unfolded protein.
To test what effect the expression of OneProt have on E. coli we set up a growth experiment measuring OD over time on the growth of E. coli K12 MG1655 WT, odor-free E. coli YYC912, E. coli K12  expressing OneProt and with an empty vector.
Figure 3: Growth curve illustrating the growth of E. coli K12 MG1655 WT, odor-free E. coli YYC912, E. coli K12 expressing OneProt and with an empty vector. From the growth curve, it is shown that the growth-rate of neither the strain expressing the OneProt protein nor the YYC912 strain is affected a lot compared to the E. coli K12 wild-type.
By comparing the growth curve of E. coli K12 expressing OneProt, TetR(+LVA), TetR(no LVA) and odor-free E. coli YYC912 it is seen that the growth-rate of E. coli expressing TetR is lowered compared to  the other strains, which means that it might be difficult to have OneProt expressed in high amounts controlled  by pTet (+/-LVA), with the TetR re"

○ Design
Step by step instructions(Fig. 6):
1. Amplify the target gene under error-prone condition.
2. Ligate the DNA fragment into a plasmid.
3. Transform the plasmid into a competent cell.
4. Pick out mutants shifting to 96-well plates for more experiments[27][28].
Fig.6 Four steps of EP-PCR
Conventionally, P-atp2 promoter wasn’t as well function as a mechanical device, and our machine could never use the only one alkali-induced promoter to regulate all the complex situation.  What’s more, we anticipated knowing the accurate response range of P-atp2 promoter, so we could extend it. Thus, the idea was appearing, by using error-prone PCR to mutate promoter, which has different efficiency and different ranges of response to the environment.
The process of mutating P-atp2 is cockamamie, when it does not require excellent skill of experiment or advanced technology. Even though there are several ways to change the reaction condition, we finally chose to put manganese ion into our error-prone reaction system.
After the amplification, agarose gel electrophoresis analyzed the promoter DNA fragment, which was using the P-atp2 as the template of error-prone PCR. The size of P-atp2 is about 355bp. Then the right gel was extracted. And another agarose gel electrophoresis analysis was done, while the P-atp2 was linked to Lac Z alpha by using the OE-PCR. Then we ligated the production into pXMJ19 and transformed the plasmid into BMTOP10.
While the whole positive-bacteria couldn’t be active 100%, our promoters still needed to be verified.
In order to attain our goal, the strategy we have devised was measuring the activity of enzyme β-galactosidase(LacZ). Most recently, we picked out every other 94 bacteria of experiment groups into a 96-well cell culture plates, the rest of two wells were the negative control(NC) and the positive control(PC). As these bacteria grew normally and the OD600 was up to about 1.5, we lysed cells, then added ONPG to start a color reaction and recorded the response time. After the sodium carbonate was added to terminate the reaction, we measured the OD420 and OD550, which could be put into the formula to calculate the activity.(Table.3)

Through the fluorescence intensity map, we have not yet clear the true advantage of MINI system. But from the following figure, we can directly observe the relationship between a nucleotide base number and fluorescence intensity. The red arrows indicate the short and strong features of the mm gene circuit.
Fig 3.5 Promoter and terminator of the nucleotide base length and intensity. (For example, mm represents the base length of Pmini + Tmini).
In order to verify that the MINI system was able to work in a variety of yeast strains, we invit-ed other teams to conduct a repeat experiment. Especially in TJU-China, the use of their own synthesis of yeast to complete this experiment also verified the MINI system with versa-tility.
Validation of expression on transcription level
The result of qPCR shows that at 22nd hour the system reached the highest expression intensity and the expression of four circuits is shown below. The error bars indicate s.d. of mean of exper-iments in triplicate.

In the chart, the RNA content of yECitrine comes as the following order: mm>mc>cm>cc, which is not completely consist with the result of protein level. mm’s RNA content is several times that of cc. Compared to Figure b, this difference in RNA content does not reflect the protein content very well, yet still, our MINI system has an obvious superiority over normal combination (cc), which confirmed our hypothesis. As shown above, generally the magni-tude of leakage is over 100 times smaller, so it can be ignored to some extent.
To draw a conclusion, mm has the smallest size and the strongest expression with a leakage that can almost be ignored. What’s more our system functions well in different strains and experimental conditions, which proves its potential to apply in various situations.

Support the entrepreneurial efforts of additional small businesses and non-profit agencies within Central Indiana and with alignment to the Biotech and Life Sciences industries.
Industry at a Glance
The DIYBiotech and community lab movements have taken hold and grown substantially, globally, in the last four years. There are community labs or bio-hacker spaces throughout the U.S., primarily on East and West coasts and forming in large metropolitan areas near college campuses. Globally, these community biolabs have formed in Germany, Australia, South Korea and Russia, just to name a few. This is a movement centered with a globally agreed, vetted by the U.N., common code of ethics. According to Ellen Jorgensen, Ph.D. and co-founder of Brooklyn, NY based Genspace, biotechnology is “the most powerful, fastest growing technology sector…poised to touch every aspect of our daily lives”. (TED Conferences, LLC, 2012)
Current Momentum
As of now the Biomaker Bench is in the process of establishing its legal identify as a 501c3 status non-profit organization. In addition, it is focused on developing an online community for Midwestern DIY makers.  Once established we hope to collaborate with extensive institutions like Biocrossroads to reach and coordinate outreach endeavors with the Indiana life science industry.

As we see, these modules are successive. After the logic module, we added a production module, which is responsible for the production of our outputs (GFP and an Homoserine Lactone that depends on the type of cell modeled). As one of our output is a messenger molecule, it has an influence on the quorum sensing module, which detects those molecules. Therefore, we have a feedback loop. This feedback loop comes from our choice to put only two different strains in our grid.
Decomposition of our system in different modules and submodules. The inputs are AHL and PAI2 and our output is AHL and GFP going out from the Production module.

Week 3: Plasmid design started, Modeling started
Wednesday, June 11th
We started plasmid design :
First draft of plasmids. The sensor plasmid is the same in every cell. Different logic + repressors plasmids are present in cells p and q. The logic + repressors plasmid from cells p is producing the quorum sensing molecule p, and another version is present in cells q which produces QSq. Colonies of p and q cells will be arranged in an alternate way on the millifluidic chip. Here as an example we use the lux system for p cells and the rhl system for q cells.
ΦC31 and Bxb1 are integrases. LuxR an RhlR are quorum sensing repressors. A riboswitch construct is placed around quorum sensing constructs to prevent leakiness of lux and rhl promoters. Type p colonies produce AHL by expressing the enzyme LuxI. Type q colonies produce Rhl by expressing the enzyme RhlI. In fact, we don't know yet which quorum sensing systems we will use. We will have to perform cross-talk experimetns in order to choose the ones that are the most orthogonal.
We tried to print our first agar millifluidic chip : we printed it too small, and the printer had resolution problems.
We wrote all reactions and found parameters from the literature for our model.

Backbone pSB1C3 was used for σx generator construct and comW construct. comX gene / comW gene were fused with BBa_K880005 which contains a constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23100 ) and strong RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). The purpose of this strong constitutive promoter and strong RBS is to unsure the large production of σx and ComW protein throughout time. Then, a double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ) is fused with the promoter, RBS, and comX. BBa_K880005 and BBa_B0015 were obtained from 2014 iGEM distribution kit.
Construct using pSB1C3 backbone consisting only σx CDS ( BBa_K1379004 ), and σx followed by double terminator BBa_B0015( BBa_K1379045 ) was also built to facilitate assembly of σx to promoters and RBSs of choice.
Bacterial Strain
The bacterial strain of E. coli used was DH10B. Since this strain of E. coli has clpXP degradation enzyme which targets ComX for degradation, an excess amount of ComX protein is required to maintain enough amount of ComX for Com-Box promoter induction.
comX and comW gene
comX gene and comW gene were cloned from NCTC 7465 S.pneumoniae strain genomic DNA by PCR using Vent Polymerase.
ComX Tag Protein
We engineered a C-myc protein tag in the 3’ ends of comX by including the sequence in comX extraction primer.

evaluate what people understand from the SB concept after the talk and when they think it will start changing our lives (survey 2).
A practical definition for Synthetic biology
People of the general public might not care about restriction sites, PoPS and copy number of plasmids; instead, they might want to know a general and practical idea of the implications of engineering biology, which involves “using engineering principles to assemble parts into biomachines in living organisms, to achieve a specific goal for human benefit”.  Though we know this definition of synthetic biology is by no means representative of the whole field, it gives people a mental image which they can communicate to others and express their opinion about.
Hypothesis
If significantly more people get close to our “practical definition” of SB after the talk than before it, our talk is an effective mechanism to communicate the concept of SB (objective b described above).
Survey 1
What does Survey 1 evaluate?
Survey 1, or the preliminary survey, is based on 4 questions:
What do you understand by “synthetic”?
Question 1 sets the ground for the concept, since the understanding of the term “synthetic” will significantly influence the concept of SB. Expected categories are “artificial/manmade, summarized, or related to materials, like plastic.
What do you think Synthetic Biology is?
Question 2 asks directly for the concept. A bit unexpected, this question challenges the survey taker to merge life  with synthetic. Here we don't have many expectations, perhaps except for artificial life.  This question will be directly compared to Question 1 from Survey 2.
Do you think it is possible to transform a living being (i.e. Bacterium) in a “biomachine” to solve human problems?
This question, without directly referring to synthetic biology, encounters the reader with the advance being made in the field and a direct application of it. It lets us know about previous information the taker may have about general biotechnology.
What kinds of problems do you think that could be solved?
This question makes the taker think about human needs or problems that haven't been successfully addressed by now. Prioritization of “needs” gives us information about the personal need of the individual; namely, it is important to draw a line between the first need an the second one, more carefully thought about. It also lets us know about the future acceptance of SB by the individual given that the problem solved is related to his view of  a “need” (therefore, main fields of opportunity for SB).

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

BEACH HP
At the dawn of September 2, 2018, a set of students clad in black and blue descended on the Elliot’s beach, Besant Nagar.  The team from REC joined the spirited public campaign of iGEMers in raising awareness about synthetic biology. We were equipped with survey forms that tested public knowledge about synthetic biology and took with us a packet of chocolates for the children. In one of the games, the crowd moved a loop around a twisted wire without it coming in contact with the wire, with each contact eliciting a loud beep. In the game of spot the differences, the crowds lifted green and red coloured placards on completion of the game. These were symbolic of our project where the mutants fluoresce in green colour. We explained the intent and nature of synthetic biology and collected filled survey forms. It was a wonderful morning as the dog walkers, students, families and marathon runners engaged us with intense conversations on synthetic biology.
EACH CLEAN UP
As a part of our collaboration with VIT, we joined the beach cleanup on June 17 on the shores of Marina. Armed with trash bags and gloves, we scoured the entire area clearing the trash. Teams from VIT, REC and IIT Madras were part of the initiative and we believed truly in the cause.  By the time we were done, the stretch had returned to its natural magnificence. We are immensely thankful to have been a part of the initiative.
ALL INDIA Igem MEET
We took part in the All India IGEM meet up 2018 that was held in Banglore. In a welcoming atmosphere of Igem teams from across the country, we had an opportunity to learn about multiple projects and listen to suggestions and comments regarding each project. We explained the mutagenesis technique that we were developing and in the end received an overall positive review regarding the scope of the project. The comments recognized the startling simplicity and the reduction in time consumption of the project. One recurrent question that we were asked was how we were planning to eliminate the false positive and negative results that could arise from the binding of a single primer"

Other elements like metals may have an increased magnetic moment as long as their electron orbit are unfilled, meaning they are unbound. Mn2+, Fe3+ have a magnetic moment of about 5 µB, Cr2+, Mn3+, Fe2+ and Co3+ have a magnetic moment of 3 µB. [http://www.diss.fu-berlin.de/diss/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDISS_derivate_000000000626/2_f-Kapitel1.pdf?hosts=]
Because of the variety of atomar magnetic properties, magnetism can be divided into different forms by looking at apparent forces and effects.        There is diamagnetism, antiferromagnetism, paramagnetism, ferrimagnetism, superparamagnetism and Ferromagnetism. Ferromagnetic forced are about 1000 times stronger than super paramagnetic forces. However, it turns out that creating ferromagnetic particels or residues is very difficult (see magnetite formation in magnetospirrilium bacteria). Also note that in a lot of biological papers, people tend to mix e.g. super paramagnetism with ferromagnetism [Various magnetic Nanoparticles Paper].
Magnetic properties are depended on the crystal structure of a metall particle. The magnetic moment is proportional to the aligment of the electron spins within an component. If electron spins are alignt magnetism can be observed. However on a nanoscale real ferromagnetism can only be noted after a critical particle size of 128 nm.[An-Hui Lu, An-Hui; E. L.

Ed. 46 (8): 1222–1244]       This is due to thermal fluctations that prevent the alignment of electron spins and therefore prevent the development of sufficient magnetic moments. Because of this phenomena all meassurements for magnetism are usually conducted at very low temperatures.
All magnetic effects that are observed for particles between 1 nm to 100 nm are considered superparamagnetic. Superparamagnetic nanoparticles only show magnetic effects when an external magentic field is applied. This field aligns the electron spins in the particle resulting in an magnetic moment mediated by an external magnetic field.       [Picture Atomarer Magnetismus]

The fraction of lactic acid in P(LA-co-3HB) influences the melting temperature of P(LA-co-3HB) (Yamada, et. al., 2010). The melting temperature varies between 100-176 degrees on Earth. In the cells, P(LA-co-3HB) accumulates in a form of granular structures in the E. coli (Fig. 1A) where we expect somewhat similar when synthesized in B. subtilis.
When cells fermentate, they naturally produce lactate which is one of the substrate along with acetyl-CoA for P(LA-co-3HB) synthesis. Both of these derives from pyruvate as shown in Figure 1B. This step is naturally present in B. subtilis connected to sucrose catabolic pathway. As an inspiration from the work done in Yamada and coworkers (2010) and by iGEM team, Yale iGEM 2013 in E. coli, we introduce four heterologous genes for the synthesis of P(LA-co-3HB).
The four heterologous genes that are integrated are
Propionate-CoA transferase (PCT): converts lactate into lactyl-CoA - BBa_K1975001
β-ketothiolase (PhaA): converts Acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA - BBa_K1975002
NADPH-dependent acetyl-CoA reductase (PHaB): converts Acetoacetyl-CoA til (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA - BBa_K1975003
Lactate polymerizing enzyme (LPE): is a lactate polymerizing enzyme and is a mutated version of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase from pseudomonas species - BBa_K1975000
Figure 1:Figure 1: (B) Illustrates the biosynthetic pathway for P(LA-co-3HB) production B. subtilis. B. subtilis naturally produces lactate and Acetyl-CoA when fermentation of sucrose occurs. These two intermediates are used as substrates by the heterologous enzymes introduced to B. subtilis. (A) shows P(LA-co-3HB) accumulation in E. coli JLX10 strain forming granules like structure.

TUST_China,2018,Team:TUST China#Detection_-_-_TEXT.html,"3]. tet(A) gene can code a transmembrane efflux protein that resistance to tetracycline. This is an energy-dependent process that decreases the accumulation of the antibiotic in whole cells. This protein functions as a metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter.
The tetracycline repressor (TetR) is the repressor of the tetracycline resistance element; its N-terminal region forms a helix-turn-helix structure and binds DNA. Binding of tetracycline to TetR would reduces the repressor affinity for the tetracycline resistance gene (tetA) promoter operator(gene tetO) sites. And gene tetO is the tetracycline operon which can be binding the tetracycline repressor to control the expression of downstream genes.
In general, TetR protein binds to TetO domain to inhibit the expression of downstream genes. When tetracycline enters the E.coli, it will binds to free magnesium ions to form a complex and then acts on the TetR protein, making it unable to block the downstream pathway. Therefore, transmembrane protein TetA is expressed and excreted tetracycline chelates out of the membrane. At the same time, the GFP protein would also be coding to make the bacterial with green fluorescence.
We also want to increase the sensibility of the detectionn chasis, so we have exchanged the position of gene tet(R) and gfp. After this action, we have found that the bacterial would growth slowly compared with the nomal detection chasis.

Human Practices
Establishment of New Human Practice
Here we present an outline of our workshop for the benefit of other collegiate iGEM teams reaching out to high school iGEM teams. We believe that formal collaborations between college and high school represent an innovative new approach to human practices with benefits for both the high school and collegiate teams. This was an effective way for us to engender excitement about both synthetic biology in high school level students as well as for our college students to demonstrate further mastery of the field of synthetic biology in general and their research topic specifically by creating presentations and activities designed for the high school level.
1.  Do an activity that will get the students up and moving. They sit behind a desk all day,You need to get them excited!
2.   Explain the point of the activity in a way they can relate.
3.  Show an interesting video to give them an explanation from another perspective.
4.  Do an experiment to give them hands on experience and a real-life example of your topic in action. This will also give the students a chance to see real culturing methods and use equipment. Be sure to give demonstrations of proper techniques and safety protocols.
5.  As the students finish the experiment, talk to them in small groups about their results. Why did they see those results? The students will be more willing to ask questions and explain what they know in a small group setting.
6.  Introduce the topic of synthetic biology with a short video or activity.
7.  Explain the aims of synthetic"

Microscopy done for MG1655 22A, 20K, (22K was already in stat phase despite being OD600 = 0.2 -- cells were short, non-fluorescent); DH5alpha 22A, 20K, 22K
Week 7
Day 31
Microscopy
Dilutions of overnight cultures in 1:5 and preparing slides for microscopy.
Overnights for Interlab cultures were done in LB Chl, and upon 1:5 dilution in M9 stationary phase was achieved within 1.5 hours (validation via OD 0.7-0.9 and microscopy).
Day 32
June
1:5 dilution of interlabs in M9 media, and 45 min of incubation at 37C gives OD value of 0.4 to 0.5. DH5alpha strains showed reasonable fluorescence.
Day 33
June
Set up interlab for microscopy
Day 34
Set Up
Set up conical flask cultures of interlabs for microscopy and flow cytometry.
1:10 dilution in M9 media for 45 minutes gave OD values ranging from 0.27 to 0.35. Only MG1655 cultures were grown and analyzed due to limited number of flasks.
Day 35
Tasks
Tasks (no specific order; grab Leon for 4. and 5. at an appropriate time):
Make new bottle of M9 Modified Media without thiamine inside.
Wash (i.e. spin down 1mL of culture for 3 minutes at full speed, then decant, and resuspend in unmodified M9 salts solution) overnight interlab cultures that were grown in LB, and take instantaneous fluorescence reads and OD600. Repeat as many reads as you like (can reuse the same plate because the wells will be filled up with the same type of cells anyway, just make sure to fully empty them each time) until the 1mL of culture you washed is depleted (just so that we don’t waste cells and the availability of the machine).
Set up growth assay - aliquot M9 Modified Media into smaller bottle and add thiamine and antibiotics appropriately. Wash LB interlab cultures using this supplemented M9 media, and grow in plate reader for appropriate duration. We only have access to the FluorStar overnight today.
Grow up cells of your choice in conical flasks"

Introductory Lab Sessions (30th June - 27th July)
To train up the members of our team who hadn't experienced lab work before, and to sharpen the skills of the team members who had, our advisers planned a period of introductory lab sessions. These experiments were based around growing cell cultures and making E.coli cells competent whilst making us aware of important lab principles such as handling of equipment, aseptic technique, lab etiquette, etc. Please see calendar below:

Figure 6 shows the maximized growth flux generated by FBA model for aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Aerobic condition is set as oxygen flux=0, fumarate flux lower bound=-20.42mmol/gDW/h,acetate flux upper bound=3.134mmol/gDW/h, pyruvate flux upper bound=0.872mmol/gDW/h, and hexane flux ranges from -5mmol/gDW/h to zero. Aerobic condition is set as oxygen flux lower bound=20.42mmol/gDW/h
In this part, we used FBA to generate the maximized growth flux of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 when providing hexane as energy source. Reaction constraints were set based on literature [5] values and genome database was adjusted to suit our engineered construct by adding the alkane degradation reactions. Results show that the maximized growth under aerobic condition is around 0.513 h-1 , while the anaerobic growth flux is around 0.298h-1 , both enough to sustain growth. This means theoretically, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is able to grow in a hexane-containing media without provision of lactate or glucose under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
 
 
 
 
Maximum current generation and power output
Current is given by the derivative of the electric charge over time. The electron flux can be converted to current using Faraday’s constant 96485 C/mol
Given the maximum DET flux is 81.68mmol/gDW/h, therefore, the Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is possible to generate current up to 2.189A/gDW.
The upper limit of MFC cell voltage is calculated based on the difference of standard cell potential in the anode and cathode. The standard potential are summarized in the table.

2018 Team and Project
The recruitment for the 2018 team flowed continuously from the 2017 project building interest in possible members through presentations and in class informational sessions. Applications for members were due by January 31st and interviews were held during the month of February. March held general meetings to inform new members about iGEM as a whole as well as the 2017 project. During this month team members researched and proposed project ideas that were brainstormed in small groups until the team decided on a project. Originally the project was based in using transposon sequencing, which we later had to shift to a biosynthetic pyoverdine pathway, however the focus was always on improving aluminum toxicity measurement procedures. At the beginning of April our team consisted of 15 undergraduate students, 4 graduate mentors and 2 faculty advisors. Team leads were nominated in June for Wet Lab, Dry Lab, Human Practices, Fundraising and Interlab teams. May and June had the teams developing goals, running training workshops and outlining our sponsorship package. We also assigned individuals to keep our social media pages update over the course of our project. Team members were kept busy during our planning and training months and continuing over the course of the summer by participating in our science communication PLOSibilities blog. June also had the wet lab and dry lab team members looking at gene block design for the biosynthetic pathway genes of our project. From July until October members were heavily involved in our cloning procedures testing multiple gene blocks with lots of troubleshooting getting creative with different ways we could characterize our biobrick.
Faculty Support of the Project
Dr. John Rohde for helping us design our project from the start, continued help troubleshooting, supplies and giving advice every step of the way on every aspect of the project. As well his extensive contribution of his time from attending meetings to student dropping in and asking questions. Dr. Louis Murray for help arranging our lab space and supplies contributions."

BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"95% confidence interval of the dependent variable means under the different levels of the independent variable, and then we can analyze the degree of the different levels. But the precondition is that the data should satisfy the homogeneity of variance, in other words, the variance of the data should be the independent identically distributed. In the next part of the modeling, we will use the one-way analysis of variance to analyze the data, and then deal with the data.
To determine whether the data suitable for single factor analysis of variance
We use the SPSS to do the homogeneity test of variance with the data we got, the outcome is shown in the figure below:
Fig.4 The figure of the data’s homogeneity test of variance
From the figure, we can see the data’s variance is 0.519, bigger than 0.05. Therefore, we can think the data meets the requirement about the homogeneity of variance and we can use the one-way analysis of variance to deal with the data.
3.0 - Construct the F-test statistics
The independent variable is a classified variable which values 0 and 1 to describe whether the tax is added into the test tube. The dependent variable is the change of the micrutubule’ length, our modeling is shown below:
$$ y = u_i + \varepsilon_{ij} \tag{1} $$
In the equation (1), \(y\) is the dependent variable, the change of the microtubule's length. \(y_{ij}\) is the \(j\) observed value of the independent variable under the \(i\) level. is the mean of dependent variable under the \(i\) level.  stands for the residual between dependent variable’s value and it’s mean value,  also obey the normal distribution  \(N(0, \sigma_i ^2)\)
Then we construct the F test statistics. First, we define the quadratic sum of the residual:
$$ SSE = \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (y_{ij}-\overline y_1)^2 \tag{2}$$
And the quadratic sum of the elements:
$$ SSA = \sum_{i=1}^k n_i (\overline y_{1}-\overline y)^2 \tag{3}$$
SSA reflects the variance between different levels and the difference is made by the different elements; SSE reflects the variance in a certain level and this random difference is due to the selected sample’s random. For example, the measured length of the microt"

2017
Teenagers had the opportunities to extract DNA from bananas while learning about its structure and how it was produced inside cells. Through the extraction process, we described the purpose of each step, and invited them to consider the chemical and biological theory principles behind what they were doing. Both their parents and teachers encouraged us to hold more activities like this in order to help teenagers to put theory into practice. Now, there were no subjects referring to Synthetic Biology, however, most of students consequently found it interesting and considered it was important to life.
As a result, we decided to put our efforts to spread the word about synthetic biology to the next generation of scientists.

In order to popularize the knowledge of domestic water to young people and promote the importance of water quality testing, we elaborately organized the practice activity in the Xiamen Science and Technology Museum. We designed the small games and quizzes relating to water quality detection and quizzes to popularize the knowledge to young people.
Finally, we found that young people lack common sense of life water knowledge while it was actually very necessary to water saving and protection.

Part 1: THU-E Mutation Part
A plasmid  used for the construction of high-diversity library in vivo ingenome level. In  this vector, highly error-prone dnaQ mutant, mutD [1] was cloned downstream  of araBAD promoter to control the  mutation rate of the target genome by the concentration of araBAD promoter’s inducer, L-arabinose, in a strict manner.E. Coli JM109 carrying different vectors  of pBAD_B0030-mutD-sfGFP, pBAD_B0032-mutD-sfGFP and pBAD_SDA_RBS-mutD-sfGFP(this RBS sequence was derived  from the RBS sequence upstream of sfGFP in original AraC_pBAD_CI_OR222-sfGFP  vector [2] )were  constructed. By detecting the induced fluorescence intensity, we found that pBAD_B0030-mutD-sfGFP,  andpBAD_SDA_RBS-mutD- sfGFPhave  relatively higher mutD expression. The increaseof mutation rate induced  by our mutation part was measured by quantifying the reversion of rifampinresistance  caused by mutation in genome.pBAD_SDA_RBS-mutD-  sfGFPcould increase the genome mutation rate up to 10 times compared with  negative control with 1g/L induction concentration of L-arabinose.

(Re)Designing Life
This year, for the human practices portion of the iGEM competition, the Penn State team developed a video that explains synthetic biology in an understandable way for any general audience. This video is titled “(Re)designing Life” and addresses many topics surrounding the implementation and execution of synthetic biology. These topics include misconceptions generated by misinformation from the general public, the techniques used to perform synthetic biology, ethical issues surrounding genetic engineering research and the future applications of synthetic biology. Through this video, the Penn State team aimed to bridge the gap that separates the technical jargon used by today’s scientists and the understanding the common public has for common biology. As a result, the misconceptions surrounding these technologies will hopefully be eliminated, opening a new relationship between synthetic biologists and the population they wish to improve.
Why This Video is Unique
While previous teams have made synthetic biology informational videos for their human practices project, this video differs not primarily in content, but in intended audience. Most of the previous videos and workshops submitted to iGEM have been directed towards students attending grade school, secondary school, or even universities. The Penn State team developed their video with the elderly the primary audience. The residents of Foxdale Village, a retirement community in State College, PA, were given the opportunity to view the video submitted by the Penn State team. The age range of these residents spanned from 65-104 years, a demographic that has not been investigated by previous iGEM competitions. From this viewing and a short discussion following the video, the residents were able to gain a better understanding of genetically modified organisms and their relation to synthetic biology.
Why the elderly?
In addition to their role as an untapped demographic, the elderly provide an open audience available to give feedback and opinions regarding the synthetic biology video. While the elderly population will have difficulty adding to the ever expanding technology that allows genetic engineering and synthetic biology, this demographic can still have a lasting impact on the scope of the scientific world we presently live in. The elderly remain active in the political landscape through voting. According to the report summarizing the 2008 presidential election voting patterns, about 20% of all voters were above the age of 65, while only 10% were between 18-24. The latter age group has been well represented in previous iGEM human practices projects, but the former has yet to be reached. Until now… The Penn State "

Summary
It is an opportunity for every single person to understand the competition, together with a new frontier in synthetic biology. All of our team members actively organized various academic activities, and participated in many meetings inside and outside school to promote teachers and students to comprehend the field of synthetic biology, as well as to improve the international influence of iGEM. At the same time, it also made our team members accumulate cutting-edge knowledge, and provided a strong guarantee for the improvement of the subject
CPU BioX Club Academic Association
In the joint efforts of CPU_CHINA iGEMers, we established the first life science academic  association of China Pharmaceutical University---- CPU BioX Club (Figure 1). The daily activities of CPU BioX Club include:
Figure 1. The speech meeting for establishing the club
1. Journal Club
It holds mainly by students of CPU BioX Club to explain the literature, so that other associators can understand the life science within various sub-disciplines of cutting-edge knowledge well (Figure 2).
Figure 2. The journal club
2. Holding the debate contest
We encourage all students to participate in the debate contest and feel the beauty of life science(figure3).
Figure 3. Students in the debate contest
3. Organizing thematic academic reports
According to the content which students were interested in, we invited some teachers, sometimes, of the relevant research areas to come to  have the academic reports on their research areas to explain for the students Q & A doubts(figure 4).

There were students in the lower grades present, and some of them seemed to have trouble keeping up during this part, so we tried to simplify the details, focus on key concepts and use metaphors to help them understand. This seemed to help, but we still received numerous questions during and after this part.
Exercise session began with each student setting an objective, such as a heat-sensing bacterial thermometer or edible antibiotics. We then explained how to use KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and did a pathway-searching exercise with some simple metabolites. After that, we showed them the RSBP (Registry of Standard Biological Parts) that iGEM supports, and encouraged students to look for genes that are needed for their synthetic organisms. Both exercises were done via smartphones, and although their small screens proved somewhat of a problem when reading pathways and so on, they worked surprisingly well, and the students were quick and eager to catch up. However, some were disappointed at the limited choices on the current part list, which led to a discussion on the future of synthetic biology and its visions.There was a Q&A session between each part of the mentoring, and the students had quite a number of questions. Many were about our high school days, and our studies in college. But others were about synthetic biology, such as the differences between synthetic biology and genetic engineering. A lot of students were also interested in iGEM, and were impressed by college undergraduates and even high school students participating in actual research projects.
Overall, this session was a valuable opportunity for not only the high school students but also for us, too. The students got to learn about the unknown but prominent field of synthetic biology, and hear about the everyday life of a science lab. We were able to see how little ordinary students knew about synthetic biology and improve our educational methods and material. Although synthetic biology still has a long way to go, it is bound to reach its goal someday.

UT-Tokyo,2016,Team:UT-Tokyo#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," a extremely significant difference between the two groups. Data taken from the average of 3 samples, with error bars indicating the standard deviation.
Though the fluorescence measurement results indicate that there is a extremely significant difference between the construct BBa_K2070016 and BBa_K2070026, since we were not able to compare the measurement with Psigma 16 GFP, we cannot be sure how much of the fluorescence is due to the activation of the sigma promoter and not the leak from the inducible promoter. Thus, further measurement is necessary to better confirm the activity of the ECF sigma16 and its cognate promoter.
SIGMA 11
ECF sigma 11 ( BBa_K1461005 ) and its orthogonal sigma11 promoter( BBa_K1461002 ) was characterised by Team UT-Tokyo in 2014. Since our system in design requires 3 ECF sigma factors and their corresponding promoter, in addition to the new sigma factors that we constructed, we decided to improve the characterisation of the existing the ECF sigma parts so that we can better understand their activity for the use in our system.
According to our modelling results, the concentration of sigma factors must be tuned so that while it must be high enough to activate the sigma promoter activity, it should not be too high that it cannot be repressed by anti sigma factors.
The approach that was taken in 2014 to tune the expression of ECF sigma factors was to tune the promoter that transcribes the genes coding for the ECF sigma factors. However, they reported that due to the possible leak from the PBAD promoter, the sigma expression could not be tuned appropriately.
Figure 5. Previous iGEM results of sigma 11 activity. (Taken from UT-Tokyo 2014 wiki.)
Results indicate that though the ECF sigma11 factors were functional in activating the corresponding promoters, they were not able to influence the level of activation by tuning the expression level of promoter generating sigma factors.
We thus decided to test constitutive promoters of different strengths for generating the sigma factors and as well take another approach to tuning the induction of the sigma promoters, that is, by expressing the sigma factors on a plasmids of different copy number.
Figure 6. Measurement of sigma 11 promoter activity under different sigma11 generating conditions.
Strong promoter refers to BBa_J23101, while weak promoter refers to BBa_J23109. High copy plasmid refers to pSB1C3 (copy number of 100-300 per cell) and low copy plasmid refers to pSB3K3 (copy number of"

BelCas9-cas9Rev2 (GCCACTAGTAATTGCATCAACGCATATAGCGCTAGCAG)
Q5 PCR was performed on pdCas9 using these primers:
Annealing T: gradient ranging from 60-72ºC, elongation time: 1.5 minutes
Expected band size: 5349 bp
And this time it worked.
PCR products of pdCas9 and pET26B were purified (hyperlink), digested with PacI and SpeI, ligated and transformed into electrocompetent cells (made by Linea).
Result of transformation of dCas9 and iGEM Cas9 ligations
Basically all transformations had colonies, also control transformations with only backbone. Only transformations without ligase were clean, indicating there was probably some back-ligation of the backbones.
Colony PCR s with VF2, VR, BelCas9-cas9Fw2 and BelCas9-cas9Rev2 (for iGEM ligations and own ligations, respectively) revealed there were no clones with the correct insert.
I decided to focus on my own Cas9 construct from now on, and drop the iGEM construct.
pT7-gRNA construction
A glycerol stock of E. coli containing pT7-gRNA was streaked on LB agar with ampicillin and allowed to grow overnight. A colony was picked for making a glycerol stock, as well as plasmid isolation (Machery-Nagel nucleospin kit).
June 7 - June 29
No labwork due to moving of the lab.
June 30 - July 31
General
Electrocompetent E. coli cells were made according to the protocol . Transformation efficiency was very high (could not count the colonies, really).
Moving dCas9 to pET26B
New PCR products were made of pdCas9 and pET26B. I proceeded with purification and digestion as usual, but added a step with alkaline phosphatase (CIP, NEB).
Performed ligation and electroporation of ligation. This time cloning was more successful: some colonies on ligation mixture, no colonies on backbone only control.
Colony PCR revealed that some colonies probably contained the correct construct. This was verified by sequencing.

Strategy:
What makes our system unique is that we do not need a specific template sequence for ourbinding protein. Due to other randomization and mutation systems we gradually generate the perfect binder regardless of the origin of the target. So everyone who  need a binder to its target can easily get one himself in a simple and quick manner. Our system would be the next step in target related research that even spreads to the medical field because of its application in target drug delivery, the tagging of certain cells like cancer cells and the inactivation or killing of viruses and pathogens. We aim to provide the starting point and make fast responses to new threats possible. The process from a  new developed antibody to a real life application is time consuming due to the requirement of going through the three phases of approval. For example the FDA requires tests on animals, tests on volunteers (Phase 1) to determine its safety and side effects, phase 2 that tests its effectiveness by comparing it to different types of treatments and phase 3 that further examines its effectiveness in a large scale study that also explores the necessary dosage and combination with other drugs. The complete process is shown in the following table:1
Step
Requirment
Animal Testing
-preclinical testing on laboratory animals
IND Application
-review by a panel of scientists and non-scientists in hospitals and research institutions that oversees clinical research.
Phase 1 Testing
-studies conducted in 20 to 80 healthy volunteers to determine what the drug's most frequent side effects are and how the drug is metabolized and excreted
Phase 2 Testing
-obtain preliminary data on whether the drug works in people (from a few dozen to about 300) who have a certain disease or condition by comparing patients receiving the drug with similar patients receiving a different treatment
-short-term side effects are studied. Typically, the number of subjects in Phase 2 studies ranges from a few dozen to about 300
Phase 3 Testing
-begins if evidence of effectiveness is shown in Phase 2 -gathering more information about safety and effectiveness, studying different populations and different dosages and using the drug in combination with other drugs -number of subjects ranges from several hundred to about 3,000 people
Review Meeting
-postmarket requirement and commitment studies to gather additional information about a product's safety, efficacy, or optimal use

RIVM meetup (14/5/18)
In the early stages of our project our team attended a meetup hosted by the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and the Rathenau Institute in The Hague, the Netherlands. During this event, we met with other Dutch iGEM teams. The teams from Leiden, Eindhoven, Delft, Groningen and Rotterdam also attended the meetup and each team pitched their project. After we got introduced by each others projects, we got to talk with experts about safety, policy, after iGEM, ethics and society in speed dating sessions. These sessions helped us discover flaws in our project, which were solved during our design process.
The Rathenau Institute also introduced their own-designed iGEMers Guide to the Future , full of tips for integrated human practices. This guide was designed to help every starting, experienced or any other iGEM team in need of some guidance to get the desired result, so feel free to explore it. Also, we did an assignment for RIVM regarding integrated human practices and safety and made appointments for further aid with the assignments and general troubleshooting for our project. We want to thank the RIVM and the Rathenau Institute for hosting this meetup and for helping us with our projects.

On Thursday 19 July, eight of our team members left Utrecht in a van with the direction: Munich. After an exhausting ten plus hour ride, we arrived in Munich to attend the European iGEM meetup hosted by the iGEM team of Munich. During this weekend, we attended a lot of lectures organized by their team. These lectures were very interesting and educational and taught us a lot about biotechnology. Furthermore, there was a poster session, where we had a chance to get to know the project of other teams. This resulted in new friendships and multiple collaborations with other iGEM teams.
During this event several workshops were taking place. Team Utrecht was one of the iGEM teams that helped team Munich by organizing a workshop in team building. Team members of several iGEM teams attended the workshop. During the feedback session after our workshop, a lot of teams gave positive feedback and said that this workshop was very enjoyable and insightful.

Science Rendezvous
The Kingston Science Rendezvous is an annual event that showcases current research in science and engineering to the community. QGEM saw it as      an excellent opportunity to connect with people from different ages and background, and we held a booth that presented some interesting science      experiments and demonstrations. At the event we had three stations, the first demonstrated the process of kiwi DNA extraction with household      materials. This was meant to establish the idea that science experiments can take place in everyday life and to encourage parents to explore      science-related projects with their children at home. The second was a microscope station presenting a set of fruit fly abdomen cross section      under the microscope. This was prepared by one of our volunteers and many were impressed by the anatomy of the fruit fly. We took the chance to      explain the importance of fruit flies in genetic research and gave children an idea of the variety of work geneticists carry out. Both parents      and children had shown great interest as fruit flies are commonly seen in households and yet it was rare for people to be able to see their      organs and inner structures. Our microscope set up also featured other prepared slides containing different types of plankton. By allowing      participants to use the microscope, they were able to gain a better appreciation"

UAlberta,2018,Team:UAlberta#BeeLab_-_-_TEXT.html," can be determined and should have a known pathogen load as they would have not been in contact with other bees. Or,
Non-newly emerged bees which are worker bees found in and around the hive. The age of these bees cannot be determined and their pathogen load is unknown as they have been potentially exposed to unhealthy bees. From now on, non-newly emerged bees will be referred simply to as adult bees.
If our team ended up collecting drone bees, or even the queen bee, our protocol was to return them to the hive.
Bee Collection
After letting our hive establish its new home, we began collection procedures for our various Beelab experiments. First, we consulted with Paul Greidanus, a commercial honey producer, about the effects of collecting honeybees on hive health. He told us that hives regularly lose hundreds of workers daily without adverse effects as healthy queens are consistently laying new brood (eggs). With this information, our team was reassured that we could collect enough bees for our experiments without harming our hive.
Our team’s first choice was to use newly emerged bees as more variables can be accounted for. To collect newly emerged bees, we placed frame cages around capped brood. Our frame cages were enclosed nets which would trap any workers that had just emerged. However, we quickly realized that bees did not emerge consistently in large numbers for our experiments which reduced the number of bees we could collect for a given day.
Due to this limitation, our team changed our approach and collected adult bees instead. Our decision was further justified by the idea that collecting a distribution of workers would be a closer approximation of the age variation within actual hive, thus providing a more realistic dataset for demonstration. To collect adult bees, we removed frames from the hive and ran our container across it. This caused multiple bees to gently fall into our container, which was faster than trying to individually collect bees.  Paul Gredanius showed us this method of collecting bees and it drastically streamlined the process.
Bee Containment
To house our bees in our laboratory, we created custom bee cages according to previous methods [4]. Our design is depicted below. These cages had the appropriate openings for both feed inlets and removal of honeybees. Our mesh walls and flooring were designed to provide our honeybees with necessary ventilation and drainage.
Our standard feed for the honeybees was filter-sterilized 2M sucrose solution. These were poured into our feeding tubes which were 15 mL disposable centrifuge tubes with one to three holes drilled at the ends. When filled and capped, a vacuum is created which prevents"

As a giant network of saturated hydrocarbons, polyethylene (PE) is a storehouse of a huge amount of chemical potential energy. While most microorganisms are unable to draw from this vast store as they cannot metabolise polyethylene or smaller alkanes, review of literature suggested that some microbes are capable of metabolising saturated hydrocarbons as their sole carbon source. There are however, limitations to the length of the carbon chains these microorganisms can metabolise [1]. 
With regards to our goal – to design a metabolism pathway for polyethylene, it was therefore a priority to fragment PE before it could be fed to the microbes. Further study on several research articles revealed that Rhodococcus ruber was among the few microorganisms that could utilize polyethylene as its main carbon source. Laccase was identified among several secreted metalloenzymes when the bacterium was grown on a PE film ([2], [6]) and so was suspected to be responsible  for the cleavage effect on PE. Further analysis provided conclusive evidence that it was in fact Laccase cleaving the polyethylene backbone. 
 
Figure 1. Protein structure and enzymatically active sites of laccase [7].
 
Laccase belongs to a family of enzymes known as multicopper oxidases which oxidize a variety of substrates while reducing dioxygen to water in the process. As shown in Figure 1, The enzymatically active part of laccase involves a cluster of 4 copper ions at different oxidation states [4]. The catalytic mechanism begins with the transfer of electron from substrate to the T1 copper site as a result of its higher redox potential; the electron obtained from the reduced T1 copper is then passed through the intermediate electron acceptor, T3 copper site and eventually ends up at the T2 copper site [4]. The T3 copper serves as an electron acceptor in the aerobic oxidation process while the presence of the T2 copper site is necessary as a terminal oxygen reducing site. Laccases were long reported to be present in some lignin- bio-degrading fungi, where they catalyse"

Synthetic Biology Course
In 2015 and 2016 EMW Street Bio has been a site and home for the international course, ""How To Grow                     (Almost) Anything"" , a synthetic biology course directed by Professor George Church of                     Harvard                     University, with our PI serving as faculty and program manager. Many of the students in the team                     took the course last year and two are taking it this year. The 2016 syllabus can be found here: http://bio.academany.org/doc/classes .
We started brainstorming for our iGEM project idea in May 2016 based on what we learned in this                     course, but focusing on hardware components. In September, we decided to build Biota Beats.

The 2016 UCLouvain iGEM Team is composed of twelve students from our bioengineering, engineering and biology schools and two biology professors. Come and meet the team ...
Adrien Gauchet :
Adrien is a master student in bioengineering in chemical and bio-industry. In his field, he loves everything about catalysis systems and chemical reactions. Then, he’s certainly our chemist (our own Heisenberg) and our glucose syrup master (show him some respect). Thanks to him we have had the opportunity to grow our bacteria on a homemade media. Adrien will also be our GO (literally “Gentil Organisateur” = Nice Organizer) for our trip to Boston. By the way, he’s the french one of the team but certainly the most belgian of all the french expatriates. He would certainly be the one to come at our team’s meeting a bit tipsy.
Adrien in one song ? Surely, “Quand l’appétit va, tout va !” (Astérix et Obélix, Mission Cléopâtre)
Alexandre Mattenet :
Alexandre is a master student in civil engineering in computer science. His task in the Team is the wiki support! He has an incredible sense of design. Listening and playing some music with nothing else than a GameBoy and drawing at any time, this guy does real ART. For him the answer will always be 42.
Alex in one song ? Surely, ‘Nyan Cat’ (Tosh 8.0)
Antoine Godeaux :
Aaaah, the God!! Antoine is a master student in biology, but he’s our god. When he speaks everyone listens. For every situation he will give you some wonderful punchlines such as “We all make mistakes” or “Trust no one”. He likes when everything is straight and right. The God has a lot of experience in biology and he has huge ambitions for his future. He’s the one that makes a Skype for an internship on the other side of the globe while making some experiments in the lab at the same time.
Antoine in one song? Surely, “Downtown” (Mackelmore and Ryan Lewis).

Ligation
Materials
You will need:
Purified vector (plasmid) DNA sample
Purified insert DNA sample
Ligation buffer
DNA ligase
MilliQ water
Extra Notes
Use of a microsoft excel sheet is highly recommended for easy calculations.
It is recommended that in addition to an experimental ligation, that you have a vector and insert controls.
This is a quick ligation protocol. It is highly recommended that transformations are done simultaneously. In 20 minutes (after the addition of ligase), the ligation is ready.  This means competent cells should be taken out in 10 minutes after ligase is added so that ligase and cells are ready at the same time.
Procedure
Determining how much vector, insert, and milliQ water should be used
Measure concentrations of the purified vector and insert samples to be used via nanodrop, spectrophotometer, etc.
The vector volume = [desired vector mass (ng)]/[vector concentration]
The insert volume = [(desired vector mass (ng))/(vector length)]*[(insert length)/(insert concentration)]*[desired insert:vector ratio]
milliQ water will be used as a filler to ensure that the end reaction volume is 20μL.  This means milliQ volume = 20μL - 2μL (from DNA ligase buffer) - 1μL (from DNA ligase) - vector volume - insert volume.
Ligation (Experimental)
Add previously calculated amount of vector.
Add previously calculated amount of insert.
Add 2μL DNA ligation buffer.
Add 1μL DNA ligase.
Add previously calculated milliQ water.
Controls
Add previously calculated amount of vector OR insert
Add 2μL DNA ligation buffer.
Add 1μL DNA ligase.
Fill total reaction volume to 20μL with milliQ water.
Purpose
To ligate the desired insert fragment to the desired plasmid together.

In a second approach, the cells were lysed using a nitrogen cooled Precellys Homogenizer. After three cycles, cells were centrifuged at 4 °C and the membrane fraction was isolated as described in the methods section . After boiling the membrane fraction, the samples were loaded onto two SDS PAGEs, one of which was consequently used for a western blot, if the fusion proteins were used. For the western blot, two different antibodies were tested, an anti-GFP antibody and an anti-cMyc antibody. Figure (15) shows the SDS-PAGE after isolation of the membrane fraction. Again, no clear difference between the negative controls and the samples could be observed around 90 kDa.
Figure (15): SDS PAGE performed with the isolated membrane fractions.
The cMyc-GFP fusion proteins were used, which should be visible around ~90 kDa, differing slightly based on the PtNTT2 variant used. No bands could be observed around 90 kDa, which was subsequently proofed by performing a western blot.
The western blot (figure 16) performed with the same samples verified these results, since only bands around ~28 kDa could be observed for all samples except for PtNTT2(TAT)-cMyc-GFP and not for the negative controls. These bands can again be associated with the cMyc-GFP tag, providing further evidence that the tag can be cleaved of from the transporter. Again, no band could be observed for PtNTT2-cMyc-GFP, indicating that PtNTT2 with a TAT signal peptide is weakly integrated into the membrane, which would explain the lacking function of this variant. The weak growth characteristics of the strain producing PtNTT2 with a TAT signal peptide would therefore most likely be caused by accumulation of the protein within the cell.
Figure (16): Western Blot of the isolated membrane fractions of the strains expressing the cMyc-GFP fusion proteins.
Thick bands can be observed around 28 kDa for all samples except for PtNTT2-cMyc-GFP with a TAT signal peptide. The negative controls do not show the same band, but some unspecific binding of the anti-GFP antibody could be observed. Compared to the previous western blot, unspecific binding was significantly reduced. These results indicate, that the linker is most likely separated from the transporter either during the isolation process or already within the cell. This would be no surprise, given that the transporter is highly hydrophobic while the linker is"
