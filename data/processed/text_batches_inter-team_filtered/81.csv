Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#cbc_-_-_TEXT.html," for the project ( complete review ) and it was the only binding domain in the Partsregistry that fitted to the project.
Accessible organisms were searched via NCBI for binding-domains, -proteins and -motifs and work groups were asked if they could help out. The results of the database research were only two chitin/carbohydrate binding modules within the Bacillus halodurans genome (that strain was ordered for its laccase <partinfo>BBa_K863020</partinfo>). One is in the Cochin chitinase gene and the other in a chitin binding protein .

Meanwhile the Fermentation group of our university offered the use of two plasmids (p570 & p671), containing cellulose binding domains. The cellulose binding domain of the Cellulomonas fimi ATCC 484 exoglucanase gene (CBDcex) and the cellulose binding domain of Clostridium cellulovorans cellulose binding protein gene (cbpA) (CBDclos). The decision was made to use these two domains. Staying within the cellulose binding domain-family and leave other protein domains like carbohydrate binding domains aside would keep the results comparable. For example, changing to a different binding material would change the binding capacities of both domains in the same way. Also both are bacterial CBDs and no post-translational modification and glycosylation had to be dealt with.
To get to know more about these two domains, their properties and their proteins, the NCBI databases were consulted. BLAST was used to identify the cellulose binding domains and ExPASy-tools were used for further analyses.

Figure 6: Protein-BLAST of Cellulomonas fimi ATCC 484 exoglucanase
The CBD of the Cellulomonas fimi ATCC 484 exoglucanase gene (Figure 6) is a 100 amino acid long domain, close to the C-terminal ending of the protein with a theoretical pI of 8.07 and a molecular weight of 10.3 kDa. It is classified to be stable and belongs to the Cellulose Binding Modul family 2 (pfam00553/cl02709; Figure "

Minipreped 4 x pSB1C3, 4 x pSB4A5, 2 x rbs-GFP, and 4 x pSB1A3. One pSB4A5 tube is incorrect, it shows RFP expression. Also loaded the gel.
Orr
Made some chemically competent cells using the TSS buffer protocol. Started making a Java program that will allow lock sequence design based on the chosen RBS, and will design the equivalent key based on the lock sequence. The program will incorporate a database with all the working RBS segments in the iGEM registry, so that the user can choose which RBS he wants to use.

Background
Our project “The Gatekeeper” is based on two scientific publications  : the work of Marciano et al. (1998) on the pIV porin electrophysiological characterisation, « An Aqueous Channel for Filamentous Phage Export. » and  Spagnuolo et al.’s (2010) on defining the gating regions “Identification of the Gate Regions in the Primary Structure of the Secretin pIV.”
The pIV porin that we used for our project comes from the bacteriophage f1. It is a filamentous phage that infects Gram-negative bacteria and is capable of assembly and release without lysing the host cell, allowing it to continue to grow and divide. The assembly of the phage is coupled to its extrusion which is done by a machinery composed of three phage-encoded proteins : pI and pXI in the inner membrane and pIV in the outer membrane.
More precisely, pIV is secreted in the periplasm and then inserts into the outer membrane, where it forms a radially symmetrical 14-meric complex with a barrel like structure.
Marciano et al.(1998) brought a lot of elements to build our project and furthermore to create protocols. In fact, in this article, the pIV porin channel behavior (produced by the filamentous phage 1 to export virions out of its E. coli host) is analysed. This article describes two types of porin pIV, on the one hand the Wild Type porin and on the other hand  a mutant porin pIV (pIV*S324G). Marciano and his team wanted to see if between those two pIV porins some differences in the permeability of the E. coli’s membrane appeared. Let’s remember that staple.
First thing to know, the phage F1 produces a channel porin pIV that is placed in the outer membrane of E. coli. This channel is closed (avoiding the lysis of the bacteria) except when the phage is leaving its host ⇒ So it’s possible to open this gate but surely thanks to a gating mechanism provided by the phage. However, this last article showed that when using the pIV mutant ("

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"ET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in pur"

Wiring orthogonal and tunable SynTF-SynPro set
Here, we present an approach to design customized mammalian synthetic transcription factor (SynTF) –synthetic promoter (SynPro) pairs. SynTFs enable binding to user-specified DNA sequences (response elements, REs), SynPros, and silence or activate the transcription after SynPros. The SynTFs we designed were in a unified style containing three core domains from N-terminal to C-terminal: DNA binding domain (DBD), nuclear location sequence (NLS), and transcription regulating domain. We chose (G4S) as the linker to add between DBD and SV40 NLS(3) to provide region flexibility(4). We chose KRAB(5) or VP64(6) as transcription regulating domain to construct silencing- or activating-form of SynTFs, named SynTF(S)s or SynTF(A)s. Their corresponding silencing- or activating-form SynPros, SynPro(S)s or SynPro(A)s, were pSV40-N*RE or N*RE-minCMV (Figure 4A) . The critical step in choosing optimal SynTF group is to find enough specific and orthogonal DBDs. We used two approaches. First, we did reference search for those commonly used DBD originating from different species. Secondly, we in-house designed based on artificial zinc-finger (ZF). For the first approach, we chose Gal4DBD(2), PIP(7), ZFHD1(8). For the second approach, we utilized a modified 3-tandem Cys2-His2 ZF(9) as protein chassis. By replacing the DNA-interactional amino residues(10) on ZF modules(11), we have generated RE-specific mammalian synthetic ZF (SynZF) (Figure 4B) .  The SynTF-SynPro pairs we wired were listed in (Table 1) .

Report assay
In order to determine the strength of promoter parts in the reporter plasmid, the change of fluorescence intensities of the reporter stains in the presence and the absence of the inducer were measured. Overnight cultures of reporter strains grown at 37 °C in Medium A containing appropriated antibiotics were diluted at least 1:100 in the medium and incubated at 37 °C as fresh cultures. After their OD590 reached 0.2, the fresh culture was diluted 1 : 3 into 2 ml of pre-warmed medium A. Under high osmolarity conditions, the cultures were diluted with sucrose supplemented medium to the final concentration of 15% (wt/vol)[2].
Sample preparation for GFP measurement
After 4 hours of high ormolarity induction, 0.2 ml of each culture was moved to 2.0 ml eppendorf tube and then centrifuged for 1 min at 4°C, 9000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded from each tube by pipette. In order to adjust each sample to reach approximately same final OD590, appropriate amount of 1×PBS washing solution was added. The cell pellet in each tube was resuspended by vortexing. After all samples for GFP measurement were prepared, 150 μl of each sample was applied to 96-well plate and its fluorescence intensity was measured with fluorometer. The fluorescence intensity was calculated by dividing the measured raw fluorescence intensity by the adjusted OD590.

Then we used centrifuge to make them separated at 4 centigrade (In this temperature, we can prevent protein from denaturation for a little longer time) at the speed of 3500rpm (8000g and 3500rpm both worked) working for 10 minutes. We got the lower phase, and it contains our target protein. We did this twice in order to increase the purity of our target proteins. We used technology of SDS-PAGE to test if this system works.

Results of this experiment
Figure 3. In this picture of gel, the first lane is the original solution of protein. We can see that it contains many other proteins. The second lane is the lower phase (water phase), we can see that the target protein have been removed and some bulk proteins stay in the water phase. The third and fourth lane are the water phase got in the reverse extraction. We can see that the target proteins have been concentrated and some other proteins have been removed.
Figure 4. This picture was shot in ultraviolet, we can see clearly that our target protein stay in the detergent phase because of the blue fluorescence.
Figure 5. We used Bandscan5.0 to analysis the gel. We can see that target proteins have been purified by ATPS. In this process, other proteins stay in the water phase and our target protein stay in the detergent phase. When extracted by saturated butanol, target protein was concentrated in the water phase. The picture of gel shows that when used it twice, the purity will increase again
We calculated the efficiency of this experiment. It is 67.54% in the twice and fourth lane and 75.06% in the fourth and fifth lane. The efficiency of it is high to some degree, but we want get a higher separation rate and increase the purity of our target protein. In our next experiment, we used many buffer and different detergent to achieve it.

BBa_K1586003
The Exeter iGEM team worked in 2015 with toehold sensors as well. Since their switch was not characterised in vitro yet, we modified our trusted approach of testing toehold sensors to work with GFP. We modified our protocol in the following ways:
using black 384-well plates in our plate reader (Glomax Discover, Promega)
measuring fluorescence by excitation at 395nm and measuring emission at 509nm
using GFP with an appended T7-Promotor as positive control
Because the sensor was not available for order through iGEM, we ordered the sensor and its respective trigger RNA with an appended T7-Promotor for our experiments. You can find the ordered DNA Sequences at the registry

Background
Melanin Production
The MelA gene codes for a tyrosinase. Tyrosinases catalyze two reactions, as described in the figure below. Melanin is a macromolecular compound produced by the polymerization of the quinone product of the second reaction, and has a characteristic brown colour.
From Claus and Decker, 2006
MelA
Our MelA gene is from Rhizobium etli. Further, it is a mutant; it has a C to T substitution at the 1,000th nucleotide, which creates a Proline to Serine mutation that reduces the amount of time before melanin production is visible. (Santos et al. 2008) The plasmid pTRCmelA was provided by Christine Sanntos from the lab of G. Stephanopoulos to Duncan Rowe under the materials transfers agreement.
Using pTRCmelA as a template, we aim to show melanin expression in E. coli and isolate the MelA gene in biobrick form.

In CF patients, chloride secretion in epithelia is impaired while sodium absorption is increased which causes mucus to accumulate (as shown in Fig 2). Respiratory pathogens which are usually removed by mucociliary escalator are no longer cleared as the normally beating cilia are matted in viscous mucus4. Respiratory pathogens are therefore able accumulate to develop polymicrobial, biofilm-based infections in the lower airways which causes inflammation of the lungs leading to tissue damage.

Abstract

Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung"

UNITN-Trento,2012,Team:UNITN-Trento#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html,"-it journey, so here it is.
I'm gonna start with my thoughts on Mediawiki and some tips to manage to do something. I say ""manage"", because, you know, Mediawiki sucks.  I have experience with other CMSs, Wordpress, Tumblr, ExpressionEngine, even some niche stuff like Kirby (if you do web design, check it out!), but this thing is bloated. I can't make myself like it, since I think it's overly complicated. It's a wiki engine, so it should be much easier to use, since everyone should be able to edit things easily.  Just the action of editing content is a mess: take a look at Tumblr, for instance, it's much easier and self-explanatory. There's a clear separation between ""Theme"" and ""Content"" (the way it should be for non-experts), that here is very subtle. And it's beautiful: let's say it, the Dashboard is dead-ugly, and the themes feel like we're still in the 90s. That said, I don't know other Wiki engines, so I can't compare it with others. It could be the best option.
I still think a basic Wordpress installation would be simpler. Good-old HTML+CSS files even better, but that's just my opinion.
Enough with the criticism, let's see some tips. What I've been doing is creating the website on my local machine with .html and .css files, then creating the pages I needed here on Mediawiki, placing an html tag in the content box, and pasting everything inside the html tag of my file inside. Here's an example:
What Mediawiki does is parse all that as HTML, in so doing achieveng our goal Some notes: don't put the <!doctype html> definition, it's already in the Mediawiki template. Notice that the stylesheet has to be hosted somewhere on a server, or it won't work, so be sure to specify the full url of the .css file.
For this to work, you also need to hide the default theme elements, so they don't display. It will be specific to your needs, just use the Web Inspector of your browser to find what the main.css file (the one Mediawiki is using) is saying, and correct in on your file, it will override the styles. Ah, another important thing to consider are the Mediawiki controls (Edit, Recent changes, blah, blah): you'll have to add those manually, in order to keep them. Many are useless, but the Edit"

After the completion of our Education & Public Engagement Human Practices, our team discussed with Dr. Dokopoulou, analyzing the students’ answers on the questionnaires, their comments during the presentation and their overall stance towards our team. Dr. Dokopoulou’s insight on our analysis is included on the Discussion session later on.
Summing up our Human Practices, we further discussed the possibility of introducing Synthetic Biology to the high school curriculum, a move that we deemed to be daring. This belief stems from observing the insufficiency in prerequisite biological knowledge at the secondary education level, as well as from the fact that biology is an exponentially developing scientific field. Both those facts, led us to support that Synthetic Biology could only be approached as part of thematic seminars, presentations, school projects or teams, whose main goal is to immerse high school students into the biological and biotechnological advancements.
Prof. Kosmas Haralampidis
Biology Faculty, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece
Prof. Kosmas Haralampidis serves as assistant professor at the Biology faculty - Division of Botany at the University of Athens. Prof. Haralampidis specializes in molecular and developmental plant biology, and his research field is of great interest to our team. s. Our team met profesor Haralampidis in person, and discussed on the topics of Synthetic Biology and genetically modified organisms.
Regarding the introduction of Synthetic Biology to the tertiary education, Prof. Haralampidis pointed out two fundamental needs: Firstly, the need to reinforce undergraduate programs’ curriculum with classes that are prerequisites for Synthetic Biology. Among others, he mentioned molecular and developmental biology, microbiology and genetics. Secondly, perceiving Synthetic Biology as an interdisciplinary field, Prof. Haralampidis indicated the need of collaboration between scientists and research fields.
Thus, he suggested the creation of a Graduate Program at the Biology Faculty in collaboration with the School of Chemical Engineering or the School of Mechanical Engineering that would address biologists, engineers, informaticians and medical students. It was pointed out that such a program in the undergraduate level would be “heavy and biased” towards students, who must first grasp the fundamentals of biology and engineering and comprehend their principles in depth before moving on to the interdisciplinary field of Synthetic Biology. Moreover, Prof. Haralampidis mentioned that this graduate program would be of great interest to greek students, as many young scientists immigrate to other countrie (U.S., U.K., Germany, The Netherlands, France) in order to pursue their passion for synthetic biology.

MIT,2018,Team:MIT#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," patents were             usually framed using over-arching claims to include a lot of different things and not specific systems. With his help the             team learned that the lab whose research was so foundational to our project, ETH Zurich, had already patented the transplantation             of a two-component system from bacterial cells to mammalian cells. Furthermore, to be able to use our devised system in a             commercial product, Team MIT would need permission from ETH Zurich to make an impact beyond the bench.
Besides interesting dialogue about the scientific patenting process, Nevin also spoke about open-access research in MIT's             Synthetic Biology Center. With Nevin's help, the team was also able to gauge the transparency of our research and what areas             could be improved by filling out the Centre for Open Science checklist. The ultimate goal is to present clean, open-access, and             reproducible data that may contribute to dental as well as biosynthetic research.
Conversations with Oral Cavity Experts
Dr. Kimberly Weiss, DDS, Pediatric Dental Associates
Kimberly Weiss, DDS is a dentist at Pediatric Dental Associates (PDA) in Reading, Massachusetts. Besides over eighteen             years of experience in general dentistry, Dr. Weiss is an instructor and advisor to dental students at the Harvard School             of Dental Medicine. Team MIT visited her at the clinic to better understand the dental community's perspective on the project.
One of the major takeaways was re-evaluating how dentists would feel about a technology that could potentially drastically             reduce their customer base. The team was very surprised when she replied, ""Would an oncologist be upset if you cured cancer?""             To her, any dentist or a doctor who focused more on the number of patients they got and less on the community's health was in             the wrong field. She explained to us that dentistry is a vast and varied medical discipline, and even with less patients having             caries there will always be a need for her profession.
Dr. Weiss also provided interesting insight into the patient's mindset. Based on her feedback, the team decided to do a cost             breakdown to determine whether the technology was more economically feasible than traditional methods of preventing dental             caries (i.e. brushing one's teeth). In terms of accessibility, she highlighted how this would be potentially more useful for             high cavity risk groups as well as people in nursing homes who suffer dental caries and tooth loss despite traditional dental             care.

A new strategy was tried to add BamHI to the whole pSB1C3-T7-EB construct. However, due to limited time, we didn’t find the optimal conditions and didn’t get any amplified product. For troubleshooting, positive control should be used for the digestion reaction to exclude a systematic error.
Investigating possible bacteriolytic activity
Esp serves a variety of functions but many of its possible activities are undocumented, which was the reason we wanted to investigate whether it would in fact also be bacteriolytic.
We chose to perform a modified Kirby-Bauer test with TOB1 E.coli for which filter papers soaked with samples were placed on an agar plate to assess whether they inhibit bacterial growth.
Kirby-Bauer, First Attempt [❓]
In a first attempt at performing a Kirby-Bauer, salt-free agar plates were used as an optimal growth medium for E.coli TOB1. Autoclaved cellulose nitrate filter papers were soaked in cell lysates, where the soluble and insoluble fractions were separated in order to also assess solubility of our protein. The plates were incubated overnight and halo formation was assessed.
Unfortunately, this proved to be rather difficult since the agar and the colonies were very similar in colour. Nevertheless, the positive control (Kanamycin at 35 μg/ml) did display an inhibition of bacterial growth, indicating that our set-up seemed to work. We could, however, not see such a halo for our EB samples samples which might simply be because EB not being bacteriolytic / bacteriostatic or might also be caused freezing our protein in lysis buffer and repeatedly thawing it.
For a repeated experiment, we planned to use freshly produced protein and selective agar which might help making halos visible.
Kirby-Bauer, Second Attempt [❓]
In this experiment, two different EB solutions were used to assess whether freezing of the samples had a deleterious effect on EB activity. After incubation, especially on Endo Agar the bacterial colonies were quite easily visible and those plates were used to assess halo formation.

In theory we could have multiple different dockerin/enzyme fusions bind to the same cohesion flagella scaffold; thereby giving our E.Coli cell multiple functions or being able to express a full enzymatic pathway.
Future Applications
Metal Binding
Oil sands development in Canada is a very successful industry, however there are a number of environmental concerns associated with these developments. One result of these developments are significant amounts of heavy metals being released into the environment, including lead, mercury and cadmium [2]. The majority of heavy metal binding proteins are small in size, often under 200 amino acids, and should therefore insert comfortably within the flagellin protein, well within the size restriction [3]. There are a number of potential metal binding proteins found within the parts registry, including SmtA [4] and fMT [5], both of which are known to bind cadmium and are under 100 amino acids in length. We are hoping through the progress of our project future teams can successfully incorporate these proteins into flagella in order to remove metal contaminants from the environment.
Nanotubes
Nanotubes are microscopic cylindrical structures which have many applications due to their strength and flexibility, as well as their potential use in nanoscale circuits. The flagella of bacteria serve as naturally made nanotubes, and can be genetically modified to bind metals for the purpose of creating metal nanotubes [6]. Metal binding loops such as a histidine loop (four repeats of Gly-His-His-His-His-His-His) are able to bind metals including copper, gold and cobalt, and are small enough to fit easily within the flagellin protein [6]. By incorporating these loops within flagellin, it should be possible to create metal-bound flagellar nanotubes which may be used in the creation of circuits [6].

Penn_State,2011,Team:Penn State#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," on detecting the degradation and damage of DNA associated with ionizing radiation. The initial proposed design is shown below. It consists of two parts: a sensor based on a lambda phage bistable switch, and a fast-acting reporter similar to the reporter designed by the Imperial College of London 2010 iGEM team.
Project Details
The Sensor
The design of our sensor was based on the lambda phage lysogenic vs lytic switch.  Optimally, the system would be activated in the presence of DNA damage due to radiation.  For that reason, we utilized the lambda phage switch, which transitions from the lysogenic cycle to the lytic cycle when DNA damage is detected. The genetic circuit we designed focuses on the DNA damage-sensitive lambda phage lytic-lysogenic cycle switch followed by a rapid response reporter similar to the immobilized fusion enzyme system pioneered by the Imperial College of London 2010 iGEM team. An initial design of our sensor circuit is illustrated below.
Under normal conditions, PRM is active, which transcribes the lambda repressor, cI + RBS.  The lambda repressor binds to OR1 and OR2, repressing PR, which in turn inhibits the transcribtion of Cro and TEV.
Once DNA damaged occurs, the ssDNA binds to RecA.  RecA becomes activated and cleaves the cI repressor, allowing for PR to turn on.  Cro then binds to OR3, which represses PRM and inhibits the transcription of the cI repressor.  Now that PR is active, the transcription of the TEV protease occurs, which is used in the reporter structure of the circuit.
The Reporter
Our reporter system will use a modified version of Imperial College London iGEM 2010 fast reporter system. Imperial’s quick acting response module used the transcription of TEV protease to cleave the bond between the GFP, C23O fusion protein. This unbound form of C230 could then form a tetramer and convert the colorless substrate catechol into a yellow product.
Using the Freiburg BioBricking Assembly technique, we plan to produce a miniature catalog of fast acting reporters while reducing the leakiness of Imperial’s construct. To achieve the latter, we plan to link a second GFP to the C-terminus of C230; this new linkage would be cleavable by RecA.
RecA Co-Protease
The normal laboratory strain of E. coli, DH10B, contains an inactivated form of RecA known as RecA1. Therefore, a"

We collected many food waste samples from different sources, i.e., school, family and the canteen. After the collection, we obtained diversified and a large amount of samples, which provides a strong support for us to build a more realistic and reasonable database. Then we sent the sample to Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences test the salt concentrations of the waste.
Communication
CGEM Forum
Besides the idea-exchange seminar we had with the experts in Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science, before the experiments in summer, in August and September we contacted many iGEM teams in China and invited them to attend the CGEM (China Genetically Engineered Machine) Forum in October, which is organized by our team together with CIEI-BJ.
On 4th, Oct. the First CGEM Forum was held in the meeting room “Reddish Lake” on the 4th floor of WenJin International Hotel. In respond to the invitation, two high-school teams (HFLS-H2Z-HangZhou and RDFZ-China) and one college team from Beijing institute of technology came to the forum. In total, more than 70 teachers and students attended the conference. Our team was in duty of welcoming, leading the people, setting the room, as well as doing signing up for visitors.
During the seminar, teams first gave presentations on their own topics on the stage; then, the professors provided advice and improvement directions from many aspects including topic (purpose, experiment design, influence, potential danger), power point (words, color, number of pages), and speech (content, volume, order of speaker, motion, time management). Dr. Li, Dr. Cheng and Dr. Xue kindly provided every team with suggestions and opinions.

We designed a circuit capable of forming patterns in a controlled way. Using a modified and temperature-sensitive lambda repressor (cI), we can trigger formation at desired points in time. This time-dependent controllability, together with the possibility to change many different parameters and output signals, leads to an enormous tunability in the creation of the patterns. Our mechanism will stimulate advancements in a variety of industrial processes like the creation of novel bio-materials. This fundamental project could also speed up medical research projects like tumor formation and tissue regeneration.

Future Applications
The knowledge transfer from pure scientific research to the commercial environment is a major challenge to be tackle for both academia and industry. By analyzing the future potential of our project, we explore how our scientific contribution can be useful for different industries. The focus lies mainly on the development of artificial bone implants, where the economic rationale for further investments was analyzed combined with a brief description of the possible barriers in the future. Other applications for the biomaterial and medical industry as well as others are also described. On top of that we explain how a future collaboration with the TU Delft iGEM team could be beneficial for our teams.

Education
We introduced to the children in three primary schools (10 to 11 years old) about synthetic biology. A brief introduction created the perfect opportunity to play a custom built game around the DNA codon table. The goal was to teach the children DNA translation and to introduce mutations in a playful manner. During the first part, the children were given the so called ""Professor Robben"" sequence. Using the DNA codon table  the children translated the DNA, colored wooden blocks symbolizing the amino acids had to be arranged into the correct protein sequence. The blocks were made in the KU Leuven's fab-lab and painted by us. The children continued playing by mutating the DNA sequence and matching the protein sequence on the sticker table. Every time they were right they earned a customised sticker designed by us as a reward.

Team lookup
Who are team CLSB?
Team CLSB UK is an iGEM team from the United Kingdom on the High School track. They have 20 team members. Would you like to search for another team, search for a part or exit?
Protocols
And you can get a protocol by first asking the app to find some. Due to certain restrictions you can't ""one-shot"" the protocols command on Google Assistant (i.e. ""find ligation protocols""). However, this does work on Amazon Alexa.
Find protocols
Sure. What protocol are you looking for?
The app will then prompt you to tell it what protocol you want. For example, if you want a ligation protocol you'd just say
Ligation
Ok, I've found Ligation protocol. Ligation lets you take a strand of DNA that has compatible sticky ends and insert it into a vector. Would you like a step-by-step guide or to exit?
The app will then search the Protocat database and find you relevant protocols. It will then read out the summary for that protocol. You can begin the step-by-step guide for that protcol by saying
A step-by-step guide
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
The app will then proceed to read out the first step. Once you're ready, you can ask the app to move on to the next step. If you missed a step you can ask the app to repeat it, and if you've gone too far you can ask the app to go back.
Next
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Repeat
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Back
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
Where possible, the app will try to remember where you are in the protocol in case you accidentally quit the app.
If you want to add your own protocols simply add them to ProtoCat , a protocols database created by Michigan Software 's iGEM team. Once you’ve added protocols there, you'll be able to use them in the app within a couple of minutes.
Privacy
You can find out how we use data provided to the app in our privacy policy . We think it’s truly a gripping read.

OUC-China,2012,Team:OUC-China#HumanPractice#Camps_-_-_TEXT.html,"2th summer camp of life science and technology
*Why we held this camp?
Last year, we held 1st summer camp of life science and technology. Through this camp, most of the participants (many of them are OUC iGEMers) had developed their interests in synthetic biology and iGEM. After that, we studied molecular biology and introduction to synthetic biology by ourselves. This year, we become OUC-China 2012 iGEMers.
So, aiming at educating new iGEMers for OUC-China, we introduced synthetic biology and iGEM during this camp. Besides, hoping they can appreciate the beauty of nature and learn more far from books, we made a sea investigation in this camp. We love synthetic biology because we love where we live!
A poster of students in this camp
*What did we do during this camp?
After one year in university, most participants had learned botany and zoology. To  build the general system of biology, we taught them biochemistry and did some microbiology experiments. Now, biology has many subjects and many new disciplines emerge endlessly. To make more new disciplines known to them, we held a lecture during this camp to introduce bioinformatics, system biology and of course, synthetic biology.
3.Winter camp for brain storming
*Brain storming in winter vacation with professors
During winter vacation, we went back school early to brain storm. During the ten days’ camp, every iGEMers in our team read papers, speak out what they leant in winter vacation, talked about ideas and communicate with professors together. In our lab, we were enjoying the joy of science and exploration.
Brainstorming with professors
Living and working with each other for ten days was an inspiring experience for 2012 OUC-iGEMers. This was the first time for our team to get the feeling of being a true researcher and to use our own imagination to create things that we have never dreamed of before. Being fully absorbed in expressing our ideas with the most terrific teammates is something that a young person just has to experience!
4.Popularization of bioscience with young kids
In June, participants from the 2012 iGEM teams joined a multitude of presentations to expand the knowledge of No.39 middle school’s students in the general sciences. Presentations included marine biology, bioengineering, introduction to biology and  so on. Besides we prepared various interactive sessions for students to learn and practice experimental skills. We also displayed our work on the ‘Wu Xing’ system in 2011 iGEM and ratio sensor"

EPFL,2017,Team:EPFL#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," we were approached by EPFL’s study promotion     responsible Maya Frühauf, asking us if we could set up a wet-lab workshop     for and supervise a high school class visiting EPFL in the beginning of July.     Of course we were more than happy to introduce those high school students to     the concepts of synthetic and cell-free biology, and hopefully pass on our     motivation for the exciting field of bioengineering. The more than 25 high     school students, in 9th grade and from the gymnasium Lerbermatt ,     Bern, would be spending half a day with us, which gave us plenty of time to     let them do fun experiments with our guidance. After discussing the matter     within the team, we made a list of several experiments and prepared everything     for their arrival; we planned on explaining to them the working of chromoproteins     and letting them perform a lysate reaction in tubes. We started with a presentation     on what the iGEM competition is, placing it within its context of synthetic biology     and explaining how this field is transforming the world we live in.
We then explained the workshop we had set up for them. Experiments included showing     the enzyme activity of beta-galactosidase, which is closely related to our project     as it is the reporter protein in our detection scheme. Another experiment was     performing an E.Coli lysate reaction, where we explained how we make the lysate     in the lab and what the advantages of a cell-free environment are. They would also     prepare a PCR reaction, after we explained to them how the PCR machine works and     that it's something we use every day in the lab, as well as prepare an agarose gel     and run the electrophoresis and check the gel under the UV illuminator at the end.     The last experiment would serve to explain how recombinant proteins, transformation     and cloning all are connected as the students would plate E.Coli cells transformed     with chromoproteins on agar plates. Beforehand a safety coordinator at EPFL had     approved this workshop, and we worked with P1 equipment and components only. In     the lab, we equipped every student with a lab coat, a pair of gloves and glasses     to ensure safety and  and divided them into groups of two. In those groups they     performed the experiments, with us explaining some select biological principles     at work (eg. protein expression, cell-free biology, transformation, cloning) and    a paper manual we wrote to resume the course of experiments. At the end of the     day and after"

8 October 2009
-We continued with the protein expression by dividing the incubated GFP and YFP into two falcon tubes and centrifuging them. The supernatant was emptied and the pellet was resuspended. Spectrophotometeric analysis of the GFP and YFP was done in the nanodrop 2000.
-We then read the absorbance of the solution at 600nm.
oGFP=1.4A
oYFP=0.8A
-The proteins were then induced centrifuged and then stored at  -80ºC (Phil Poronnik)
13 October 2009
-Began preparing for the Electrophoresis of YFP. This was done by initially preparing the reagents we needed.
o6 X DNA loading dye
oAgarose gel
-Agarose was then poured into the plate and cooled. The samples for the loading gel weer prepared by adding the YFP sample, 6X DNA loading dye, this was then loaded into the gel and electrophoreses for 30mins
16 October 2009
-We began the mutagenesis of the YFP; this was done by a polymerase chain reaction. To do this the YFP plasmid and both the primers were diluted. 10X reaction buffer, YFP plasmid, primers, dNTP mix, quick solution, DNA polymerase and Milli Q water were all added to make a total volume of 50µL. the reaction was then completed using 18 cycles.
19 October 2009
-Completed the Dpn I digest, this was done by adding Dpn I restriction enzyme to the amplification reaction and gently resuspending the solution, the reaction was then centrifuged and incubated for 7 hours
-In the evening we began the transformation of the ultracompetent cells. This was completed by pre-incubating the LB-agar plates while thawing the cells. Beta Mercaptoethanol and Dpn I treated DNA was added to the ultracompetent cells and mixed gently, and incubated for 30 mins. After incubation the cells were heat shocked. 800μl of SOC medium is added and incubated for 45 mins. The transformed cells were then spread thoroughly on the LB agar plates and were left to incubate overnight.
20 October 2009
-Went in to the lab to see if there was any colony growth on the agar plates.

We have improved three promoters from the iGEM registry by adding a consensus ribosomal binding site (RBS) from the thiolase gene of Clostridium acetobutylicum to each, which functions in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We then performed a robust characterisation through a GFP assay using a spectrophotometer in conjunction with calibration curves generated during the iGEM Interlab study, and expressed their strengths in standardised units of fluorescence.
Original promoters from iGEM registry:
BBa_J23119
BBa_J23114
BBa_J23106
Original promoters with RBS (Ribosomal binding site):
BBa_K2715119
BBa_K2715114
BBa_K2715106
Additionally we have added four new promoters to the iGEM registry with the same ribosomal binding site from the thiolase gene of C. acetobutylicum. The four promoters are from C. acetobutylicum (Pcac_thl) [Bba_K2715010], Clostridium sporogenes (PCsp_fdx) [Bba_K2715011] and two from Clostridium difficile (PCdi_TcdA) [Bba_K2715012] and (PCdi_TcdB) [Bba_K2715013].
We characterized all seven promoters in both E.coli and C. difficile. C. difficile is a Gram-positive anaerobic organism with significant differences to the E. coli chassis for which existing characterisation was performed. The existing registry promoters BBa_J23114, BBa_J23106, and BBa_J23119 were characterised for expression strength using a GusA assay in C. difficile. The four novel registry"

Valencia_UPV,2014,Team:Valencia UPV#prueba pag_-_-_TEXT.html," be translated in a sum of vectors in which the random vector has a constant module and changeable direction inside a range, whereas the gradient vector module is a function of the gradient in the field. The question now is: how do we include the saturation effect in the resulting moth shift vector?
With this in mind and focusing on the implementation process, our approach consists on the following:
The gradient vector instead of experiencing a change in its magnitude, this will be always the unit and its direction that of the greatest rate of increase of the pheromone concentration. A random direction vector with constant module will not be literally considered, but a random turning angle starting from the gradient vector direction.
Attending to the previous question how do we include the saturation effect in the resulting moth shift vector?, here the answer: the dependence on the moth saturation level (interrelated with the pheromone concentration in the field) will state in the random turning angle.
Table 1. Approximation of the male moths behaviour.
This random turning angle will not follow a uniform distribution, but a Poisson distribution in which the mean is zero (no angle detour from the gradient vector direction) and the standard-deviation will be inversely proportional to the intensity of the gradient of sex pheromone concentration in the field. This approach will drive to a ‘sexual confusion’ of the insect as the field homogeneity increases, since the moth in its direction of displacement will fit the gradient direction with certain probabilities which depend on how saturated they are.

Eureka Moment
Finland is known as the sauna nation and we Finns are very proud of our sauna culture. In fact, if you visit Finland, a must do is to take off all your clothes and go to a little room heated to almost 100 ℃, where you sit naked with others and sweat. Since sweating in sauna is a huge deal, from the beginning of our iGEM project, we had some idea for sweat based analysis. During our literature search to understand different substances present in sweat, we found that many proteins are also secreted in sweat as part of our innate immune system. That is when we serendipitously came across an interesting peptide called dermcidin [1] . Dermcidin is known to have antimicrobial activity against a range of different microbes. Though initially we had many possible application ideas and different problems to solve, we realized that the peptide in our hands may be best-suited for solving the problem of acne. We realized that this was an every household problem, affecting millions in all age groups across different countries. To develop our product for acne, we first had to validate the market demand and product potential.
Focus Group Survey
Before developing a product, it was important for us to understand the consumers and their needs. So we started off with a consumer survey involving 194 people from different age groups between 16-60-year-olds. Our primary questions were directed towards understanding the depth of acne as a problem in consumers' day to day lives. Below is the list of questions and data we received.
About acne presence and severity among people surveyed:
Correlation between acne severity and mental wellbeing:
Product Potential and Customer Group Identification
After the extensive focus group survey to identify the depth of acne problem, it was quite evident that acne was indeed a serious problem among a range of different age groups. At least 60% of our responders have been diagnosed with acne at some point of their lives and at"

Wednesday 29th August
British Science Association - Philipp and Bethan met with Roland Jackson to discuss our DIYbio collaboration.
Hackspace Day 1 - We went en masse to the London Hackspace this evening for the first workshop. Carina, Yeping, Philipp, Martina and Bethan were all present. Howard met us there. We bought a glycerol stock of W3110 E. Coli and empty petri dishes to show the biohackers how we make minimal agar plates for day 1 protocol of making competent cells. Quite a few people turned up and they were very keen to have a go!
Paris visit' - Bethan is organising with iGEM Paris-Bettencourt a trip to Paris to discuss how our two project approach biosafety, and also discuss aspects of our DIYbio collaboration with members of the CRI's Education X.0 project. Paris iGEM also invited us to participate in their debate on the 16th!
Thursday 30th August
Hackspace Day 2 - Together with the hackers, Bethan helped to build a shaker to agitate our cells overnight. This involved using a number of equipment only available at the Hackspace, including hand saw, glue gun and motor. The biohackers were very keen to give us an electronics tutorial as we build our circuit for the shaker. A variable resistor was included in the circuit design so we can control the speed of the shaker.
We also performed PCR of the cholorophenicol plasmid backbone required for our ligations. At hackspace, they have a very cool 'ancient' thermocycler. It has no heated lid so mineral oil has to be added to samples to prevent evaporation. The biohackers showed us how to program the machine. There are so many steps compared to the one used in our lab!
Wiki Animations - Philipp successfully uploaded the first of our wiki animations explaining our experiments.

Hackspace Day 3 - Our shaker from yesterday was still alive today and the liquid cultures in falcon tubes are all cloudy showing growth! Together with the biohackers we ran a 1% gel of the PCR product from yesterday using their DIY gel tray. Their tray didn't have a cover, you can also see how the wires are connected"
Ionis_Paris,2016,Team:Ionis Paris#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html,". We obtained the expected results : red colonies were shown on the petri dish (Figure 3) due to the synthesis of the red protein mRFP meaning that the Pr promoter trigger XylR and mRFP synthesis.
Figure 3: Monitoring of XylR production though control of the activity of the Pr promoter. Modified bacteria containing XylR coding device with mRFP grown on a petri dish. The red color of the bacteria indicate that mRFP protein is produce and therefore that XylR is produce too.
This construction will not allow XylR quantification but those results show that XylR protein was constitutively produce by our genetically modified bacteria containing XYlR coding device with mRFP.  We wanted to realize a XylR-mRFP fusion but this part was too big for IDT synthesis. We created the BioBrick BBa_K2023010 (XylR-His) to give to future iGEM the opportunity to purify and quantify XylR protein.
Bioluminescence assays
Protocol and tested concentrations
We used the protocol 13 (available here )and decided to test several concentration of toluene (0ng/L, 10ng/L, 100ng/L, 10µg/L and 10mg/L).Bioluminescence assays were realized several times after toluene addition (1h, 3h, 4h30 and 5h30).
Bacteria transformed with our biosensor used in each assays come from the same culture (OD = 0.1). This culture was well mixed and divided in 50 mL falcon. Toluene was then added in each Falcon.
Bioluminescence assays were realized quickly after substrate addition and the bioluminescence intensity was measured using Mithras² LB 943 Monochromator Multimode Reader. This machine was kindly lend by Berthold company for 3 days in order to let us realized the bioluminescence measurement. In addition to bioluminesence intensity, sample's OD was also measured. All tests were realized in triplicates.
Several negative controls were realized :
Measurement of LB bioluminescence intensity to determine the background noise
Measurement of LB + toluene bioluminescence intensity to determine toluene effect on the bioluminescent intensity
Measurement of the bioluminescence intensity of bacteria transformed with a genetic construction that do not contain the gaussia luciferase gene (Pr-XylR).

Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
Researcher Safety,
Nicotiana tabacum - No. NT cells are common cell lines used for decades in plant research. No known hazards have been associated with NT cell research.   Reporter genes – No. Fluorescent proteins are a staple of molecular biology, and no known hazards have been associated with their use. Our promoters also pose no threat.
Public Safety,
Nicotiana tabacum - No. We do not intend on developing the project in any way such that the public would encounter our project. Even so, in a hypothetical commercial development, NT cells are not expected to put the public at risk. NT cells are not viable outside a nutrient-rich environment.
None of the parts we intend to make, promoters or fluorescent reporters, have shown any health risks to date.
Environmental Safety
- No. While other plant models could conceivably cross with wild-type plants and generate unforeseeable hybrids, NT cells mitigate that risk. Because NT cells are incapable of sexual reproduction and can only proliferate through clonal propagation in their nutrient-rich media. Containment of the cells is easier to manage with less risk should the NT cells ever breach containment. Therefore, we would not expect any of our promoters or reporter genes to reach the environment. We are ensuring proper containment of transformed Agrobacterium.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
- No. Our reporter genes are standard fluorescent proteins used repeatedly not just in iGEM but research abroad. Our modified plasmid poses no risk to the researchers, public, or environment. The inducible promoters selected are found naturally in plants and are predicted to pose no risk.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
- Yes. The University of Nevada, Reno Institutional Biosafety Committee supports our project, especially with regard to the fact"

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#safety_-_-_TEXT.html," applies to the majority of organisms used during development. In the rare occasion that a gene from a Level 2 organism was required - a Serratia gene coding for chitinase, for instance - we opted instead to create it from sequence, rather than using the whole organism. An integral part of BeeT’s premise is a presenting a lower danger/nuisance to bees and humans as compared to more conventional Varroa-exterminating methods. This is the reason we opted for extremely [specific toxins (Link to Specificity/Cry Toxin/Chitinase? pages)].
Kill Switches
BeeT’s twin redundant kill switches are its primary biocontainment measures, designed to trigger when the organism leaves its designated environment. In order to carry out its function, BeeT only needs to be active inside the beehive; its presence anywhere else is undesirable. The first kill switch, the [optogenetic TA system (Link to Marijn’s project)], makes use of the dark interior of a beehive. Being exposed to sunlight over a period of time - which can be inferred as an escape from the hive - will activate the system, killing the bacteria. The second switch, the [amino acid-Cas9 system (Link to Bel’s project)], relies on the inclusion of a synthetic amino acid when BeeT is introduced to the hive. In absence of the amino acid - outside the hive, or when the supply is spent - the system will trigger. As the activated Cas9 targets BeeT’s own DNA, this also helps address the issue of horizontal gene transfer. This design makes BeeT both self-containing and self-disposing. For more information regarding safety in our project, see our Safety Form .
Laboratory
Maintaining a healthy and contamination-free work environment is a major priority in the field of synthetic biology. Before starting, each member of Team Wageningen UR involved in wet lab work received an introductory tour by the laboratory technician in charge of safety. The tour and subsequent training covered proper clothing, waste disposal, equipment sterility and so forth. The majority of BeeT development was done under Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) conditions , with a small amount of work done at BSL-2. For the latter case, specialized training, as well as up-to-date vaccinations, were required.

Q: What is the biggest risk associated to synthetic biology?
A: I would say a lack of acceptance in society caused by a lack of information that is broadly accessible to enable members of the public to assess risk (cf GMO debate).
Q: How far is a future where synthetic biology applications are part of everyday life?
A: It is here now.
Q: Would you support students to undertake studies in synthetic biology?
A: Yes, there have been PhD students in EMBL already who have carried out projects that would be defined as synthetic biology.
Discussion
In performing this video project, we learnt a lot about how to approach famous and busy scientists, how they reason and how they feel about synthetic biology. In listening to their inspiring words, we got even more enthusiastic about synthetic biology and feel compelled to positively impact society in the future with our innovative ideas. It would have been fantastic to be able to collect more information on the opinion of scientists totally outside of the field, but this was somehow not possible. While the answers we got from Ian Mattaj clearly show that scientists working in unrelated field can have an opinion on synthetic biology, we should consider that the EMBL is a research institute where synthetic biology has been present. We fear that most scientists working in institutes where synthetic biology projects were never performed would not be able to define synthetic biology or would fail to see the difference between synthetic biology and biotechnology (well, we saw how for instance even some of the system biologists we interviewed still spoke of synthetic biology as biotechnology, so this distinction seems to be fuzzy even for those working in closely related field!). Synthetic biologists have still to go a long way to explain their approaches and goals to other researchers and to the lay public. We think that the iGEM foundation, by pushing teams to perform human practice projects during the iGEM competition, strongly accelerates the spread of knowledge on this fascinating new field of research and pushes us students to spend time reflecting on how important it is to explain what we do to the outside world ."
IIT_Kharagpur,2015,Team:IIT Kharagpur#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," did you solve them (in brief)?
Finding a project was hard. In retrospect, I think we should have kept it a bit simpler than trying to find a project in literature. Thinking about a problem without thinking of possible limitations is something we probably should have done back when we started out with iGEM.
Does iGEM help in improving international collaboration?
Yes, through various teams collaborating with one another and making their ideas open to everyone, it is improving international collaboration.
Do you believe that in your country the awareness about synthetic biology has improved enough to consider it as a mainstream science?
No, I think that synthetic biology and the creation of GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) is still very confusing and scary for the general public in the United States.
How do you raise funds to participate in iGEM? How difficult is it to get funds from the sponsors?
We raise funds mainly from the colleges at our university's discretionary funds; other funds come from life and biotechnology companies who support us with in kind supply donations or small monetary donations. It is relatively difficult for us to get sponsors, so each year we try to contact as many people as possible in order to increase our chances of finding willing sponsors.
Interviews:
Prof. Hari Niwas Mishra
On the 3rd of September, three of our team members interviewed an eminent faculty  member of IIT Kharagpur, Prof. Hari Niwas Mishra of the Department of Agriculture and   Food  Engineering,  who  is  an  expert  in  the  field  of  Health  Foods & Nutraceuticals,   Innovative Food Processing Technologies  and Food Safety & Quality Control. This  is   how it went: Team: Sir  you  have  been  working  in  this  field  for  about  21  years...can  you  tell  us  about  the   statistics of food spoilage in the country...like how much wood gets wasted every year due to   spoilage? Professor Mishra: You  see,  a  few  days  ago  i  was reading  in  the  news reports  that  ICAR (Indian   Council of Agricultural Research) conducted a recent study in association with CIPHET (Central   Institute  of  Post-­Harvest  Engineering  and  Technology),  which  involved  a  survey  to  assess   spoilage  incurred  in  food  storage,  handling,etc. According  to  the report,  4­8%  of  food  grains,  "
SCAU-China,2016,Team:SCAU-China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," The HPLC results also showed that astaxanthin was the predominant carotenoid in aSTARice, and did not exist in wild-type rice seeds. The orange–red compound in transgenic seeds mainly is astaxanthin.
Figure 6   HPLC chromatogram of methanol extracts from transgenic aSTARice (red line) and wild-type (blue line) rice seeds. HPLC analysis recorded at 480 nm of extracts.
To calculate astaxanthin content of different transgenic aSTARice lines, we analyzed the relationship between different concentration of the astaxanthin standard sample and its peak areas using HPLC, and we acquired an astaxanthin standard sample curve (Figure 7). By using this curve, we analyzed several transgenic aSTARice seeds. Some lines accumulated astaxanthin up to 5.20 μg/g DW (dry weight). In contrast, no astaxanthin was detected in wild-type rice.
Figure 7   Standard curve of relationship between astaxanthin concentrations and its peak areas.
 
 
Investigation of aSTARice in later generation
Figure 8   Relative expression levels of four foreign astaxanthin biosynthetic genes and astaxanthin content in seeds of wild-type and later generation of aSTARice. Their expression levels are normalized to Osactin1 transcript level. All reactions were carried out in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated twice. Error bars indicate ± SEM. DW, dry weight.
The later generation seeds of aSTARice were harvested at the end of September this year and we performed quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and HPLC analysis. Several transgenic lines were chosen for investigation. As the results shown in the diagram, astaxanthin content varies from lines, some lines remain stable astaxanthin production while some synthesize in a low level. Supported by the qRT-PCR analysis, the low content of astaxanthin in the endosperm of transgenic lines are associated with poor transcriptional activity of a BHY gene, which no obvious transcriptional activity is detected in four lines. The investigation demonstrates that astaxanthin biosynthesis accomplishes only under the well cooperation of the four genes. When one of the four foreign genes was down regulation of expression, astaxanthin content would be decreased. These four genes are the essential genes for biosynthetic astaxanthin in aSTARice.

Introduction
UrbanTundra is a student-led research team comprised of students from several high schools across Edmonton. Back in 2016, we discovered iGEM at the annual Science Expo Youth Conference and hence, decided to form Edmonton’s first iGEM team to compete in the high school track! Fast forward to the 2016 Jamboree: our team presented research based on creating a system that could break down toxic perchlorate, enabling us to extract oxygen and break down the toxic molecule in the same process. We walked away from the 2016 Jamboree with the Bronze medal, as well as Best Poster, Best Presentation, and Best Wiki!
Team Story: Self-Improvement
At the beginning of 2017, we began recruiting new members for our team; in fact, the majority of our team is completely new! Unlike last year, we chose to expand our reaches to more than one high school, benefitting from the talents that Edmonton had to offer as a city. In June, we participated in our first conference, NDC, as the new
UrbanTundra
. Our team members communicated and collaborated with other science student groups, learning more about the different aspects that we could integrate into our own project. Through this experience, our newly-formed team not only bonded with one another, but we also learned about the objectives and nuances of the iGEM competition from the past members. Likewise, the judge’s feedback allowed us to assess our current situation, plan our next steps, and move forward as a team.
Based on the adjustments we made
from
the NDC conference, our leadership was adjusted and our team was portioned off into three sections: research, engineering, and outreach. These sections allowed us to not only work more effectively as a
team,
but also accomplish more in a shorter amount of time. Each member from a section was “buddied up” with two other members from the two other sections; this way, they were able to stay updated on the progress of the other teams.
This year, our goal was to complete the first part of our biological system: expressing perchlorate reductase. We have been"

Parts were PCR amplified for new Gibson (mostly Lux CDEG and Lux AB) and bands from yesterday's PCR were purified.
Day ends when Pollak throws coffee at Carla for some unknown reason. She believes he is conspiring against her (he hates her sweaters, breaks her watch and now the coffee episode). Pollak's defense: I just opened the door and there she was with the coffee. I didn't mean to do it. It just happened.
Friday: So... we had tech support from Olimex during the morning. Basically, they did the same as Juano, the light sensor terminals were soldered to small wires (in a more professional way of course). We like to call this sensor frankenstein's girlfriend :) (franky's chick). We'll try the arduino light sensing system next week.
Attempted another Gibson to assemble C1.1, C1.2, Pcaa3 and ADF3 (check the Constructs section for more details on these parts).  We occupied the isothermal buffer with the correct concentrations this time :) Also, we purify bands from yesterday's PCR and check sizes of colony PCR done last yesterday. Some colonies are the right size.

BIT,2015,Team:BIT-China#project Basic circuits.html_-_-_TEXT.html," optimal condition for most microorganisms. For the sake of regulating the acidic environment, we need to construct an alkali production circuit. Our project concentrates on the gad system in Escherichia coli str. K-12.
GadA, one of a functional genes for producing alkali, is employed in our circuit to convert glutamate to GABA, which is a certain kind of alkaline substance. GadC (glutamate γ-amino butyric acid anti-porter) exchanges extracellular Glutamate and intracellular GABA, whereas gadA and gadB converts glutamate to GABA by removing the α-carboxylate group of glutamate.
○ Design
Therefore, we are able to regulate the external acidic environment through the secretion of GABA. The following picture(Fig.15) shows the entire process of gad system.
This year, our system relies on the intracellular activity of two isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase, gadA and gadB, which catalyze the proton-consuming conversion of glutamate to γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)[16]. The constitutive promoter J23119, the ribosome binding site B0034 and the functional gene gadA will be used in our circuit (Fig.16).
Fig.15 The mechanism of gadA
Fig.16 Alkali synthesis circuit of gadA
○ Results
Firstly, we cloned the gene GadA from the genome of Escherichia coli str. K-12.. It is found that there are two restriction sites (EcoRI and PstI) in the sequence of GadA. Thus, one-day step mutation was applied to move the restriction sites. Then, the standard part GadA was constructed successfully.
In order to test the function of GadA, we inserted it into plasmid pET28a. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3). The agarose gel electrophoresis analysis below (Fig.17) shows the positive clones of GadA.
Fig.17 The positive clones of GadA connected with pET28a
After the construction of the alkali producing system, we measured the changes of pH in bacteria solution as well as the intensity of proteins expressed through SDS-PAGE. So long as OD600 of the bacterium solution reaches 0.6, the bacteria was induced by IPTG under 16℃ for 16h. The following table (Table.1) shows the different pH values between the testing group and the control group. It shows that the gene Gad"

18 August - 31 August
 
The plasmids containing the new BioBricks NisA, NisC, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs)  that were isolated in the week of 11 - 17 August were concentrated with a SpeedVac and then sent for sequencing with the primers VF2 and VR . The sequence of each BioBrick was confirmed.
 
 
 
 
1 September - 7 September
 
Colony PCR on more transformants containing pSB1C3 with NisB and NisRK was repeated, using VF2 and VR . This time, a  correct insert size wasbfound for a NisRK transformant.
Because there was still no correct insert size found for a NisB  transformant, the remaining NisB colonies were tested for a correct insert size. There were no positive transformants found.
 
 
 
 
8 September - 14 September
 
A PCR was done on all the genes that contained illegal restriction sites: NisI, NisT, NisP and NisFEG. This should generate multiple PCR fragments for each gene, that will be assembled again using Gibson assembly. The PCR was split into two seperate reactions because of the large differences between the size of the different fragments. Fragments were sorted on <750 kb and >750 kb. The experiment was not continued because of time limits.
 
 
 
 
14 September - 21 September
 
Because of the constant low concentrations of the plasmid pSB1C3 with the new BioBricks, it was decided to transform the isolated pSB1C3 with the new BioBricks (NisA, NisC, NisRK, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs)) again in Escherichia coli DH5α.  The pSB1C3 plasmids containing the new BioBricks were again isolated. For each transformation, two seperate cultures were grown in LB with 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol. A miniprep was done on the cultures and the insert size was checked with colony PCR, using VF2 and VR as primers. In addition, a restriction analysis was done using EcoRI and PstI. Cultures that showed a correct insert size were sent for sequencing.

How to Become a Donor
[ENGLISH VERSION]
 
In June we will be publicly announcing the first Panamanian team to participate in the annual iGEM Synthetic Biology contest held at MIT. This is an opportunity for Panama to create a center of excellence in the rapidly growing field of Synthetic Biology, and will offer students the opportunity to build skills on an international level, which will lead to invaluable careers.
This is an opportunity for your company to gain visibility by supporting these Panamanian students!.
The Panamanian team will consist of students from the University of Panama, the Techonological University of Panama, and graduate students at INDICASAT and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI). SENACYT, Panama's National Secretariat of Science, Technology, and Innovation, will match private sponsorship up to $15,000. The universities, INDICASAT, and STRI will be contributing both money and staff time, and INDICASAT will be donating the cost of all biological equipment and supplies.
How can your corporation help? We need to raise $20,000 to finance the team's efforts. The funds will be used for travel expenses for 10 students and 2 instructors to the final iGEM event at MIT in Boston, instructor travel to training events, publication preparation, students' local travel expenses, and other materials necessary to support the team.
Gold Sponsors of $5000 or more made before our public announcement of the team will allow you to have a representative speak during the press conference, which will be held at SENACYT, will be attended by SENACYT Director Dr. Rubén Borrocal, and will get national television coverage.
Silver Sponsors of $1,000 or more will be specifically acknowledged during the press conference, and will have their logos displayed during the conference.
Bronze Sponsors of $500 or more will be included in our web site acknowledgments.
In addition, sponsors will get similar acknowledgments in all press releases during the year as the contest progresses, and will be invited to certain future presentations of the team's work.
This is an opportunity for you to support the next generation of Panamanian scientists and engineers and to visibly support the development of Panama's industrial base in a way that is"

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," go up to 24 mg/L (Chorus and Bartram, 1999). However, such levels are only observed in scums, which are formed by certain cyanobacterial species such as Microcystis spp. and Anabaena spp. Our enzyme will not be able to detoxify such high toxin concentrations - a concentration of 24 mg/L would be detoxified to toxicity value corresponding to a concentration of 150 μg/L of MC-LR, which is greater than the safety limit of 1 ug/L designated by the WHO (WHO, 2003). However, scums are very conspicuous on the surface of the water, and people would instinctively not use such water for any purpose, including for sauna. The normal levels of microcystin when the cyanobacteria don’t form scum are maximally 20 μg/L (Chorus and Bartram, 1999), which can be detoxified to safe levels with MlrA.
Project Design
When designing our constructs and experiments, there were several factors we needed to consider: large-scale production of the enzyme, the enzyme being a putative membrane protein, and ensuring that the microcystin inside intact cyanobacterial cells would also be degraded.
Dziga et al. (2012) had succeeded in producing active, soluble MlrA in E. coli , but because we want our final product to be manufactured in a large scale, it seemed like there would be better ways to achieve this efficiently. Optimally, this would mean using a chassis organism capable of higher protein yields with the produced enzyme being secreted into the growth medium, since that would be the most cost-effective way of purifying it. The enzyme should also have some properties that make it easy to purify.
In the detection part of our project, we had already decided to use S. cerevisiae as our chassis. Having both parts of the project in the same chassis organism would allow us to potentially couple the two in the future. In addition, because of our considerations of enzyme mass production, a chassis capable of higher protein yields and better secretion efficiency than E. coli would be beneficial. E.g. the yeast Pichia pastoris is known for its capability to achieve extremely high cell densities and protein production yields, which is optimal when thinking of mass production (Ahmad et al., 2014). Coupling this with secretion would be ideal. Verifying that the enzyme production works in S. cerevisiae would be promising for considering potential production in eukaryotic organisms such as P. pastoris. This gave us additional motivation"

Tamu 4
0.001 mm/min
Extension rate was dropped to 0.01 mm/min because the fibers were breaking too easily. Data is being weird. 0.01 mm/min is too slow to be continuous, so the data is more or less discrete. Will need to average each data point before analyzing. Additionally, the fiber has a permanent kink in it.
Holy crap 0.001 mm/min took over 2.5 hrs and still didn't break. I bumped it up to 0.01 mm/min to get it going faster.
I then bumped it up to 0.1 mm/min
0.001 mm/min takes literally over an hour. Would recommend 0.1 mm/min.

Background
The drive to develop `a technology of the living substance' has fascinated scientist for centuries and has led to several moments in history when scientists claimed they were about to `create life in a test tube', produce `synthetic new species', or otherwise engage in the engineering of genes and chromosomes. Synthetic biology takes an engineering approach to building artificial biological systems, taking the tools and experimental techniques of genetic engineering to a new level. The focus is often on ways of taking parts of natural biological systems, characterizing and simplifying them, and using them as a component of a highly unnatural, engineered, biological system. The individual parts are standardized by engineers to facilitate exchange and reuse of parts, for example as DNA BioBricks TM. Synthetic biology already has many accomplishments to its credit. The effort to generate synthetic genetic systems has yielded diagnostic tools, such as Bayer's branched DNA assay, which annually helps improve the care of some 400.000 patients infected with HIV and hepatitis viruses.
iGEM
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the premiere undergraduate synthetic biology competition, first held in 2003. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. They will make use of known BioBricks TM and develop new BioBricks TM that will be added to the registry. The organization promotes the advancement of science and education by developing an open community of students and practitioners in schools, laboratories, research institutes and industry. The research described in this article is part of the research done by the iGEM team of the Eindhoven University of Technology in 2012 and will be presented at the European i"

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified"
Tsinghua-A,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#Game Discovery_-_-_TEXT.html,". A’s “undercover agents” quickly surround and eliminate B’s bacteria.
Discovery
The easiest way to capture a fortress is from within
    As we can see, A’s “undercover agents” quickly surround and eliminate B’s bacteria. This is also a good example of showing how important the strategy is.
    As the old saying in China goes, the easiest way to capture a fortress is from within. This strategy is also mentioned in the book Master Sun’s art of War, the most famous book on war in ancient China.This game tells the similar story. In history, we find that the seemingly indestructible empires were always ruined by troubles that arise from within but not outside.
    Don’t be afraid of playing chess in your enemies’ home! Maybe you are only one step away from success!
V Protracted Battle V.S. Blitzkrieg
    In this case, both sides own the same amount of bacteria. We can see it is interesting that A’s farmers grow fast firstly at first but are killed by B’ lethal warriors after a while.
Discovery
He who laughs last laughs best
    In the first 20 seconds, we can see that the amount of E.coli in side A is apparently larger. However, in the following 30 seconds, we can see that B’s warriors attack the E.coli from A and eventually get the victory. In this case, A’s farmers grow fast firstly but are killed faster by B’ lethal warriors after a while.
    We can often see similar conditions in real life. Someone maybe a nobody in his youth, but a somebody when his is old. At the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, many people might thought that Britain would probably be the winner as its military force seems stronger. However, after the 8-year war, American eventually won the war.
    He who laughs last laughs best. We should not lower our guard even if we are at an advantage.
VI Win the Battle Fast
    In this case, the amount of warriors in A is larger than the amount in B. One interesting thing about this situation is that warrior A stays very close to warrior B.  We can see that side A wins very fast.
Discovery
Destroy the core figures and the gang will collapse
    We can see that warrior A stays very close to warrior B at the beginning. Warrior B is the key figure in side B as farmer B does not threaten side B and we win the game if we can kill warrior B. In this case, warrior A kills warrior B first so that side A wins very"
Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#HP-content_-_-_TEXT.html," Braunschweig had the privilege to host the ERN as the only location in Germany this year, next to metropolises like London, Paris and Rome - quite adequate, as the Braunschweig region is the European leader in research and development [1]. Therefore, there was a bet that at least 1,000 researchers from the area were to assemble at Braunschweig’s Schlossplatz - and the bet was won!
Our stand, located right in front of a big shopping mall, was visited by a variety of people, some of whom had probably not expected to be informed about synthetic biology that day! For children, we had some pictures to color and they could also have their own faces painted with a cow as a motive. Next to other fun activities like foosball, the main focus was, of course, on presenting the iGEM idea and our project to visitors - and our own motivation to take part in such a competition, despite also being kept busy by our regular studies. The eye-catcher of our stand was a large tree which we had made out of craft wire and plastic sheets. During the course of the day, this tree was being decorated with survey sheets we had asked our visitors to fill out. The survey dealt with the question in what way the people expected synthetic biology to benefit humanity.

Lehr Leo
The “Tag der Lehre” (translates to “Day of Teaching”) hosted by our university is dedicated to the appreciation of innovative teaching concepts and provides a platform for exchange about this topic. This is quite important to us because from our point of view synthetic biology is not yet appropriately represented in our curriculum. Therefore, we seized the opportunity and presented our iGEM team and project as a figurehead for synthetic biology at our university. In doing so, we made clear that it is an important subject with considerable significance not only from a scientific, but also from a societal perspective.
Our stand at the “Tag der Lehre” was visited by a variety of people from all kinds of professions and disciplines towards whom we could emphasize our concern. As some of them were university professors and even the principal was present, we think we might have come a little closer to our aim. The day ended with a science slam in which we presented our project in an entertaining way and actually won first prize - which we consider to be a positive sign"

To further develop that thought the necessary process operations were determined and are shown in flow diagrams to showcase the necessary steps to be taken from a custom binder order to the finished lyophilized product for shipping. Because we were only working in the dimensions of our lab we reached out to experts and asked for their opinion on up scaling our idea. They provided a lot of parameters to be considered and asked questions we up to this point did not thought about. We integrated their knowledge on the topic into the development of the up scaling and business plan as well as the process development . The ultimate aim for our system would be that it can generate binders to every target. Therefore we ran a Phagemid display in order to evaluate the capabilities of our system.

One major challenge of working in a high school classroom is we don’t have access to most sophisticated testing equipment such as a spectrophotometer. As such, although we were able to show that our bacteria could break down fats by observing a color change, we were not able to generate any quantitative data – only qualitative. When we were at aGEM (an Alberta-focused iGEM competition), the University of Calgary team offered to establish a collaboration to help us run a quantitative experiment on our bacteria in their lab. We got to visit their lab on several occasions and they helped us design a time course experiment with proper controls to test in their spectrophotometer. We did some practice runs and then ran our actual experiment. They helped us design and run the test, as well as analyze our data and create a figure. This helped us see the rate of the enzyme breaking down the ester bonds of the test compounds (4-nitrophenyl palmitate and 4-nitrophenyl octanoate). We also showed them our presentation and some of their team members helped us with presentation advice and graphic design help for our figures.
