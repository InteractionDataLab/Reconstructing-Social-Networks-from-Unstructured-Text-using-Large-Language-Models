How to quantify channel capacity of gene regulatory networks?
We transfect HEK-293 human cells with our plasmid constructions as described in the form [ref: table]. Different concentrations of Dox are applied to cell culture at the same time.
Transfected cells are cultured for 48 hours before performing flow cytometry, long enough for protein expression level to achieve steady state. FACS examination measures florescent intensity emitted by each cell, from which we obtain a large sample of florescent protein expression level, tens of thousands of cells for each experiment group.
Data collected from flow cytometry are later analyzed on computers. We estimated probability density function (p.d.f.) from data using kernel density estimation, a nonparametric statistics method. Given high and low Dox concentration input, cells exhibit different probability distributions, as illustrated in the example below [ref: fig].
What we have in hand is the conditional distribution $p\left( {Y\left| {X = x} \right.} \right)$ , given a known level of input $x$ . In order to calculate mutual information $I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \iint {p\left( {x,y} \right){{\log }_2}\frac{{p\left( {x,y} \right)}}{{p\left( x \right)p\left( y \right)}}dxdy}$  and estimate channel capacity, which is $C = \sup I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ , we need to find the input distribution $p\left( X \right)$ and joint distribution $p\left( {X,Y} \right)$ that optimizes the equation. $p\left( X \right)$ , however, is not known in the first place. We first randomly pick a stochastic vector as the initial input distribution and then use an optimization algorithm to iterate the function and maximize $I\left( {X;Y}"

Week 9
A fresh start with a lot of work for setting up the lab again. I learned the basics of phage work in this and the next week.
Week 10
Continuation of learning how to work with bacteriophages. Mite feeding experiments with fluorophores: Mites do take up fluorophores with their food! But only a small amount of them (~16 %).
Week 11
Feeding experiment with mealworms. Mealworms are easy to feed, easy to dissect and easy to keep. They take up fluorescein when fed with carrots dipped in it.

Week 13
SDS-PAGE of mealworm proteins, mite proteins, and mealworm gut proteins.Proteins can be seen in all of the samples. There is a distinct difference in protein pattern in the gut and the overall mealworm sample. This indicates that using only the midgut for experiments enhances the chances of finding a specific toxin. Attempts to do so in mites failed due to the small size of Varroa destructor.

Week 14-15
The titre of the provided phage library was to be determined. Attempts to do so via ""tear-drop assay"", where one X-Gal/IPTG plate can be used to characterize 4 samples, failed. This is probably due to the high mobility of the phage M13KE. The titre was obtained by using the protocol listed here (LINK).
In vivo phage display on mites and mealworms has been performed. Titre dropped drastically after each round.
Week 16
In vivo phage display on mealworms with propagation of phages inbetween the rounds. During this, unexpected, lytic phages appeared on the titre plates. Experiments were put on hold.

Limonene is a well-known cyclic monoterpene which can occur in two optical forms (2). (D)-Limonene is one of the most important and widespread terpenes in the flavor and fragrance industry, for example in citrus-flavored products such as soft drinks and candy (2). The (L)-Limonene form has a more harsh fir-like odor with a lemon-note (2). For our project we choose an enzyme-cascade, beginning with acetyl-coA and leading to the product (L)-limonene. This biosynthetic pathway was designed and inserted in E.coli (Fig.2)

Finally, as we found that the concentration of Repressor is not a problem                     for the system (main system section), we concluded, that we can have                     different magnitudes of sfGFP with very small errors, by optimizing sgRNA                     concentration.
dcas9 Expression Site
In this section we are going to examine the different options we had for                     the expression site of dcas9 in order to inform Wet lab, which is the                     better option for our system. The three options that the Wet lab was                     thinking were:
dcas to be expressed on the same plasmid with sgRNA and sfGFP
Double plasmid solution where dcas is expressed in the same plasmid                             as tetR.
dcas to be expressed directly from the genome.
The second option is the one that we examined until now. For all three                     options we set tetR’s copy number as 15.
Figure 11: Dcas9 Concentration over different copy numbers for all three options
Figure 12: sfGFP concentration over different copy numbers for all three options
As we expected, the results show, that when dcas is expressed from the                     genome, sfGFP is greatly increased as copy number is increased, because it                     sets a very low upper limit for the repressor concentration, which is                     reached very soon even for low copy numbers.
When dcas9 is expressed within the same plasmid as sfGFP, there is no                     limiting reagent in the system and both sgRNA and dcas are increasing.                     The final sfGFP production and system error is exactly the same with the                     final option, which is also our main system. This can be interpreted as in                     the main system we concluded that the system is robust, regarding the                     repressor binding and concentration, due to the final strong repression,                     slow unbinding and also slow degradation rate of the repressor. However, in                     the case of double plasmid, we are able to monitor the expression of dcas,                     in contrast with the single plasmid were dcas is constantly increasing.
Taking the case that we do not use tetR for dcas repression, the only                     difference is that the expression of dcas would be even higher.
Also we thought of having tetR and dcas both expressed in the same plasmid                     as sfGFP, but the results were not good. Actually dcas9 concentration was                     decreasing while copy number were increased. This"

Background
Our strategy for dsRNA production is a multi-part approach. The construct is expressed dicistronically, with a His-tagged MS2 coat-protein expressed initially. Additionally, we employ the use of a Herpes Delta Virus Ribozyme (HDVR), which will be evolved through SELEX in order to generate a thermozyme. Upon an increase in temperature (22 °C to 37°C), the thermozyme undergoes a conformational change, resulting in cleavage at a specifically prescribed nucleotide. This thermozyme is placed just upstream of an MS2 coat-protein binding site. This allows us to purify only full-length RNA once it has been transcribed, as those transcripts not harbouring the binding domain will not be effectively purified. His-tagged MS2 coat-protein is then free to bind the newly transcribed binding domain. Using affinity chromatography, purification of the MS2 coat-protein and the bound RNA is possible. Upon a temperature increase, cleavage and liberation of a single stranded RNA occurs, allowing for purification of a single strand of highly pure RNA.
By using two complementary RNA-generating sequences within the thermozyme construct, we are able to generate double stranded RNA for use in pest control simply by annealing the two resultant strands produced by our purification strategy.
Given our chassis and ability to over-express His-tagged MS2 coat-protein, our purification strategy is poised to purify large amounts of highly specific RNA. The scalability of this platform lies in the ability of individuals to design novel pesticides for any target organism, having only requisite knowledge of the genome. New dsRNA-based pesticides will be employed cheaply and specifically without costly design and massive amounts of resources currently utilized in"
Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#KaraNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," sites were only cloning once and became un-draggable afterwards, and they showed up scattered all over the place in the library instead of in neat rows like we wanted. Turns out it was just some silly stuff on my part, like using the wrong constructor. Easy enough to fix!
Had a mild heart attack when Consuelo forwarded the email Traci sent her about designing primers, though. I'd spent so much time on the UI and building the modules themselves that I'd mostly forgotten about the primers and how confusing I'd found the process. It's a good thing Kathy's on hand to help decipher these things, but all the same I think I should try to learn primers and PCR over again and hope it sticks. And once put into the code as just another string, it seems so much less intimidating to talk about prefixes, suffixes, reverse sequences, and complementary strands. They're all just another transformation or operation then, nothing huge.
Veronica worked on that for a while, and I tried to develop a backend for the automatic placement of fusion sites. I got it working after a few logic hiccups, nothing too serious, and afterwards I pitched in to the effort to print the correct primers, based on Traci's explanations. That went well enough, and the day wrapped up with implementing the user creation of fusion sites in the library and checks for duplicate fusion sites before primer generation.
I also put in some time on search to make it a bit faster, at least when parts are displayed under a type or filter, but I'm not sure if it's really optimized. The way it handles data may be unecessarily complex. And figuring out how to incorporate searching within all parts or just one type was a bit of a headache! I'd forgotten how tangled conditional trees could get. Am I overthinking this?
27 Jul 2012
Today was a pretty slow day. Uppy went off with Consuelo, Kathy, and Nahum to MIT for user studies. I somehow managed to break Nahum's optimized search code within a half hour of being shown it - oh, man! There wasn't any time to fix it and check in his version before they left, but I tried to fix it while they were on the road. In the end I didn't make it, so Veronica and I did a little busywork fixing bugs while getting a constant stream of input from the MIT users, relayed to us through Gchat. One very vague exception (along the lines of ""Something bad happened"") kept appearing, and we just couldn't figure out what it was! Instead,"

After that the protocol would exactly follow the Cell Measurement Protocol from the iGEM Interlab Study. Afterwards electroporation was used for transformation instead of heatshock. However, when we were preparing the high OD600 stocks something went wrong when centrifuging and washing. We tried to get the required OD600 of 16, however we did not have enough volume and bacteria to further concentrate and got stuck at an OD600 of 11 with only little volume left. Evaluating to iGEM Marburg we told them what we thought went wrong. Unfortunately we were only sent a set of chemicals for one try of their Interlab Study and therefore we were not able to complete their Vibrio natriegens interlab.
Dutch Mini Jamboree
On Friday the 19th of October, iGEM Eindhoven hosted the Dutch Mini Jamboree. This was an event to practice for the real deal in Boston a week later. All of the six Dutch iGEM teams (Delft, Utrecht, Leiden, Rotterdam, Groningen and Eindhoven) came to Eindhoven University of Technology to present their project and have a final practice session with all of the teams. It started with a poster session followed by a lunch. After lunch, the presentations started. These presentations were performed in front of four experienced judges. This jury consisted of Will Wright (European iGEM Ambassador), Pieter van Boheemen (Dutch Institute for Public Health and Environment), Maaruthy Yelleswarapu (PhD in Nijmegen, has previous iGEM experience) and Bob van Sluijs (1st runner up overgrad in 2014 with Wageningen RU). These judges gave feedback to the teams so that details could be finalized to give the best possible presentation in Boston. Also, feedback on posters was provided. The event was concluded with an ‘’After iGEM’’ talk by Will Wright. After that, we had dinner with pizza and we went to the bar of our study association for some fun and drinks.

A potential difference of 120V was applied across the gel for 40 minutes before it was stained with ethidium bromide for 30 minutes.
Analysis of Results
Analysis
The first three lanes produced expected results: pBAD33 and pBAD/HisB being “blank” plasmid backbones, the pSB-1C3-abijk lane giving two bands corresponding to similar sizes (being pSB-1C3 and abijk insert respectively).
All the other lanes seem to be showing only products in the 2kb range, which corresponds roughly to the size of the pSB-1C3 backbone, but the sizes are not uniform. Nonetheless, we know that the plasmid extraction step was carried out correctly as it did yield products approximating what we were looking for.
If it was a matter of the ligation step carried out on 23/06 failing entirely, we should be expecting a uniform row of backbone bands. Instead, there are minor but noticeable size variations between each band which cannot be successfully explained by failed digestion/ligation. It is thus speculated that the pSB-1C3 stock we received from iGEM HQ had suffered from varying extents of DNA degradation such that the restriction enzyme cut sites on their ends were no longer.

Following up on this, we thought about how we can inform people factually but in a comprehensible way about gene technology and synthetic biology. Before we talk about fancy devices in synthetic biology, how can we get down to the underlying issue of social rejection of gene technology in general?
At the same time, young students interested in science and engineering are the most valuable future source of innovation. One day, they might be the researchers who develop the solutions to the most pressing issues of our world. For that reason, informing this group of people is of utmost importance and was therefore prioritized in our Policy & Practices work.
Combining these two thoughts, we visited two schools, the Kaiser-Karls-Gymnasium in Aachen and the NEAnderLab in Hilden, where we talked to students about synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, but also explained the scientific background and social aspects of our project. A delegation of our team also visited the MakerFaire in Hannover, a family-friendly exhibition for tinkerers of all kinds, to spread the idea of synthetic biology and to discuss our project with the public. When we organized the Aachen iGEM Meetup 2014 , we also made sure to include a public part where all teams who participated in our meetup had the opportunity to present their project to a general audience.
In general, we received positive feeback throughout. The students we worked with in the NEAnderLab also filled out evaluation sheets, giving us very good marks for our collaboration. Through our work with the different people we encountered during our Policy & Practices work, we were able to inform people in a comprehensible way about synthetic biology and gene technology in general. We see this as a successful first step towards a society that embraces the possibilities provided by Synthetic Biology, and recommend approaches like the school collaborations to other iGEM teams who want the spread the idea of synthetic biology.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Concept2_-_-_TEXT.html," the lytic cycle, the circular DNA is replicated in great quantity in the cytoplasm; a lot of viral progeny are formed, driving to the cell death and the virions liberation. During the lysogenic cycle, the phage genome is integrated in the bacterial chromosome, and is transmitted to the line of descent. The replication is achieved at the rythm of the bacterial cell division.
Naturally infectious for the bacteria Escherichia coli, the lambda phage, as every phage, is not infectious for man. This characteristic comes from the fact that the genome is governed by prokaryotic promoters but also because it has a very low capacity to transfect eukaryotic cells.
Finally, one of the most interesting characteristics of the lambda phage is the fact that he has a linear double stranded DNA, with cohesive ends: 12 nucleotides complementary “sticky” ends, called “Cos” sequence. These cohesive ends have a genomic encapsidation function.

The encapsidation of the therapeutic plasmid [2,3,4,5,6,7]
The encapsidation of the viral genome is particular for the lambda phage. It is managed by the Cos sequence . This characteristic allows the specific encapsidation of the sequence of interest.
We can observe in this picture that the initiation and the terminaison of the encapsidation is mediated by the Cos sequence . This is the fragment between two Cos sequences which is encapsidated. This particularity is used in molecular biology since several years in order to create DNA banks and molecular tools named Cosmides.
According to this fact, we decided to encapsidate, inside the cell vector, only the therapeutic plasmid . So, the Cos sequence of the lambda genome is deleted, and are placed in the therapeutic plasmid .
Non-coding sequence Cos: Position 1-132 et 48462-48502 – length: 174 bp.

Project Formation
For the past two years, the Wash U & Penn State iGEM team has been working to progress the Nitrogen Project. In our first group meetings, we had to determine if we, too, wanted to contribute. Both of the previous teams worked on finding the genes necessary for expressing nitrogen in E. coli. However, they had limited success – one team claimed to find nitrogenase activity, but the results were never replicated. The other never succeeded in constructing their complex plasmids. However, we didn’t want to abandon their work and shirk the resources and knowledge of the professors and graduate students who we would be working alongside all summer. So we tried to carve out a new niche in the Nitrogen Project for ourselves – and we looked outside Wash U for help.
Enter Sarah Carlson, a project manager at the Practical Farmers of Iowa. Initially, we called her to get a better idea of the environmental consequences of nitrate fertilizer runoff in the Midwest. We explained that the Nitrogen Project aimed to eliminate fertilizer use altogether. Contrary to how we thought she’d respond, Carlson stated that fertilizer was not the battle to fight. Nitrates leak from the soil regardless of fertilizer use and, instead, we should work to plant cover crops to soak up the excess.
This had a very strong impact on our direction for the project. If nitrogen-fixing plants won’t have the world-changing impacts we believe, were there other problems we could tackle with research that fit within the bounds of the nitrogen project? What other applications weren’t we considering?
After our conversation with Carlson, we took a closer look at the cellular conditions necessary for nitrogenase function. While we were still motivated to work on the Nitrogen Project, our scope was now adjusted. Perhaps we could make a cell that would improve nitrogenase’s function, but avoid the laborious task of actually inserting nitrogenase’s genes. We thought that a cell with the perfect conditions for nitrogenase could also be used with other recombinant proteins – we’d just have to select the right conditions to improve.
While our new project still fit into the scope of the Nitrogen Project and we continued to understand the"

We ascribed the inability of our model to the fact that the precise descriptions contain too many equations and parameters and we felt obliged to establish a simplified model in place of the precise one for simulation and further analysis.

現在では、バイオアートでは「生きているもの（living forms）」を用いて作らなければならないと言う考え方が一般的です。しかし、この「生きているもの」の定義は、未だ明確に決まっていません。 このように、バイオアートはまだ生まれたばかりの新しい芸術なのです。
既存のバイオアートの例(Wikipediaより引用)
しかし、既存のバイオアートは、バイオテクノロジーなどの専門的な設備・知識が必要なために一般の人が身近に使うことのできるものではなく、私たちの「科学をより身近に」というキーワードに合致しません。そこで私たちは、バイオアートを手軽に楽しめる新しいアートツールの開発に取り組みました。
私たちは、一つの大腸菌にインクとして作り出させた無数の色を持つE.coli Penという、今までにないアートツールを開発しました。このE.coli Penは、新しいアートツールとしてバイオアートの分野を発展させるだけでなく、発色の美しさや絵を描く楽しさとともに生命現象のシステムも学ぶことができる知育玩具としても役立ちます。

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Brainstorm_-_-_TEXT.html,". LuxR activates several gene including LuxI. Here they used LuxR in a sensing mechanism.  When LuxR binds AHL its will overexpress hydrogen perioxide coding genes.  Entire system was onto a high copy plasmide in E.Coli. They showed the system is able to detect and kill pathogens by a coculture assay. They have successfully demonstrated the overproduction of hydrogen peroxide in E. coli (JI377) using the pyruvate oxidase from S. pneumoniae. This “oxidative burst” is sufficient to kill a competing strain of JI377 cells in co-culture assays
Difficulties: The most surprising finding was that the cells began expressing hydrogen peroxide a full hour before they were induced with AHL. The current hypothesis is that some component of the rich SOC media mimicked AHL and activated LuxR. However, no such autoinduction occurred in the defined minimal media M9. It would be interesting to see if LuxR spontaneously activates expression in a rich defined media
Production of hydrogen peroxide is not a normal occurrence in the large intestine, and its effects would need to be investigated before the engineered strain could be used to fight fection.
Heidelberg - Ecolicense to kill
Valencia - Hot Yeast
Idea:  Heat is vital for life. Some organisms are able to maintain their internal temperature constant, while other not. UCP1, thermogenin is a mammalian uncoupling protein in the mitochondrial inner membrane. When protons pass through the  UPC complex instead of the ATP synthase complex they produce heat instead of ATP. They tried to express the UPC1 in a S.cerevisiae strain, so this strain would be able to maintain its temperature constant in a given range.
Applications: - A cell which is able to maintain its own temperature so no external heating would be necessary, this could reduce the electrical costs in a lab. - The system could be implement in some plant species. If a plan6 would be able to maintain its own temperature it could grow in a colder temperature or survival frost.
1) In order to detect and measure temperature production they build a Liquid Cultured Calorimeter(LCC). Therefore they used commercial thermo flasks, isolation material(Armaflex), hardware and software. The isolation material Armaflex caused some problems because it reacts with water.
2) They build a UPC + strain, a UPC - strain and two mutants. Gly 76 and Gly 175 mutant(deletion in 76 or 175 Gly triplet). LCC experiments showed that the two mutants where able to heat up there"

Following the successful verification digest (figure 22), the samples were sent for sequencing. We did a Kapa PCR of BBa_J04500 + TALE A , but the gel of the PCR products showed a band size that was approximately 1000bp less than expected. This PCR was done so we could use it for other constructions. Instead we ordered new primers to try a different approach to our remaining constructs.
Figure 22.Verification digest on construct 11*.
Now that we have our TALEs we need to express them. We are experimenting using different time points and IPTG amounts to determine how to best express our proteins. We will be running our samples on SDS PAGE gels next week.
Week 17: August 19 - August 23
This week we repeated overnight cultures, minipreps, and sequencing of BBa_J04500 + TALE A and construct 11* ( pSBIC3 - BBa_J04500 - TALE A -link-Blac), as previous sequencing results were inconclusive.
For TALE protein characterization and expression we did a trial run to determine the optimum time point and IPTG concentration.
We subcultured our overnight cultures of TALE A , TALE B , the positive control RFP and the negative control BBa_J04500 . For each pellet and supernatant, we had 3 time points 3 hours, 6.5 hours, and 24 hours and 3 IPTG concentrations of 0.1mM, 0.4mM, and 0.8mM for a total of 72 samples on 8 SDS page gels. Our results indicate that the optimum IPTG concentration is 4mM and 8mM IPTG and induction time of 3 hours and 6.5 hours.
A subsequent SDS page gel was run with TALE A , TALE B , Beta lactamase, BBa_J04500 , and RFP .
We also received new primers for construct 10 and 11. We set up a PCR of the construct 10 primers and BBa_J04500 + TALE A template DNA. The gel of the PCR products showed 1800bp bands, which were too small. We repeated the PCR with an increased extension time and the gel showed bands of the expected size. The PCR product was purified and cut with BsaI, ligated together and transformed.
We set up a PCR of the construct 11 primers and BB"
Warsaw,2012,Team:Warsaw#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," primer without overhang
Then for thirty more cycles temperature of annealing was calculated for the whole long primer with overhang – that is because from this moment there was enough product of the reaction in the reaction mix to become a template for the next cycles
And that's it!
Then we cloned our PCR product into pJet plasmid, using special kit for cloning PCR products , and transformed with it E. coli TOP10. After isolation of the plasmid, we confirmed the sequence of received product by DNA sequencing (traditional Sanger sequencing). From this step, our parts were ready to digest and clone with procedures recommended by iGEM :)
We managed to optimize reaction conditions and received all of ours parts by PCR reaction. Unfortunately, then we faced some problems and weren't as successful as we hoped. We didn't manage to confirm all our products' sequences by DNA sequencing. Finally we received a full BioBrick part:
Promoter
Two RBS, BBa_K780001 and BBa_K780002
Terminator
Third step
As soon as we received our first full and confirmed BioBrick part, we started preparing our construct for Bacillus subtilis. We began from ligation of this part with GFP, because that would allow us to check if our promoter and RBSes work. We used 3A assembly procedure, which we found on iGEM website. We followed the set pattern:
We knew that we had still a long way ahead to receive our full construct in Bacillus subtilis, and so we decided to start measuring our parts in E. Coli for the start. Measurement in E. Coli is the most common standard of measurement in iGEM community. We predicted that our parts will be working also in E. coli, but with lower efficiency than in Bacillus subtilis.
We successfully measured our RBS37 (BBa_K780002) comparing to RBS Bba_B0034, and we obtained result 10,13%.
We also tried to measure our other parts, but we didn't manage to put together full constructs with them, so the measurement was impossible.
Step four
When we had a ready construct consisting of promoter + RBS + GFP we cloned it on pTG262 vector . This plasmid, which was constructed and sent to us by Edinburgh iGEM Team, is the only autoreplicating plasmid meeting iGEM standards designed for Bacillus subtilis. We managed to successfully clone our insert to the vector, what we confirmed by digesting with EcoRI and Pst"
US_AFRL_CarrollHS,2018,Team:US AFRL CarrollHS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," In addition, they were tasked with performing another Gibson assembly, this time joining the CheZ inserts with various ribosomal binding sites to the insert and backbone. Both transformations went into the incubator overnight, with the LabPats hoping for its success. Late in the day, Annie performed the Flow Cytometry portion of the Interlab.
Lab 2
The RX lab students woke up very early in the morning with a plan to collect Interlab data.  They started by taking the prepped Interlab cultures and taking the OD reading in order to determine how much of the sample was needed in order to reduce the ABS 600 to 0.02 in a 12 mL culture.  A time 0 samples were placed on ice and the time 6 were placed in the incubator as according to the protocol.    After Interlab was finally set up, the team split into the two groups once again in order to cover more ground and complete the necessary work of the project. Peter, Chris, and Travis started testing on Yarrowia covered plates with various concentrations of chitinase from Streptomyces Griseus  in order to find the effective concentration.  They also resuspended Chitinase C-1 from IDT and began assembly of the chitinase into the ice nucleation plasmid.  After the assembly was completed, they then transformed onto Amp plates and left to incubate overnight and hopefully grow colonies. Max and Jonah continued with the plate testing of cinnamaldehyde since this is a multiple day process with a lot of waiting periods for growth.  They also took the readings of the Interlab samples after the 6 hour incubation period was completed and then sent the samples over to RH for the flow cytometry readings.
Friday (07/20/18)
Lab 1
The next day, the LabPats looked at the transformations from the previous day. They were disappointed to see that none of the transformations worked. Saddened, they continued to persist and discuss new ways to approach it. First, they settled on re-doing the PCR, as there may have been an error early on in the process before extracting the “RhlR” plasmid. Thus, they started again, completing a PCR and running it on a gel. After looking at the bands, however; the students were still disappointed to discover that the bands were popping up in the wrong place and the backbone, which is supposed to be at 3,000 base pairs, did not appear as so. Looks like it’s back to the drawing board!

Fudan-CHINA,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," we are not the first one to introduce VEGF-scFv to iGEM. Team NCTU-Formosa did this work in the year 2015 (BBa_K1694003). Nevertheless, to our regret, we find that there is no experimental structure in PDB (Protein Data Base), which may decrease the reliability of the outcome if we optimize VEGF-scFv based on this part. Thus, this year we introduced a new type of VEGF-scFv (BBa_K2886002) that has accepted structure in PDB, enabling us to work out a much more credible improvement. And, we also simulate the structure of BBa_K1694003 to help us learn about our improvements.
Figure 1. The structure of VEGF-scFv and the interface score of modified version of BBa_K2886002 compared with original version and BBa_K1694003. (a) VEGF-scFv is two outermost Ig-like domains of the antibody of VEGF joined together with a GS linker. (b) According to the interface scores which indicate the affinity of VEGF-scFv to VEGF of revised BBa_K2886002, original BBa_K2886002 and BBa_K1694003, we can draw the conclusion that revised BBa_K2886002 probably has a higher affinity to VEGF after our modification.
As is vividly depicted in the Figure 1, we can find that compared to the binding surface of their original version of BBa_K2886002, the mutant version has a lower interface score, which indicates that our work does make sense. For more detailed information of this process, please click here to visit our Receptor Optimization page.
Summary
What we do has set a good example for iGEM teams. Using similar tool and strategy, you can make improvements to your target protein to make it more practical or we can even endow new functions to a protein theoretically, which is definitely promising in the field of synthetic biology.

Stuttgart,2018,Team:Stuttgart#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," in 10 µL ddH2O using ZymocleanTM Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research). The NodC restriction reaction was purified using Monarch PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit (NEB). After ligation and transformation in E. coli DH5α colonies were picked for overnight culture and plasmid DNA checked by double digestion with XbaI and PstI and agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure C.1, rightmost lane). DNA sequence and plasmid map can be found in the registry ( BBa_K2848000 ).
Expression of BBa_K2380002/-042 and our combined construct BBa_K2848000 was performed using a culture volume of 100 mL. Cells were disrupted in phosphate buffer by high pressure homogenization using an EmulsiFlex C5 (Avestin, ATA Scientific). Proteins were purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (HisTrap column, ÄKTA, GE Healthcare) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Figure C.2).
Figure C.2: SDS-PAGE of purified protein fractions after expression using BBa_K2380002 (NodC), BBa_K2380042 (NodB) and BBa_K2848000 (NodC+NodB). Red arrow: NodC.
As successful expression of NodC was noticed, enzyme activity was tested by UDP Glo assay. Results of the corresponding luminescence measurements are displayed in figure C.3.
Figure C.3: Activity assay of purified NodC after expression using BBa_K2380002 (NodC) and BBa_K2848000 (NodC + NodB). Assay was performed using the UDP-Glo Kit (Promega) and UDP-GlcNAC as substrate. Activity was measured by detecting luminescence with a TECAN microplate reader, integration time = 1 s.
In figure C.3 the activity of NodC expressed from our combined BioBrick has a much higher activity than NodC expressed from BBa_K2380002. As there was no change in the sequence of the NodC expression cassette the reason for this higher activity is not clear. Further experiments have to be conducted to validate the activity of NodC.

Conclusions
Taken together, the characterization of the miniTn7BB-Gm minitransposon indicates that this element is able to transpose efficiently in both an enterobacterial (E. coli), and a non-enterobacterial (P. putida) host, consistent with the previously described wide host-range of Tn7. The transposon can be delivered by means of electrotransformation, heat-shock transformation and conjugal mating from three different delivery vectors. We have also shown that most transposition events in both hosts occur in a site-specific fashion, at the known attTn7 sites present in their chromosomes. Finally, we have shown that the gentamycin resistance can be excised by flipase-dependent site-specific recombination at least in one of the hosts (P. putida), leaving an unmarked strain that may be suitable for applications in which the use of drug resistance markers is not acceptable.

wash and autoclave glassware
prepare 20% raffinose stock solution, filter sterilize
calculate transformation efficiency from last week's transformations (need OD measurements from that day)
figure out primers to verify yeast transformations (pRS primers don't seem like they'll work!)
recheck sizes of all parts to ensure that they do not overlap (making sure that colony PCR will work)
innoculate cultures by 5 pm and put into incubator for TEST #1
----------------------------
Due to time constraints, both today and also predicted for tomorrow, decided to only test all parts related to ZifA and its reporter.  Thus, the following parts were innoculated today:
pRS305 + pRS306
nullA + pRS306
ZifA (Z0267) + pRS306
pRS305 + ZifA rpt (Z0637)
nullA + ZifA rpt (Z0637)
ZifA (Z0267) + ZifA rpt (Z0637) from colony (7/4)
ZifA (Z0267) + ZifA rpt (Z0637) from glycerol stock #1
ZifA noflo + ZifA rpt (Z0637)
This represents the largest amount of parts that we have for any activator.  Also innoculated two controls, one with dex and one with gal.  Placed all tubes into incubator just before 6 pm.
It was discovered going through the plates that there is a strong need to consolidate the glycerol stocks.  It appears that there are several plates containing transformations that have never been made into glycerol stocks, but because the shared list is incomplete, it is hard to say.
Number of colonies on the 1:1 plate:

mCherry - 587 ex, 610 em and EYFP - 514 ex, 527 em
Took cultures out of incubator around 2:25 pm, 20 hr and 25 min.
Discovered lack of growth in several of the cultures from last night, especially those whose carbon source was galactose.  This could simply be due to the fact that the tubes with galactose were innoculated after each respective tube containing dextrose, such that the dextrose tubes had first contact with each colony.  All dex tubes experienced growth except for

Continuing efforts to make our own ‘generators’ (e.g. RFP_gen) that is relevant to our project - using the relevant promoters and RBSs. This will provide us with other options if RFP is deemed suboptimal.
We have found an isothermal PCR (RPA) kit for use with our project. RPA was chosen as the best candidate because of it’s reasonably low operating temperature at 37-39C, compared to another commercially available isothermal PCR system, SDA, which has an optimal temperature 60+C.
We also had our second AITF GeekStarter workshop. A significant takeaway was learning about an alternative assembly method. Using the type IIs restriction enzyme BsaI, and custom primers that would allow us to produce custom sticky ends we could theoretically assemble our entire construct (4-6 parts) in one reaction, which would drastically cut down our time spent in the lab. This will be attempted in parallel to the traditional BioBrick assembly procedure.
Week 10: July 14 - 25
We have obtained a Blood PCR Kit from KAPA that allows direct PCR from whole blood without the isolation of DNA beforehand. We are also in the process of ordering an isothermal PCR kit (RPA; Recombinase Polymerase Amplification) from TwistDx. Since we intend on performing isothermal PCR on whole blood samples we are looking into the molecular details of the conditions in both KAPA Blood PCR and TwistDx basic RPA kit in order to effectively combine both technologies into a suitable strategy for us to obtain a prepared and PCR-amplified sample. We have asked for further support in the form of information from KAPA.
Primers that will allow us to carry out the modified method of ‘Golden Gate’ assembly have been placed for order, we are now waiting for them so that we may begin 1-step assembly. We are also waiting on our synthesized genes.
We have been contacted by 2 more groups so far for collaboration, details are being worked out. We now have three potential collaborations to work on from Purdue, Cornell and Colombia iGEM teams.
Efforts are still being made to assemble our genetic detection circuit manually, using the traditional BioBrick assembly method. However, many failures have been witnessed and it appears to be an uphill battle.

Grenoble-Alpes,2017,Team:Grenoble-Alpes#LabBook_-_-_TEXT.html," to stop close on itself, 3 successive dephosphorylations of EcoRI digested plasmid J04450 were done.
For each dephosphorylation step, two transformations were made: one with digested plasmid X time dephosphorylated ; the other with the same that underwent a ligation step (without insert, just the enzyme).
The “3 times dephosphorylated” was satisfying because low number of colonies appeared on the plates with or without ligase comparing to plate with undigested plasmid, meaning the plasmid lose ability to close by itself.
Thus, the plasmid “3 times dephosphorylated” was used for the probe insertion. Again, different molar ratios were tested:  1:1, 3:1, 7:1 and 10:1, like in the second essay. A screening of 12 colonies was done to check if some had incorporated a plasmid with the probe.

The detector that has been sent to iGEM as the part BBa_K2299000 is the one containing the second version of the probe, i.e. the version inserted thanks to EcoR1 and Xba1 site.  This insertion appeared to be much easier because self-ligation of the plasmid backbone could not happen anymore, and all the phosphorylation steps could be skip.

Progress of parts
[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
The plates with ligation A (blp + GFP) were fetched from the blue light installation. There was no GFP signal. The following actions will be taken:
The plasmids will be purified from the colonies and will be sequenced using primer 2260.
Next time, we will probably put them in liquid cultures under the LED's while shaking gently. Also, other parameters that need to be considered are being researched.
They will not be exposed to the light as long anymore. We decided that 1h will be more than enough.
Possible bleaching?
A colony from all three plates with the LigA-construct was taken and ented in liquid culture. This was needed to check whether the colonies were still alive.

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

Still working with the control of the pipette.
I tried to test different parameters:
→ How much can we reduce the time for pressing a button? I found that the delay time 175ms for HIGH and LOW levels is a good value. With several tests, I didn’t notice any bug.
→  How can we change the volume faster? If we keep the button up or down pressed then it goes faster. So I made a graph with the delay time we keep pressed on the button and the delta in volume it implies. !!
NOTE: the next value after 10μL is 0.20μL
06/20/2018
The code is now quite well structured with different functions and parameters easy to modify.
Seems like everything is working perfectly.
There is :
→ One function to set the volume with the initial and the wanted volume as parameters It can use another function to determine the time we need to keep the button up or down pressed to change the volume faster.
→ One function to set the speeds in and out.
→ Functions to aspire and dispense the liquid

I worked with Charles on the conditioning circuit for the photodiode. We managed to make it work on the breadboard circuit but something is still wrong with the PCB.
06/28/2018 → 06/29/2018
I worked with Thomas on the mechanics for the circular movement of the carousel. We made some wedges to reduce the weight on the motor itself hoping that it would have an easier and more linear movement.

Meeting/brainstorming with the engineering team in the morning to take stock of the situation on every modules, what components we need to order, and all the constraints we have.
→ We have to speed up on the “mechanics” and “pipette”  modules to be able to design the pieces we need on CAD.
So I started to work on the Eppendorf 1000uL pipette the LMGP gave us. However, there is a problem we didn’t realise before : the eject tip button is mechanical… additionally we need a really small adaptor for the power supply that we don’t have. So, no test can be done for now, and it seems like we have to buy another pipette like we had before but designed for a bigger volume.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Selection#KnockOutKnochIn_-_-_TEXT.html," flanked fragments of the designed DNA construct, the expected length for a successful integration of the reporter gene in the genome was given.    Therefore, the knock-out, knock-in experiment was successful and the reporter was perfectly integrated into the JS200 genome.
Figure 3: Results of the genomic cPCR of the possible knock-out/knock-in strains. For this gel 13 colonies of the ampicillin containing agar plates were picked. The expected band of the knock-out/knock-in strain was about 3000 bp in size. With the 1 kb ladder as the length standard, it is seen that the colonies 2, 6, 7, 9 and 13 have the expected result.
Although the integration was successful, it was not possible to test the advantages of this modification in vivo, due to the time limitations. The different HA4 mutants could not be tested, because the cloning from pSB1C3 to pSB1K3 took long. Unfortunately the final measurement of the system with the mutants could not be completed.   Nevertheless, we can proudly report the, that we designed a functional bacterial two-hybrid system and we paved the way for upcoming experiments with the system."

Characterization of K1392991
Here, we characterized the part K1392991 by ligasing K316003 and J23108. After centrifugation E. coli DH5a at 3000rpm for 3 minutes, we burst the cells and let the enzymes free in solution. Then, adding 1 mL of catechol(0.1M) into tube, color change into green.
At the following picture, there is Catechol (1,2-benzenediol) present in Left tube. It proves that in presence of catechol there is a degredation process in k316003+j23108.
There is no Catechol (1,2-benzenediol) present in Right tube. It proves that in absence of catechol there is no degredation of PET in k316003+j23108.
This characterization contains parts that Imperial_College_London created in year 2010, we have proved that it works well and we aproved its function with our own construct of its use.
At the following picture, the liquid is 0.1M catechol (1,2 benzenediol) itself:
According to gel image: Left, part is closed to 2300bp. Right, linearized backbone is closed to 4000bp.

Bacto-Aid
Description
Bacto-Aid
This project was chosen due to the interest in synthetic spider silk. An article of interest concluded that synthetic spider silk fused to human defensins was stable while preserving the antimicrobial effect of the defensins, thus it became one of the founding pillars of our project Gomes, Silvia C, Isabel B Leonor, Joao F Mano, Rui L Reis og David L Kaplan (2011). “Antimicrobial functionalized genetically engineered spider silk.” eng. I: Bio- materials 32.18, s. 4255–4266. issn: 1878- 5905 <. The idea of making PHB a part of our project as the plastic in the bandage, evolved from the desire to solve the growing problem of plastic pollution. Bacto-Aid was the perfect project to make our two wishes come to life.
The three major subparts of our project are thoroughly described in the following sections.
The bacteriocins are the antimicrobial peptides in our hybrid silk. Resistance development has been creating difficulties in treating infections with traditional antibiotics. Since no resistance has been observed against bacteriocins that have been used the past 50 years, they show great potential as an alternative treatment. The bacteriocins act bactericidally through pore formation and interfere with intracellular enzymatic reactions of the specific targeted bacteria Zendo, T., Yoneyama, F., & Sonomoto, K. (2010). Lactococcal membrane-permeabilizing antimicrobial peptides. <. Bacteriocins are  proteins, but are not used today for therapeutical use due the denaturation in the stomach. Intravenous administration has been tested in vivo and shows promising results Lohans, C. T., & Vederas, J. C. (2012). Development of Class IIa Bacteriocins as Therapeutic Agents.

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

Once the medium was completely absorbed by the agar (to avoid UV absorption by medium), cells were irradiated inside the TORDEITOR (the device we specially designed for this experiment) with different amounts of UV light (lambda=254 nm). To fine tune UV dose, we used a shutter (similar to those used in cameras, click here to see an explicative video) able to produce UV pulses of less than 1 second of duration. After that, cells were harvested from the agar plate with SOC medium supplemented with ampicillin. Finally, OD and fluorescence intensity were measured at different times. An aliquot of the same culture that was not irradiated was used as control.
As we can see in the graph below, UV exposure does induce the expression of ZsGreen1. Furthermore, longer exposures result in higher levels of protein expression (higher fluorescence intensity was observed, as expected according to the molecular mechanism of lexA promoter), although lethal effects were observed when doses about 5 seconds were applied.
Figure 10. Fluorescence intensity (FI) normalized by the optical density (OD) of cultures that were subjected to UV exposures of different duration in comparison to a control culture (not exposed). Measures were taken 70 min after the exposure.
Figure 11. Fluorescence intensity (FI) normalized by the optical density (OD) of cultures that were subjected to UV exposures of different duration in comparison to a control culture (not exposed). Measures were taken 90 min after the exposure.

DspB
DspB has been isolated and purified and has been shown to increase dissemination of wild type cells from biofilms and restore dissemination in mutant cells ( Kaplan 2003 ).
DspB comes from the bacteria Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.  It is most likely an N-acetylglucosaminidase that causes the detachment of cells from biofilm colonies through the 1→ 4 glycosidic bond of β-substituted N-acetylglucosamine ( Kaplan 2003 ).  DspB is homologous to family 20 glycosyl hydrolases which cleave terminal monosaccharide residues ( Kaplan 2003 ).
One possible substrate for DspB is a type IV pilus required for the attachment and autoaggregation of bacteria by altering its adhesive properties.  Another possible substrate is exopolymeric substance (EPS) which is part of the exopolysaccharide matrix which plays a role in biofilm formation.  Exopolysaccharides may contain N-acetylglucosamine which DspB is thought to hydrolyze. Manuel et. al have characterized the mechanistic aspects of DspB and show that conserved D183 and E184 resemble the proposed 20 β-hexosaminidase mechanism; that aromatic residues W237, Y278 and D183 assist N-acetal group orientation and hydrolysis; that Y187 plays a role in specificity; and that residues R27, E332 and W330 help stabilize the transition state of hydrolysis ( Manuel 2007 ).
We  received WT gene from University of British Columbia 2010 iGEM Team .  We sequenced this gene and found ten variations from Aggragatibacter actinomycetemcomitans strain HK1651 genomic DNA.  We then proceeded to codon optimize it for expression in Caulobacter.  This gene was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) . Optimized dspB is Part:BBa_K531004 .

Hesse Day - Local Outreach in Marburg's Federal State
To reach out to all sorts of people of different social groups, we presented our iGEM project on the Hesse Day (dt.: Hessentag) in Korbach, as well as introducing basic biological principles. In the federal State of Hessen, the Hessentag is the biggest annual public festival. The ten-day lasting event took place for the 58th time and welcomed approximately 845.000 visitors this year. It unites the different parts of Hessen celebrating diversity, differences, integrations as well as tolerance. Besides a rich cultural program involving live music, arts and crafts, the Hessentag offers the space for education and knowledge transfer for everyone who is interested.
The ProLOEWE initiative and ""Hesse creates knowledge""
Figure 1: A side view on our activities and posters at the Hesse Day.
The initiative ""Hessen schafft Wissen"" (engl.: ""Hesse creates knowledge"") and ProLOEWE contribute in this important part of the Hessentag by promoting the dialogue with the society and advertises Hesse as scientific valuable location. The exhibitions of various companies, organizations as well as universities arouse the interest in significant social and scientific issues while showing their work. Since Synmikro, one of our main sponsors, is partly funded by LOEWE, we embraced the chance to collaborate with the PROLOEWE initiative to advertise science as an irreplaceable and fun part of Society and source of our prosperity.
Experimental Fun for Everyone!
Figure 1: Discussing what DNA is and how it influences our life with a large selfmade puzzle
For the purpose to induct people into biology concepts and methods, we offered several child-orientated hands-on experiments on the Hesse Day. All experiments and posters we developed were united under the broad banner of microorganism and their benefit for the world - Naturally, with Vibrio natriegens as our highlight.
The central activities showcasing both methods in chemistry and biology were the extraction of DNA and red cabbage as natural pH-indicator. With household items and some easy steps, the children could create their own red cabbage artwork and take their own extracted DNA home.
To simplify the difficult concept of DNA, we crafted a large DNA-puzzle where a Codon-Code translated to one letter in the alphabet. Children could then write their own"
Stockholm,2015,Team:Stockholm#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," The structure and function of EnvZ are outlined in Figure 2.
Figure 2: An overview of the structure and function of EnvZ.
Since the secondary structure of the periplasmic domain has not been determined experimentally, we had to rely on predictions. A first prediction was made using the RaptorX protein prediction server . We then consulted with researcher Roger Draheim who had run a prediction of the periplasmic domain with the Phyre2 tool . These predictions were very similar, and the Figure below is based on the Phyre2 model and rendered with PyMol . Based on this prediction, Draheim suggested that the domain was structurally similar TIpB, another bacterial receptor found in H. pylori. In TIpB, two alpha-helices are responsible for dimerization. The rest of the periplasmic region in TIpB is composed of beta strands, coils and a single helix which forms a ligand binding domain . Based on this, we decided to insert the genetic construct for ZHER2:342 into EnvZ, as shown in Figure 3. This chimeric receptor is hereby referred to as EnvZ-Affibody chimera.
Four constructs of the chimeric receptor were designed. In the Figure below, regions that were replaced with ZHER2:342 in each construct are colored red.
Figure 3: Bacterial antigen receptor (BAR) constructs 1, 2 and 3 with the parts on EnvZ replaced with Z:HER2:342 marked in red.
From the Figure 3, it can be seen that construct 1 was created by replacing part of the PAS domain with the affibody Z:HER2:342. This resulted in 62 residues in EnvZ were exchanged for 52 residues in the affibody. The PAS Beta sheet/Coil I region was kept as this was thought to effect dimerization. Unlike construct 1, construct 2 was created by first adding a GSGGGSG linker to the C-terminal of the affibody molecule. After this the affibody+linker replaced in the same part as for construct 1, resulting in 62 residues being exchanged for 66 residues.
The final construct (BAR3) was created by replacing a smaller part of the PAS domain. This resulted in 27 residues in EnvZ were exchanged for 58 residues in the affibody.

Gas Chromatography
Gas Chromatography is a method used for separating and analyzing compounds by injecting ａ sample mixture into a column prepared to be in a suitable stationary phase and passing a gas （carrier gas） in the mobile phase through the column, in order to separate the mixture into its components by making use of the difference in retention capacity against the stationary phase. This method can be applied to a gaseous or vaporizable sample, and is used for identification, purity testing, and quantitative determination.

XJTLU-CHINA x Suzhou Science and Technology Museum
With the cooperation of Suzhou Science and Technology Museum for Youth,                             We organized an activity “Discover the Mysterious of Life”.                             Approximately 400 teenagers and their parents attended the activity.                             We invited our Head of the Department, Prof. Mu Wang to be the guest speaker.                             Then we introduce the basic concept and application of synthetic biology,                             followed interacting with audiences.
Summer camp
This year, for the first time,                             we cooperated with Zibo City Teachers College to hold a “high school student science experiment summer camp” spanning six days.                             About 50 young people aged 15-17 participated.                             This summer camp contains different disciplines,                             provides opportunities for students from different backgrounds to experiment with experiments and initially develops an interest in science.
Affiliated school
In collaboration with the affiliated school of Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,                             We launched a series of course called “Synthetic Biology and Life” into the STEM class and tried different teaching devices,                             such as using the $1 microscope Foldscope (by Manu Prakash) to observe cells in the classroom.
A high school in Zibo
In addition to the summer camp, we also held a science lecture for high school students.                             In the lecture,                             we introduced the basic concept and frontier research in synthetic biology to high school students and discussed with them the ethical and philosophical issues behind the biology,                             such as editing the biological genes in the Chinese cultural environment.
Suzhou Ulink international High School
In China, there are some high schools that study international courses such as IB,                             and Ulink is one of them. Many of them are interested in learning biology or related fields,                             interested in participating in iGEM in the future. We gave them a presentation of the concept of synthetic biology,                             the projects we have done before and the rules of iGEM. Made a brief introduction.

This summer, we collaborated with three 2016 teams and a 2015 team. We have been mentoring a new team, TMMU-China team, which we are the first one introducing iGEM to TMMU. We helped Jilin-China construct a part that optimizing expression and helped UESTC-China-software complete part of the validation experiments. Besides, we got in touch with the W&M team 2015 to get the “curriculum booklet” and had a lesson with 15 families, then communicated the improvements with W&M team. Finally, in the course of our human practices of popularizing iGEM , a high school, Chengdu NO.7 High School, is interested in it. With our help, it’s likely that they will establish an iGEM team next year.

1. How does the current phosphorus removal process work at a biological nutrient removal WWTPs?
Usually, when nutrient removal is required from WWTPs, they are obliged to significantly reduce the amount of both phosphorus and nitrogen from the influent (Tanyi, 2007). As such, even amongst biological nutrient removal WWTP, there are a few slightly different commonly used settings, such as the Phoredox, Bardenpho or A2O settings (Oleszkiewicz, 2015).
Let us illustrate the current phosphorus removal process using the most basic EBPR setting: A2O setting. Under the A2O process, once the influent has gone through the primary treatment, it enters the anaerobic zone, where the phosphorus accumulating organisms eat volatile fatty acids to gain energy. Subsequently, the phosphorus accumulating organisms move through the anoxic zone to the aerobic zone, where they use the stored energy to accumulate phosphorus from the influent. In the aerobic zone, an important step in nitrogen removal, called nitrification, occurs. Some of the influent is then recycled back to the anoxic zone so that denitrification, the second step in nitrogen removal process can take place (Nourmohammad, 2013). This way, phosphorus concentration is usually reduced down to 1 mg/l, whereas nitrogen concentration down to 10mg/l (Oleszkiewicz, 2015).
2. How does Phosphostore work?
We would first culture our Phosphostore bacteria through a continuous culture system and then place them in metal containers. Then, we would put these containers full of bacteria inside the aerobic zone, where our bacteria would remove phosphorus from the influent. After a few hours, we could take the containers out; all that is left inside is bacteria full of phosphorus. We can easily kill the bacteria full of accumulated phosphorus by putting them through a crossflow filtration system. The bacterial debris would be later sold on the market as fertiliser to partly cover the operating costs.
How would we culture our Phosphostore bacteria? - We envision our bacteria to be cultured in a chemostat for production. A chemostat is a bioreactor in which fresh medium is continually added while culture liquid containing leftover nutrients, microorganisms, and metabolic products are continuously removed at the same rate. This technique is called continuous culture and allows microbial growth to take place under steady-state conditions - growth that"

Newcastle,2018,Team:Newcastle#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,", we spent the week producing kill curves for each of our bacteria as to determine whether our concentration of naringenin was having an adverse effect on the growth of our bacteria. This was as we knew naringenin possessed antimicrobial properties thus it was important to work out if this was the reason that we found chemorepulsion for E. coli instead of no effect. During this week we also secured a sponsorship from ibidi who we are happy to say provided the team with their specialised μ-slideIII 3-in-1 chemotaxis slide which allowed us to visualise cell movement in response to naringenin via timelapse videos. It was also during this week that we reinvented our chemotaxis assay to be more in line with the work of Reyes-Darias et al. (2014) by reducing our agar percentage even further and utilising large, square plates in order to run multiple replicates and test distances on a single plate.
We also conducted a second attempt of Gibson with re – calculated values for the inserts. This was transformed as before and there was no growth on the plates. As this was thought to be due to the backbone concentration being far too low after purification, another PCR to linearise the backbone was conducted. This was ran on a gel and quantified to have a much higher concentration.
Week commencing: 03/09/2018
This week we carried out our reinvented chemotaxis assays that involved using minimal agar on square plates, and setting up a concentration gradient of naringenin, and obtained results which showed positive chemotaxis of Azospirillum brasilens towards 100uM narinegenin at distances between 0.5cm and 2.5cm! The most successful result was when the bacteria was at a distance of 1.5cm, so we will carry out repeats of this distance.
Another Gibson attempt with the new backbone and the gblocks was done. Following transformation this reaction yielded 2 colonies showing that the plasmid with chloramphenicol resistance had been taken up. In order to see whether the rest of the operon had been integrated into the plasmid, colony PCR and plasmid miniprep was conducted on both colonies. However only the plasmid had been taken up without the operon.
Week commencing: 10/09/2018
This week we were able to successfully transform Pseudomonas sp. with a gentamicin resistance gene by electroporation.
We also tested methods of sterilising plant tissue, such as using different concentrations of ethanol"

3. Quantitative characterization of Piezo1 and TRPC5
Mechanical stimuli are generated by three ways: 1) Hypoosmolarity; 2) Sonic wave; 3) Microfluidics
To quantitatively characterize these two channels, we employed hypoosmolarity and different magnitude of shear stress to stimulate cells. Besides, we also explored new manipulation using sound with different intensities and frequencies to test cells’ response.
Hypoosmolarity
After serial dilution of medium, we used osmotic pressure to generate mechanical stress exert on cell plasma membrane to activate Piezo1 or TRPC5 channel.
Diluted medium could induce a sharply increase in fluorescence intensity, reveals that cell could sense this stress, in other words, hypoosmolarity can trigger calcium influx through Piezo1 and TRPC5 channel.
Sound
In this part, we supposed that different frequencies and intensities would have great different impact on cells, so we employed a wide range of frequency and intensity of sound to stimulate the cell. We used home-made  sound generators utilizing piezo buzzers, balanced armatures, speakers, ultrasound transducers and atomisers to activate Piezo1 and TRPC5 channel. Fluorescence intensity increase could be observed after intracellular calcium concentration increased. There is little literature report of quantitive research on channels employing sound as stimulus, we wanted to quantify our experiment, simulation and calculation of how much energy we should apply on cell’s membrane.
The formula of sound intensity and its corresponding pressure on cell is below. P is pressure (N/m2), I is sound intensity (W/m2), ρ is medium density and c is sound velocity.
I = \frac{P^{2}}{2c\rho}
Microfluidics
We designed microfluidics chips to produce shear stress to stimulate Piezo1 and TRPC5 channel. We could manipulate the pressure on cell membrane by changing the culture medium flowing velocity in microfluidics channels. We have proved that, it could takes less than 1 second for R-GECO to reach maximum fluorescence intensity from receiving stimulus to release fluorescence. With numerical and analytical calculation of fluid dynamics equations, we could predict the sensitivity of MS channels in terms of mechanical stress (Fig. 7),"

Inhibitor
Background
IDEA
In molecular genetics, inhibitor is a DNA or RNA binding protein based on its function that it can inhibits the expression of one or more genes by binding to the operator or associated silencers. A DNA binding repressor can recognize special operator gene, then it will block the attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter or prevent RNA polymerase to move along the direction of DNA, thus it can stop genes from being transcripted into messenger RNA.
The RNA-binding repressor binds to the mRNA to prevent the translation. However, all is fair, this repression can also be relieved by some inducers. If an inducer, which can initiate the expression of gene , is present, it will interact with the inhibitor protein and detach it from the operator. RNA polymerase will have the chance to transcribe.
Corepressor is the molecule which can combined with inhibitor, helping it bind to the operator more tightly and repressing  transcription. An inhibiter that binds with a corepressor is termed “aporepressor” or “inactive repressor”. One type of aporepressor is the trp repressor, an important metabolic protein.
The above mechanism of repression is a type of feedback mechanism because it only allows transcription to start if specific inducers are present.
Inhibitor protein is widely used in logical gene circuit construction, controlling the expression of special genes or important metabolic processes
Mechanism
We choose three types of inhibitor-promoter: LacIq-plac, CI-pR and TetR-ptet to regulate the threshold based on our need.
LacIq-pLac
LacI repressor is a DNA-binding protein which can inhibit lac promoter from expressing genes, which are relative to lactose metabolism( from expressing lactose metabolism relative genes).
These genes are repressed when lactose is not available to the cell, ensuring that the bacterium only invests energy in the production of machinery necessary for uptake and utilization of lactose when lactose is present.
When lactose becomes available, it is converted into allolactose, which combines with the LacI and inhibits the LacI’s DNA binding ability. Loss of DNA binding by the lac repressor is required for transcriptional activation of the operon. LacIq is a mutation type of"

BioBrick parts and standard assembly
A BioBrick part can be defined as a DNA sequence (encoding a particular biological function) that conforms to a set of standard rules . The Registry of Standard Biological Parts consists of over 2000 standard parts, each of which can be assembled according to BioBrick assembly standards to create multi-component parts of increasing complexity and functionality (Shetty et al., 2008) .
There are different assembly standards, namely BioBrick Standard Assembly ( RFC 10 ), BioBrick BB-2 Assembly ( RFC 21 ), Silver/Fusion Bricks ( RFC 23 ), Freiburg Fusion Protein ( RFC 25 ) and BioBrick MoClo (RFC 1000).  ( Registry of Standard Biological Parts, iGEM ; Knight, 2007 ; Knight, 2008 ; Anderson et al., 2009 ; Philips et al., 2006 ; Grünberg et al., 2009 ). The BioBrick assembly standard RFC 10 is the most widely used assembly standard ( Registry of Standard Biological Parts, iGEM ). Each year hundreds of iGEM teams all over the world contribute and submit BioBrick compatible parts to the registry. The BioBrick standard has a set of stringent requirements for a part to be RFC 10 compatible:
Should not contain Illegal and Avoidable sites
Allowed sequences within BioBrick parts include any DNA sequence    which does not contain the following sequences:
Illegal
EcoRI (gaattc)
XbaI (tctaga)
SpeI (actagt)
PstI (ctgcag)
Avoidable
NotI (gcggccgc)
Should have appropriate Prefix and Suffix
Each BioBrick part must contain the following sequence as suffix downstream of the 3' end of the part:
T ACTAGT A GCGGCCG CTGCAG
The prefix used for coding regions is different from the sequence for non-coding BioBrick parts. This is to allow the construction of ribosomal binding sequences 5' of    coding regions.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"; mainly ODEs. Khan Academy was very helpful with this.
With all three reactions being reversible, MATLABs dsolve function was not able to solve our differential equations. We tried them by hand but were not able to solve them analytically. We had to solve numerically and chose the Euler method. This involves iterating with short time intervals (here we used dt ≈ 1s) between each calculation using a loop to keep a record of how the substances changed over time. We then graphed these values as follows:
k1
k-1
k2

We’ve recreated this model so it’s actually running in the browser - try dragging the sliders above the graph to modify the rate constants.
Mass action kinetics model with transcription and translation
The first simple model neglected transcription and translation completely, which meant it was an excessive simplification and consequently was not that useful. To address these shortcomings, we created a second model, derived from parts of Tobias Stögbauer’s PhD, with many more species. [5]
This model was very slow to run (so slow we’re not going to try run it in the browser), as there were many species and thus more calculations needed to be done per loop. However, it primarily was slow as we needed a small dt value to keep the model accurate so there were more loops in total.
We had to use a very small dt value or errors could easily add up with so many species. It ended up taking about a minute to run each simulation which wasn’t acceptable for us, as we wanted to be able to quickly change parameters and ideally test a range of parameters. Speeding up the model would make it more useful to the wetlab team. They then could vary each of our parameters and see how they affected GFP output, for example seeing the effects of different switch designs and experimental setups.
Having lots of species also made it harder to find accurate rate constants for all the steps in the reaction. Tobias Stögbauer’s PhD was very useful for this, although many of his values weren’t that applicable to us as we used a different cell-free system leading to inaccuracies -  which were amplified when dt was increased.
It was also difficult to get useful data from the model as there were so many parameters that changing just one was unlikely to have a significant effect on the final result. This made it harder to draw conclusions from the model. For similar reasons it would also have made it hard to adjust the parameters to fit to our lab data when we had it. More parameters also increased the total uncertainty, decreasing the precision of our model.

Conclusion It is hard to draw conclusions from this gel, since RNA makes up most of the nucleic acid in the samples and no control pBluescript plasmid was added. The bands around 2-3kb could be pBluescript, but it is under debate why it would appear at two different heights then. There are really weak bands visible around 4kb, which could be the uncut plasmid containing the insert, but no fragments around 1 kb could be discovered - being the expected height for the digested inserts of moaA or cld.
To be able to draw firmer conclusions, a colony PCR was performed.

Overall design
During humanity’s constant exploration of the world, the greatest pursuit is to remodel it to improve human life. While ‘phase separation’ in cells is under intense investigation, experiencing a research boom, the scientific community hopes that this phenomenon ‘worth millions of dollars’ can be artificially designed to enhance native functions and even acquire new ones. Our team, Peking iGEM 2018, went all out to overcome the challenge: artificially design Synthetic Phase separation-based Organelle Platform (SPOT).
Then we put forward two questions: Why can phase separation in cells produce membrane-less organelles? And how can we design our system to implement its intended functions?
Like oil in water, the contents of cells can separate into droplets. According to physical principles, the process where materials self-assemble into organelles is described as ‘phase separation’, which is the conversion of a single-phase system into a multiphase system. In general, materials flow to regions with low chemical potential instead of low concentration. Finally, the components are no longer distributed uniformly but form granules locally, which can act as organelles in the cell.
Thus, the main work to synthesize an organelle is to implement phase separation in a cell. Then, how can we do it? Composition can switch rapidly through multivalence. Our design was inspired by recent studies showing that multivalence drives protein phase separation and formation of synthetic organelles. What’s more, we take our inspiration from existing living systems and previous work. For example, intrinsic disordered regions are an indicator of large-scale phase separation in the cell. They interact with each other through van der Waals forces, hydrophobic effects and electrostatic attraction. There are many interactions like this in nature, such as FKBP and Frb, SUMO and SIM, SH3 and PRM, phyB and PIF6. Thus, we can make good use of them to induce the self-assembly of our designed organelles and regulate them in various ways.
In conclusion, multivalence drives the self-assembly of proteins and interaction binds the parts together. Therefore, interaction can induce phase separation and multivalence can make larger assemblies, which are two essential elements in our"

Week 1
The ‘dry lab’ has a first meeting where we begin to decide which work has to be done, and how are we going to achieve it. After that, I start collecting information about the equations of the basic toggle switch. My partners help me understanding how works the system and many other little things. Luis, offered us a lab where to work during the summer.
Week 2
At the meeting, the group told me about using a specific software for modeling biological systems. I become to study how ‘Simbiology’ works and start doing small tests.  I do the first basic bistable model, and run the simulations. The results have sense. Although the main working tool is simbiology, I also start doing some Matlab programs to confirm the results.
Week 3
I continue making programs/simulations and thinking how to implement the controls of the basic bistable. Although I have a couple of equations, they don’t fit in my analysis.
On Wednesday we had a general meeting with the entire group. Each subgroup showed the work done and its perspectives. But before this, I met the ‘dry lab’ and showed the programs done. We tried to adapt the model to obtain some interesting simulations to show. Otherwise, to adapt the simulations to the real behavior, I need a lot of parameters values, so we decided to make an analysis with the simple model to adapt the real results, because it has fewer.
(The rest of the week I’m going to a blues festival, so I can’t do any work)
Week 4
I found some interesting information about how to model the ‘IPTG induction’ reaction. Also, I decided to model the degradation of the thermosensitive protein with a mass action kinetics law. So I implemented"

1. Fungal Expression with T7 promoters
For the first carotenoid pathway assembly, our goal was to test the efficacy of the T7 promoter and polymerase system within fungi. Each gene was individually appended with a T7 promoter for viral polymerase transcription. Each gene would be transcribed individually by T7, then translated by the fungus.
2. Bacterial Expression with T7 promoters
For the second assembly, our goal was to test the efficacy of the T7 system in bacteria. Each individual carotenoid gene was appended with both T7 and rbs, for effective viral transcription and bacterial translation.
3. Fungal Expression with Native Promoters
For the third assembly, our goal was to test and characterize native fungal promoters with our crt genes. However, we needed at least three different fungal promoters because E. coli considers large repeated sequences, such as eukaryotic promoters, to be duplications, and will get delete them. So, different fungal promoters must be used with our carotenoid genes. This also allows us to easily swap out promoters to study the carotenoid pathway and combinations of promoters in further detail.

And then, we constructed this araBAD operator before FourU element and mRFP. The plasmid is showed in Figure 7. Because we didn't have the plasmid in which RFP protein is regulated by nomarl RBS under PBad, we used the part <a href="" http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K577881 "">BBa_K577881</a> , in which only the FourU element is replaced by RBS, as the positive control.

According to the result, we could use the concentration range of L-arabinose from 100μM to 50000μM to simulate the different interaction strength of ligand and receptor.
Testing the plasmid of inducible mRFP expression with RNAT-fourU element
We use 50000μM L-arabinose, the highest concentration, to test inducible mRFP expression with RNAT-fourU element under araBAD promoter. The results are as follows.

Figure 9 shows that temperature almost has no impact on the expression level of reporter protein regulated by normal RBS, however, to the experimental group regulated by the FourU element, the expression quantity of reporter protein cultured at 30°C induced by 50000μM L-arabinose is dramatically lower than the group cultured at 37°C, and there is no detectable fluorescence intensity of the reporter protein without any L-arabinose. The results show that the araBAD promoter has litte leaked expression and works well with the FourU element.
Then we test the response of the inducible plasmid to the temperature changes from 30°C to 37°C. We cultured both the positive control and experimental bacteria at "

Interlab
The purpose of this year’s interlab is to address the high level of variability in fluorescence measurements. Typically, fluorescence is measured using the optical density (OD), or the absorbance of light by a sample when measured at 600nm using a plate reader,  nanodrop, or spectrophotometer. However, since this method can be inaccurate, Interlab seeks to improve the standard method of measuring fluorescence in populations of cells. Since the number of cells in a sample can vary, if the fluorescence is normalized to the cell count of the sample, then the average amount of fluorescence can be calculated, which is likely more accurate than that of a population of unknown size. Therefore, Interlab will investigate if normalizing fluorescence measurements to colony-forming units (CFUs) will yield more precise results than OD.
Each iGEM team was asked to normalize the absorbance to the number of cells in two ways: by comparing sample absorbance to absorbance of a sample of known concentration of beads similar in size to E. coli cells and by counting CFUs from each sample.
OD
For the first method, absorbance was measured for a sample and serial dilution of silicon beads. These beads, similar in size and shape to E. coli cells, are expected to scatter light in a similar manner, providing an analogous sample of known concentration. The first part of this process was to get a reference point for OD600 to easily interchange between Abs600 and OD600, accounting for differences in volume between wells. In this measurement, four equal samples LUDOX CL-X (a 45% colloidal silica suspension) were compared to samples of ddH2O, and the OD was measured using a plate reader. By finding the mean of the replicates, correcting by subtracting the mean of the water to get just the absorbance of the silica, and dividing by the OD600 from the provided Excel sheet, the conversion factor (OD600/Abs600) was calculated to be 3.500.
A particle standard curve was also developed using a serial dilution of monodisperse silica microspheres to plot the concentration versus absorbance, thus allowing the estimation of the number of cells based off"

We obtained the peptide sequences for these genes from the following online databases:

GenBank - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank [3]
TAIR - http://www.arabidopsis.org/ [4]

(For details on the exact gene functions, sequence sources and reference papers, please click here )
We used Geneious™ to run tblastn [6] and query the protein coding sequences against the nucleotide sequences of the m. polymorpha scaffolds. Our dataset was made of large gap read mapping transcripts obtained by mRNA sequencing conducted by the Haseloff Lab on the M. polymorpha Cam strain.  Open Reading Frame (ORF) and Coding Sequence (CDS) predictions were made using the CLC bio Transcript Discovery plugin [7] .
Figure 1: Example of a blast hit, matching a nitrate transporter protein sequence to a Marchantia gene
We selected the most convincing hits as those with a grading above 30% and got a shortlist by ranking them based on concurrence with an existing gene prediction as this made the selections more reliable. We isolated possible promoter regions as those 2kbp upstream from the start of the purported gene.
Hits for very short regions of homology were not selected. This generally corresponded to hits shorter than 5% of the sequence length of the predicted gene, although slightly shorter hits were noted as support for the reliability of a good match.
Results and Discussion
Out of the 27 genes that we shortlisted, we were able to obtain products from a PCR off extracted M. polymorpha DNA with a success rates of 50% - 70% on successive runs. We ran out of time to satisfactorily complete this stage and debug our difficulties with Gibson Assembly, but we think that we have good evidence that these candidates warrant further investigation.
Notes:
• In Figures 2 and 3 the predicted gene numbers are grouped according to the related essential nutrient: genes 603 – 11107 inclusive relate to nitrates; genes 3555 and 3556 relate to sulphates and 170-11169 inclusive relate to phosphates.

Nonetheless, without conclusive evidence on         the impact of biofuels (and its future replacement with         our biodiesel) on world food prices, our analysis used the         most conservative estimate and assumed that there will be         an insignificant impact on the average American family's         and Canadian family's food prices.
While generally neither American families nor Canadian families own and operate diesel-powered vehicles, certain         diesel-powered vehicles are becoming more popular within         these markets. Given current economic hardships, filling         up at the pump is often a significant burden on today's         families and thus we wanted to illustrate how consumers         could save on each tank if they were driving in Toronto, New         York and Los Angeles. The table below represents the cost         breakdown and estimated local price of our fuel relative         that to the local cost of diesel. Estimates were also made         for the local price of an 80% diesel 20% biodiesel mixture,         which represents the current largest biodiesel substitution         feasible in current infrastructure.

Edinburgh_OG,2017,Team:Edinburgh OG#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria are the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Examples of overuse include the prescription of antibiotics in cases where the infection is minor and will clear up without medical intervention     (Levy, 1998). Antibiotics are also heavily overused in agricultural settings. A staggering 80% of antibiotics purchased in America are used on livestock (Bartlett et al., 2013), encouraging the growth of resistant bacteria and risking their     spread through the food chain (Wright, 2010). Misuse includes the prescription of antibiotics for viral infections, and patients stopping their course of antibiotics before the recommended time (Levy, 1998).
Despite the ever-increasing number of antibiotics that are no longer effective against many pathogens, there is a lack of new antibiotics being developed. This is because development is incredibly costly (Sukkar, 2013) and there’s no guarantee     that pharmaceutical companies will recoup these costs through profit, as resistance can arise in a matter of months (Bartlett et al., 2013). Even if new antibiotics are developed, they can only stave off the antibiotic resistance crisis for     so long. Instead, alternative strategies are required.

Bacteriophages
Bacteriophages (phages) are the most abundant life-form on the planet, with an estimated population of 10^32. Phages are viruses that infect bacteria, and they are incredibly specific – each species of phage only infects particular species or even     strains of bacteria (Wittebole et al., 2014).
Typical phage structure consists of an icosahedral “head” and a cylindrical “tail” (Figure 2). The phages DNA – which can be single or double stranded – is packaged within the head. Upon recognition of specific receptors     on the host cell surface, the phage injects its DNA into the host bacterium via the tail structure (Montag et al., 1987; Klug & Huxley, 1971). Once inside the bacterium, the phage enters one of two possible lifecycles.
During the lysogenic cycle, the phage genome lies dormant and is replicated along with the host DNA and spreading to bacterial daughter cells. The phage genome may integrate into the host genome (as in λ phages) or form a separate plasmid (as     in P1 phages) ("
