SCU_China,2017,Team:SCU China#HP#Silver#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," In order to make the poster                                         more clear and intelligible, besides responsible team, other three teams also                                         participated in discussion and gave their suggestions about the content of the                                         poster. In addition, when we had difficulties in explaining our project and                                         ideas to publics, members of other teams came to help us immediately. If we                                         hadn't cooperated with each other, this exhibition would not have succeeded. It                                         was a fantastic and impressive collaboration which we would never forget.                                         This exhibition was also a wonderful chance for us to put what we learnt in                                         classrooms into society. Except doing experiments in the lab, it’s our duty to                                         introduce the knowledge about biology and biotechnology to public as well.                                         Through this activity, we did our bits to make public understand what is                                         transgenic technology clearly.
     It’s also very important that we got many suggestions about our project from the                                         public who visited the exhibition. We found that most people hesitated when                                         talking about taking bacteria as medicine. So we considered to use a more safe                                         bacterial stain as final product after we constructed the whole circuit in E.                                         coli successfully. In addition, we found that many people worry about the amount                                         of melatonin produced by bacteria in intestine. Therefore, it is necessary to                                         test melatonin level in animal model carefully. These suggestions and feedback                                         were helpful for us to improve our project. They make us understood public                                         opinion, so we can develop our project in the aspect of drug shape, mode of                                         administration and so on in the future work.

     We held the Sichuan University 2017 Architects                                     Competition of Microorganism                                     Application: Human /Animal Health in September and October. The competition included                                     the first oral defense and the final. Three of the team members, student team leader                                     of team “SCU-WestChina”, and two advisors of our association were present as judging                                     panel.
     This competition required contestants participate in                                     the competition in groups. And                                     each group should design their project about Human /Animal Health. Then the groups                                     took part in the defense to present their project. Finally, based on their project                                     feasibility, creativity, safety and so on, the groups were awarded different prizes.
     After the first oral defense, 7 teams were chosen to                                     attend the final. The final was                                     held in the one of the largest classroom in Jiang’an Campus of Sichuan University.                                     More than 10 professors attended as judges. After the final defence, one gold award,                                     two silver awards and three bronze awards"

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Cellulases (MATLAB model)_-_-_TEXT.html,"ucosidase - 0.01 g/kg
Temperature 35° C
Figure 1 is set with β-glucosidase at its maximum concentration and Figure 2 with  Exo/endo-glucanase at maximum. This is to compare the effect of certain enzymes on cellulose degradation and glucose production.  The result is consistent with what is expected. Exoglucanase chews away at the end of a cellulose chain, producing cellobiose sugars and endoglucanase cuts cellulose chanins in the centre, turning one chain into two. This concurs with the results, with Figure 1 modelling markedly higher amount of cellulose at the minimum amount of exo/endo-glucanase than that of Figure 2. Whereas β-glucosidase cuts cellobiose in half, producing two glucose molecules. Figure 2 which β-glucosidase is at its maximum produces 255.6% more glucose than in Figure 1 with β-glucosidase at its minimum in 60 hours.
The concentration of cellobiose in Figure 1 keeps low. This is because there is little cellulose converted to cellobiose by Exo/endo-glucanase. Also, if there is any cellobiose, they are all converted to glucose by β-glucosidase.
Figure 3: Graph of cellulose degradation over time with maximum β-glucosidase.
Initial conditions: Cellulose - 100 g/kg, Glucose - 0.01 g/kg , Cellobiose - 0.01 g/kg.
Enzymes: Exo/endo-glucanase - 1 g/kg, β-glucosidase - 0.01 g/kg
Temperature 35° C. The x-axis is set to semilog.
Figure 3 is under the same conditions as Figure 2, but its x-axis is set to a semilog scale to illustrate what happens over a longer period of time. The effect of high β-glucosidase can better be seen with the complete conversion of cellobiose to glucose.

BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY AND FUNDS
AsemBio Biotech Chile (Chilean Association of Biotechnology): In 2009, there were about 200 companies involved in biotechnology (biotech companies and research centers) in Chile. The rate of growth of the biotechnology industry in Chile has grown in recent years and a sustained growth rate of 30% per year is expected. Over the past four years, the industry received more than $ 93 million, plus a foreign investment of more than $ 170 million. A study by CORFO (which is no longer available on their website), the Chilean biotechnology companies are distributed mainly in the agricultural sector (41%) and Health Diagnosis-human (27%), the remaining 32% is distributed in companies engaged in aquaculture, food, industrial biotechnology and bioprocessing. An interesting area of development of biotechnology in Chile has been the biomining where bacteria are used to dissolve metals such as copper from"

Part of the team volunteered at the high school Jamboree. We saw many amazing teams with remarkable ideas! Congratulations to all the teams for their hard work over the past semester, and good luck as future iGEMers!
Sunday, July 1
We attempted another test transformation , this time using bought Excel 10β competent cells. We had both a negative and positive control. We also plated different concentrations of the final solution to see if we were over or under plating. We also used agar plates with ampicillin that Tarun made. We used store bought SOC. The part used was BBa_J04450.
Monday, July 2
The tranformations performed yesterday were successful. Both the positive control and the plaes with our part showed growth. The transformation efficiency was extremely high. We got single colonies on the plates with 50μL and overgrowth on the plates that had 150μL. We will only plate at 50μL from now on.
Due to time constraints, we have decided to synthesize both of our constructs. In parallel to characterization of the synthesized constructs, we are going to assemble both constructs using Gibson assembly. The assembles constructs will differ from the synthesized constructs in that the promoter will be a PoPs device and there will be a fluorescent protein on each. In this way, we can find if the addition of these two characterization parts will affect the functionality of our constructs.
The synthesized constructs were ordered from DNA 2.0 . Pictures of the Gene Designer (DNA 2.0 software) renditions of the three constructs are given below.

Transglutaminase
Another possible crosslinking regime would involve the use of a different crosslinking agent, transglutaminase ( TGase ), which is commonly used in the food processing industry to bind meats by crosslinking free amine groups. This enzyme could either be produced in the cell by incorporating it into the lysis pathway (or by secreting it into the extracellular environment) or by direct addition to the lysis medium, like AIBN. This enzyme crosslinks glutamine to lysine residues, and would therefore act on all proteins produced by the cell. Thus, this strategy would work exactly the same as our above system, except AIBN would be replaced by TGase, either produced by the cells or added separately. The plastic production genes would no longer be necessary – rather, we would replace them with genes coding for a high number of glutamine and lysine residues (maximizing the crosslinking potential), and cause these peptides to be heavily produced, inducibly or constitutively. The properties of the resulting hydrogel could be tweaked by adjusting the secondary structure of these over-produced peptides, and their glutamine/lysine distribution and frequency.

5 Meritorious Projects: Demonstration
Colors and light should always be something attractive on an iGEM competition. And the Cambridge team of 2010 and 2009 certainly understand this and take it to their advantage.
Cambridge 2009
Their 2010 work of lightening cells with different luciferases and their 2009 work of transmitting different pigments of different colors are both applicable and charming projects for the competition. A simple array of colors and lights would just tell the whole story.
Cambridge 2010
Now here goes the project of Bristol 2010. The incorporation of engineered E. coli into beads will not only extend the territory of this biobrick, but also will help with possible commercialization. The combination of field application and lab design will always remain the most exciting part of iGEM!
BCCS-Bristol 2010
What would happen when electricity meets synthetic biology? Valencia 2009 team presented a wonderful combination of electrical engineering and voltage-sensitive cells. And the idea of iLCD gives a visual impact illustrating the characteristics of their biopart and the charm of interdisciplinary research.

DNA scaffold? Aligned proteins? Is ELISA the only way to characterize its function with those boring curves and numbers? The 2010 team of Slovenia said no! Spatially related fluorescent proteins would undergo a process called Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer. And seeing the emission of fluorescence sure catches more intention then those curves, right?

MEXMUN is a student simulation of the debates that take place in the main deliberative bodies of the United Nations Organization, discussing economic, political and social issues. In this simulation, students take on the role of representatives of different countries before the UN, knowing and maintaining their national interests, having to reach the end of a resolution.
Nearly 700 secondary, preparatory and professional students from more than fifty national and international institutions participate in it. Through 20 years of history, MEXMUN has  established itself as one of the largest and most elaborate conferences of its kind in Mexico, offering debate commissions in Spanish, English and French.
As part of our Education and Public Engagement activities, we developed MEXMUN edition 2018 topic “Synthetic biology as a tool for the development of biological weapons"" in the First Committee on Disarmament and International Security (CDSI in Spanish) to be discussed by high school students from different states of the republic at the UN simulation. We intended to get more students interested and involved on synthetic biology issues as well as evaluate the possible risks of employing the tools this new discipline requires, tools we use in the laboratory for the construction of our product.
To make sure we had developed a wholesome and reflexive topic which students can build upon, we had to look over the international mechanisms, agreements and bodies that regulate, look after and assure the responsible and safe use of synthetic biology and GMOs.
We investigated on the Geneva Protocol, Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, Cartagena Protocol, Convention on Biological Diversity, Biosafety-Clearance house, the Nagoya - Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol and Nagoya Protocol. Through this research, we learned on biosafety matters regarding synthetic biology and we raised self-awareness on the globalization of this discipline"

Introduction
Despite many efforts from the indian government and NGO's to decrease the micronutrient deficiencies in India, there are two major limitations that prevent the vast majority of the population to access sufficient sources of vitamins and iron or phytic acid: cost, and distribution. Our project proposes an elegant solution to address both those issues, via a cost-effective biosynthesis of vitamins and phytic acid by micro-organisms, which can be cultivated in everyone’s home without any need of external infrastructure.
We decided to re-think the universal tradition of food fermentation to expand it with new possibilities. With         community acceptance in mind, we developed a product that can work sustainably in the hands of people with         minimal equipment, and fits equally well into the existing infrastructure set up by the Indian government to         fight malnutrition by significantly reducing the production costs. This way we ensure that our product has the         highest chances of reaching its target population. At the same time, we designed our product to engender people's         trust, as its use is sustained without strictly depending on any third party and it is deeply rooted in their traditions.
Distribution & Availability
The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme
An important problem we wanted to tackle with our product is the access Indian people have to sources of vitamins. Indeed, we researched what structures and programs already exist in India, and found that it was a major issue.
One of the most important governmental programs for vitamin supplementation is the                         Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program, which has existed in India since 1975.                         This program monitors the growth and development of children, and provides supplementary                         nutrition as well as education and primary health care for children under six and pregnant and                         lactating mothers. The program is implemented through a network of community-level anganwadi centers (AWC), which provides daily supplements both in the center as well as                         through take-home rations"

Implications
The Science of Collective Behaviors
Our inspiration for this project stems from the lack of comprehensive understanding of cellular collective behavior. In synthetic biology, it is particularly important to understand population mechanisms and collective behavior in order to properly replicate and study natural systems in a laboratory setting. From the study of T cell communication in immune responses to correcting for quorum sensing in bacterial cultures, collective behavior is a powerful, inevitable and largely unknown phenomenon in biological systems. Our project aims to create a synthetic cell circuit capable of not only modeling natural collective systems, but quantitatively analyzing such interactions.
As the biological sciences are making a shift from a qualitative science to a quantitative science, our team is making an effort to support this transformation by creating methods for replicable and standardized measurement of biological phenomena. By designing a solely synthetic circuit with modular parts, we are able to fine tune collective responses using various feedback loops and stimuli. Through this modular approach, we hope to expand this cell circuit to be able to replicate/simulate all different kinds of collective responses from autoimmune responses to cell adhesion. In addition, a key design feature of our cell circuit is an autonomous/community-coordinated readout able to be quantitatively measured with flow cytometry. Our cell circuit impacts science at the research level, helping scientists understand natural phenomena and providing a novel measurement tool. A standardized quantitative method of measurement, opposed to qualitative observations, will create a more transparent and un-biased data analysis tool for scientists to use and relay data to the public. We hope that our project will be able to provide novel insights into cellular communities and provide a tool to study various natural systems, with implications reaching into everything from pharmaceuticals to tissue-biology.

With an electrolyte containing Tris-HCl (c = 27 mM) and NaCl (c = 24 mM), we found that the Debye length of the solution we were drying is 0.0024 nm. Since this length is smaller than the average size of an amino acid, we were free in selecting the grid size of the lattice model.
To effectively model protein-protein interactions, rather than interactions between individual amino acids, we decided to discretize our proteins into blocks of five amino acids per unit.
As it is not straightforward to manually derive a protein model using protein structure files, we wrote a program that converts the commonly used ""protein database"" file extension (.pdb) for Cas13a into a 'LEGO-block' model (in the form of a matrix) (Figure 1). The hydrophobicity and charge (isoelectric point) scales applied ( Biro, 2006 ) can be easily adapted.
Figure 1: LEGO-block model of Cas13a to input into the lattice model. A) Model of Cas13a hydrophobicity distribution. For visualization purposes, a colour threshold was applied: red areas are hydrophobic while grey areas are not. B) Model for Cas13a charge (isoelectric point) distribution. For visualization purposes, a colour threshold was applied: blue patches are positively charged while gray patches are not charged or negatively charged.
We provide the Matlab script , enabling anyone with basic Matlab knowledge to import a structure, which can be converted to a coarse-grained 'LEGO-block' model with a resolution that can be set by the user. In addition, the code intuitively includes the desired hydrophobicity and charge scales to consider, which can be adapted as desired.
However, since TDPs are intrinsically disordered proteins, this method could not be applied to them. Thus, we simply settled on averaging the properties of five neighbouring amino acids in the sequence, instead of in space. Similar to protein folding, there are two main driving forces behind protein-protein interactions which are electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions ( Vagedes et al. 2002 ). To be able to calculate the interaction energies between different protein units, the hydrophobic moment and isoelectric point ( Biro 2006 ) of each amino acid were averaged for each unit during the discretization.

None of our team members had previous experience with HTML or CSS, making this Wiki quite the challenge to code. Luckily, the code for all iGEM Wiki sites is open-source unless specified otherwise. We thank the 2017 Manchester iGEM team for their open-source CSS style sheets. This included a Bootstrap page, among others. We wouldn't have been able to design this site without their CSS and HTML wizardry.

After assembling of CFPS compounds, 10 µL of each reaction were directly pipetted into a 364 black well plate, sealed with transparent film and incubated at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured without the film after 3, 6.25 and 24 h respectively. Fluorescence did not exceed the negative control distinctly in any case.

CFPS with plasmid T7p-RBS-sfGFP (BBa_I746909) in 21 µL volume with “normal” and run-off extracts from 05/13, 05/20 and 06/03 respectively. For each reaction a negative control with water instead of DNA is employed
For the first time, Mg-glutamate and K-glutamate were additionally supplemented to the reactions as they were no part of the “reaction buffer”. 3 M K-glutamate and 100 mM Mg-glutamate stock solutions were prepared and directly used to supply the reaction with a final concentration of 4 mM Mg-glutamate and 80 mM K-glutamate.
To each mix of DNA, glutamate salts and water, a master mix consisiting of “reaction buffer” and one of the above mentioned extracts was added. Reactions were performed in microcentrifuge tubes for 3 h and then 20 µL were transferred to a 364 well plate which was used for fluorescence measurements and further reaction performance. Relative fluorescence units were normalized to corresponding negative controls. The maximum of fluorescence was observed after 7.75 h for 06/03 run-off extract, which fluorescence was 10 times higher when compared to its negative control. First promising results that showed we can really produce sfGFP in vitro!

We manually applied pressure pulses to line to induce a momentary flow change. The flow was then reversed and allow for cell to receive fresh media with 0.075% Tween20 which prevented cells from adhering to the main channels and waste ports.         • We took pictures of microfluidics in fluorescence microscope every 5 mins and analyzed the fluorescent density with imageJ.

Exeter,2014,Team:Exeter#DegradationConstructs_-_-_TEXT.html,"A was shown to have a higher substrate preference for PETN and Nitroglycerin than PETN reductase, the uncharacterised gene of which was submitted by the iGEM team from Edinburgh in 2009 William’s et al. (2004).24
Finally, NemA was found to already exist in E. coli, albeit at a low expression level. This suggested to us a capability to be expressed successfully. However, we also realised this meant that we would more likely to face natural control mechanisms that could silence the activity of the enzyme if it is overexpressed.  It also meant that we would need to assess the natural tolerance of our E. coli DH5α strain to the explosives to ensure our engineered enzyme provided enhanced tolerance to TNT and NG compared to the wild-type.
Through a comparative study of PETN, NemA, Morphinone reductase and the yeast OYE, the TNT mechanism for the similar PETN reductase was detailed.25 Due to the sequence similarity, we are using this as a model for the pathways involved in anaerobic degradation of TNT by NemA (Figure 5).
Figure 5: Diagram depicting the potential mechanistic steps in the transformation of TNT by PETN reductase. (Adapted from Rylott et al. 25 and Williams et al.)26
 
In addition to degradation of TNT and NG, NemA may also function as an efficient chromate reductase to remediate hexavalent chromium, a serious and widespread environmental pollutant.27
The NemA construct ( BBa_K1398003 )
With the nemA DNA sequence identified28 we were able to design our construct to evaluate NemA as follows (Figure 6):
Figure 6: The NemA construct depicting the constituent parts of the construct.
The construct contains the coding sequence for NemA ( BBa_K1398002 ), an enzyme involved in the degradation of toxic compounds for their reuse in nitrogen metabolism. The construct also contains a Lactose-inducible promoter ( BBa_R0010 ), a strong RBS ( BBa_B0034 ) and a double terminator made up of BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012 ). The protein has been codon-optimised for expression in E. coli.

What is PCR?
Polymerase Chain Reaction or PCR is a common tool used in the field of biology to amplify DNA or RNA. Invented by Dr. Kary Mullis, PCR is conducted trough cycling DNA, primers and enzyme through various temperatures. Generally starting with a value near 95 degrees Celsius; used to break the Hydrogen bonds between double strands a process called denaturation. The machine then cools down to annealing temperature, with values near 50-60 degrees, at this point primers are able to attach to the template strand of DNA. This stage is then followed by extension temperature, around 72 degrees, at this point the polymerase is able to extend and add nucleotides to the primer.
Purpose
Although the process of amplifying genetic material is remarkable, the hardware needed to do it is relatively simple-- all that is required are three different temperatures which are maintained by the machine, enabling the enzymes and template to do the work of PCR. Current PCR machines cost thousands of dollars, and although there exists open source, DIY PCR machines, their costs still range in the hundreds of dollars. Here at the University of Maryland, we thought that that was an absurd notion. PCR, because of its simplicity and utility, is a robust tool for the diagnosis of many diseases both in the developed and developing world. Making the device cheaper would give more people accessibility to this platform. Accessibility enables further innovation and development of novel methods for disease detection and this in turn enables better and faster diagnosis and treatment both in the developed and developing world.
Another major advantage of ""cheap"" is education. Here at the University of Maryland, we acknowledge that iGEM is a competition, however we also understand that this competition is also a collaboration. It is an opportunity for all of us to learn from one another and serves as the foundation for future discovery, innovation, and new projects. We hope that our work with the PCR machine will inspire many more teams to tackle designing hardware. We hope that our current collaborations with Duke University foster better and more innovative projects from both of our teams. And most important, we hope that our efforts will be"

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," to the capsid, as well as encapsulating immunogenic sequences can simplify the applications and productions of vaccines (Lua et al., 2015).
Gene therapy: By encapsulating a gene editing system like CRISPR, PNCs have the potential to deliver proteins capable of genetic modification to a specific tissue or population of cells. A benefit to targeted gene therapy is that it can help avoid genetic modification to all cells or even target gamete cells (Bundy et al., 2008).
Invasive Species/Pest Control: PNCs have the potential to encapsulate a toxic agent that may be specifically targeted to a particular species or pest while preventing off target effects within the ecosystem. Partnering this technology with specific biological control agents can help to prevent invasive species introduction and limit the proliferation of pests (Whitledge et al, 2015).
Implementation of iGEM projects: Our team did an analysis of previous projects in Alberta from The University of Alberta, The University of Calgary, The University of Lethbridge, and the Lethbridge high school. Of the projects analyzed, ~25% had trouble implementing their project into the real world scenario they had designed it for. Encapsulating in protein nanocompartments would allow them to deliver their systems safely and efficiently, making their projects more successful.
Our System
Our goal for the 2018 iGEM season was to develop a PNC toolkit for future iGEM teams and researchers which we named VINCEnT (Viral-Inspired Novel Cargo Encapsulation Toolkit). Our software tool was created in order to help individuals build PNCs that cater to their specific project needs which include surface peptides, encapsulation proteins, and specific cargo loading approaches that can be used for various applications. With these designs we can address a wide range of issues such as antibiotic resistance, the negative side-effects of chemotherapeutics, or the impact of using GMOs as biological control agents.  For more information on VINCEnT, please visit our Design page.
Figure 2. VINCEnT's service: specific cargo is packaged and instructions are provided with the package for direct delivery to the desired cell type.

Subjects that Ought to be Implemented in the Device
ATP Production from Solar Energy
Harvest of solar energy comes to mind as one of the most essential systems needed for the PowerLeaf to actually work. We had to select parts of the PowerLeaf to work on, and at the end of the day, we decided to cut this subpart. Instead, we had a great Skype call early on in the process with the Australian Macquarie iGEM team , who has been working for several years with the implementation of the photosynthetic systems in E. coli.
Cellulose and the Cellulases forming an On/Off Switch
This is also a very crucial part of the PowerLeaf, since it would otherwise be generating an electrical current non-stop, even when not needed. Thereby overthrowing the potential for long term-storage of solar energy. We believe this can be solved either through precise gene circuit regulation or by physical compartmentalisation, but there might be even more elegant ways in which to handle this challenge.
Physical Engineering of the Hardware
It should be possible for the energy storing unit to convert CO2 into cellulose, thereby producing O2 making its chamber aerobic. For the energy converting unit to effectively transfer retrieved electrons to an anode, it requires anaerobic conditions. Thus the removal of O2 from the device is an obstacle to overcome. It will require some out-of-the-box thinking to come up with a novel idea without having to require more energy than produced.
To make a workable prototype of the PowerLeaf, proper engineering of the hardware is necessary. This"
Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#cbc_-_-_TEXT.html,"acgtcacctgcgtgtagctCGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTT
Due to bad cleavage efficiency at the PstI restriction-site in nearly all PCR-products the cloning of the CBDs ( CBDcex(T7) and CBDclos(T7) ) and especially the insertion of GFP_His to the CBDs took a lot more time as expected. This was due to the fact that no additional bases were added to the 5' termini of the designed primers, thereby greatly reducing cleavage efficiency. When the problem was discovered and protocols adjusted or primers extended, cloning got a lot quicker and more successful.
As the project went on the T7-constructs did not seem to work. One suspected reason was that a stop codon (TAA) that was accidentally introduced between the RBS and ATG could be the reason. To solve the problem a change to a constitutive promoter (<partinfo>BBa_J61101</partinfo>) was made using the Freiburg-assembly. Therefore Freiburg forward primers for the CBDs were made.

The primers arrived just a few days before wiki freeze (Europe). Switching to the constitutive promoter had no obvious effect (no green colonies or culture), neither had changing the expression strain from E. coli KRX to E. coli BL21 for the T7-construct.
Since Regionals
After Amsterdam two approaches were made. One changing the order of the fused proteins and one altering the linker between CBD and the GFP. Both started simultaneously.
Figure 10: PCR-product of BBa_K863104 with S3N10-primers
One reason for the problems could be the too short space in between the two proteins, resulting in CBD and GFP hampering each other from folding correctly. To test and solve this, a very long linker with three serines followed by ten asparagines should be assembled in the already existing parts via a blunt end cloning.

We improved the part BBa_K237002 from the iGEM team SDU Denmark 2009. We optimized the RIP sequence for our chassis E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS strain and added a secretion signal peptide to address the RIP to E. coli Type II Secretion System. We confirmed our part BBa_K2616001 by sequencing. Learn more about this part on this page .
Model Your Project
We modeled how NGF is produced in our modified E. coli , its diffusion in a medium environment and its consequences on neurons growth.  It helped to have an insight on which concentration of NGF to use in our experiments and also helped in predicting the future growth of nerves inside of our prototype. The mechanical modeling presents tools to visualize the constraints applied on the humerus and femur bone and was used to choose the best material to use for a prosthesis and the best configuration possible for a bone. The modeling of the humerus helped us to limit the length of the osseointegrated stem. Learn more about our modeling on this page .

Activity: Questionnaire Survey
In China, overuse of antibiotics is a severe problem. The alarming data shows that China has become one of the world’s top                 antibiotics consuming countries, with an annual per-capita consumption of antibiotics at 138 grams, or 10                 times that of an average American (The Nation, 2013). The overuse of antibiotics is not only driven by physicians,                 but also by patients themselves. Patients frequently ask for prescribing antibiotics for some common conditions,                 for example, diarrhea, and sometimes even fall out with their physicians over the use of antibiotics. Patients                 who like to self-medicate purchase inappropriate antibiotics over the counter in pharmacies easily.
Therefore, with an aim to figure out patients’ perception of medical treatment and to improve our project design by making                 it more applicable so that it can handle real life problems, we conducted a public survey to better understand                 how bacterial enteritis are treated in daily life as well as the current situations of antibiotic overuse.
Figure 1 The Questionnaire
150 people had participated in the public survey, and their age ranges from 16 to 50 and the gender of the participants is                     relatively equal, making the statistical data relatively effective and reliable. According to the survey                     (Figure 1), only 25% of the patients with serious diarrhea caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection                     choose to go to hospital while the others just take some medicine by themselves.
Figure 2 Answers for what to do if getting infected with Staphylococcus aureus.
Figure 3 Medicine that patients choose to treat diarrhea caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
For patients who take medicine by themselves, over 50% of them will take antibiotics as their first choice, Smecta being                     the second. This phenomenon revealed a widespread use of antibiotics in daily enteritis treatment, which                     may not be a wise option due to a series of side effects and the well-known existence of antibiotic resistance.
In addition to investigating the current condition of antibiotic overuse, we also asked what other measures people will take                     to prevent such diseases. For the majority of people, suggested by the data above"

Procedure: New Biofilms
New biofilms were created for July 7 testing. Same protocol used as June 30. Instead of using crystal violet dye, we are using E.coli DH5α cells with RFP (PSB4K5). 2 μL of KAN was added to 2 mL centrifuge tubes along with 1980 μL LB and 20 μL of culture.
300 μL of mix was pipetted into wells of 96 well plate. Biofilms left to grow 24 hours in 37˚C incubator.
Procedure: Degrading the July 6 Biofilms
The biofilms created yesterday successfully grew. To degrade the biofilms, bleach, Tilex and Truly cleaner solutions were used that had previously been created. The solutions of biofilms were disposed of in the biohazard waste and the microtiter plates placed in water. They were vigoursly shaken to dry and 300 μL of respective cleaning solution added to each well. Since three plates of biofilms were created, each cleaning solution received its on plate. 15 mins after the solutions was added, they were disposed of in the biohazard waste.
Procedure: Reculturing the July 6 Biofilms
To culture the biofilms from yesterday, 300 μL of LB media was added to one well of a microtiter plate. The media was then pipette up and down to mix with any remnants of the biofilms. The media was then pipetted back into the 5 mL tube of LB media. 5 μL of KAN was added to the 5 mL tube of LB media.
Process was repeated for the remaining two plates that used different cleaners.
Note: Before cultures were degraded using the different cleaners, Kieran had taken a sample of the biofilms and prepared a 5 mL tube of LB to culture the biofilm that would be ensured to grow.
Cultures were left to grow 24 hours in 37˚C incubator.

. This equation calculates the inhibitor concentration that corresponds to a certain relative level of GzmB.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the main chronic inflammatory diseases made worse by elevated GzmB activity. We will use this as an example to show how the calculator works. GzmB concentrations in synovial fluids (joint fluids) of arthritis patients were determined from Tak et al., 2009 (summarized in Table 3). There is a significant GzmB concentration difference between the control group and RA patients. The equation that returns a concentration of inhibitor can be used here, as it takes in relative GzmB levels and returns the amount of inhibitor needed.
Table 3: GzmB Concentration in Synovial Fluids. GzmB concentration in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis obtained from Tak et al., 2009.

If a patient has a GzmB level that is X times the amount of control (around 34 pg/mL), then proportionally, X/100% = 100%/Y, where Y is the factor we want to decrease the patient’s level by (relative to his original level). Therefore,
, and the amount of inhibitor needed [L] can be calculated. For example, if an RA patient has a GzmB concentration of 3400 pg/mL, then the patient has about 100x the normal GzmB level. Therefore, the Y factor would be 1%, and [L] can be calculated to be around 130 uM.
It should be noted, however, that there is a large standard deviation for GzmB levels in RA patients, which means there are significant variations: if treatments are to be given, it would be better to conduct treatments on a case-by-case basis.

Planned abstract for ITS 2012 submission. Searched up how to upload Sifteo app onto the store. Finished grabbing lists of parts for Nahum to integrate for the new type of search/filter process for the MoClo Planner.
Day 42: July 26, 2012 - Day 43: July 27, 2012
Helped Kara and Veronica debug a new feature they implemented for primer designer of the MoCloPlanner. Wrote up abstract for submission of the SynFlo application to ITS 2012. Worked on the surface feature of SynFlo that simulates what occurs when E. coli is exposed to a contaminant. A new byte tag will be registered as the contaminant that causes the E. Coli encoded with the ""red plasmid"" to blur more than the other E. Coli. Ideally, when this application is complete, it is only when the E. Coli touches the byte tag that its state will change, but currently all red E. Coli change when the surface registers the tag. Finished implementations part of the abstract.
Day 44: July 30, 2012
Finished implementing the traveling E. Coli animation for all color combinations. Changed parser that constructed text files of most promoters/rbs/cds/terminators in registry that included parts' registry id and what type of part they were to include each part's common description name. Working on tag visualization of the surface application for SynFluo.
Day 45: July 31, 2012
Finished enabling reorientation for plasmid and color cube interaction and installed new program into cubes to test code out. Made it so that neighboring the Ecoli and Plasmid on any side of the other and flipping would run the animation and change the state of the cube. General preparations for poster session: Helped with some writing for the poster and taking pictures of the SynFluo demo.

In many ways, iGEM itself is an enabling factor for biotech entrepreneurship. As shown in the data, having a successful Proof of Concept at iGEM is positively related to founding a business, with a p = 0.16 and a positive coefficient of 0.698, all variables held constant. This makes sense, as proving an idea at iGEM means potential for credibility in the real world as well. If the concept is proven and there is a market opportunity, then likely there is startup potential. In general, all of the interviewed founding teams had relatively successful Proofs of Concept. Overall, this means that really having a proven idea could lead to startup creation.
11. Full Model of Significant Variables
This model represents the variables that are significant at the 10% level (p ≤ .10) when independently regressed with the dependent variable, Founder.

BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," price of reagents in this experiment is expensive. The experiment period is long which takes no less than 3 days.
The wave length of measuring OD is 350nm, which is between ultraviolet light and visible light and always leads to a huge deviation. Also, the requirement of the testing instruments is high, quartz containers are needed as well, which cost a lot.
Our project avoids these drawbacks, and provides a new insight for the anti-microtubule drug screening. What we need is just a fluorescence microscope by using our kit.
Take paclitaxel as a control, we could test the fluorescence intensity of new medicine compared with paclitaxel's. In this way, further research and development of new anti-microtubule agents can be carried out easily than before.
Detection in high sensitivity
HPLC/RP-HPLC is one of the most common method to detect paclitaxel now. It relies on pumps to pass the sample through a column filled with solid adsorbent materials. Each component in the sample interacts differently with the adsorbent material, causing different flow rates and leading to the separation of the components as they flow out of the column.
Fig.3 The process of HPLC
This is a time-consuming process which is very unfavorable to the studies in laboratory. For example, in a laboratory which producing paclitaxel from fungus, detecting the concentration of the product may delay experiment process if there were no paclitaxel at all. So we need to develop an effective method to rapidly detect whether taxanes exist or not before measuring concentration. Our kit can reach the goal in order to accelerate research progresses.
Concentration detection
Apart from our former achievements, optimization is also needed. An intensity-concentration database of certain medicines (e.g. paclitaxel) is being planned, then we can use our “taxolight” to determine the concentration of this certain medicine conveniently.
There is a limited issue that the sample solution must be ensured not containing other anti-microtubule agents. Nevertheless, it is still useful. For example, farmers who plant taxus can apply our kit to detect the concentration of taxanes in there plants. Moreover, factory can use our kit to test the concentration of taxol in their fermentation broth. In conclusion, our product can be popularized in many agent-specific tests.

UCAS-China,2018,Team:UCAS-China#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," our hardware more portable, we made a more advanced and fancy-looking one. With good human-machine design interface and high level of integration, our final hardware was very flexible and easy to operate. Its appearance was designed as a carton train. We named it Forest Train and the name meant that its destination was our rose forest. Anyone “takes” it (that means he/she put a plate in Forest Train) would see beautiful rose produced by E. coli.
We ordered transparent polycarbonate boards (PC boards) from a factory online. PC boards had high biological affinity and we used them to build the shell. To block the outside light, we paint the inner layer black. We used acrylic pigment to blacken and decorate our boards, which is waterproof and colorful.
Figure 20. Transparent PC board.
Figure 21. Blackened PC boards.
Inside Forest Train there was a projector, and we used a professional reflection mirror for projectors to illuminate a plate.
As for placing plates, we used iron stands, tested tube holders and a tripod to establish a stable structure. It was a delicate structure and it functioned pretty successful, as the plates could be placed properly without blocking the light.
Figure 22&23 The supporting device for plates.
Besides, we also used a temperature controller and two fans in our Forest Train so that it could function as an incubator. Fans were used to refresh the air in the device and accelerate the process of heat dissipation. An ultraviolet lamp was fixed on the ceiling to sterilize the device after using.
Anything unsealed on the hardware was hid in our appearance design harmoniously (such as the fan in the wheel and the “window”). The “window” was a door to access our plates and the fans were hidden in the first wheels of the train. With the well-designed hardware (2.0 version), we made some remarkable progress in lab.
Figure 24 “Window” to access plates.
Figure 25 Fans hidden in the wheels.
Figure 26 Internal structure of our Forest Train.
Figure 27 & 28 Appearance of our Forest Train
Future work
We wish in the future we can automate the process in our Forest Train and improve its efficiency. Then you can see a longer Forest Train with a customized projector, and every window can open and pick or take out a plate automatically. The customized projector can illuminate every plate. In that case we can produce beautiful products combined art and science continuously and efficiently, maybe just like a flower shop.

6/2/2015: Day 2
Second day at the lab! Today was dedicated to exploring the functionality of the cornerstone software. We made our first HelloWorld app in Javascript. Cornerstone also offers functionality using C++, but we decided on Javascript as a more malleable and accessible language to use. Our first app consisted of a few rectangles on the screen, which can be moved around by the users and duplicate when tapped on. Our long-term goal is to develop customized Widgets that would simulate bacteria and viruses, so later in the day we began exploring drawing customized shaped. By the end of the day, we had circles! Tomorrow we’ll explore more of the shape and customization possibilities.
6/3/2015: Day 3
Similar to yesterday (and likely the rest of this week), today was spent playing around with the available Widget features. We changed the shape of the Widgets to ellipses, hopefully moving towards a more E.coli-like shape in the future. We also defined some interaction between the widgets. We started off with bacteria being able to “eat” other bacteria: when two bacteria were close enough, the bigger one would consume the smaller one, with the latter then becoming a circle in the bigger one’s surface area. We then later differentiated between bacteria and viruses, another step towards a more accurate (though obviously still simplified) simulation. Bacteria are now bigger and elliptical, while viruses are smaller circles. Viruses can be replicated by tapping on them, and we currently have not define a mechanism for creating new bacteria. Bacteria can become “infected” by a virus through interacting with it. The issue we ran into was the fact that viruses were still individual widgets even when within bacteria, which meant that tapping on a virus inside a bacterium would still create new viruses, and it was possible to move a virus outside a bacterium’s body. At the very end of the day, we decided to use the addChild() function in widgets, which successfully restricted the virus’s movement within the bacterium. Ideally, tomorrow we’ll work on disabling any interaction with the virus once it is within a bacterium.
6/4/2015: Day 4
Today was a big day with a lot of progress! First, we explored changing the rendering function of bacteria, so now when a bacterium becomes infected, rather than containing the virus widget itself, a little circle is drawn within its body (and the virus widget is removed from the screen). Adding instance variables to the widgets really extended the possibilities for interaction, so we decided that if an infected bacterium encounters a"

Figure 2. Water retention of SAP in room temperature(RT).
Figure 3. Water retention of SAP in 55℃.
Whether in room temperature(RT) or high temperature(55℃）,the SAPs presented much lower rate of water lose. SAPs still had about 15% water content while the control became completely dry, indicating the strong water retention ability of SAPs.

The poly-crylamide/agar double network hydrogel is coded as“Axay”, in which “A” represents the acrylamide,“x” stands for the molar percentage of acrylamide（AAm）monomer content in the hydrogel. And “a” represents the “agar”, “y”stands for the agar concentration mg/ml.  In addition, the ratio of photoinitiator to monomer was fixed as 1mol%, and the ratio of crosslinker to monomer was fixed as 0.028mol%.

Abstract:
Using a simple one-pot, heating-cooling-photopolymerization method, we have successfully synthesized new type hydrogels with high mechanical properties , like cartilage and natural rubber, of stiffness (elastic modulus) , strength ( failure tensile stress ), and toughness , excellent extensibility and a unique free-shapeable property (formation of many complex shapes). Which not only fulfilled the basic ends of insoles, but also provided a wild range hydrogels with controllable stiffness and toughness to meet the needs of personal customized “Comfootable” insoles.
1) The polyacrylamide Single network hydrogel was totally transparent, becoming opaque and darker with the increasing of agar concentration.

Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," possible for proteins. Any mutation alters the effector sequence directly and thus can have severe effects on the functionality.
Standard for DNA work
Furthermore we have standardized the work with functional DNA. Has functional DNA usually is ssDNA it can NOT be cloned into a plasmid for storage. But every single strand functional DNA can simply be ordered as oligos.
In our project we mainly combined aptamer with a catalytic nucleic acid and thus create an aptazyme. However some constructs are more complicated than this (see HRP based detection). The parts we use can be combined in different constructs. All DNA parts described by us can be combined in may ways to create devices with a variety of functions and as such are very useful platform for the iGEM community.
<groupparts>iGEM015 Heidelberg</groupparts>
Parts
We would like to point out several of our parts as they were crucial and fundamental for our work. Below this section, a list of all entered parts can be found.
BBa_K1614007 - Favorite Part
We deliberately chose BBa_K1614007 - the HRP-mimicking DNAzyme - as favorite part, even though we cannot physically submit it, as it is a 17 bp long DNA-oligomer. Despite its small size, this functional DNA is capable of forming a G-quadruplex. Upon incorporation of hemin, a chemiluminescent reaction can be performed. We used this striking feature for many optical readouts, namely the AptaBody approach, the Labelling and Visualization and the Validation of the Software. This part is hence so central to our work that we would find it inappropriate to not appreciate and acknowledge this part aptly.
BBa_K1614002 - The Basis of our RFC 110
A highly relevant series of parts that is based upon BBa_K1614002 are all parts associated to our RFC (as also described above). In our RFC 110, we describe a standardized procedure for the production of small functional RNA. The storage of the constructs, as well as the integration into the in vitro transcription - cassette is suggested to be performed in BBa_K1614002. Therefore, this part is also central to our work and by including it into the registry, we want to enable the entire community of synthetic biology to generate small functional RNA in a standardized, yet versatile way.
BBa_K1614019 - A Part we Improved
One of the main strengths of synthetic biology, compared to other scientific disciplines is the strong community it is build upon. Yet this community is nothing without active"

UCAS-China,2018,Team:UCAS-China#LightToColor_-_-_TEXT.html," less fluorescence would be. The phenomenon was probably because that under relatively low light, the light sensor could be induced and under relatively strong light, the light can aggravate the burden of the bacteria and thus harmed the growth of the bacteria and reduced the expression of fluorescent proteins. We modelled this result for further explanation.(For more information, please see MODEL )
After using fluorescent proteins, we used the plasmid pJFR5 (BBa_K2598052), which contained enzyme genes lacZ (BBa_K2598025), bFMO (BBa_K2598029) and gusA (BBa_K2598032), to created more colors using enzymes. The enzymes could generate pigments on the plates and the results of mixing color was easier to observe, which could provide a new material for artists to create artworks. From the figure 13, we could see the different colors generated by enzymes and our system also worked well. The colors were a little dark, and we thought that the phenomenon might resulted from the high concentrations of the substances and long illumination period, which could be adjusted in the future.
Figure 13. The results of mixing color using enzyme.
By controlling the wavelength and intensity of the input light and the time of exposure, we could predict and control all kinds of colors our bacteria would produce. We did not have to edit the proteins to get a new color, and all we needed to do was to change the input light. Our concept of mixing color on the bacteria cells were proved to be reasonable and provided a convenient way for scientists and artists to create new colors and artworks. Applying the RGB system to our E.coli, now we could now stain our rose with various beautiful colors using colorful lights!

Blog
Back to top
To reach out to the public we started a blog on a local newspaper in Uppsala, our target group was the everyday person. We have written about our project and the biosynthetic community in a way which can be understood by a person who has never heard of synthetic biology before. The main goal with this blog was to inform and raise awareness of the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance and how we need find new ways of fighting it.
We have held study visit for the freshmen students of molecular biotechnology engineering program. The study was composed of two lectures, one held by our instructor Erik Gullberg, who spoke about synthetic biology, and the other one was held by our team members Sabri Jamal and Hampus Elofsson, who spoke about iGEM and the projects we have done in past years and now. The study was finalized with a short tour of our lab and some practical information about the lab work. The goal of this study was to inspire the students to join iGEM in the following years.
The molecular biotechnology engineering section of Uppsala University is going to have a inspiration week with different guest lectures during lunch. We have been invited to speak on Monday 1/10 about how iGEM is relevant to our education and what experience participation gives.

Figure 2 shows the 96-well plate that was used in our BioBrick characterization. First comparing our constructs to York 2013's construct, our GolS (BBa_K2048001) was able to more strongly express LacZ in both presence of gold and copper compared to York 2013's GolS (BBa_K1127008) . This can be determined by how wells G1 through G5 are more red in comparison to wells E1 through E5 for gold and C1 through C5 compared against A1 through C5 for copper. This can also be visualized in Figure 3 where the assay was at 24 hours.
Figure 2: CPRG assay results after 12 hours of incubation
Figure 3: CPRG assay results after 24 hours of incubation
Secondly, when looking at the assay, the degree of how red a well is becomes weaker or more yellow after 0.5\muM. We expected to see a linear increase correlated to increase in the concentration. However, instead, we observed a sudden decrease in expression levels after 0.5uM (Figure 4). This became more pronounced over time, resulting a Range Detector Circuit. We suspect that there is an inherent edge that represses the expression after a certain threshold. This would produce the circuit shown in Figure 5. We speculated that this effect might be minimum for cell free extracts that contain minimal enzymes.
Figure 4: 2D Absorbance graph for CPRG assay
Figure 5: Computational explanation for the CPRG assay
Thirdly, we compared our GolS (BBa_K2048001) and GolS P118A (BBa_K2048002) constructs response to and in the presence of gold and copper. Based on observations of 12 hours (Figure 2) and 24 hours (Figure 3), it is visible that the GolS (BBa_K2048001) from G1 through G5 (the Au(3) concentrations) is darker red compared to C1 through C5 (the Cu(2) concentrations). The visible significant difference in the darker shades of red for the gold concentration wells compared to copper indicates that our constructs are far more sensitive to gold than it is to copper.

SYSU-Software,2014,Team:SYSU-Software#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," 1. A toggle switch, The presence of Repressor1 can repress the transcription of Repressor2, but such repression can be abolished by Inducer1; while Repressor2 can repress the transcription of Repressor1 and be abolished by Inducer2. (Adapted from Gardner et al., 2000)
Therefore, the pattern of toggle switch is: when there is an input of Inducer1 with no Inducer2, there is no output; when there is input of Inducer2 with no Inducer1, there would be an output.
Following the standard mentioned above, we deduce the following form:
2. Oscillator[7][8][9]
Using Hill equation one can represent the system as
αi is the conversion rate when there is no activator; βi is the degradation rate; γi is the leakage rate; n is the Hill coefficient.
We transform these equations into the same form: since such process also reflects the relation of activation and repression between proteins, we can still use function F and G mentioned above to illustrate such reaction.
Therefore, we deduce:
3. Inverter[10]
We study a structure from its function. We know that inverters serve to alter the concentration level from a high one to a low one, or vice versa. In the integrated circuit design, we can use a NOT GATE to realize the switch between high and low electric potential. Therefore, In our software, we design an inverter structure resembling the NOT GATE to mimic the real situation.
4. AND GATE as a Dual System[11][12][13]
AND GATE are different from cases above. An AND GATE receives two inputs and returns only one output as a result. Therefore, we cannot utilize the F and G functions as mentioned above. However, it is reported that AND GATE is composed of activation and repression between proteins; therefore, they are equivalent in biological terms. We multiply these factors to indicate their interrelationship and get function H:
Dual-Activation system:
Activation-repression coexist system:
Dual-repression system:
Algorithm

2. Invoke the corresponding functions such as F(the activation) or G(the repression).
3. Use the SPICY package built in Python to solve ordinary differentiated equations and returned the values.

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  The PCquad Yeates will be grown again in order to rerun the purification and a purer product will be attempted to be obtained.  For today, the glycerol stock will be used to streak on a plate.  In addition, sequencing primers will be designed.
The previous sequencing primers look like they should work for PCquad prime 3.0 and Mutant 10, so no primers were made.
Streaking the plate:
The glycerol stocks were obtained and put on ice.  The ampicillin plate was obtained and warmed in the incubator for 15 minutes.  Using asceptic technique, a wire loop was flamed, and cooled on the gel.  It was then dipped into the glycerol stock, and then plated in a zig-zag fashion.  The wire loop was flamed and cooled again before running another zig-zag pattern across the end of the previous streak.  This was done a total of three times.  The plate was then put in the 37C incubator at 5:30PM."

HPLC Results
We were able to generate good standard curves for detection of each intermediary. The curves were generated from the chromatogram data returned by HPLC. Each curve displays the detection of each intermediary at concentrations of 5 µM, 10 µM, 25 µM, 50 µM, and 100 µM (Figures 7, 8, and 9).

Figure 9: Standard curve for detection of indole acetic acid. The peak area refers to the area under the chromatogram peak.
HPLC chromatograms were recovered, demonstrating the ability of the method to detect the presence of each intermediary in mixed solutions. We report good mixture detection at 100 µM and 10 µM concentrations of each mixture , with less resolution when samples were present in 5 µM concentrations (Figures 10, 11, and 12).

Cover the flask with aluminum foil, and secure the foil with autoclave tape. The foil should be somewhat loose (to avoid building pressure in the flask while sterilizing and blowing the foil off), but not so loose that lots of liquid can escape
Put the flask in a plastic autoclave tray, load into the autoclave, and sterilize using the 20 minute liquid program
Once the autoclave finishes venting (which can take twice as long as the sterilization proper), check that the foil covering is still in place. If it is not, the media is contaminated! Unload using the insulated oven gloves
Allow the media to cool until it can be handled without the oven mits. The cold room can be used to speed this up. Alternatively, if a large batch of media is prepared flasks may be kept hot in the prep lab water bath, to avoid all of them cooling at once. Agar polymerization cannot be reversed once it starts (and if it begins to set in the flask you're in trouble!), but media can be kept from setting further by keeping it hot.
Once media is cool, add other desired ingredients. Use the magnetic stirrer to mix, but do NOT add a stir bar now, or the media will be contaminated. (If one wasn't added before, you must do without.) Common additions include:
ampicillin (stock 100mg/ml, final 100ug/ml)
kanamycin (stock 50mg/ml, final 50ug/ml)
chloramphenicol (stock 50mg/ml, final 10ug/ml)
x-gal (stock 40mg/ml, final 40ug/ml)
To achieve final concentrations, add 1mL of stock per 1L of media, except for chloramphenicol, where 0.6mL per 1L of media is added instead
Pour directly from the flask into sterile petri plates. Use a quick pass with a bunsen burner flame to snuff out bubbles that form during pouring. Do not subject the plate to continuous heat or the plate will melt, and the heat sensitive ingredients added in the previous step will be destroyed. Bubbles can allow cells to access nutrients without being exposed to the plate's antibiotic, and should be blown out immediately before the gel can set. It's a good idea for one person to pour while another flames bubbles.
Allow the plates to stand right side up overnight, or until the gel sets if they are needed"

General Genetic Algorithms
General genetic algorithms are a population-based meta-heuristic approach to optimize a complex target function [8] . The question at hand is in this                 case: Given a large input parameter space, how to choose a configuration that yields a maximal value in terms of a certain measure function.
Genetic algorithms utilize the simulation of biological evolution. A specific configuration from the large input parameter space is called individual and                 its value in terms of the chosen measure function is defined as its fitness value. An individual has a representation that can be mutated to obtain a new                 individual with a different fitness. A set of \(N\) individuals is called a population of size \(N\).
A population is simulated over the course of time for a number of generations \(g\). After each generation, evolutionary processes are applied. These comprise mutation of an individual, parental selection from the population – based on the individuals’ fitness values – and individual pairing. The so generated                 offspring replaces the previous generation and forms the next generation.
Thus, genetic algorithms resemble evolution through mutation and selection pressure in order to find the fittest individual.
Adapted Self-Developed Genetic Algorithm
We use a modified genetic algorithm with fixed population size. It computes the escape probability of individuals. These individuals implement a kill switch                 which might be destroyed through mutations. The kill switches are modeled as genetic regulatory networks. The major difference is that it is not used for an                 optimization task but rather for the evolution of the population. Below, the algorithm is comprehensively summarized in figure 6.
Figure 6. The self-developed, adapted genetic                 algorithm we use to compute the escape probability.
The processes are as follows:
Individual: An organism that has the kill switch of interest implemented. Since using genetic regulatory networks, the kill                         switch is a system of ODEs including the biologically relevant parameters \(k\). These parameters are initialized with the values                         from the non-mutated kill switch and lie in the biologically relevant regime.
Population: \(N=1000\) individuals that are simultaneously simulated.
Fitness: The toxin expression compared to the toxin threshold \(\theta\). An individual’s fitness is between 0 and 100. It implements a                         soft criterion around the toxin threshold.

UCSF,2013,Team:UCSF#ALHS Project1_-_-_TEXT.html," 85.2% of the students felt that GMOs should be labeled. About half of the students (48.1%) said they would avoid eating GMOs (66.7%) and would pay extra to avoid them (18.5%). After the unit, one student said he learned “that a lot of what we eat is genetically modified”. Another echoed that statement, “I learned that a lot of the food we eat are made from GMOs,” and went on to explain, “I also learned that we can check if they contain GMOs by a process that we learned in this biotech class.”
Lab Activities
In search of two genes
In order to find out if GMOs were present in common, every-day foods, such as tortilla chips and papaya, we tested these common foods for the presence of two genes: CaMV35S, which codes for a promoter, and NOS, which codes for a terminator. We specifically looked for the presence of promoter and terminator genes instead of the actual functional genes themselves because the functional gene may vary from organism to organism, depending on what qualities of the organism are being altered. In order to determine which of our samples were GMOs and which were not, we used some very common lab techniques including Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), which amplifies a certain piece of DNA.
Choosing the foods
We chose to use a variety of food, including fresh soy beans, tortilla chips, Fritos corn chips, papaya and a organic corn snack that claims it is made from an ancient variety of corn. We tested some foods that were labeled “non-GMO” and some that weren’t labeled at all.
Testing
We crushed up samples of each food  up with a mortar and pestle, while adding small amounts of water to make a slurry. We then placed each sample into a microcentrifuge tube containing InstaGene, a chelating agent that helps to remove metal ions. We have to use this because it ensures that the PCR will be free of metal ions. After adding our samples to InstaGene, we shook the tubes and placed them into a 95°C water bath for 5 minutes. Afterwards, we centrifuged them for 5 minutes at the maximum speed, and then refrigerated them.
The next day, we removed the samples from the refrigerator and placed them on ice. We added all of the essential ingredients for PCR into a PCR tube, in addition to DNA from the samples we had centrifuged the previous day. After mixing the contents of the tube, we placed them into the thermal cycler."

More details about our market research can be found on our Human Practices page
Objectives
As stated in our project aims, and justified by the market reasearch above, we wanted to develop a standard for biosensors that is reliable, affordable, portable, open-source, accessible and relevant. These different targets required further condensation before a formal design process can begin. The formal design goals for our project were, therefore, the development of:
an output that is reliable, reproducible, and quantitative.
a robust, standard platform for biosensing inputs.
a system for the storage and distribution of biosensors for straightforward use in multiple applications.
a system that is rooted in real world applications that can bring about a positive change in the world
Design considerations
Inputs
It's common sense that without a reliable input system, output systems, however robust, cannot be trusted to give meaningful results. It is therefore important that the response to a given input from a biosensor is well characterised (with response curves) under different conditions. However, to truly revolutionise biosensing we would also require a standard platform which could sense a multitude of analytes. This would allow for better characterisation and all additional information about a sensor's function under different conditions to be acquired with one fewer parameter which would need to be changed.  We would also like the response curves to be relatively linear across a wide range such that different toxicity thresholds are detectable using the same system. Ideally, we would also like a system that could be designed ""from scratch"" in the future such that there would be no need for an existing response mechanism in an organism to be found before implementation as a biosensor could take place. This goal is a very long way off, but we would like to consider platforms with the potential for it. The input must therefore have the following attributes:
A decoupling between the sensing mechanism and its interface with the output system.
Highly specific analyte discrimination.
An output response which is highly proportional to the concentration of analyte present.
The potential for rational redesign, possibly through the use of software tools.
Processing
All biosensors currently in the registry only use a single output to relay information about the concentration of an analyte. Because there is great potential for differences in culture homogeneity, and because the productivity of cultures is proportional to their cell density, this often leads to poorly reproducible and unreliable results. We therefore desire some processing to be performed (without specifying where in the whole system, yet) which factors in these variables and allows for a much more accurate readout. With accuracy"
UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," would be very limited and researchers would be unable to synthesize a specific treatment. Instead, he confirmed that we should go forward with working on a single proof-of-concept disease and then broadening our focus towards other diseases as well. While he encouraged us to identify markers specific to hepatocellular carcinoma , he also pointed us to some foundational literature and lab documentation to guide our decision making.
Takeaway:
Talking to Dr. Zhang helped solidify our choice of HCC as our proof of concept. We also began making specific technical design decisions based on the foundational literature he has provided us with.
Nina Vandeventer, Global Head of Personalized Development at Genentech
In talking to Ms. Vandeventer, we learned more about the broader challenges in implementing a diagnostic test in a clinical setting . She re-iterated a crucial point that we had heard many times: the key to getting healthcare professionals and healthcare providers would be to demonstrate high levels of accuracy . She also suggested in order to improve our overall design, we need to discuss our perspectives with as many stakeholders as possible . In her position at Roche/Genentech, interacting with stakeholders is essential to understanding expectations, needs, and concerns. By embedding their feedback int our strategy and our implementation, we would be able to develop a sustainable solution that addresses the needs of more people. Important stakeholder groups included patients, healthcare professionals, providers, and the scientific community.
Takeaway:
After our conversation, our team went back and looked at the people that we had talked to, as well as the ones we were planning to. We decided to group them into buckets and identify their primary pain points. Because our team was interested in long-term sustainable implementation, we wanted to make sure that we took a stakeholder-based approach to this. Talking to patients would help us understand what it is like to live with a specific disease and understand physical and emotional challenges facing patients and their families. Talking to healthcare professionals helped us improve the understanding of how to generate clinical insight and understand existing clinical methodologies and routine practices. Another important piece of a diagnostics product is its price point and healthcare reimbursement strategy: if it is too expensive or has too narrow of a focus, the hospital will most likely not buy into it.

Figure 2. Left: The time required for the bacteria to enter dormancy varies with the expression level of RelB.  Right: Only one of the tested configurations, RelB2:50-RelE:35, causes the bacteria to regain their activity within the modelled time. The data is based on the simulation of 1000 independent bacteria.
The simulated data revealed, that when enhanced RelE production is implemented, in order to induce dormancy in E. coli, the effect come easily. However, implementation of RelB expression is also found necessary to ensure that the bacteria are able to enter an active state again.
The model showed that the system is sensitive to the RelE:RelB ratio, as well as the total amount of produced toxin. As seen in Figure 2, implementation with production rates in the vicinity of 50 and 35 molecules per minute for RelB and RelE respectively, was found to be suitable for balancing our system; the bacteria lay dormant within the computed time and re-enter an active state within minutes.
The simulated data made it evident that implementing an optimised dormancy system comprises a challenge, as the individual expression levels of RelE and RelB, as well as their interaction, has a crucial impact on the regulation of dormancy. Thus, controlled gene expression of both RelE and RelB is required to implement a controllable dormancy system in the PowerLeaf.
If you want to dig deeper into this crucial modelling of the dormancy system, read the full results here.

Gillespie Algorithm
The Gillespie algorithm is a way to calculate the evolution of stochastic functions; in this case cell concentrations. To use the algorithm, two things are required:
Reaction rates of the system at a given configuration.
A random number generator.
For each time step, two things are calculated using the random number generator:
The time before next reaction.
Which reaction occurs.
The time before next step is given by:
Δt=S-1log(r1-1)
Where S is the sum of the reaction rates and r1 is a random number between 0 and 1. This gives the time, as if the system was one reaction with reaction rate S, using the random number to give an exponential distribution.
The reaction is chosen proportionally to each individual reaction rate using another random number, where reactions with high rates will occur most frequently.
As each reaction is carried out, the new time is the sum of the previous and added reaction times.   These calculations are carried out until the time reaches the wanted limit, or a specific number of reactions has occurred."

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#Policies_-_-_TEXT.html," the hydroponic facility or being ingested by any consumer. Second, all produce is processed and sanitized before being sold at market and/or eaten. Any bacteria residing on the vegetables would be washed off or killed.  Both of these factors provide little chance for the bacteria to ever enter or harm consumers of these hydroponic crops. The risk of foodborne illness is not significantly higher compared to conventionally grown crops.
Though there is no theoretical danger to adding our E. coli, we have not addressed all risks. We do not know how the oxidative state of the growth solution will affect the nutritional value and chemical composition of produce. It is also possible that the bacteria could cause the aeration system of a hydroponic setup to clog and/or fail. We plan on further testing these unknowns.
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
In order to evaluate the environmental impact of OxyPonics, we examined the impact of hydroponic farms. Hydroponic farming has greater water efficiency and can be a solution for food production with limited supply of freshwater, especially in drier regions. Furthermore, since hydroponic setups are enclosed systems that can be situated nearly anywhere, it avoids the negative impacts associated with conventional farming , including a large land requirement, soil degradation and erosion, and runoff of pesticides and nutrients [9].
In some cases, hydroponic farming has been shown to require greater energy input than traditional farming [9]. However, it is largely still considered beneficial since areas that use hydroponics to reduce water usage typically have large amounts of renewable energy available. Furthermore, as our system is dependent on bacterial fluorescence, there is minimal energy input to OxyPonics. This will lower the energy needs of hydroponic systems, increasing their sustainability.
Another concern shared by many about hydroponics is that the nutrient solution in the water can cause environmental harm during disposal [10]. OxyPonics tackles this issue as well. With accurate, precise, and real-time monitoring, OxyPonics can ensure that the water quality of the hydroponic system is high enough that even upon disposal, there is no adverse impact on the environment. Moreover, we can reduce waste because better monitoring allows nutrient solutions to be utilized longer, meaning that there is a decreased need for growers to throw out and replace their nutrient solution.
As mentioned in the Safety & Risk section, the E. coli we utilize will be contained within dialysis tubing. They will be handled with care, and all produce leaving the system will be sanitized. The E. coli hence will not be released into the environment. Through preventative measures and risk"

WPI-Worcester,2014,Team:WPI-Worcester#Proof-of-Principle_-_-_TEXT.html,", we performed a fractionation experiment followed by a Western Blot. We were doing the fractionation to isolate the membrane bound proteins from the cytoplasmic proteins. We then performed a Western Blot using a GFP antibody. Our results suggest that their might be some localization of YFP to the cell surface membrane using the BclA-YFP construct. However, the results were not conclusive. We believe that the Figure 4 below shows the localization of the YFP to the membrane. This is the case because in the BclA-YFP well in the membrane bound protein lane there was an extremely high expression on the blot. This shows that the YFP is being localized to the cell surface on the biochemical level. When performing the Western Blot, it appeared that the wells were loaded evenly but a loading control was not used which is part of the reason we concede these results to be mildly inconclusive. We still feel the results of this Western Blot adds extra support to the efficiency of BclA cell surface protein localization when combined with our microscopy results.
Figure 4: Cell Fractionation and Western Blot Results
Agglutination Assay
For our proof of principle agglutination assay, we wanted to test if antigens expressed on the cell surface, in this case YFP antigens, would bind to their corresponding antibody and produce visible agglutination. In order to do this, we based our protocol off of this paper. We combined in a well plate GFP antibodies (which is analogous to YFP antibodies) with E.coli expressing YFP externally through the use of both INP and BclA. As a control, we also mixed GFP antibodies with E.coli internally expressed GFP as well as E.coli externally expressing the CAEV antigen using our biobrick( BBa_K1423004) .
If our agglutination experiment is successful, we would expect agglutination in the wells with E.coli externally expressing YFP (using BCLA and INP). We would not expect agglutination in the well with E.coli internally expressing GFP because the GFP is internal, meaning the extracellular antigen cannot bind to it. We would also expect no agglutination in the well containing E.coli externally expressing the CAEV antigen because that is the incorrect antigen, and it is not recognized by the GFP antibodies.
It is important to first establish how to interpret the results of our agglutination assay. When agglutination occurs, antibodies will bind to their matching antigen pairs, creating a mat on the bottom of the well. This"
Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#project#drylab#modeling#deployment_-_-_TEXT.html," some distance $L$ downstream of a chemical source in order to detect the chemical.       So for a given river width $W$, how do we find the distance $L$ to place our biosensor? One way to determine $L$ is to go to the river in question, measure its height, width, length and volumetric flow rate and numerically solve for bulk motion. Unfortunately, the Alberta Oil Sands are roughly 4,000 km away from Cornell, so going to Alberta is out of the question. A simpler solution is to use dimensional analysis to estimate what the value of $L$ would be for each river that may be effected by Oil Sands operations.       First, the time scale $\tau$ which is the time scale for bulk motion can be written as:       $$\tau = \frac{L}{u}$$       where $u$ is the average velocity of the river and $L$ is the length scale for bulk motion. Second, a time scale for turbulent mixing can be written as:       $$\tau=  \frac{l^2}{D}$$       where $l$ is the length scale for mixing and $D$ is the turbulent mixing coefficient. Since bulk motion and turbulent mixing are happening at the same time, time scales can be set equal to each other allowing $L$ to be solved for:       $$L=  \frac{ul^2}{D}$$       The average velocity $u$ can be rewritten as:       $$u = \frac{Q}{wh}$$       where $Q$ is the volumetric flow rate of the river, $w$ is the width of the river and $h$ is the depth of the river. Next, the turbulent mixing coefficient can be rewritten as:       $$ D=kh \sqrt{ghs}$$       where $s$ is the slope of the river, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $k$ is an experimentally determined constant. This constant differs for turbulent mixing across a river (horizontal) and turbulent mixing within a river (vertical). Since we want to place our biosensor at the point where the chemical is completely mixed in the river, we need to take into account both horizontal and vertical turbulent mixing. Putting both of these definitions into our equation for $L$ gives us       $$L=  \frac{Ql^2}{kwh^2\sqrt{ghs}}$$       Finally, we need to define what $k$ and $l$ are. If we want to know how far downstream the chemicals will be mixed horizontally across the"

The aftermath: A few days later, the information was everywhere…from newspapers to appearing as breaking news across television shows; not to mention, it was on every social media outlet that exists. Everyone was talking about the effects of the diseases and how two new states identified regions having infected mosquitoes. Naturally, people were wondering and questioning: What needed to be done to put a stop to the spread? How to protect themselves from getting the illness? What would happen or could be done if they contracted one of these horrific diseases? During a press conference: Senator Smith took full advantage of this opportunity that “fell into his lap” and decided to make several appearances on TV stating, “This is a concerning issue, which shows the importance of allocating a larger portion of federal resources to clinical research and development.” He continues declaring that he wants to give more money to pharmaceutical laboratories and research institutions, obviously to fight diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, but he also stressed how this case shows the importance of being a step ahead in the fight against may other viruses and pathogenic bacteria plaguing our country. “I want us to live in a country that is free of disease and illness…stand with me and HELP ME, HELP YOU fight TOWARDS A HEALTHIER TOMORROW FOR ALL…May God Bless America”, he concludes. What he didn’t anticipate: During Senator Smith’s press report, Mr. and Mrs. Walter, who were living in New Mexico, were following the news and paid close attention to the concern that was being expressed regarding the health of the residents in these states and that their state was likely to be the next place infected by arboviruses. Mrs. Walter was pregnant and she was aware of the consequences Zika virus has on her unborn child. So, Mr. and Mrs. Walter made a life changing decision. Despite the fact that they were a young couple and did not have a lot of money, they decided to move to a state where arboviruses were not reported. They sold their house, packed their things, and moved to Wisconsin. In fact, they were not the only people that made that decision. But this decision wasn’t easy for the Walter’s, nor was it easy for other families. Older people and other families were in no position to leave due to finances and other restraints, so they were forced to stay and hope for the best. They were all in a panicked state of survival. Everything was changing around them. The economy was also impacted by this Zika scare. A number of suppliers"

Human Practice Collaboration
Initialized by the iGEM Team from Düsseldorf , we had a nice human practice collaoration with the teams from Aachen, Bielefeld, Darmstadt, Erlangen, Hannover and Tübingen taking part in this campaign. The concept of this campaign was that iGEM Teams from all over Germany design postcards with an important aspect of Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology combined with a catchy motif, and exchange them with all the other teams. Now having a large variety of different postcards, the teams distribute them to the public. The aim is to give non-scientists an understanding of Synthetic Biology, what this means, and in which parts of our life it is involved.

University_College_London,2012,Team:University College London#HumanPractice#Rathenau_-_-_TEXT.html," geoengineering and the rights and responsibilities relating to such large scale projects.  However, our research quickly revealed that these topics had been already been well-publicized and thoroughly discussed.  We decided to try and avoid the tired and abstract moral/ethical questions, and bring our debate into a more concrete setting by using a ‘crisis scenario’.
Crisis scenario
The crisis scenario was inspired by the Rathenau Institute’s Synbio futures ,  a series of ‘techno-moral vignettes’ – short stories imagining possible futures in which synthetic biology technologies have become commonplace.  Our crisis scenario, which is set in 2030, imagines the mutation of widely-used synthetic fertilizer, FertiBac, to produce a toxin that is spreading into crops and waterways.  See the full scenario here .
Using this crisis scenario we provide a framework for the debate by setting out a possible future in which the fears raised by synthetic biology have come true – to discuss the ‘what now’ rather than the ‘what if’, to debate in practicalities rather than generalities.
The debate
We are very pleased to have Annemiek Nelis of the Dutch Safety Board chairing our section of the Meeting of Young Minds.  We will also have a panel of representatives from the UEA Norwich and Paris Bettencourt iGEM teams, the Oxford Conservative Association, GreenLeft Youth Organization, and National Federation of Young Farmer’s Clubs, amongst others.
They will act as the ‘European Council of Synthetic Biology’, who will come together in a public hearing in the aftermath of the crisis. They will be responsible for deciding the best course of action to take and interrogating members of our team, as the scientist, manufacturer, marketer, and regulator of the failed technology.  We will also hear questions and suggestions from the public, of which the best three suggestions will be announced on the iGEM wiki and the Rathenau website.
Position Paper
As preparation for the debate, we were asked to write a 2500-word position paper.  The paper, which is available here , is divided into three parts.  The first part, ‘The synthetic biology present’, presents the current legal situation around deliberate release and transboundary movement of synthetic organisms.  Part 2, ‘Next steps’, questions the need for changes to the existing legislation, as synthetic organisms move out of the laboratory towards industrial applications, to reflect the new challenges – real or perceived – posed by truly synthetic (as opposed to simply genetically modified) organisms.   Part 3 ‘Into the future’, deals with the issues posed by our crisis scenario, looking"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar,"

6/27/08 方針決め会議＆第29回ブレインストーミング
場所：VBL3階会議室
前半は古林さんに来ていただき、これからの方針について話し合いました。
8月に入り次第本格的な実験にうつるためには、7月中旬のテスト休みの前に今年のiGEM-Chibaのテーマを決定しておく必要があります。
そこでこれからの予定としては、先日決めたチームごとに企画を完成させていき、7月10日までに紙面化して提出＆発表します。
また勉強会では、2年生が全員揃う曜日が少ないこと、時間がないことを考慮し、Web勉強会をすることになりました。
Web勉強会は自律して行わないとできないものです。各自本気で取り組んでください。
ブレインストーミングでは福冨さんの案を中心に行いました。
ほかのチームも福冨さんに負けず、自分たちの案を発表していきましょう。
