Capsule - look into the 2014 team
Thinking about having water in the capsule, keep water in capsule, break it and everything gets hydrated
Coating the microneedles with palmitic acid, we don’t need to create another compartment

Backing Layer
Purpose:  
provides structural support and protects the middle adhesive layer from the environment
3M CoTran™ 9722 Backing Polyethylene Monolayer Film
Alternative: (2nd best out of 3)
3M CoTran™ 9719 Backing Polyethylene Monolayer Film
Out of the three films 3M offers, the qualities that we thought would be beneficial are:
Elongation = for movement of patient, has to 600% elongation, highest of the three
MVTR = this has the lowest amount out of all 3
Translucent
Breathable
Printable
Can be directly laminated to adhesives
Heat Sealable (PE)
Designed to resist excipient and drug uptake
We are not sure how much oxygen the bacteria would be using. We are not sure if 6400 cc/m2/day is enough for oxygen transmission.
We do not know if this would turn cloudy after a period of time as currently existing patches with clear backing undergo the same issue.
Adhesive Layer
Also note that thicker adhesive layer also results in severe cold flow during storage in the pouch, and
higher affinity for lint and dirt to adhere to the edge of the
patch during wear.

Fig 2.
Revelation with light filters
As our device is meant to be used at home, we wanted a revelation method that does not imply the use of a UV lamp.                                     Inspired by the work of the 2015 iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec team on sfGFP (another fluorescent molecule which emission wavelengths and absorption are                                     relatively close to those of fluorescein), we decided to test whether a revelation with light filters on the flash and camera of our smartphone would work. Images taken with the smartphone equipped with various combinations of filters revealed that the filter on the flash was necessary                                     to foresee a fluorescence (see below). Moreover, adding a filter to the lens increases the detection sensitivity.                                     Also, it turned out that the sample of fluorescein concentration was a very important factor.                                     Above a certain threshold of the concentration, fluorescence is quenched.
Fig 3.
However, on a cellulose paper sheet the fluorescence detection turned out to be much less efficient, even in the optimal conditions that ensure a minimum of quenching.
Paper strips design
We designed paper strips that could handle our biological system.                                     These paper strips contained a filtration pad in glass fiber, a nitrocellulose strip, and an adsorption pad in cellulose.
Fig 4.
The filtration pad was here to prevent erythrocytes from migrating on the paper strip. It worked, after migration the nitrocellulose remained white and the results could be read. We also tested the microfluidics of this system once in our prototype, until we got good migration results.
Fig 5.
Characterization of Aptamers for real STIs: HIV and HBV
After an intensive work on the human thrombin, we tested HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase (RT).                                     This particular target would allow us to detect HIV infections at a very early stage, when this virus has just penetrated the host.                                     At this stage antibodies are produced by the patient’s body yet,                                     so conventional methods of detection are not valid. We did an EMSA with the most efficient HIV RT aptamer we could find.
Fig 6.
The curve presents an inflexion point for [RT] = Kd = 490 nmol.L-1 The sensitivity is again quite good, with the same warnings than for thrombin.
Important remark: We only have one aptamer to catch the Reverse-Transcriptase. Although"

Human Practice
     The art of science should not only be limited to the scientists who are learned. We believe that everyone has the right to have a taste of the magic of science. As everyone likes playing games, we decided to integrate playing with education, thus making science more fun and less formidable. To make our game better, we had a visit to one of the biggest game company in China and received many constructive views from experts. We want the public to know more about science and love science, especially children. In order to achieve this, we held an exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum where lots of children who are interested in science visit every day. Lastly, as we want many of our peers to know more about synthetic biology and even have an interest in being an iGEMer, we held a mini-jamboree in our school. Take a look at what we have done!

Hazards of Obesity
&nbsp &nbsp Obesity is associated with increased risks of many diseases ,like diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and heart diseases, and even cancer. The chances of obesity people to have hypertension is 2 to 6 times higher than those of normal weight. Apart from this, the doctors also pointed out that obesity can cause many mental illnesses. Obese people, especially young women, often feel ashamed to show themselves in public; and such lack of confidence may eventually make them miss out opportunities.
Obesity Treatment
 Drug therapy, healthy lifestyle like diet as well as physical exercise are preferentially adopted when patients receive a treatment, mostly because of the better feasibility and the less side effects. However, most of them feel hard to insist and have problems of rebounding, etc.
 Surgery, such as liposuction and sleeve gastrectomy, compared to other obesity treatments, are used in certain situations when patients are in an urgent need to lose weight. Nevertheless, the treatment cost is expensive and the side effects are inevitable.

Molecular Targeting Therapy
Concerns
Doctor Qiu affirmed us for the creativity and novelty of our project, but she also put forward some concerns. First of all, there may be unknown risks in our project, since we use siRNA drugs to knock down the expression of BCL2, which is a key gene in cell apoptosis. Certainly it will lead to a chain reaction and induce apoptosis, but what is the fate of adipocytes debris? When it comes to nucleic acid drugs, extra gene expression must be valued. Moreover, the rare application of targeted drug in treating obesity may result in some distrust of our patients. Doctor Qiu joked that if she was fat, even if our project had gorgeous results on mice, she was unwilling to try such a new drug. Because unlike cancer, obesity is not that mortal and many therapy options are available, it is less prone for people to risk their lives using unknown drugs just to become slim. Furthermore, the sustainability of our medicine efficacy should also be taken into consideration, given that the ideal frequency of intravenous injection is twice a month for patients. It is obvious that too short medicine efficacy sustainability compelled with everyday shot is inadvisable. Doctor Qiu argued that siRNA drugs would unavoidably be degraded in patients body so the long-term drug efficacy is definitely where our future"

Der erste iGEM-Wettbewerb fand im Jahr 2003 statt und war zu diesem Zeitpunkt ausschließlich für Studenten des MIT vorgesehen. In den folgenden Jahren wurde die Teilnahme auch für Teams anderer Universitäten gestattet und im Jahr 2011 traten bereits 165 Teams von Universitäten aus allen Teilen der Welt an.  Dieses Jahr nimmt auch ein Team der Universität Göttingen erstmals an diesem Wettstreit teil und sieht diesen als eine großartige Chance zahlreiche Fähigkeiten, die für eine Karriere als Molekularbiologe nötig sind, zu erhalten und zu verbessern.  Zu diesen Fähigkeiten gehören die Planung und Organisation eines Projektes, einschließlich der Aufstellung eines Teams, Finanzierung der laufenden Ausgaben, Koordination der Laborarbeit, dem Design von Experimenten und der Zusammenarbeit als Team.  Neben der tatkräftigen Arbeit im Labor über die gesamten Sommermonate, sind auch Literatur-Recherchen und eine gut strukturierte Dokumentation der Experimente und derer Ergebnisse von großer Bedeutung.

As far as I can recall I was always immersed in Sciences  and multi-culturalism. Following a bilingual education in France,  I obtained an Honours Bachelor of Science in Anthroplogy and  in Biology from the University of Toronto. Drawing from such a  wide education, I really wish to participate in the iGEM  competition so that I can bring to the team my biology skills and  my anthroplogical knowledge. I want to seize the opportunity  and contribute to this new adventure that synthetic biology is.

After many talks with some teachers, I had the wish to  participate in the iGEM competition. The idea of life engineering  seems to me very interesting. To create standards could  simplify experiments and all shares. We are not yet researchers  but we have the ambition to achieve a research project end to  end. Finally, iGEM contributes to the development of synthetic  biology, while attempting to demystify the image of science. I  think science is accessible to people that get caught into the  game.

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Notebook#Engineering#ODF_-_-_TEXT.html," also expected: Transmittance is the fraction of light not absorbed by some medium relative to the cell-free and clear medium. However, the transmittance is not only dependent on the amount of cells in the way of the light's beam, but also how much light shines through the cuvette in which fashion, and in which fraction is received by the sensor in which angles.
Using the above formula we performed this experiment for Pseudomonas putida and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and asked team Freiburg to perform the same experiment using mamallian cells.
Experiments
We performed several experiments during the development of the device. Finally, we can relate the measured transmittance to the true Optical Density (true OD), and further, we can relate the true OD to the true OD of the photospectrometer in our lab. By doing so, we can calibrate our device to meaningful values.
We have done this according to the previous section for Pseudomonas putida and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
The final function for calculating the OD from the transmission calculated by our device can be calculated as
$$ OD(T) = f(T) \circ g(device) $$
where $f$ transforms transforms transmittance $T$ to true optical density for our device, and $g$ transforms true optical density of our device into the true optical density of the photospectrometer. This way our device is calibrated according to the photospectrometer.
Pseudomonas putida
True Optical Density to Transmittance plot for P. putida
Corrolating the true optical density of the OD/F Device to true optical density of the photospectrometer for P. putida
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
True Optical Density to Transmittance plot for S. cerivisiae
Corrolating the true optical density of the OD/F Device to true optical density of the photospectrometer for S. cerivisiae
From these plots, it can be seen that our device delivers robust and reproducible results for both procaryotes and eucaryotes. Also the function from transmittance to true OD follows a clear pattern, making its calculation possible on a low-end device like a microcontroller.
It is interesting to observer that function $g$, mapping the true OD of our device to the true OD of the photospectrometer, are close together for both P. putida and S. cerivisae, as seen by the regression coefficient. In fact, 3.416 and 3.461 are such close together, that the minor deviation could"

The construct Pqrr4+B0034+K082003 (GFP:LVA) has been sent to for sequencing with Pqrr4 F/R primers to the University of Calgary DNA Sequencing Facility (University Core DNA Services, Calgary, Alberta, Canada). It has been submitted before 1pm, so we will be able to get the results tomorrow.
2. Overnight cultures
Overnight cultures of Pqrr4+I13500 were grown from the single colonies that were transformed yesterday. These are required for plasmid isolation of the circuit, which will then be verified via Restriction digest.

I spent some time looking up and reading out aiiA, B0015 and B0034 and then Jeremy spent some time explaining restriction sites, primers, resistance, steps of construction and where my part fits into the system.
Next, I worked with Fahd to make a list of new companies we could contact for sponsorship but we'll divide them up tomorrow. I have started to research a few that i thought I'd like to contact. I also looked up the contact info for Utoday and I'll be contacting them tomorrow. I sent out the last few newsletters to companies and emailed our Communications/media adviser to discuss few issues about promoting iGEM.
Then the marketing, ethics and outreach team worked together to make the slides for tomorrow's formal presentation! We discussed the important issues, edited, and divided up the different sections among different group members.

Notecards
I started writing the notecards that will be handed out at each station. For example, at the quorum sensing station you meet Squidney Crosby. Once you click on him he will say:
""Help the bacteria glow! Take a bacteria avatar into your inventory. Then right-click, wear the costume and go towards the bacteria.""
From this a person should be able to understand the goal of this station, how to carry out the task, and learn something about using Second Life controls (in this case it would be wearing something in your inventory). You also receive a notecard saying:
""Quorum sensing is a way for bacteria to coordinate their actions. When they replicate and reach a certain number of cells they activate a gene all at the same time. For many species of bacteria this is done"
Virginia,2012,Team:Virginia#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," of legal uncertainty about the largely court-defined patentability of synthetic  biology gene products. As explained above, the status quo will likely inhibit research, skew  research toward highly profitable domains that do not necessarily represent social need, and  dramatically inflate consumer costs. Although patents also provide an unambiguous method of  leveraging “copyleft” licenses, as demonstrated by the BioBricks Foundation (Rai & Boyle,  2007), there is reason to conclude that coexistence of such a commons with the rest of the patent  system will not produce substantially better innovation outcomes (Torrance & Tomlinson, 2009).
Abolition of Gene Patents
Recent polls indicate abolishing gene patents is probably the most generally popular  alternative, representing a near-majority of the public and about twice the number in favor of  keeping the current system as it is (Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News, 2012).  Industry intensely claims, however, that patents are necessary to their innovation. Although it  might appease opposition groups, making gene sequences unpatentable subject matter without  also providing an alternative system would likely promote a spillover from patents to other forms  of intellectual property protection, since genetic material in synthetic biology is formally  susceptible not only to patent enclosure, but also to copyright and trademark (Torrance, 2010).  Especially in biomedical applications, some form of financial incentive is necessary to overcome  the extremely expensive process of clinical trials and regulatory approval, which complicates  simplistic analogy to innovation patterns in open source software development (Rai & Boyle,  2007).
Sui Generis Framework
Drafting sui generis (custom, one-of-a-kind) legislation for synthetic biology or  biotechnology more broadly may thus be justified. A strong argument can be made that patents  simply are conceptually inadequate structures for genetic information (Calvert, 2008), and that  this is a key internal link to effectively promoting socially useful research without exorbitant.  The BioBricks Foundation constitution, which emphasizes standardization, openness, and social  responsibility, provides a model on which to build such a framework (Torrance, 2010). A  framework based on this model would ideally provide tailor-made solutions to synthetic  biology’s unique challenges of potentially costly regulatory hurdles to translation, ecological  risk, and interactional complexity while acknowledging its unique research requirements.  However, the process of drafting such legislation is likely to be long, difficult, and uncertain (Rai & Boyle, 2007).

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#modeling#qs_-_-_TEXT.html," enzyme Enz
dEnz
Degradation rate of enzyme Enz
αB
Production rate of metabolite B
dB
Degradation rate of metabolite B
Kd
Parameter of the Michaelis-Menten function modeling the action of enzyme Enz on the substrate, metabolite A, in order to produce metabolite B
n
Hill coefficient for the Hill function modeling the activation of the transcription of enzyme Enz with metabolite A as inducer
KA
Activation concentration for the Hill function modeling the activation of the transcription of enzyme Enz with metabolite A as inducer
Parameters are not well-known.
Deterministic Model
We derived this model doing the following assumptions:
Assumption 1
The induction of the promoter PA by A is supposed to follow an Hill function.
Assumption 2
The enzyme-based reaction from A to B is supposed to follow a Michaelis-Menten function.
$$\begin{align} \frac{d[A]}{dt} &= \alpha_A - d_{A} [A] \\ \frac{d[Enz]}{dt} &= \alpha_{Enz} \frac{[A]^n}{K_{A}^n + [A]^n} - d_{Enz} [Enz] \\ \frac{d[B]}{dt} &= \alpha_B \frac{[Enz] [A]}{K_d + [A]} - d_{B} [B]  \end{align}$$
Application to our project
Populations of bacteria will grow into a medium, which provides them metabolite A. The metabolite B will serve as communicating signal, like LasAHL or LuxAHL. It will be an input for the logic construct. As soon as metabolite B is being made available to the cell, the cell will produce the input for the logic construct.
Moreover, one type of cell will produce B as output. Therefore, the output of the logic gate signal will correspond to the production (or absence of production) of the enzyme Enz, so that the A contained in the medium can be transformed to B. Enz will play the same role as LasI or LuxI in our original model.
We separate the promoter activating the production of the enzyme with the production of the enzyme itself. Moreover, cells sense B and want to produce B. In our modules, we have to remplace equations in the sensing module and in the production module.
Sensing Module
For example, B would induce the production of the integrase, Bxb1.

Small presentation to give the other teammembers an update in modeling. Good remark of instructor on our model, we made a mistake in the working of LuxR-AHL induction/inhibition. Brainstorm on how to put modeling on the wiki. Brainstorm on how to make an introduction movie for iGEM jamboree.
wednesday 8th of September
Made corrections to description of modeling. Wiki division for modeling is finished by designers. We will put a first version of the model on the wiki soon, although this should still be updated with the LuxR/AHL complex. Thank you, designteam, for making the modeling page, ready for us!
thursday 9th of September
Worked on the full model today, included the LuxR/HSL complex. The iGEM-team of 2008 KULeuven also used it in their system, so it was just copy/pasting. The antifreeze and cell death descriptions are corrected for a second time. Two slides for jamboree in Amsterdam are prepared.

Stanley is doing the part with the fosmids. and Divya will work on  the Flp plasmids.. silver stuff is not workin out.. so tomek n deepika are lookin for other protocols..  tomek also spoke to eugene on Friday .. he offered some advice n help.. so they are going to  try out some new stuff this week..
no news from the visa..
some students have been registered for the jamboree.. travel and  stay have to be looked  for.. we are considering youth hostels.. and also couch surfing as a last resort..
daniel made a new and nice wiki template.. we will have a wiki meeting today.. so if  anyone is around and wants to contribute to the wiki.. please come to the pc pool.. if u  �� dont find me/ daniel der.. jus call me.. cos the venue for the wiki meeting is not fixed..
other imp deadlines.. 2nd oct - late registration. 21st oct - submission of parts to the regsitry.
hope to c u guys at the wiki meetin today.. if not we meet as usual tomo.. at 5pm.. 2nd  floor kitchen..
6th oct
although anja did not vote, the results would not change. summing up the final result: the people who will go to Boston are Divya, Tomek, Priyanka, Deepika and Arnab. Stanley  was ranked third overall, but was VISA-rejected twice as you all know - he is replaced by  Arnab.
Since Daniel has already booked his flight to Boston, we will try to add him to the list  of registered students so he can attend the jamboree at MIT. We will also make an  accommodation reservation for him together with the other 5 but he will not be refunded  by igem.
Ilaria and I will circulate more news as they appear.
Keep up the momentum, there's only 12 days left before the final set of deadlines for  wiki, project description, and parts submission.

safety concerns
As a software team, our team does not produce any typical biological safety or ethnic issues. However, we still take safety into account from as many aspects as possible:
1. Safety for programmers
Most of our work is mainly done in front of computers, which is not ergonomically to programmers as working in such environment may cause much exhaust and stress. Therefore, we made a series of regulations to guarantee they are not exposed to computers constantly for too long time and recreational area is within 10 meters. What is more, every time our programmers go to web labs, we make sure that there would be safety equipment as well as accompanies for them.
2. Safety for public
We are aware what our software will bring to teenagers or youngsters, and our software is ensured that no violent or sexual scene or content is included. We also did a lot of work to estimate and reduce the possible errors or faults users may encounter in the future.
3.Safety for software
To better protect our intellectual property rights, we have consulted IPRs centre of USTC in case of future problem. We will restrict the use of our software and we will apply for a patent later.
4.Safety for campus
We are quite aware when we perform our work or lecture in campus, and no disorder or turbulence has shown during in the above activity.
5.Other safety concerns
(i) Our team made no new BioBrick parts (or devices), and no safety issues happened from this. (ii)No biosafety group or committee protested our project.
Suggestions for future development of safety in dry lab.
Although a lot of work is done to ensure the safety of programmers in dry lab, a lot of work still remains to be done. And here we present some brief ideas on how we can develop the safety for programmers.
1. In many conditions, programmers in a dry lab have to share places with experiment operators due to limited space, which may lead to underlying health problems. Therefore, we suggest that strict rules should be made to provide independent space for programmers.
2. We take it for granted that not only safety for programmers, but the safety for intellectual property should be taken into consideration. Thus we suggest that all codes and other achievement should be granted with copyrights before sharing.

When we talk about internal clock, we actually refer to the circadian rhythm of higher animals and plants. Sensing the cycling environmental factors (light and temperature, etc.), circadian clock allows organism to behave accordingly and reguarly. This year, we develop a plug-in for microbes, a system that can build up an internal clock for microbes and guide them to live regularly as well as to work efficiently. Also, we could insert this system into dangerous strains and endue life span, they are doomed to die before causing any biohazard. Flip units based on recombinase system are introduced in our system.

Academy for Talented Youth
At the end of the summer we had the opportunity to be a part of another event at the university, as SDU was visited by the Academy for Talented Youth . We presented our presentation and had an extra focus on bioethics - and we had a really good discussion with them. We then supervised them in the laboratory.
Other talks
Symposion
As a good way of getting more feedback we held a presentation at Symposion - a philosophical association at SDU . The audience were composed of professors in philosophy, students from philosophy and other students who found it interesting. There were an almost hour long discussion with lots of good constructive critique and advices for our human practices. Their ideas and arguments had a big influence on our writings on bioethics and philosophy of science. They gave us ideas to other forms of arguments in bioethics, e.g. the religious arguments. They also gave us the idea of ""Track-record"" for a way of handeling the Precautionary Principle.
OldGEM
In September we had the amazing opportunity to meet with the previously iGEM teams from SDU. We held our presentation and they gave so much feedback that it filled 3 pages in notes! The feedback was a very welcomed gift that we used for adjusting our presentation. Otherwise than that, it was a lot of fun meeting the old teams and hearing their pointers on our project. They also gave us a little pep talk, which we appreciated!
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
The day before we left for Boston we had the opportunity to present our project for the whole Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BMB) . This event was our rehearsel of the presentation, which we will bring with us in Boston. We are hoping that our presentation will inspire other students to apply for next year's iGEM competition.
The media
SDU made an informational video about us and our project, which got featured at their facebook page and on youtube. It was so much fun recording it and we had a strict focus on showing a sense of humor and making our project understandable and relatable to the public. Hopefully this video will inspire other students to apply for next year’s iGEM team at SDU.

Nade Sritanyaratana - Student Member
Nade Sritanyaratana
Nade Sritanyaratana is a 4th year undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley. He is majoring in Bioengineering with a concentration in imaging, and hopes to apply for a PhD graduate program in the upcoming year. Beyond imaging, his academic interests include Biomechanics; signals and systems; circuit analysis; systems biology; and linear optimization.
His prior research experience consists of working with bioengineering professor Steven Conolly in the Summer and Fall of 2007. During that summer, he designed a coil helmet with an induced Maxwell magnetic field . This magnetic coil could be worn on the head and activated to generate small magnetic waves, soothing the wearer. Nicknamed the “Happy Helmet”, it was designed to non-invasively treat the bipolar-depressed via magnetic stimulation. Once fully developed, the helmet was to cost a hundred-fold less than an fMRI , the current primary treatment to bipolar depression.
This summer Nade is working full-time with the iGEM 2008 Cal Computational Team. This is his first time using Java. Prior to Java, his programming experience included an introductory C++ class in the 9th grade and MATLAB experience for three years in Berkeley. He has had prior experience with computational modeling in general; last year Nade worked with LabVIEW for his introductory class to signals and systems. Last fall he graphically modeled a growing brain tumor with ADINA for his Biomechanics class, and later based his main Biofluid mechanics project on the dynamics of a atherosclerotic artery using a computational model generated by COMSOL.
Matthew Johnson - Student Member
Matthew L.E. Johnson
Matthew Johnson is currently starting up his senior year at the University of California, Berkeley.  He is a Bioengineering major focusing on cell & tissue engineering, with a passionate interest in regenerative science and synthetic biology.  He is also enthusiastic about nanotechnology, BioMEMS, molecular biology, product design, economics, and writing.
Matt has lofty ambitions, and thinks that applied science is the key to solving many of life's problems, maybe even including the big one at the end of it.  He is very interested in how bioengineering and synthetic biology can be used to improve living conditions for people all over the world, whether through novel medical treatments, cheaper, cleaner sources of replenishable energy, or the development of heartier and healthier food crops.  Outside of science, one of of his biggest interests is taekwondo, which he started"

CCA_San_Diego,2017,Team:CCA San Diego#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,". While discussing gene therapy and consequently, GMOs, we emphasized how GMOs weren’t necessarily harmful and how they could be of great benefit to the future field of science. In the lab, we championed this viewpoint by greatly increasing our consideration of ethical concerns in our experiment procedures and obtaining results.  When introducing our project to other iGEM groups and professional companies, we made sure that we always included our ethical concerns into consideration when discussing possible improvements for our project. These ethical concerns were the forefront of our collaborations with the other teams and companies. For more information on the Bioethics Seminar, click here.
STEM Days
The results of the STEM days were the implementation of what we learned throughout our project. Survey results helped us realize that we had to increase public knowledge about synthetic biology and thus, we modified our project to be applicable to a wider field of application. Before we conducted these STEM Days, we only sought to engineer a bacteria that would degrade extremely specific compounds; however, after the STEM Days, we were aware that if we wanted our project product to be prevalent in the field of synthetic biology, we enlarged the significance of our bacteria to degrade PAHs in crude oil, and not just in the laboratory. Furthermore, because so many people were unaware of synthetic biology in their scientific community, we made sure that whenever we presented our project to children, we did so in order that they could understand the basic concepts of our project. For more information on Stem Days, click here.
iGEM Summer Camp
We have created two camps to educate students (1 week environmental-genetics as well as a physics and applied physics) on the science that is necessary to do effective and safe labwork, perform lab techniques safely, and apply concepts to understand the world around them. For more information on our camp, click here .
Beach Cleanup
Having seen the effects of chemical pollutants on our beloved beaches firsthand during the beach cleanup, our team sought to tailor our project so that it would minimally affect the environment, including natural resources and animals, around us. Before this event, we mainly focused on the degradation of simple compounds, such as fluorene, phenanthrene, and naphthalene. After this event, upon discovering the deleterious effect of oil in the marine ecosystem, we decided to shift our focus to degrading crude oils and thus, to develop a bacteria that could degrade harmful substances of a greater scale. Philippe, our head of Lab, bought crude oil to test how our engineered bacteria would degrade this substance. For the results, click here.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

It triggers a sensor bacterium, Vibrio harveyi, which in turn activates the effector cell (the yeast Pichia pastoris). The later eradicates Vibrio species by producing innovative antimicrobial peptides from crocodile.
Genesis of our molecular strategy
While we were defining our strategy, a cholera epidemia started unfortunately to expand in Yemen 7 . This terrible situation led us to focus on this problematic as it appears that current solutions are not efficient enough to deal with this situation. The bacteria V. cholerae, agent of the cholera disease, is usually found in water and infects more than a million people each year.
Recently, academic research groups started to focus on synthetic biology in order to find a way to deal with V. cholerae 8 , 9 . Additionally, some iGEM teams tried also to deal with the challenging detection of V. cholerae 10 , 11 , 12 , using E. coli. They based their strategy on implementing the quorum sensing detection pathway of V. cholerae into E. coli to activate reporter gene expression. However these projects, no matter how clever and brilliant they might be, were not successful enough, likely due the complexity of introducing a large amount of DNA information in a single microorganism. This is the reason why we built a synthetic consortium of microorganisms. Using multiple microorganisms instead of one will allow us to choose existing species that are already specialized for their tasks, as well as reducing the amount of necessary modification to set up the required functions. The information processing steps have been split in two different microorganisms: V. harveyi as the sensor and P. pastoris as the effector, with the system triggered by V. cholerae presence.
A microbial consortium chassis against cholera
The whole synthetic consortium is composed of three microorganisms. The first one should be V. cholerae but for safety reason, we engineered an E. coli strain to produce a V. cholerae molecular signal. The second bacteria required a quorum sensing pathway to detect V. cholerae signal. V. harveyi naturally possesses such pathway and we engineered it  to make it able to sense V. cholerae. We also engineered V. harveyi to make it producing a second molecule messenger. The third microorganism, P. pastoris was engineered to detect this messenger and produce in response the secretion of a high amount of antimicrobial peptides that can lyse V. cholerae.
We finally created an artificial consortium chassis to deal with cholera disease."

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
Figure 1: Petridishes piling up in the lab.
Throughout the project we did a lot of different experiments in the lab. To do this we needed to know what and how to do the these. For this purpose we used standard operating procedures (SOPs). All the SOPs are written by either us or some of the previous SDU iGEM Teams in collaboration with minimum one person with experience in the field of the given procedure. sometimes optimation of these SOPs is necessary, but never without asking a supervisor first. It was hereby secured that all persons was following the same procedures in the lab.
Below is listed all the SOPs used by the 2015 SDU iGEM Team:
SDU iGEM 2015 SOP0001 - Primer design for gene Knock Out (KO) in pathogenic E.coli

Bielefeld-Germany,2010,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#References_-_-_TEXT.html," A. tumefaciens. The transcription procedure in E. coli is very similar to A. tumefaciens but not complete homolog. In E. coli the rpoA gene - encoding the α-subunit of RNA polymerase in A. tumefaciens - is not present but essential for the transcription of a virB promoter-driven genes ( Lohrke SM et al., 1990 ) For this reason it was necessary to subclone a modified virG gene that is capable to be trancribed by the E. coli expression system.
Yong-Chul et al. (2004) described VirG mutants that are capable of expressing the virB promoter-driven genes in E. coli without the requirement for the RpoA from A. tumefaciens, suggesting that the virG mutants are able to interact with the transcription system of E. coli ( Yong-Chul J et al., 2004 ). In VirG the amino acid at position 56 is likely to play a key role in the interaction with the RpoA of E. coli.  Regarding to Yong-Chul J et al. (2004) we used virG mutants, with amino acid substitutions of G56V and I77V that are capable of activating vir genes in E. coli in response to inducer acetosyringone in a VirA-dependent manner.
Read out system
Firefly Luciferase
We are using luciferase as the read out system. The luciferase was originally extracted from the firefly Photinus pyralis. It is one of the best studied and characterized read out systems. The luciferase enzyme catalyses the chemical reaction from its substrate luceferin to oxyluciferin and light ( De Wet et al. 1986 ). Figure 8 shows the reaction in detail.
We used luciferase as the read out system because it causes only slight negligible noise, hence the signal to noise ration is excellent.
Figure 8: Firefly luciferase reaction (De Wet et al.1986)
Output-signal amplification by Sensitivity Tuner implementation
Using a standard, inducible promoter with reporter system often results in weak reporter expression. So difficulties in quantification can occur. The quantification can be enhanced by an amplification of the transcription rate of the desired reporter genes. Such an amplification can be realized by using a so called sensitivity tuner device. This takes place as promoter induction upregulates a phage activator, which binds to a phage promoter upstream of a reporter gene. As result, a PoPs input"

We added IPTG for induction of the Mg-chelatase enzyme components from the Mg-cheletase plasmid. This would ensure that the lac operon was induced and transcribed the genes necessary for the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway. We added AMP as the cells were grown with ampicillin resistance, ensuring that only the cells we wanted grew and any others that were present were eradicated.
After incubation for the week, we analysed the colour changes of our colonies visually from a creamy, opaque colour to a red colour due to the presence of PPIX. We resuspended each sample and took 50μl and added 450μl of methanol and centrifuged on high speed. We measured spectrofluorescence of each of the supernatants at wavelengths of 404nm for PPIX and 420nm for Mg-PPIX. Data was obtained for both wavelengths and graphs were produced plotting wavelengths 620nm (for CPIII) and 630nm (for PPIX) on GraphPad Prism. For the Mg-chelatase plasmid induced with IPTG, we produced a graph showing the emission values at an excitatory wavelength of 590nm to generate a graph showing MgPPIX.

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get

We explained the contents on the posters and answered the questions proposed by the viewer. We shared our opinions about transgenic technique and accepted their advice on the exhibition. “I got an objective and all-round view on GM products,” said one viewer.
We decided that the theme of the exhibition was “transgenic and human health” and the main contents went about disease therapy, biologic pharmacy, disease detection and environment improvement, corresponding to the projects of the teams. Accomplishing the designing and printing of posters a week ahead and the putting-up and arrangement of the exhibition one day ahead, we prepared the exhibition carefully.
In the following days, we arranged team members from each team to be responsible for the maintenance and explanation of the exhibition. On the last exhibition day, we withdrew the posters and cleaned the exhibition hall together.
We SCU-WestChina also introduced our project in the exhibition besides the knowledge about GM. We hoped that the viewers could know more about hyperuricemia, as well as our project, so that they could share their ideas and suggestions with us. What’s more, we handed out the handbooks on hyperuricemia to the public coming to the library. It’s honor to us if the public can know something about hyperuricemia and the GM.
It meant a lot to us to hold the exhibition on “transgenic and human health”. Firstly, we introduced the public the benefits brought by GM products, in which way the public can know about more aspects of GM, so that they can consider it in a dialectical and rational way instead of a one-sided, extreme one. Secondly, we popularized the knowledge of hyperuricemia, which made contribution to the awareness and importance of hyperuricemia. Thirdly, optimistic feedback and advice on our project were collected. Fourthly, this exhibition enhanced the communication and cooperation between the iGEM teams. You know, the exhibition wouldn’t have succeeded without wonderful collaboration and teamwork.

NCTU_Formosa: Collaborations
Collaboration
The New iGEM team- TCFSH
     Since April 14th, NCTU_Formosa started to introduce experiments which are related to iGEM to the science-gifted class of Taichung First Senior High School(TCFSH). Gradually, the background knowledge of synthetic biology was adequate, then the cogitation of combination to engineering and biology was shared, the core of the gene regulation, the design of biobricks was taught. Also, we introduce previous projects from NCTU_Formosa, hope to give them the prospect of the competition.
     In the last semester, the instructor of NCTU_Formosa, Pro. Wen-Liang Chen invited the gifted students from TCFSH who decided to learn about biology to our lab. NCTU_Formosa then gave them a series"
Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," into contact with the liquid sample causing the liquid to bridge the gap between the two fibre optic ends. The gap is controlled to both 1 and 0.2 mm paths.
Initiate a spectral measurement using the operating software on the connected PC by pressing the “blank” button to blank the Nanodrop. A pulsed xenon flash lamp will provide the light source and the spectrophotometer analysis the light after passing through the sample. After the measurement the data is logged in an archive file on the PC.
When the blanking is done, open the sampling arm and wipe the sample from both the upper and lower pedestals using a soft laboratory wipe. Wiping prevents sample carryover in successive measurements for samples varying by more than 1,000-fold in concentration.
Pipette 1 ml your DNA sample and press the “Measure” button to determine the amount of DNA in your sample.
Remove the DNA solution from the measurement pedestal and clean the lid and the pedestal with deionized water.
Agarose gel electrophoresis
Linear and double-stranded DNA molecules can move through a gel matrix with a velocity that is proportional to the logarithm of their molecular weight (MW). Therefore, the MW of unknown DNA species can be determined by comparing their electrophoretic mobility with that of DNA molecules having known MWs. DNA molecules with lengths ranging from 0.5 kbp to 25 kbp can be separated using agarose gels.
Voltage
The velocity with that DNA molecules move through a gel matrix depends on the applied voltage. It is important to know that the velocity of large DNA molecules increases more rapidly than that of small DNA molecules. As a consequence, large molecules can be separated from each other with a high accuracy at low voltages.
The electrophoresis buffer
Most gel systems are based on Tris-Acetate-EDTA (TAE) and Tris-Borat-EDTA (TBE) buffers. The electrophoretic mobility of DNA molecules is quite similar in both buffers. However, the buffering capacity of the TBE buffer is significantly higher. Therefore, it is recommended to use TBE buffer for mini-gels that run at a high voltage.
The DNA conformation
Supercoiled, nicked and linear DNA molecules, having the same molecular mass move with different velocities through the gel matrix. Because supercoiled DNA has the smallest hydrodynamic radius, these DNA species show the highest electrophoretic mobility.

From Hyukjin Ko, 14th of September
I will visit Professor Choi on Monday and discuss final decisions.
We need to amplify the required genes, and grow cells to extract genomic DNA. Additional plates are also needed.
I will explain more about the details on Tuesday, 5 p.m.
It is mandatory that all members attend.
From Hyukjin Ko, 11th of September
Now that's what I call useful information.
Way to go, Young.
From Young Byun, 1oth of September
I just read a paper on YodA protein!!!
It's a cadmium specific protein.
It is normally kept at a low level, but when Cadmium is induced to the cell, the concentration goes up 50 times.
The beautiful aspect is that it is very specific for cadmium and no other metals.
School festival is coming up.
From Young Byun, 10th of September
I found this paper using LazZ and lux to detect mercury by attatching them to  mercury promoter PmerTPAD and
Cu promotoer PcoE.
Cu showed gradual response to concentration, but mercury only showed threshold response.
I think Lux is a good tool for detection we could try out on our experiment.
Fund raising is not going well.
The big companies are not cooperative either.
Sigh.

I think cadmium sensing protein CadC could be used.
I think they are not included in the iGEM distribution, but it works in E.coli.

BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"mg/L salicylic acid was added to the media, the bacteria showed a peak level of red florescence intensity (induction time: 4h). The florescence intensity had not risen significantly when the concentration of salicylic acid was further increased. Meanwhile, as the concentration of SA increased, growth of the bacteria seemed to be repressed. We also found that cultures incubated in the 96-well plates did not show significant difference between control and experiment, but visible difference was observed when they were incubated in 10ml tubes. This probably due to the different growing environment of E. coli, indicating that the induction procedure of salicylic acid needs relatively large incubating space.
In conclusion, salicylic acid induction needs larger space, while emrR is highly sensitive when binding with SA, for that the peak level of expression is reached under very low SA concentration. However, the peak level is indeed not very large, which would possibly make the growth promoting effect not obvious, for a quite low level of SA would enable the expression of GDH keeps at a constant (peak) speed, which is quite low as well. Consequently, the harvest of SA would not obviously increase. Possible optimizations may focus on these following aspects: 1. Since the key problem is the low expression level of the growth promoting factor (GDH) and realizing that the RBS of emrR binding promoter from E. coli genome is not efficient, we could replace it with another RBS with higher ribosome binding efficiency. 2. Low expression level may ought to the fact that the circuit shown in Fig 16 is sensitive to salicylic acid. Thus, increase the level of expression of emrR could possibly decrease the sensitivity.
Salicylic acid does play the role of launching emrR binding promoter, but the expression level of downstream gene is too low after that, which cannot be applied to the whole gene loop, and optimization of the gene loop is needed. Direct optimization of the coding reading frame to optimize protein structure is the most fundamental method, but it takes long time and has a low success rate. Therefore, we intend to change the RBS of emrR binding promoter to increase the translation speed of mRNA. RBS B0034 was introduced on the original loop ultimately (Figure 17).
The expression of the optimized vector was significantly increased compared to that using the wild promoter and RBS. In order to perform repeated experiments more efficiently, we sent the plasmid dry powder to HBUT-China and UCAS-China for different experiments. The experimental results of HBUT-China showed that"

Introduction
Unlike proteins, nonribosomal peptides are not synthesized through translation, but rather by sequential condensation of amino acids by large multimodular enzymes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) [1,2]. In fact, it is these complex pattern of condensation of amino acids that attributes to the activity of these compounds. NRPSs do not rely on an external template for synthesis of their products. They can be divided up in modules that each are responsible for incorporating one additional amino acid onto the growing peptide chain much like an assembly line (Figure MISSING#) [3]. At the end of the assembly line, the growing peptide is released as a linear peptide or through cyclization.
Figure #MISSING NRPS are highly modular. Tyrocidine Synthetase (tycA-C) consists of ten modules, two epimerization domains, and thioesterase (TE) domain. Tyrocidine precursors are assembled one-by-one in an assembly line mannar. The TE domain cyclises the tyrocidine upon releasing it from the active site.
Each module, with the exception of the initiation, consists of at least three domains. These domains are responsible for activating the monomer (adenylation (A) domain), holding the activated monomoer (peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain), and amino acid condensation (condensation (C) domain). The C-domain is lacking in initation modules and the terminal module contains an additional required domain responsible for termination and release of the product called thioesterase (TE) domain [2].

The adenylation domains are responsible for activating and attaching the amino acid mon"

Description
What's the problem?
Our project deals with an everyday problem described by the following scenario: You want to enjoy a refreshing shower in the morning, but your hairy roommate clogged the drain again?  You would like to have a relaxed bubble bath after a long day, but there are bad odors coming out of the pipe system?
The general practice now:
You try the ‘hot water method’ to flush the drain…  nothing happens.
You remember what your mother taught you, so you put a fancy mix of vinegar, baking soda and some magic into the drain… a mysterious creature arises, but nothing else happens.
In the end there is just one thing left – you put the nasty chemical mixture of the stinky cleaning agent down the drain. The corrosive cloud disappears and you can finally take your shower… still trying not to breath in the acrid fumes.
Pipe clogging and closure occurs in every household as well as in industry.          Various components contribute to the pipe closure, such as fat and hair.          Commercial chemical pipe cleaners contain aggressive substances, which are harmful to the environment and health and also can lead to pipe breaks.          Biological alternatives (purified enzymes) have been researched for years, without reaching the efficiency of chemical cleaners.          In addition, the purification of the enzymes is very complex and cost intensive.
Our solution
We pursue a system-biological solution which is based on an intact microbial system.          Inspired by different interesting projects we decided to develope a keranolytic Escherichia coli.          The projects of past iGEM-teams were part of our investigation too and we are already co-working with iGEM-team OLS_Canmore 2015/2016 to exchange information.          We would like to use the knowledge of these groundworks to develop a new type of enzymatic cleaning agent by complementing and combining ideas out of different scientific sources.          To differ from other projects we are aiming to engineer Escherichia coli to express enzymes like esterases, lipases and keratinases into the medium.          Due"

UST_Beijing,2016,Team:UST Beijing#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," combination of bacteria culture over a wide range of concentrations (A620: 0.01-0.9).
The enzymatic efficiency in E.coli was standardized by calculating (A450-1.5*A620)/A620.
The result displayed that the concentration of PNP decreased when the concentration of lactose was increased. Since the similarities of structure between lactose and PNPG, high concentration lactose may pose a competitive inhibitory effect on PNPG. There was an optimum concentration of arabinose as inducer, so less enzymes would be expressed if the concentration of arabinose exceed optimum concentration or is lower than it. The process of bacterial metabolism uses sugar in each well, so that lactose would be less competitive, then enzymes would begin to decompose PNPG.
Plasmid design ( BBa_K207200 )
In the double-plasmid system, as a proof of principle, β-glucosidase was expressed under lactose and arabinose. However, T7 RNA polymerase inhibited the growth of E.coli.  Next we designed an arabinose-inducing composite Biobrick by replacing the E.coli K12 araC operon B.A.D. genes with our synthetic β-glucosidase gene. We connected three gene fragments together on the basis of principle of ara operon. One of the gene fragments can produce araC protein, a type of ara binding protein—inhibiting the activity of pBAD gene. pBAD gene controls the expression of araC gene to one direction and regulates araB, araA, araD genes to another direction. The last gene fragment is a DNA sequence that can express β-glucosidase.
In this part，we borrowed the original sequence of araC and pBAD(pC) from the genome sequence of E. coli K12. Considering the direction of transcription on 5'→3', we replaced the sequences of araB、araA and araD with reverse complementary sequence of β-glucosidase. Terminal J61048 and B0015 were added at the end of coding sequence of araC and β-glucosidase. The prefix and suffix were necessary of parts for biobrick ends.
Plasmid verification

According to the latest research from Chinese Academy of Science published on                                 ACS Environmental Science and Technology, China used 162,000 tons of antibiotic                                 substances for human(48%) and animal(52%) in 2013, which is tenfold usage of USA and                                 antibiotic substances in high concentration can be detected from many river basins that                                 may potentially harmful to public health and environment. In their professional                                 evaluation, antibiotics can be detected in all rivers in China in different degree.
Among these rivers, the Pearl River Basin in South China and Hai River Basin in North China received the highest antibiotics emission. More than 36 common antibiotic                                 substances were discovered in these rivers, one of them, for example, in the Pearl River                                 Basin, amoxicillin was found at 3384 ng/L and fluprofen at 2867 ng/L. Though lack of                                 standard ranking on antibiotic contamination, according to environmental scientists                                 from CAS, antibiotic substances concentration more than 1000 ng/L is relatively                                 extremely high, based on Europe Union Standard.
Now, many technology including ELISA, Delvotest, HPLC-MS/MS, CE and Quantum Dot are able                                 to detect antibiotic concentration in river sample, however much of their have much                                 deficiencies, including:
Not portable, many big and automatic equipment are indispensable for concentration                                     detection.
Complicated Routine, which requires trained personnel to conduct experiment. However,                                     facing that large scale contamination, complicated routine and trained personnel                                     cannot be satisfied at all districts, so do it in many developing and undeveloped                                     countries and districts.
Recent technology is still not sensitive enough and sometimes time consuming.
Hope with our project, antibiotics issues can be solved in an accelerated way.

Who is CACCI?
CACCI, called the same as Kathy, is a kind of constructed                                 bacteria for Characterization of Antibiotic Concentration based on                                     Chemotaxis and Interference.
Along with ROSE, CACCI embedded in SPRING will be used to detect antibiotic. Although,                                 the construction of ROSE will specifically tell the concentration of different antibiotics in the river samples, its feature is also deficiency: that is such strong                                 specificity may hurt extensive measurement. Besides, using traditional genetically                                 modified circuits to express report is still time-consuming, comparing with general                                 physical or chemical measurement approaches.

If the Evobody is binding the target protein and the proteins are folded correctly, the complex is exported into the periplasm due to the signal peptide, which is removed during the process (Blaudeck et al. 2001). That way, only bacteria with functional Evobody are able to export the beta-lactamase into the periplasm where it operates as a resistance to ampicillin.

As it turns out, they were keenly aware of the issues of microplastic shedding from washing synthetic textiles and were looking into potential solutions. This provided us with the opportunity of accomplishing what we set out to do - collaborating with an established organization that had the resources to radically improve the currently unsustainable situation. We conducted a market scan on different technologies that IKEA could implement in various stages of their product design that would decrease the release of microplastics from their synthetic materials.
Re-engineering synthetic textiles
Proactive solutions
Standardized testing methods
Proper disposing and recycling
Initially, we interviewed research groups working with the development and engineering of shedless synthetic fibers as well as businesses engaged in designing reactive solutions such as washing machine filters and special washing balls. Current disposing and recycling methods were also investigated, where would the consumer properly discard the caught microfibers? This allowed us to assess the existing complications in the development of proactive solutions. We found out that there are very limited options for shedless synthetic textiles and to make the situation even more complicated, noticeable ambiguity in how to measure and interpret data on synthetic shedding.
However, we were met by a very passionate community working tirelessly to develop sustainable solutions to the problem at hand. This inspired us to attempt to facilitate cooperation between the stakeholders by creating a channel through which they could communicate their ideas and share their thoughts, naturally within the boundaries of their intellectual properties. Thus, we concluded the project by gathering different stakeholders to jointly discuss the issue of microplastics together with IKEA. In attendance was representatives of IKEA, Environmental Enhancement, Ocean Clean Wash, Rozalia and Wexco Environmental.
The big difference in time zone wasn’t an obstacle for participating in the discussion. From the right we have Laura Díaz Sánchez from Plastic Soup foundation, Caroline Reid from IKEA. Brian Koski from Wexco Environmental, Blair Jollimore from Environmental Enhancement and Rachael Miller from Rozalia Project via skype.
To develop both short-term quick-fixes as well as long-term sustainable strategies, the expertise of every involved actor needs to be utilized. It is our conviction that this can best be achieved through cooperation and teamwork. Our hope is that the initial success of establishing a channel of communication between the different stakeholders will serve as an indicator of the willingness to collaborate and that this mindset will trickle down through the industry.

The Brown iGEM Lab is student-run and consists of five undergraduates. This year, the team split up to work on two projects. We begin our training in the Spring semester with a lab class in Synthetic Biology.  With the gracious support of the UTRA Program, Research at Brown, and several academic departments, we were given the opportunity to pursue our own ideas over the summer.  With the guidance of graduate mentors, faculty advisors, and synthetic biologists nationwide, our lab has split our efforts to pursue two distinct projects- one an electrical reporting system, and the other a threshold regulation network.  This is the latter.

Be conscious of what we talked about here, we hope that all iGEM members will develop judicious research ethics and achieve eloquent projects.
Laboratory Biosafety Guideline
In this section, we will talk about the fundamental guideline which WHO provides.This guideline shows researchers unique set of safety equipment, facility, and practices to conduct safe and sure experiments.
Biohazard Containment and Safety
The relative hazards of infective microorganisms are grouped by risk group (WHO Risk Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4).
Laboratory biosafety manual Third edition says as follows:
Risk Group 1 (no or low individual and community risk)
A microorganism that is unlikely to cause human or animal disease.
Risk Group 2 (moderate individual risk, low community risk)
A pathogen that can cause human or animal disease but is unlikely to be a serious hazard to laboratory workers, the community, livestock or the environment. Laboratory exposures may cause serious infection, but effective treatment and preventive measures are available and the risk of spread of infection is limited.
Risk Group 3 (high individual risk, low community risk)
A pathogen that usually causes serious human or animal disease but does not ordinarily spread from one infected individual to another. Effective treatment and preventive measures are available.
Risk Group 4 (high individual and community risk)
A pathogen that usually causes serious human or animal disease and that can be readily transmitted from one individual to another, directly or indirectly. Effective treatment and preventive measures are not usually available.
Laboratory facilities are designated as basic ? Biosafety Level 1, basic ? Biosafety Level 2, containment ? Biosafety Level 3, and maximum containment ? Biosafety Level 4. Biosafety level designations are based on a composite of the design features, construction, containment facilities, equipment, practices and operational procedures required for working with agents from the various risk groups.
Risk groups relate biosafety levels but do not “equate” to the biosafety level of laboratories designed to work with organisms in each risk group.
High risk groups require more rarefied composite of the design features, construction, containment facilities, equipment, practices and operational procedures. We mainly talk about BSL1 and BSL2 because it is uncommon for undergraduate students to handle the facilities above BSL 3.

Double transformation and InterLab study - Inoculation
Goal:
Transform both pdCas9 and pgRNA with anti-luxS into competent cells
InterLab study - inoculate colonies in LB-medium
Procedure:
Double transformation of pdCas9 and pgRNA with anti-luxS:
Both pdCas9(2) and pgRNA(2) with anti-luxS (isolated from day 11 – 05. July. 2018) were simultaneously transformed into competent cells (DH5α). The amount of added pdCas9(2) (5 μL) and pgRNA(2) with anti-luxS was 5 µL per/plasmid, and it was added to the same tube containing competent cells. The cells were plated on agar with both AMP and CM. A couple of steps were added at the end, and the purpose was to increase the cell concentration plated on agar, and probably increase the possibility of colony formation. The cell culture was therefore centrifuged for 3 minutes at 6800g, and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was then resuspended and cells were plated.
InterLab – Inoculation of colonies
A colony from each agar plate was inoculated in LB-medium (5 mL) with CM (5 μL). The cell cultures were incubated overnight at 37℃ with shaker.

This decision was further supported by our own literature research, as nebulizers would be able to be more efficient than any other device while having the lowest side effects associated to its use.

Handbook
When we started our Human Practices, it was hard for us to understand exactly what human practices entangled and what was required for a team’s human practices to be successful. We had to spend a lot of time just reading about the topic to know where and how to start.
During NiC, informational presentations were held, in these presentations human practices were emphasized and displayed as something many teams forget about, put too little energy and/on or starts too late with. From these presentations, we had the idea to make a clear, easily understood handbook for all new teams to consider in the beginning of their human practices. We also skyped with the iGEM team from Lund (a new iGEM team!) and introduced the idea of a HP manual.They confirmed the need for such a handbook by saying “That is a great idea and it would've helped us a lot in the beginning if we had such a manual!”.
We decided to base the handbook on the work of previous successful Human Practices teams. We sent out questionnaires and received answers from Stockholm 2016, OLS Canmore 2016, Imperial 2016, Groningen 2016, Bielefeld 2015, William and Mary 2015, UofC Calgary 2016, Cornell NY 2016, Paris Bettencourt 2016.
From these teams, we received very positive feedback about our idea:
Luis Suarez from Groningen “I think it is a great idea of you to start such a manual! Starting HP can be confusing and challenging.”
Rachelle Varga from Calgary “What a great idea! I’d be happy to answer your questions about the 2016 UofC_Calgary iGEM team”
Allison Bricknell George from Paris Bettencourt “It´s a good idea, please share the result when you're done with this!”
Thanks to these teams, we were able to complete a great handbook for all new iGEM teams, so everyone can succeed in their human practices!

Collaboration with other iGEM Plant Teams
The engineering of plant systems provides enormous potential benefits. Plants can be engineered to synthesize all kinds of bioproducts, from the simplest sugar to the most sophisticated recombinant antibody, on the large scale at extremely low cost. We would like to see more and more Plant projects in iGEM, so we decided to share our experiences with other Plant teams: The Cambridge-JIC and the NRP-UEA-Norwich teams. These are the outcomes of our collaboration:
New RFC with Cambridge and NRP-UEA-Norwich teams.
The Plant chassis presents specific features that engineers need to take into account: plants are multicellular organisms, with eukaryotic gene structure, making use of plant-specific regulatory regions and requiring special T-vectors for transformation, to mention only some of them. Consequently, general SynBio standards and repositories need certain adaptations to facilitate engineering with plant chassis.  To discuss the technical requirements of Plant Projects within iGEM and beyond, we have prepared a RFC document on Plant Standards in Synthetic Biology. We expect to discuss this document, together with the implications and perspectives of Plant Synthetic Biology in a Special Workshop that will be held during the 2014 Jamboree. You are all invited to assist!
Parts exchange and characterization:
We also collaborated by exchanging parts. NRP-UEA-Norwich provided us with their chromoproteins (AmilCP (Bba_K1467201) and AmilGFP (Bba_K1467202)) so we could test both our system and their parts as we both worked in the same plant chassis (Nicotiana benthamiana). With these parts our team developed two biosafety devices BBa_K1554004 and BBa_K1554005. In addition, the NRP-UEA iGEM Team also provided us with their"

01 June 2012,Discussion of the first lab results
As no important organizational matter was needed to be discussed, we mainly talked about the results of the labwork of the different groups. Group 1 will now start the screening of the transformants of group 2 for enhanced mobility. Group 2 will further analyze different promoter-vector combinations. Group 3 is now ready to perform the QuikChange PCR!
After the meeting we discussed the paper from Looger et al., 2003, Nature. In this paper they used a structure based computational method to redesign receptor-ligand binding. If we had the software this method would be beneficial for us, too!

Anna presented her designs for the logo of our iGEM team and we liked them a lot! On our homepage you can now admire the design which got the most votes.
30 April 2012,We inspect the laboratory at the Max Planck campus.
Today we had the first lab inspection with Steffen Frey after their so called ""demolab"" achieved the S1 security status! We are very thankful that the MPI allows us to use it for our project and for all the material support they give us. After the inspection Steffen gave us an S1 security instruction and we discussed some points concerning the undisturbed labwork flow. For some unexpected problems concerning the topic of borrowing equipment of the university without working on the university´s grounds had occurred, Heinz equipped us with some material and we were able to pour the first swimming agar plates!
26 April 2012,Weekly meeting: PCR-Lecture from Heinz.
In this meeting Simon presented to us the special iGEM requirements, e.g. the structure of the parts that are handed in and told us about the iGEM distribution kit which should arrive soon. For Mrs. Ute Ludwig, the person responsible for the equipment in the practical courses at the university, kindly granted all our wishes regarding the lab supplies, we discussed the transport of the material.

Newcastle,2018,Team:Newcastle#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"ie bags                     from Eppendorf! We had previously decided that the naringenin flavonoid would most likely be the most successful, therefore looked into utilising parts from the naringenin operon previously used by TU Darmstadt 2014 iGEM team. We also Skyped Daniel Sachs, a member of the TU Darmstadt iGEM team to hear his advice on what worked well with the operon and with which promoters. Finally, we codon optimised one of the gblocks for the operon (TAL) and ordered all the segments with their corresponding RBS’s from IDT.2.
Week commencing: 16/07/2018
This week was full of action. The architects in the team 3D printed a cold deck for the Opentrons OT-2 and laser cut accompanying trays to hold test tubes. Now that we have the cold deck we can manufacture trays to hold lots of different apparatus increasing the number and complexity of experiments we can carry out on the Opentrons. In addition, we had a meeting with Martyn Dade-Robertson from the School of Architecture, Planning & Landscape; he spoke to us about the importance of finding a context in which to situate our human practices, once we have this it will provide the design parameters necessary to progress. Finally, stencils were made for the 'Alternative Roots' logo enabling us to tag any hardware we build.
Some of the team also travelled to Munich this week for the European iGEM meet up. Those who attended throughly enjoyed liasing with other iGEM teams as well as the event organisers and speakers. The team's poster was on display at the meetup which gathered some interest around our project as well as many questions and suggestions for improvement which have been duly noted by the team for further consideration. Potential collaborations were also sought after in Munich.
Lab work for the chemotaxis assays commenced with trial runs using the DH5α E. coli control in order to test  the protocol. It was noted from these attempt that the concentration of naringenin was too high as the plates  did not show signs of growth for 2 days; after which, signs of growth were minimal.  The concentration was diluted to 100µM and 50µM for future trials to see if this would overcome the issue. We also Designed forward and reverse primers for each of the four segments, for detection that the operon had been transformed.

SDU-Denmark,2015,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour52_-_-_TEXT.html," the GCN4 yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) protein was fused to the T18 and T25 domains (T18-Zip+T25-Zip). Leucine zippers are known to interact by forming homodimers and if the system indeed works, their interaction will lead to functional complementation between the T18 and T25 domains. This leads to the synthesis of cAMP, and thus by using a cAMP-induced reporter system, one can observe whether or not there is an interaction.
When working with the bacterial two-hybrid system, it is necessary to use a strain with a non-functioning or absent adenylate cyclase, cyaA. For this purpose we constructed the Escherichia coli K12-strain, MG1655 ΔcyaA. We also used the cyaA-deficient E. coli K12-strain BTH101 (MC1061-derived). This was for the purpose to exploit the lacZ-derived reporter system encoded in this strains chromosome. The lacZ gene encodes a β-Galactosidase which is positively controlled by cAMP. Our goal was to use the RFP reporter system in the MG1655 ΔcyaA-strain.  Due to difficulties with RFP reporter system, this control experiment was carried out in the BTH101-strain.

of plasmids were sequentially co-transformed into the BTH101-strain.
As expected, the results only displayed complementation between T18 and T25 when the leucine zipper was fused to both of the domains.  These results infers that our constructs function as expected, and that they can be used to detect protein-protein interactions. This indicates that the system can be used to screen for peptide aptamers. If we wanted to use the RFP reporter system instead, the same experiment could be conducted and red colonies would be observed instead of blue. The transformations should, however, be plated on LB plates without X-gal.

Welcome to the 2017 BostonU HW Project: MARS
Microfluidics is often an overlooked tool in the field of synthetic biology because designing and using microfluidic chips requires specialized knowledge. Our project, MARS (Microfluidic Applications for Research in Synbio), aims to increase the accessibility of low-cost and easy to use microfluidic systems for the synthetic biology community.
The typical design, build and fabrication flow utilized in microfluidics requires significant intellectual investment, technical agility, a high startup cost and time investment. The 2016 iGEM Hardware Team, Neptune , in conjunction with CIDAR Lab created an alternative software workflow tackling design and manufacturing barriers. What our team focused on is the implementation stage of this workflow, ensuring that synthetic biologists are able to effectively use the tools provided to them.
The main goals of MARS are to:
Increase accessibility of Microfluidics
Design chips that are relevant to the day to day protocols in synthetic biology labs which can be used together to perform more complex protocols
Create and provide a standardized method of evaluating chip functionality
These three goals led to the creation of the three main branches of MARS: Microfluidics 101, the MARS Repository and Fluid Functionality. Using this end to end system, microfluidics can become a more accessible and practical tool for synthetic biologists to integrate into their labs.
Use the graphic and images below to navigate the three branches of MARS and get a more in-depth look at what we have created over the summer.

The mathematical modeling theory outlined on this page was integrated in the creation of our application, to ensure reliable results.
Relating Relative Promoter Units to Transcription Rate
Relating Relative Promoter Units to Transcription Rate
Assumption:
The first major assumption, is declaring ""Promoter Activity"" , to be a direct model of transcription rate. ""Promoter Activity"" is the number of RNAP molecules that clear the final base pair of a promoter (with units of [PoPS]  = Polymerase per second).
Thus,
Where,
Thus, through simple substitution:
The modelling can further be simplified through a series of assumptions:
1) GFP expressed from test and standard promoters, have equivalent maturation rates, as they mature under the same conditions:
2) Since both the test and standard promoters are carried on the same plasmid backbone, assume they have the same average copy number:
3) Since promoters have been standardized to have identical transcription initiation sites (predicted) and identical sequences downstream of the site, we expect them to produce the same mRNA sequences.
Therefore,
Expect transcribed mRNA to be identical, implying mRNA degradation rates are equivalent:
Thus, we assume translational rates of immature GFP from some mRNA are equal:
4) Assume that immature GFP is stable. Therefore, protein degradation is negligable compared to dilution due to cell growth.
Thus:
Thus,
and if
Then,
Therefore, we assume the difference between growth rates of cells containing the test promoter construct and cells containing the standard promoter construct, is negligible compared to the maturation rate of GFP.
Thus, for the purposes of QGEM's modelling;
Relating Transcription Rate to Protein Production
Relating Transcription Rate to Proteins Produced
Assumption:
CsgA alone and CsgA-fusions (such as CsgA-AFP8 and CsgA-SpyTag) behave similarly in terms of transcription in the cells.
The transcription rate of the CsgA gene is modeled as follows:
where,
Thus, by the stated assumption, the transcription rate of CsgA-fusions can be modeled with the same equation.

2011.07.04
Today we had our meeting in the afternoon. The weather is so hot. It was like barbeque ourselves under the sun so we decided not to have meeting in the afternoon anymore. The topic today is the oxidation of CO to CO2 – we found out that Rhodospirillum rubrum can undergo Calvin Cycle to obtain their energy from sunlight and use CO2 as their carbon source, however cyanobacteria or other bacteria is needed for CO2 fixation and production of biofuels. But it would be much more sophiscated if we add on the cyanobacteria into the system. Hmmm … looks like we have to improve more on our system design !
2011.07.05
We talked to the microbiologist Prof. Chen CY yesterday evening and stunned us with 3 questions. The time factor, the mutation factor and the gene expression rate. The experiment of CO2 fixation requires at least half a year to complete so we probably couldn’t just simply add in our project. Besides that, we also have to think of the mutation of the gene. If the gene mutated then the product would be useless. And the most important is the rate of the protein to turn fluorescent. Lastly, if the gene size is getting bigger it would be more difficult to insert into the plasmid. Consequently, we would need more time in cloning and that would be time-costing. Uhh … we really need to find the resolution soon ! Any way, Prof. Ingrid is really very busy. We have not see her for the past 2 weeks. Gotta check out with her lab assistant.
2011.07.06
Today we had meeting in the afternoon again. Thanks god the weather is windy. We downloaded all the sequences and CDS of the gene we need. On the other hand we also search the sources of R. Rubrum which we planned to use in our project. There is a few proffesor in taiwan doing the research about R.Rubrum. So Joanne will help the letter to them to request a sample of it. And the worst case we can buy it from biotech corporation. Steven need somebody to be the in-charge of wikipedia. Leo volunteered. Found out that 2 enzymes"

Parsing v1
At first we decided to parse the data we had into The Stochiometric Matrix, and we did it, with a combination of PERL , R , & MATLAB scripts. We had a lot of trouble with that parser particularly because we didn't know to what structure it had to conform (i.e. what are the fields of ""rev"", or ""c"", or ""b""...). After finding this sample file to use and the Nature Method Tutorial , we eventually got it working. Once the thing was partially functional, we got to play around with COBRA's functions, and we found the elusive createModel function.
Parsing v2
With the createModel function, we re-made the COBRA structure and got it fully functional with this . It was then we discovered the data we had been working with was painfully out-of-date. Searching in vain for a magical function that would consult databases and update reactions, we realized manual curation was necessary. For every one of the 385 reactions we had.
Parsing v3
We used the E-C Numbers classification to check the known reactions, we connected isolated dots with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes , and we finished the holes with other searches ... Once the data felt up-to-date, we set to re-analyze and tweak the metabolic reconstruction to our heart's content with this . We made several models to explore how the system reacted:

There is a purification obligation in horticulture.
There are no set rules on the concentration of drug residues. Also, determining the effects of cocktails or low concentrations of drug residues is very difficult.
Our biosensor potentially replaces animal behavioural toxicity test, reducing the use of experimental animals.
Constant feedback and reflections on our project is needed, due to the use of GMO’s.
Applied
On potential stakeholders:
Companies producing or using pharmaceuticals and other chemical compounds are also stakeholders, since they have a purification obligation.
Water treatment plants also require concentration measuring methods.
On our biosensor:
Water samples should be filtered before applying it to our biosensor. As well, we need to make sure our biosensor survives in surface water and not only water used in laboratories (Milli Q water).
Consider techniques needed to test for E. coli presence in case some kind of leak in the system occurs.

22/08/18 About Michael Bentvelsen
Michael Bentvelsen is a policy advisor for the Dutch Water Authorities (Unie van Waterschappen), that represents all Water Authorities in the Netherlands. Water authorities are responsible for both water quality and water purification.
Insights
There is a variety of filter methods that can be used for water purification needed for water analysis.
For water purification, BDS uses a method with one purification step, in stead of the chemical purification methods, which needs two more expensive steps.
Although the government seems a logical stakeholder of biosensors, in practice the producers of the specific compounds, like pharmaceutical companies, are the major clients of BDS biosensors.
Biosensors have great advantages compared to chemical analysis methods. They are cheaper, faster and often measure a broader range of compounds.
Applied
End product integration:
Experiments have to be conducted to determine what filter method will be sufficient for DeTaXion. The needed filter methods are more likely to be similar to the methods used by BDS than by chemical analysis, because the systems of DeTaXion and BDS biosensors are more alike.
So far, we have set our minds on producing a kit, enabling buyers to do the experiments by themselves. However, end product design will be easier and the results will be more reliable when the measurements are done at the lab. We will have to reconsider our choices based on these newly acquired advantages and disadvantages.

-   1.5 % Agarose-1xTAE gel
-   4 µl PCR reaction + 1 µl 5x DNA Loading Dye
-   5 µl of Test RDs; 1 µl uncut plasmid + 1 µl 5x DNA Loading Dye + 3 µl dH₂O
-   3 µl 2 log ladder
-   Run at ca. 100 V in 1xTAE buffer

-> RD: Expected band ca. 750 bp + ca. 2 kb for all digests. The expected bands were obtained for all RDs --> all clones contain plasmids --> prepare the plasmids for sequencing by G2L
-> PCR: for expected products: add ca. 2x 20 bp to sizes indicated above. The expected bands were obtained. However, for iGEM_67/68, iGEM_69/68 and iGEM_67/70, a slight band at approx. the bp of 2x expected was observed for 2 µl reaction (“product dimmers?”), this seemed to decrease with increasing primer amount. Hig iGEM_69/70 primer amounts seemed to interfere with PCR. The negative control only shows primer clouds at bottom of lanes. The optimal primer concentrations for the different PCR reactions seem to be:

Expert interview
• Uartar Seker, Assistant Professor, Synthetic Biology Group, UNAW
To enable our curli fiber a better conductivity, we enhanced it with nanogold particles. But we were confused on how to confirm the best concentration and the best size of nanogold particles for our experiments. Fortunately, we got in touch with Professor Uartar. He suggested us using 5nm gold nanoparticles to decorate our electrode so that we can maximumly fill up the gaps between curli fibers.
• Chao Zhong, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Integrative Bio-inspired Molecular Engineering (IBME) Group, ShanghaiTech University
Our project aims to detect the current at the downstream of our enzymes’ reactions. But to our frustration, the current was so weak that we could not detect them in a convenient way. So we turned to Professor Chao Zhong for help.
As he pointed out that it would be much better if we filled up with nanogold particles. He also offered us his E.coli strain (PIN4) whose endogenous CsgA was knocked off which helped us to acquire the purified curli fiber proteins.
• Christopher Whitford, ZJU-China & Julius-Maximilians Universität Würzburg Mentor in After iGEM
Mr. Chris and ZJU-iGEM were firstly connected by After iGEM. He is an experienced iGEMer. We had our first meetup in 8/8/2018, during which Mr. Chris pointed out that iGEM concerns not only  the main body of your project but also the demonstration of the significance of your project. iGEMer should realize that it would never be useless to show your comprehensive considerations of your project’s Human Practice.
In the second meetup, we were confused by how to ensure the biosafety of our cell-free biosensor. He provided us his recent paper talking about how to apply the biosecurity of iGEM projects which directed us in safety.
The third meetup was mainly talking about the Human Practice Part of iGEM project. “The more Human Practice you applied, the more competitive your project will be.” Hence, we realized it would be a promising Human Practice activity for us to keep frequent communications with Acon-Biotech and have more cooperation with Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital.
We sincerely thanks for his selfless denote!
