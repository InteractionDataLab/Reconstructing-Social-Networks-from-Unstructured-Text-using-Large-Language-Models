Nitroreductase activity assay: Overnight liquid cultures of nitroreductase strains were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 mins to pellet the cells. The cells were then resuspended in 250 ul PBS and 1 ul DTT to ensure that cellular proteins are not oxidized. The solution was sonicated 6* (10 s sonication+20 s rest). The supernatant was separated from the pellet by centrifugation and used for the NADH-dependent nitroreductase activity assay.
To assess background activity NADH (5 ul) and bacterial supernatant (5 ul) were added to 0.8 ml PBS and mixed. OD340 was measured for 1 minute. DNBA(5 ul) was added to the same cuvette to start the reaction and change in OD340 was monitored for 1 minute. DMSO(5 ul) was used a control (DNBA is dissolved in DMSO)

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated HP_-_-_TEXT.html," existing design should work and suggested looking into the design of his B-series of Zika virus toehold switches to improve our existing switches. We did so, and modified our design to base them on these switches which have reduced system leakage. They have shorter loops and no-refolding domain which helped increase sensitivity. Based on his feedback, we also increased the loop size for the 15b-5p switch design. This compensates for its long stem (which reduces on state activity), increasing dynamic range. With his help, our switches were optimized for their application as a diagnostic tool. Read more about our first series switches on our design page .

iGEM EPFL
After speaking to several experts who highlighted the importance of reducing false positives and false negatives (see applications section below), we began to explore ways to improve the design of our toehold switches. We spoke to iGEM EPFL - another team working with toehold switches. We explained the issues we had with homologous miRNAs that reduce the specificity of our sensors. iGEM EPFL suggested that we design our switches to utilize the mechanism employed in “Ribocomputing devices for sophisticated in vivo logic computation”. [1]
Based on this advice we designed a second series of toehold switches that can distinguish between miRNA sequences with one nucleotide differences. This improved our design , effectively reducing false positives, a crucial part of any diagnostic method.
With reduced cross-hybridisation, we could create an effective multiplexing assay: multiple switches that each regulate the production of a different reporter protein with a distinct emission peak. This would drastically increase the efficiency and scope of the test. As the second generation of switches can detect single base mismatch differences the sensitivity and specificity of the entire system would be improved.
Professor David Rubinsztein
Professor David Rubinsztein, Professor of Molecular Neurogenetics at Cambridge University, suggested that we use luciferase instead of GFP as our reporter protein. He explained that it may be able to provide more sensitive readings. We produced 4 composite parts as a result - with 2 being toehold switches containing luciferase. However, the constructs with luciferase were so long that, in combination with our inducible promoter, we were unable to insert them into the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone in one ligation step. Unfortunately, we did not have time to ligate the individual components of the constructs into the pSB1C3 backbone so we were"

Overview
We began our project early in this year, but wasted lots of time on molecular cloning. We were making mistakes and debugging during most of the time. In July, we tried to build the memory sequential structures at first but failed at last because of leakage. Later, orthogonality of five integrases we have was tested. At the same time, we were tring to change promoter in our two-signal system and still working on this now. Furthermore, we have engaged in InterLab in the mid-summer. Efficiency of five integrases was tested in late September and October.

Continued to design primers
Monday, June 11
We attempted to optimize our primers using online guidlines and software.
Here is a website that details primer design.
We used a calculator and an Oligo Analyzer which can calculate the liklihood of occurances such as hairpins and dimers.
Upon analysis, we found that the primers that would be required to use Gibson assembly were not ideal. In some cases, the forward and the reverse primers did not have Tm values that were close enough to each other. We also had difficulty with making our primers a reasonable length. Furthermore, many of the primers had a high probability (Gibson free energy value lower than zero) of froming dimers or hairpins. Finally, we deicided that it would most likely be more successful to use 3A assembly instead of Gibson.  In order to save time and ensure the accuracy of the sequence, we decided to synthesize instead of assemble the whole silica making device in a high copy plasmid.  Welcomed Rubeena to"

ROSE FOREST
One hundred years ago, there was a young boy who was seeking a unique rose for his beloved girl. It was a freezing winter night, and all roses had died. After a long time searching in the withered rose bush, the young boy was desperate. Touched by his true love, a nightingale, who heard and understood his wish, sang all night under the cold moonlight. Just before dawn, a rose stained with the blood of the nightingale, bloomed, bright and fragrant.
Enjoy the beautiful story in our video!
The writer Oscar Wilde, created a red rose for true love out of the nightingale’s song under moonlight.[1] To Wilde, the unique rose stained with blood of the nightingale is the symbol of love and true art. To us UCAS-China iGEM team, the touching story should be passed down to our generation and explained in a scientific and creative way using the tools of synthetic biology. Furthermore, as Wilde conveyed in the story, the barrier and combination of art and science still remain worthy of discussion, so we also explored in depth the relationship of art and science in the Human Practices section .
.
Our project combines the four elements - music (the song of the nightingale), light (the moonlight), color (the stained rose) and odor (the rose fragrance). In our project every iGEMer is able to create his/her own rose with unique soul, together to form our rose forest in the junction of art and science!
DESIGN
In our project,  E. coli needed light and sound as inputs to produce color and odor as outputs."

Company visits
Our product, D-psicose, as a sweetener, has the advantages of high sweetness and low calorie. To collect some information about the current sweetener market, and situation of sugar production, we visit companies related to sugar production. We learned the market demand of sweeteners and transformation of lab-scale achievements to market, and collected professional insights and suggestions on our IGEM project, to better understand the important value and development prospects of D-psicose.
Global Horticulture (Xi’an) Limited
Yangling, Shaanxi Province, China
A company that produces and sales kiwi-containing beverage.
Keypoints of discussion with Manager Zhao:
The potential huge market of D-psicose will rely on people in top cities with healthy diet, or the diabetics, who will prefer to buy healthier D-psicose.
Chinese people always think of sweetener as a bad additives, which is a potential obstacle for the commercialization of sweetener including D-psicose. More popularizations are needed to make healthy sweeteners acceptable.
Xinsheng Jixiang Biological Company
Weinan, Shaanxi Province, China
The company mainly produces enzymatic sugar-containing food products
Keypoints of discussion with Director Tan:
D-psicose is advantageous over other sugar substitutes especially in terms of calorie and taste.
If we want to commercialize our D-psicose in China, the acceptable price is ~20,000 RMB/ton, which means the price of one bottle of D-psicose-containing beverage is ~10 RMB. The visit allows us to better understand market demand and acceptance of D-psicose, which will better improve our products and project.
This activity allows us to better understand the needs of the market, which will better improve our products.
Yesherb company
Xi’an, Shaanxi Province, China
A company produces oligomannose-containing prebiotic products.
Key suggestions about how to transform scientific research into products to market:
Ideas goes first before experiment and production.
Refine lab-scale techniques for large-scale production.
Think more about the market of your products, your advantages and disadvantages
Finally, the operation of the entire production, marketing, sales etc.
Benefit the old diabetics

Hobbies: read books, papers, write about general things that happened in life and that pass through my mind, play guitar, sing, play tennis, spend time with my family and messing around with friends and finally, one of the most important things for me, be absorbed in my own thoughts.
iGEM expectations: This is a great step for doing something for the humanity. The entire world could change for good thanks to the synthetic biology. The power is in our hands, let`s do better things for the future. Research interests: I am extremely interested in conducting research in order to contribute to the knowledge and development of humanity in the scientific field. Since I was a child, my passion has been to study animal behavior. However, since I joined to study biology, the ecology and the environmental biology has been very important to me primarily because we are living a crucial moment for the world as global warming. Now I see more clearly that the synthetic biology is a good new increasing field to combat this and one good example is what we are doing in our proyect of rhamnolipids. I have many questions, there are now many aspects of biology that I like to investigate. I am looking for many answers. To go deeper and deeper into the wonderful world of the study of life, I reaffirm the maxim of Socrates, ""I only know that I know nothing"", and that gives me more thirsty of wanting to know.

This shows the process that occurs with the T7 System. We induce the Lactose inducible promoter with IPTG as it mimics the lactose and cannot be broken down by the cell. This allows it to continually perform transcription on the construct embedded in the genome of the BL21(DE3) and thusly constantly produce the T7 RNA polymerase encoded by the gene(3).This T7 RNA Polymerase binds to the T7 Promoter and starts transcription on the construct within our plasmid pSB1C3. This then creates the mRNA which will undergo translation and produce the protein encoded by the gene due to the E. coli RBS on the construct. Part BBa_I712074 .

Signal Integration: Applications of RNA Riboregulator Capabilities
Abstract:
This project explores some of the ways that the secondary structure of messenger RNA can be used to control the rate of protein expression. The 32oC ribothermometer made by the 2008 TUDelft team will be coupled to fluorescent proteins to visually confirm temperature-dependent translation. The ""ribolock"" made by the 2006 Berkeley team will be tested at various temperatures to determine if it could double for use as a ribothermometer. Finally, a proof-of-concept NAND logic gate will be constructed: a ribolock will be used to interpret two concurrent environmental signals into an on/off control for mCherry output.
Safety Considerations
   1. None of our project ideas raise any safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety.
   2. There is a Biosafety Commitee at the University of Victoria, which can be found at http://ohs.uvic.ca/biosafety/index.html .
   3. Our project raised no issues as it did not involve any dangerous organisms, genes, or materials.
   4. None of the new biobrick parts we made this year raise any safety issues.

Project Description:
Sphereactor: a synthetic bacterial microcompartment
It's a box, not a bug!
In the Beginning…
Over millennia, eukaryotic cells have evolved sophisticated organelles, which enabled them to partition their cytoplasmic contents into functional sectors (e.g. the nucleus for storage of genetic material). Such compartmentalisation allows greater efficiency of cellular processes, where each organelle is allocated a set of specific metabolic tasks. Some prokaryotes have also developed a method of forming intracellular subdivisions called bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) by expressing a set of proteins that ‘cage in’ a reaction pathway to make it more efficient. A wide range of metabolic pathways are isolated by BMCs, from carbon dioxide fixation pathways to organic compound degradation. Despite these varying functions, the proteinaceous BMC shells show considerable homology as a result of a highly conserved protein domains. [1]
One such set of proteins is expressed from the propanediol utilisation (Pdu) operon in Salmonella enterica, which is involved in the coenzyme B(12)-dependent breakdown of the organic compound 1,2-propanediol. S. enterica synthesises its microcompartments during aerobic or anaerobic growth on 1,2-propanediol, but does not form them when grown on other carbon sources. Enzymes vital for the catabolic pathway are thought to be enclosed within the BMC. [2]
Figure 1: Gene organization in the Pdu Operon and Pdu metabolic pathway. [1]
The Pdu operon is composed of 21 genes, which encode proteins involved in the Pdu microcompartment (Figure 1) either in formation of the shell or in the metabolic pathway contained inside. Of these 21 genes, seven have been identified as having a role in BMC shell assembly. These genes code for the proteins PduA, -B, -J, -K, -N, -T, and -U plus a truncated version of PduB termed PduB’. [3]
It is thought the Pdu BMC shell adopts an icosahedral shape, with multiple flat triangular faces and 12 vertices. With the exception of P"

Overview
In order to lower down the repeatability rate of codons, we use intelligent optimization algorithm.  We exploit amino acid degeneracy and alternate nucleotides to reduce the repetition rate of bases of TALE DNA sequence. (See Figure 1) Then the optimized TALE sequence will be tested in wet lab to verify our conjecture whether TALE DNA sequence of lower repeatability rate works at higher efficiency.
Figure 1. RNA codon Table
For instance, we may change UUC into UUU to make one of the repeats different from others while the amino acid(PhenylalaninePhe) is identical.
By this way, we use two types of intelligent optimization algorithm to optimize TALE DNA sequence.
Genetic Algorithm(GA)
-Introduction of Genetic Algorithm
Genetic Algorithm is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection. The heuristic is routinely used to generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems.[1]
GA has lots of applications in many fields, such as in bioinformatics, using GA to optimize DNA successfully made the sequences have better physic-chemical properties for PCR.
-Our strategy
Initialization
Create a population of hundreds of TALE sequences.
Mutation
Each sequence changes a base randomly under the premise that 1. Amino acids sequence remain unchanged 2. To prevent TALE sequence from being cut, no restriction enzyme site we exploit in experiment is allowed to be created 3. Mutation should not take place on the overhang of each repeat.
Crossover
In GA, crossover is a simulation of the process of synapsis. We randomly choose a point of amino acid, and two sequences exchange their parts from the point we choose to one of the ends.
Figure 2.The process of crossover is a simulation of natural synapsis of chromosome.
Fitness Scoring
We take two main factors into consideration:
1.Repeatability rate of the sequence
To judge the repeatability, we compare the changed sequence with the original one and count the Hamming distance between them. When a restriction enzyme site sequence occurs on the mutated TALE sequence,"

Vincent processed the data and there was only a 1.2 on-off ratio showed by ribosthermometeres. James thought it was because the lac operator stood in front of the ribothermometers disturbed its secondary structure. James and Neil wrote another set of sequence to fix that problem.
James finished writing the fifth edition of the sequence in snapgene and sent it to our instructor to be analyzed. But the modeling part had no progress.

August 10 - August 16
Zhang Haoqian advised us to change the lux promoter and J23119. Plus his suggestion, we just realized there are still too many parts needed to be tested separately. So instructor taught us to modularize our circuit. We separated every construction into two parts. One involves promoter and RBS, the other one belongs to protein and terminator. In such case, we were able to examine each part and later quickly install proper parts together to construct our final circuits. We together finish coding the sequence.
A bad news came out that the yellow chromo protein turned out to be orange when expressed. That led our land turn to purple instead of green! It was beautiful but……unacceptable. We needed to change it.
August 17 - August 23
According to the separation of parts, we named all the parts and double-cheaked the sequence:
-PR-1~PR-11: Different promoters and RBS;
-CT-1~CT-9: Different proteins and terminator.
James and Neil respectively designed the new thermometer sequence:
-TW-1~TW-9: Different promoters and different thermometers designed by James;
-TJ-1~TJ-9: Different promoters and different thermometers designed by Neil.
Vincent, William and Neil started to construct and transform the parts.

Concordia,2016,Team:Concordia#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," that blue color formation was due to the presence of GolS and P118A. Blue color seems to have appeared in the GolS M9X construct, as well as all ion constructs, possibly indicating that GolS reacted with some ions in the M9 media (which contains calcium and magnesium). However, a darker blue color was observed with the 5 µM Au GolS construct, indicating higher LacZ activity caused by GolS in the presence of Au, as compared to the other ions. This is a confirmation that GolS is performing its intended function of binding to gold ions.
Interestingly, we have found that the GolSP118A construct can clearly bind to gold, copper, and silver ions. Silver ion binding by GolS and has not been documented in the before for GolS, so we have characterized GolS to another degree. Both GolS and GolSP118A do not show any binding affinity for Al ions.
We also wanted to obtain quantitative values from this data, so we attempted to extract the blue insoluble pigment in DMSO. We first spun down the cells (4000 RPM, 5 min), got rid of the supernatant, and lysed the cells with a commercial E. coli  lysis buffer. We then added the commercial neutralization buffer, spun the cells again, removed the supernatant, and resuspended the pellet in DMSO. We then obtained absorbance values of our wells.
We found that the solubilized blue pigment had absorbance maximum at 640 nm. As can be seen in the spectrum above, the untransformed DH5alpha incubated with Au ions (which did not have blue pigment) did not absorb at 640nm.
We measured the absorbances of the solubilized blue pigments in each well at 640nm. The absorbances are written under each well. These quantified absorbance values add onto the qualitative data we have generated for our collaboration.

Below we will give more detailed explanations for the purposes behind each of the following plasmids, explaining the function of every component of each plasmid and how we did them.
Plasmids:
IPTG inducible promoter - RBS - GFP - Mutator
ParoF--RBS--mCherry--RBS--mutator
Generic Promoter--RBS--mutated TyrR
IPTG+GFP Mutator:
(IPTG inducible promoter - RBS - Mutator) The IPTG promoter is used to quantify the mutation rate of each mutator via rifampicin (rif) fluctuation analysis. The reason that IPTG was used was so that the expression of the gene of interest could be controlled and be turned on only during the gene during the fluctuation analysis (but not during the cloning of the RBS and Mutator parts). Ergo, an unaltered copy of the RBS and mutator gene could be cloned for later use.
GFP (or Green Fluorescent Protein) was used primarily to visualize cells that had successfully gained the insert. The presence or absence of fluorescence under blue light could instantly give an indication as to if the cells contained the insert without having to either use some of the sample or wait for a lengthy procedure to determine the same thing.
The mutators were first cloned into the IPTG-GFP backbone in order to effectively assay their mutation rates. The expression of the mutators on this backbone is activated by the presence of IPTG in the growth medium, allowing us to effectively control the expression of the mutator gene to prevent any unnecessary mutations in the cell prior to cloning into the main ParoF-mCherry backbone for FREP. Plasmids that had already undergone the fluctuation analysis were then transferred to the ParoF+mCherry backbone.

TRPV-Ferritin system
When TRPV1 and Ferritin are co-expressed in the same cell, only using medium radio frequencies, Ferritin will be heated and then activate TRPV1. Once been activated, TRPV1 will result in calcium influx and finally facilitate   the expression of downstream genes.[4][5]

Design
Introduction
We try to use medium wave for Trichoderma atroviride operation. To achieve our goal, we plan to build up the TRPV-Ferritin system, depending on which we can turn the medium waves into heat, inducing Calcium influx and changing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Therefore, we can operate Trichoderma atroviride using autologous promoter regulated by Ca2+.
However, the experimental period of Trichoderma atroviride is too long, together with the fact that its genetic background is unclear, so we choose another fungi, Saccharomyces cerevisiae for substitution to check the function. Its own Calmodulinsignal transduction pathway is used to activate the downstream gene.
Experimental Design
Proof of Concept
fluo-4 —— To test the change in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, we used Fluo 4-AM to detect the concentration of intracellular calcium ion.
Fluo 4-AM is a kind of acetylmethyl ester derivative of Fluo 4, and able to enter the cells after culture. After that, AM will be hydrolyzed by the intracellular esterase and release Fluo 4, which can bind Ca2+ and give out fluorescence. So, Fluo 4-AM enables us to test the intracellular Ca2+ concentration.
Fig.3 Construction of CDRE promoter[6][7]
CDRE —— CDRE,calcineurin-dependent response element,is a segment of DNA sequence which can be regulated by specific transcription factor Crz I. This TF is activated by calcineurin in the present of calcium ion. To create a promoter can be up-regulated by calcium influx,we replaced the upstream activating sequence(UAS)of CYC1 promoter with 4 CDREs. It can be a hard work to construct such a promoter with these repeating sequences. Luckily, UCAS helped us to contract this fusion promoter and sent it to us. We choose mRFP as report gene"

Modeling of the Optimum Beginning Time of Public Service Advertising on Genetic Pollution
Abstract: This section focus on how the genetic pollution been made aware by the public and the function of public service advertising (PSA) on accelerating the awareness process. Our model is based on the ordinary differential equations to describe how basic knowledge and the potential effects of genetic pollution been propagated through the public. During the analysis the model, the relationship between the propagation speed and the amount of social welfare brought about by PSA is very helpful. We conclude from the model the different optimum beginning time of PSA for different initial propagating speed which is directly related to the problem itself. In addition, we also evaluate the strength and weakness of the model and look into the future work putting forward some accessing methods.
Restatement of Our Modeling Task
With the emergency and deterioration of genetic problems, together with the lack of related knowledge, the role of PSA is becoming more and more important in popularizing the knowledge of genetic pollution. To study the function of PSA on popularization of the genetic pollution and to optimize the beginning time of the advertising.
Basic Assumption
The speed of propagation will be increased greatly with the help of advertisement, but this will only be useful to those who do not aware of this problem;
We assume the propagation speed will not reach its maximum level after stopping the advertising;
Ignore the change in the advertising environment and that of similar problems;
We also assume the propagation process is continuous process;
The intensity and the duration of the  PSA of genetic pollution is relative unchanged;
The advertising content is authentic and significant;
The positive effects of the advertisement is immediately.

UMaryland,2016,Team:UMaryland#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the MDH2 gene that had overhangs to be inserted into the chloramphenicol resistant backbone. We special ordered FDH and FALDH parts and attempted to use 3A to attach a ribosome binding site to each. When this step did not work for us, we decided to design primers that would have extensions to add in ribosome binding sites and would be able to anneal to create a plasmid with the two enzymes. We successfully performed a gibson after a PCR was run with the designed primers and parts, and did a 3A with this gibson product and the G-Block. Our final step was to do another 3A to attach a double terminator to the end.
After inspection of our created plasmids, the Fructose and the Formate plasmids, we noticed a few features of the plasmids that needed to be edited - Fructose had an extra EcoRI site and the FDH and FALDH genes did not contain stop codons. To alter our plasmids, we performed site directed mutagenesis using PCR with primers we designed.
An additional plasmid we attempted to create would be responsible for producing the protein folding chaperones GroES and GroEL which would assist in the particularly complicated folding mechanism of sMMO. Dr. George Lorimer kindly donated a plasmid already containing GroES and GroEL to us. We then sequenced this plasmid and identified the insert containing GroES and GroEL that we wanted to isolate. Overhang PCR was performed in order to create a PCR product containing GroES and GroEL flanked on either side by Gibson overhangs that matched up with either end of the standard iGEM chloramphenicol resistant backbone. The PCR product was then combined with the backbone via Gibson assembly. The resulting plasmid was then combined with the standard iGEM double terminator (BBa_B0015) through 3A assembly. Overhang PCR and another subsequent Gibson assembly was then used to attach a promoter and ribosome binding site to the GroESL construct. Sequencing of this plasmid, however, revealed several point mutations and deletions that would impact protein functionality. As such, this construct cannot be deemed ready for use at the moment.

CONCLUSION
With this experiment we could indirectly verify the functionality of both the operons expressing azurin and p28 respectively. From this experiments we chose the clone 3 for the creation of azurin-rich and p28-rich bacterial lysates. Samples from these cultures were further analyzed via SDS-PAGE to verify the production of p28 and azurin in a direct way.

SDS-PAGE to Confirm AHL-Induced Expression of azurin and p28
OBJECTIVE
Fluorescence measurements showed indirectly the functionality of the operons expressing azu/sfGFP and p28/sfGFP. To directly confirm that bacterioferritin was indeed co-expressed, an SDS-PAGE analysis was performed.
PROCEDURE
Protein lysates were obtained from bacteria treated with different concentrations of AHL. To determine the samples' protein concentration, needed to prepare the samples for SDS-PAGE, the Bradford protein assay was preformed prior to the SDS-PAGE analysis. A detailed protocol is available in Protocols.
RESULTS
To determine protein concentrations in the lysates via Bradford protein assay, a standard curve was  first generated by using a protein standard, bovine serum albumin, and measuring absorbance of different dilutions of the standard. Second, absorbance of the unknown samples was measured and the results were fitted to the curve.
After determining the unknown concentrations, samples were prepared accordingly and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Band sized approximately 14.8 kDa (which corresponds to azurin [3] ) were visible in the samples treated with AHL. No bands corresponding to the azurin-derived p28 peptide could be detected, mainly because of its low molecular weight (27 aa, ~4 kDa). There were no bands in untreated samples or the negative control (Figure 7).
Figure 7. SDS-PAGE analysis of azurin and p28 expression upon AHL induction. The samples analyzed were equipped: 1) with a vector expressing azurin/sfGFP, 2) with a vector expressing p28/sfGFP or 3) with an empty vector. Adetectable band corresponding to azurin's molecular weight only appears in the induced sample (AHL +) while it is absent in the mock-induced sample (AHL -). No band could be detected corresponding the p28 on the AHL-induced p28 expressing strain.

BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"  After being in an ice bath for about an hour and a half they were put back into the -80 in their respective tubes.  Hopefully they are still viable.  A test of their viability using a simply positive control (3x flag plasmid) should have occurred tonight, but can be done tomorrow instead.  The rest of the cells were all in the ice bath for 30-40 minutes.  They were heat shocked in pairs, starting with the first to have their plasmids added and progressing towards those whose plasmids had been added last.  The heat shock was placement in a water bath at roughly 45 degrees C for 40-50 seconds.  After heating, each pair was placed in ice bath.  After three heat shockings, the first ones to be heat shocked had been in the ice bath for an estimated 2-5 minutes, so LB was added to them and they were placed in a tube holder at room temperature.  After LB had been added to all tubes, they were placed in the incubator for 2 hours.  In this fashion, it was possible to adhere rather closely to the transformation protocol despite the larger numbers of transformations.  The cells were plated as described previously and placed in the incubator around 11:50 pm.  Should check up on them around 1:50 pm tomorrow.

Met with Suzanne today.  Spent some time catching her up on the system and began to discuss ways to observe individual protein concentrations and to further model and analyze the system.
Took plates out of incubator around 2:35 pm.  They had been in the incubator for 14 hr and 42 min.  There were good colonies on all plates except Z0279 and Z0842, which were placed back into the incubator along with the controls to make sure that colonies could grow if they were present.  Note that these two parts are the LexA activator and the LexA activator reporter, respectively.
Began ligation between J63001 and J63002.  For ligation, use 1:3 ratio of vector to insert.  This should be in relative amounts, which corresponds to the weight of DNA present in the volume (in ng) normalized by the length of each DNA strand.  Prefer to have more insert than vector.  Thus, try using 8 uL water, 1 uL vector, 3 uL insert, 1.5 uL 10x ligase buffer, and 1.5 uL T4 DNA ligase"

This critical voice also reminds us that modest cell survival is necessary, considering that                         increase the ROS content by regulator components will increase stress of cells. Therefore, to                         improve the stability and reliability of product, and make it more durable. We designed the                         tolerance module.
Tolerance Module
Yca1 encodes synthesis of metacaspase, a homologue of the mammalian caspase, and plays a                         crucial role in the regulation of yeast apoptosis. According to the literature, knock out yca1 can improve the yeast tolerance to ROS, so we just do it. As a result, engineered strain can                         work at high ROS level.
Cell-Based Electrochemical Method (2017)
Today is the age of interdisciplinary integration. Cell-based detection combined with                         traditional electrochemistry, which is a landmark in the history of antioxidants detection. The                         cell-based electrochemical method uses NaAlg/GO hydrogels and 3D culture system to place cells in electrochemical workstation and adds nanoscale electrode materials for sensing intracellular                         ROS. It has good reproducibility and stability and is simple and rapid. However, it is still                         unable to achieve high-throughput screening for antioxidants and is difficult to popularize                         because of limitation of materials and instrument.
Synthetic                     Biological                     Strategy (2018)
21th century will become the new epoch of synthetic biology. As time goes on, synthetic biology                         is emerging in more and more fields and gives unique strategies to address kinds of problem.                         The plug-and-play characteristic of synthetic biological parts are conducive to the                         popularization of product.
In addition to the product design shown above, we have some special designs.
Design-Everything                         for Detecting
Feedback                     Module
Feedback Module works based on dCas9 technology and endogenous antioxidant system of yeast. We                         transformed and made use of that system sensing intracellular ROS level and starting our                         embedded genetic circuit properly to control the ROS level by dCas9. What's the role of                         Feedback Module?
● First, intracellular ROS level increased by regulator components may fluctuate, which                             causes the detection signal unstable. Therefore, we designed the Feedback Module which can                             regulate the ROS level in a stable range. Second, our sensor roGFP2-Orp1 has detecting                             threshold for ROS. The output signal is linear within the threshold and nonlinear beyond                             the threshold. Feedback Module can control ROS level within the detection threshold.
● Last, excessive accumulation of ROS will affect the survival of engineered strain.                             Feedback"

The growth curve was shown in Figure.6.
Opposing to our expectation, the growth has a negative dependence on tryptophan. It may be caused by the little demand to malQ of the cell and thus the high expression level of malQ can become a burden to the growth of the cell. This problem might be more disturbing for tac promoter in original plasmid pTrc99A was not strict so the leakage effect was serious.

Figure.7  malQ enzyme activity in vivo against the concentration of tryptophan 12 hours after IPTG induction
To confirm our hypothesis about the tryptophan dependent malQ expression system, we tested the enzyme activity of malQ present in the cell 12 hours after adding IPTG. The enzyme activity is defined as the moles of maltose to glucose convertion per minute per OD600 at 37℃. And the glucose assay was conducted using the EnzyChromTM Glucose Assay Kit (produced by BioAssay Systems). We plotted the enzyme activity against the concentration of tryptophan and the result was shown as figure.7.
Figure.8 tetA cloned from pCM110
It was shown that when the concentration of tryptophan was below 10mM, the maltase activity increased with the level of tryptophan, which was the same as our expectation. However, when the concentration of tryptophan continued to increase, the enzyme activity started to decrease, showing the upper limit of tryptophan to be more or less 10mM.
In parallel, we constructed tryptophan sensor coupling tetA circuits which can provide selection pressure to tryptophan provider microorganisms by antibiotics resistance. Similar to mutD, three different RBS sequences (B0030,"

Overview
We all are in this together! With a combined effort, we can make a positive impact on our planet and on the people and other species that we share it with. The “Community” section of our wiki is about cooperative practices, such as creating and characterizing BioBrick Parts for the Registry, contributing to standardization of methods by taking part in the Interlab Study and collaboration with other iGEM teams. What is unique to iGEM, collaborations can also focus on human practices and other collaborative efforts that benefit the community, as is the case with many of our collaborations.
We all do better when we work together.
Conferences
Before going to the Giant Jamboree in Boston we attended two iGEM conferences: Nordic iGEM Conference (NiC) in Copenhagen (Denmark) 9.-11.6.2017 and European iGEM Meetup in Delft (the Netherlands) 7.-8.7.2017. Both conferences proved to be very useful in preparing for the actual Jamboree, making contacts and especially in familiarizing ourselves with countless other projects! As a bonus, we were given a few very interesting lectures on current research topics and on science journalism.
At the Nordic iGEM Conference the program included a presentation by one of the previous year’s iGEM teams (Cosmo crops) with a Q&A session, three workshops mostly focusing on ethics, feedback and communicating science to the outside world, as well as networking and a Boston-style PowerPoint presentation to the judges and the audience. Feedback from the presentation and our idea helped to shape our project to its final form, while we also gained some valuable experience on presenting. We even got a special mention from the judges for having a clear and visually appealing presentation!
There was no PowerPoint presentation during European iGEM Meetup, but instead a poster session. We had prepared our own poster and had a chance to present it to the other teams and get their input to our project while practicing presenting a scientific"

The students are very positive to answer our questions, we gave the students the badges of our team as souvenirs. The interaction lead us to the introduction of synthetic biology. We've also introduced iGEM to them and showed them how to take part in iGEM as a high school student.
After listening to our introduction, they had a better understanding of biology . For us, it's quite a good experience to communicate with middle school students and to teach them what we've obtained in taking iGEM competition.

Clot Makers
We found that we may not need to order any BioBricks, as Lethbridge only used the sequences of the parts, and then proceeded synthesized them. We decided that we want
some more time to determine what we need to send for synthesis, as we want to be exact with what we need. We also decided some different ways to continue the second construct, which Lethbridge never got to test. We want to add purification tags to both construct one (clotting blood) and construct two (localizing the clot). We could use Histags, and in construct two we need Factor 13, an antimicrobial peptide.

We began looking at places/people we could contact who we can ask for more insight into potential applications for our project. We sent an email to Dr. Lavik, who is
knowledgeable about using nanoparticles to increase the rate of coagulation and lessen the possibility of infection and inflammation. We also talked a little bit about a potential way to test the effectiveness of the enzymes we produce with our constructs. We also introduced the idea of potentially adding a numbing agent into the construct.

VICKI
Fort McMurray oilsands tour: reflections of day 2
We rose early this morning to venture to Surmount, another oil sands development site that is co-operated by ConocoPhilips and Total (of France). Whereas the oil sands on the Suncor lease site is high enough for it to be mined relatively inexpensively, the sands in Surmount are much deeper and the bitumen must be extracted with SAGD technology. SAGD entails drilling a horizontal well far below the surface, consisting of an upper pipe that releases steam into the surrounding area and a lower pipe that collects the bitumen runoff and channels it to another location for processing. As the bitumen in raw form is extremely viscous and will not travel through the pipe untreated, it must be mixed with another petroleum-based product (which they purchase from Suncor!). Some semi-iGEM-related issues that come from this are:
Efficiency of energy production. One of the ConocoPhilips representatives mentioned that they can extract 6 barrels of oil for every barrel equivalent of energy that is put in. Most of the input energy is lost in producing steam to heat the bitumen and sufficiently lower its viscosity to enable it to flow. Although this number is certainly more realistic than what I heard at Suncor the day before (and, admittedly, the Suncor source did mention that he was not sure of the exact value), it is nowhere near the 30:1 output-input ratio that comes from conventional oil wells (Pressnail, 2007). Given that many people are anticipating an energy crisis, one must ask whether accelerated development of the oilsands is a responsible approach at this stage, especially when we consider one or two generations into the future, when the effects of the extravagant lifestyles of this generation become more pronounced. Please note that I have not said that the oilsands should not be developed – I am merely suggesting that we should approach their development cautiously until we have more efficient means of extracting oil – let’s say, a 20:1 output-input energy ratio. For now, developing the technologies that are capable of extracting oil more efficiently is critical.
From an iGEM perspective, this could entail designing bacteria that release an enzyme that lowers the viscosity of the bitumen. This would allow us to operate with lower steam temperatures, and thus lower the input energy necessary to get anything out of the process.
Alternatively, we could design bacteria that can effectively crack"

Single Cell ODE Model for the Sensing Module
1 Overview
The ﬁrst module in our construct is the Sensing module. The purpose of this module is to respond to the concentration         of AHL in the cell and amplify the amount of AHL as a signal for further modules of the construct by using a positive         feedback loop. In this module, the most important species considered are AHL, LuxR, mRNA, and GFP. The parameter         in the simulation is the extracellular AHL concentration which diﬀuses into an initially AHL free cell.
AHL and LuxR are integral to the function of the function of the module, both being required to induce the pLuxR. Speciﬁcally, a (LuxR_AHL)2 molecule induces pLuxR by binding to a region in front of it on the plasmid.
pLuxR is involved in the transcription of mRNA, which in turn in needed for the translation of LuxI and         GFP. While ideally, the promoter would only function when induced by (LuxR_AHL)2, in practice it has leakiness         and still promotes transcription even in the absence of any AHL, which is problematic due to our usage of a positive         feedback loop. The eﬀects of this leakiness and how we chose to combat it shall be described momentarily.
The mRNA transcript is translated to produce LuxI and GFP. LuxI is a synthase for AHL, and completes the positive feedback         loop. GFP is used in this module as a reporter for the activity of the system as well as a proxy for the concentration         of mRNA.
In our later models, we will also model the effect os adding antisense RNA (asRNA). The binding of asRNA to mRNA to form double stranded RNA (dsRNA) can prevent it from being used to translate any protein. It also increases the degradation rate of mRNA when it is bound in dsRNA due to the presence of the Hfq binding site on"

3. 1ml of each culture was taken and spun down in a microcentrifuge for 3 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, 950µl of 2x Laemmli sample buffer was added to 50µl of B-mercaptoethanol.
5. The supernatant was discarded from the samples and the pellet resuspended in 200µl of the above solution.
6. The samples were then boiled at 90oC for 10 minutes.
7. Afterwards, they were spun down for 1 minute in a microcentrifuge.
8. At this stage, the samples could be stored at -20oC or ran on a gel immediately.
9. Two gradient gels consisting of a 12% separating gel and a stacking gel were prepared and the samples ran at 100V until proteins reach end of the     stacking gel at which point the voltage was increased to 200V for 20 minutes.
10. One gel was stained using Instant Blue and the other was used to transfer the proteins onto a membrane.
11. After the proteins had been transferred onto the membrane using a semi dry transfer ran for 40 minutes at 5V, the membrane was blocked in 5% Marvel milk overnight at 4oC.
12. The next day, the membrane was washed 3 times in 1xTBST buffer and then suspended in 10ml of 1xTBS buffer to which the primary anti-His antibody was     added and left for one hour. The protein ladder was cut off before adding the primary antibody.
13. The membrane was then washed 3 times in 1xTBST buffer for 5 minutes and then suspended in 10ml of 1xTBS buffer, to which the secondary antibody was     added and left for one hour.
14. The membrane was then washed in 3x10ml 1xTBST buffer for 5 minutes.
15. The blot was then soaked in developing solution for 5 minutes before being wrapped in a plastic cover aligned with the protein ladder that was cut off     at step 12.
16. Once in the developing room, the film was exposed to the blot for 30 seconds, 2 minutes and 5 minutes and then placed in the film developer.

For promoter 1 (switches on the pro-drug and signaling molecule transcription), a very  good candidate is HIP 1 promoter - hypoxia-inducible promoter which drives reporter gene expression under both acute and chronic hypoxia. It was developed in attenuated Salmonella species. Take a look here:   http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/cbt/article/2951/mengesha5-9.pdf

Alex sent the 3 main project proposals to Dr. Darren Nesbeth for review.
Tom and Andy edited the wiki page adding various sections and elaborating on previously created pages.
Weiling researched on killing mechanisms being able to target hypoxic regions of solid tumors and promoters in hypoxia environments.
Catrin - General project research
Ruxi - Further researched the potential promoters esp HIP 1 and the Fas regulated programmed apoptosis.
We attended a Synthetic Biology talk by Neil Dixon, University of Manchester (Tom and Andy).
Had a general meeting for discussion of what has been accomplished so far, and the subsequent actions, which are to be undertaken by team members. Further documents were also submitted to Dr. Darren Nesbeth concerning 'team roles'. The team then began to do individual research or other activity:
Tom and Robin - Edited the iGEM wiki, added team information and removed the unnecessary tutorial information, replacing it with more useful information and streamlining the whole interface.
Weiling and Alex - Further development of circuit ideas, taking inspiration from previous iGEM ideas as well as further research into the CD95L molecule.

Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," so they actually know very well how the technology works and very well how she will be implemented and they are actually the ones who are telling us how to implement it because they are “us”, they are part of our project. So it is not going to be one small group of scientist implementing this grand technology. It is going to be something in the hands of a lot of people over a wide region. The initial tests obviously going to be in one or two locations.
In Burkina Faso they are about to release the first ever modified animal ever to be pulled into Africa. And this is one of the strains we produced in our lab. It is not a gene drive; it is just a sterile strain. So the idea was that we are build up capacity and that we are going to take the mosquito strain they are going to rear it and going to get used to checking for integrity of the synthetic compounds, checking for whether they can track them after release whether they can rear them to the number we need to rear whether they can sex them and these such things. And then we are going to measure impact of the release; so how well do they mate with individuals in the wild things like this. So this is very important to build up a capacity. And I think it will give everyone the confidence to know, is it really possible that these technologies could be taken up by Africans in Africa and used to cure an African disease. And I think they are going to do it, these goals are fantastic.
iGEM Hamburg: We are also thinking about what to do with our stuff because of course we do not want to be the people that introduce something into another country and say: “We have a solution for a problem that you have worked on so long.” So we are also looking for maybe corporations in order to conduct all these things.
Dr. Hammond: As part of our project we have a massive communications team which is being going to Africa. Actually, most of our team is African. Like Africans going to other countries in Africa. And we are meeting with regulators; so with government regulators, with community leaders and chiefs of villages and anyone who has a big stake in what we are doing. And we are getting feedback on what their concerns are. We are spreading the technology in a way that is actually as relevant as it needs to be. So different people want to know different levels of detail. We are trying to help to provide info graphics and cartoons and anything to try to explain what we are doing at a different level of detail. So that we get it across as well as possible.

(NB: antibiotic is only added to the first culture. The remaining days the bacteria are grown in cultures without any antibiotics)
Scanning Electron Microscope
SEM 1.1
Day 1: The bacteria was cultivated overnight in 5 ml LB-media at 37 degrees celcius.
Day 2: The overnight culture was centrifuged  15 min at 4000prm. Afterwards the pellet was resuspended in  distilled water. We aimed to get approximately 106 bacteria in 10 µl solution which was plated on double adhesive tape at the top of the grid. The solution was allowed to air dry and the remaining fluid disappeared as samples were exposed to the vacuum in the electron microscope.
The sample was examined with different electron intensity and magnification. We found that the best picture was taken with a electron intensity of 10 kV  and a magnitude on 10kx.

Specificity issue: In eukaryotic part, we use tissue-specific promoter GDF-5 and light-controlled switch ChR2 to ensure the curing gene only be expressed in chondrocytes with specific light exposure. In prokaryotic part, the “detector” employs inflammation factor like NO and hypoxia signal to detect the location and activate the downstream gene expression.
Immune issue: As long as a foreign object is introduced into human tissues, the immune system will attack the invader. The risk of stimulating the immune system in a way that reduces gene therapy effectiveness is always a possibility. To reduce immune response, we plan to remove the antigens on bacteria/virus. Details regarding E.coli antigen removal could be found in UC Berkeley’s project in 2007 iGEM.
Control issue: We expect the circuit to stop functioning or commit suicide once it has accomplished its curing mission. Our OA-curing E.coli has the “supervisor” part, which employs the quorum sensing system to control bacteria density—both over-population and injection of inducer will lead to suicide and removal of bacteria. In eukaryotic part, light exposure is a must for the activation of whole system, while tissue-specific promoter GDF-5 controls the switch of downstream circuit as the second guard. Once the treatment is over, the process can be easily switched off by removing the light exposure. And we have conceived a feedback inhibition by adding Cabin1 at the end of the circuit, which will act upon MEF2 once expressed under certain condition. We have confidence controlling the therapy won’t be a problem.
Vector issue: E.coli, the most widely used prokaryotic engineered bacteria, still have safety and other issues. Apart from antigen removal and other efforts to minimize its risk, replacing it with a more human-friendly kind of bacteria (such as bifidobacteria, advised by a professor from medicine school) may also be a choice. In eukaryotic parts, viral vector is the biggest problem and most difficult to answer. Up to now, there isn’t good solution—though many vectors available such as retrovirus, adenovirus, and non-viral methods, they all have their own drawbacks that prevent further clinical trial. So there is still a long way to go until our therapy can make real difference on human body. As our project only involves the circuit construction and function test in this stage, vector issue won’t be a big problem now. We believe this problem will be solved with further advancements"

A problem arises for those that wish to continue with their iGEM project as a start-up, as everything that is shared can not be patented. Many of the iGEM teams that want to start a business, could do so by patenting program codes instead of sequences or similar25 26.
Still, one of iGEM’s greatest achievements is the number of startups it has generated. So, is there a way to keep sharing, but still be able to run a start up after iGEM?
We in iGEM Stockholm have - with the help of IP experts - completed a strategy to turn an iGEM project into a startup, while still respecting and acknowledging iGEM values. This will be exemplified with our project, PROlung.
In terms of IP strategy, our project can be divided into three parts:
Part A: Lung therapeutics
Part B: E. coli GMO
Part C: Drug enzyme
In an initial patent search, we would firstly, have to look for patents inside the field of A, B or C, and see if any of those are relevant for our research. Secondly, we would need to study the combinations of A and B, B and C and A and C, in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the current situation in this field. Thirdly, we would have to see if there is any patent as a combination of A, B and C, that could have similar, or the same claims of our intended patent. All of this in addition to all scientific papers published before the filing date of the patent counts as prior art to our invention and could invalidate its patentability. If our invention is able to have a characteristic feature that does not infringe any of the explained options and combinations, it would be patentable.
Result
With the help from Rosa Lönneborg, a lecturer in patent search and critical information literacy inside the life sciences at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, we were able to develop our patent strategy and to identify patents related to our product.

Northwestern,2011,Team:Northwestern#Notebook#Protocols#3A Assembly_-_-_TEXT.html," It has antibiotic resistance C.
The left part's plasmid is cut with EcoRI and SpeI.
The right part's plasmid is cut with XbaI and PstI.
The construction plasmid backbone is a linear piece of DNA. It has a few bases beyond the EcoRI and PstI restriction sites. It is cut with EcoRI and PstI.
All 3 restriction digests are heated to heat kill all of the restriction enzymes.
An equimolar quantity of all 3 restriction digest products are combined in a ligation reaction.
The desired result is the left part's SpeI overhang ligated with the right part's XbaI overhang resulting in a mixed site that cannot be cut with any of our enzymes.
The new composite part is ligated into the construction plasmid backbone at the EcoRI and PstI sites.
When the ligation result is transformed into cells and grown on plates with antibiotic C, only colonies with the correct construction(*) survive.
Protocol Variation
Our team did not order primers for the plasmid backbone when we used 3A assembly, and instead amplified circular backbones from the iGEM kits. This was problematic because during ligation, the DNA still contains pieces of the excised part from the backbone. This piece sometimes reinserted itself instead of giving the desired construct, meaning that some of the colonies that grew when the ligations were transformed had only the backbone. The excised insert from the backbone contains a gene that transcribes RFP, so after transformation, some of the colonies were red and some were clear. The clear colonies were what we wanted, whereas the red colonies were just the original backbone with the reinserted piece. We also did not PCR purify the restriction digests. These alterations still worked to give us the colonies that we needed but was somewhat inefficient, and we recommend that next year's team use the edited 3A protocol below, using PCR'd linearized backbones.
There were also some variations that we believed increased our construction efficiency, namely that we increased digestion time to 1.5 hours and ligation time to 1 hour. Ligation can also take place overnight at 16 degrees C. If the following protocol is not working as well as desired, consider implementing these changes.
Materials
Two parts in BioBricks format to be assembled.  The parts are in a plasmid or they can be generated via PCR.
A construction vector that has a different resistance marker from either of two parts.
These construction backbones are available from the Registry.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM database. We described our concerns about being transparent and therefore being an open source for people who haven’t been in contact with iGEM. We explained the issue about anybody being able to access information about synthetic biology and in that way being able to recreate entire experiments. All iGEM teams must comply to this transparency to be able to fulfill medal requirements. We mentioned that our 3D printer could be recreated by anybody, because a manual will be placed on their website stating all the steps to create this machine out of children’s toys. Our final statement was as followed:
“The open source mentality of iGEM is not so threatening as that this system should be forbidden”.
We chose this statement because for requirements of our assigned track, Hardware, we are required to have all information present on our wiki. This also includes the manual for creating the 3D-printer with K’NEX.
The public had been handed out green/red cards, to indicate if they agreed or disagreed with this statement. The public was almost entirely unanimous in agreeing with the Delft’s students. Besides the agreement, there was a technical philosopher who said that although we should aim to an open source system to stimulate innovation, we should also be aware of the risks related to such a system. Such as the misuse by malicious people to create “evil”bacteria. The pro of the iGEM mentality being an open source was that for agencies it is easier to control what the newest advances are, and other researchers are able to easily find new experiments or techniques. We believed that open source would be met with more resistance, but the public was quite positive for the reasons above.   Although we agreed on this point, we were also very glad to see that almost everyone saw the benefits in an open source system as used by the iGEM community.
The next team was Groningen who talked about their biofilm used for the production of blue energy; the production of energy based on the difference in salt concentration between salt and fresh water. They stated that it should be possible to allow GMOs outside closed circuits. The public was a bit more hesitant in agreeing with this, mentioning that it can be unpredictable what the effect of these GMOs will be on the environment. Prof. Pronk added that naturally occurring microorganisms will, in most cases, outcompete the GMOs.
The third team was Amsterdam, who explained their project incorporating symbiosis between E. coli and cyanobacteria to produce biofuels. The costs of biofuels are not favorable compared to current fossil fuels due to the production costs. Therefore, the students"

EXPERIMENT
1.  Constructs
1a. Multi-copy test constructs:
Multi-copy test constructs were constructed for the following promoter switches in their PB state (promoter switches flanked by attP and attB sites):
BBa_K1039004: Bxb1 Invertible Promoter Switch (Promoter J23119) – PB State
BBa_K1039008: PhiC31 Invertible Promoter Switch (Promoter J23119) – PB State
BBa_K1039009: PhiC31 Invertible Promoter Switch (Promoter J23118) – PB State
The gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP) was placed downstream of each promoter switch in its inverted orientation (BBa_K1039015). This allows for the promoter switch to transcribe GFP in its PB state. The gene for red fluorescent protein (RFP) (BBa_J04450) was placed upstream of each promoter switch. RFP was therefore only transcribed upon a directionally regulated site-specific recombination event on the attP and attB sites flanking the promoter switch. As mentioned before, this event is mediated by the corresponding PhiC31 or Bxb1 integrases and thereby results in the reversed orientation of the promoter (Fig. 1).
The multi-copy test constructs were assembled via 3A assembly (Parts Registry Assembly Protocol) and sub-cloned into a Parts Registry plasmid, pSB4A5. Each test construct is flanked by the standard iGEM suffix and prefix. The multi-test constructs made include:
Bba_K1039025: Test construct for Bxb 1 Invertible Promoter switch (Promoter J23119).
Bba_K1039027: Test construct for PhiC31 Invertible Promoter switch (Promoter J23119).

Auto-aggregation
To achieve cellular aggregation, we use the famous auto-transporter protein, Antigen43 (Ag43). [7] It has shown to cause auto-aggregation of cells when overexpressed. (Figure 3) We plan to exploit this property of Ag43 to substitute centrifugation. We acknowledge previous iGEM teams who have worked on Ag43 (Hokkaido University, 2012; Aberdeen Scotland, 2014 and some more) as we got the BioBricks for Ag43 readily available.  We intend to express Ag43 only when the cells have made the product of interest. Hence, we use the diauxic shift in the media to act as a switch for the expression of Ag43.

The solution
The biologically produced microlens is an extreme small lens that can be used to make environmentally-friendly and eventually cheaper microlens arrays. The use of these MLAs as encapsulation layer for the solar panels, will result in an increase of the efficiency of those solar panels. To achieve this, Escherichia coli cells (E. coli) will be covered with polysilicate, using the enzyme silicatein. By overexpressing either the transcriptional regulator bolA or the cell division inhibitor sulA, the cell morphology can be changed and the and the optical properties of the lens can be optimized. The biological MLA as encapsulation layer will result in more efficient and more environmental friendly solar panels.

Management team & Organizational structure
BioLens is a high tech startup with well-educated people with different backgrounds. We will work with an interdisciplinary team that will form the board of directors. We believe that within the company equality is important and we aim to be an organization with a collaborative structure.
A collaborative structure means that we aim to be a non-hierarchical organization. The organization will be fluid and flat, which gives every individual a great responsibility to make decisions on its own. We will set targets for individuals and teams and then provide the appropriate motivation and support to help them achieve those targets. Traditional management layers will disappear in this way.
Eventually we believe that this type of structure results in a more open and trusted environment. Every individual should feel confident to share his opinion and to criticize the opinions of their colleagues and managers. An environment will be created where openness, sharing and discussion is central to everything that takes place.
This will result in a company with employees that feel much more responsibility and loyalty. Every individual employer will feel taken seriously and therefore will feel a collective sense of ownership and involvement in the process of achieving the goals of the company.
BioLens is a spinoff from the TU Delft. This has as one of the main advantages that they will help us to make our business a success. This could be help or advise, regarding project related aspects, financial aspects, etc. For example, they could help us developing the final prototype. Within the board of directors there is nobody with experience in the field of solar energy and we probably will need help to develop our final prototype. Research groups from the TU Delft could help us with this. Therefore, as can been seen in Figure 1, we consider the TU Delft as part of our organization as"

Silicic acid test: pellets were washed 3 times with PBS (which was tested not to interfere with the test) to remove all remaining LB medium. Then cells were resuspended with a 10mM NaOH solution and all cells removed by centrifugation to perform the test on the supernatant, that now should contain hydrolysed silicic acid. However, we believe that the cells were partly lysed with the NaOH solution since when trying to perform the test aggregation occurred again. Thus, we had to drop the test and decided not to characterize silicatein kinetics.
Growth study: plated cells from samples taken yesterday at timepoints 0, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h and 5h at different dilutions (no dilution, 1/10, 1/100, 1/100). All plates contained to many colonies to be counted so the growth study will be performed again at higher dilutions.

This team replaced two residues in the ssrA tag in order to weaken its interaction with ClpX but not with SspB (see Figure 2). They chose to use a Ser (serine) as a C-terminal residue as fewer than 10% of ClpX substrates with this tag had a Serine in this position. Asp was chosen as the antepenultimate residue because it decreased ClpXP degradation slightly. These new ssrA modified tags were called DAS tags. Fusing these DAS tags (Figure 2) to a protein, they found out that with the DAS-tagged substrate it was necessary the presence of Sspb for a high-affinity binding and  degradation by ClpXP.
Furthermore, they demonstrated that inserting residues between the ClpX and the SspB binding sites improved the SspB substrate delivering process to ClpXP. They tried out 3 variants of DAS tag: DAS+2, DAS+4 and DAS+8 (see Figure 2) and concluded that the DAS+4 tag showed the highest degradation level differences with and without SspB (see Figure 3 and Figure 4).

Figure 4. Initial rates of ClpXP degradation, with and without Sspb using the DAS+4 tag. Taken from McGinness et al. (2006) .
Therefore, this group has designed a proteolysis system that can be controlled by the presence or absence of the adaptor protein Sspb.

Collaborations
We collaborated with other iGEM teams in two primary ways: providing data through surveys and receiving assistance in dealing with a growing team from Cornell iGEM.  We provided data to the IIT Kanpur iGEM Team for their project that worked with other aspects of water pollution, namely detergent degradation, which is one area we are interested in as a team.
Perhaps most significantly, we also collaborated with the Cornell iGEM team after a member of our lab met with, and was able to tour the Cornell iGEM Lab spaces over the summer! This initial interaction and discussion of how the Cornell iGEM team is organized led to future collaboration between our two teams looking at how as a team we can practically implement some of the strategies Cornell iGEM has used to manage their large team size. We have been excited to have a large influx of members this fall, but have struggled to effectively communicate and delegate assignments for the team. As a result, the methods for team member evaluation, establishment of sub-team leads, and meeting schedules with the various sub-team leads that we received from Cornell iGEM have aided us greatly in setting more concrete standards for communication and team operation. Additionally, we have been trying to find a way to better ingrain our iGEM team into our institutions research program and with some help from the Cornell team we have made significant progress in setting standards of evaluation and a more defined structure for our team. This necessary structure and method of evaluation were previously lacking in our team, but with the suggested revisions suggested we will now be able to be more formally recognized by our home institution and receive official acknowledgement for our work.
Finally, we have also been immensely grateful to collaborate with a team of software developers at our home institution, W.A.S.D., to construct and implement our Wiki! They have done amazing work taking our ideas and turning them into a well-structured and beautiful Wiki that allows us to display our work in a clear and organized format. We couldn’t have completed"

Introduction and Motivation
As the field of Synthetic Biology emerged, so did arguments for standardizing the assembly methods involved in constructing plasmids. The archetypical example of such standardization is BioBrick RFC[10], introduced in 2003 by Tom Knight at MIT. BioBricks are stored on a standard plasmid, pSB1C3, which contains prefix and suffix sequences flanking the part. These sequences contain two pairs of 6 bp restriction sites (EcoRI+XbaI and SpeI+PstI), which can be used for both part assembly and quality control. BioBricks are intended to be well-characterized biological parts, such as genes or promoters, that are predictable, ready to use, and can be combined in unique ways. The rules of this assembly method also require that none of these sites are present in the parts themselves. This requirement can be an onerous imposition for iGEM teams using large, novel parts such as genes and operons obtained from environmental samples.
Fig. 1: The probability of at least one restriction site appearing in a sequence. The length at which a sequence will have a 50% and 90% likelihood of containing a site are displayed for the 50% GC content line.
Despite the problems with the current standard, it is clear that having a repository of genetic parts stored in a standard plasmid is useful to the field, especially for those with limited resources. Once these constructs are submitted into a database it is very easy for others to incorporate those parts into their own constructs because of the standardized submission; thus making collaboration much simpler.
We concluded that the problem with RFC[10] lies in the fact that it requires everyone who wants to submit a part to the database to accommodate a highly restrictive assembly method. In an era when many fast, cheap, and scarless assembly methods are available, mandating a single assembly method no longer benefits the community. It is easily demonstrable that as the size of your construct increases toward the size of an average eukaryotic gene, the chance of one of the four restriction sites popping up in your sequence is rapidly surpasses 50%. We concluded from this analysis that restriction site"

The main drawback of using lignocellulosic material is the structural components: lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose.
Unlike cellulose and hemicellulose, lignin is highly resistant to chemical and physical processes (Yang & Wyman, 2008). Therefore, in order to hydrolyze the cellulose and hemicellulose into fermentable sugars, they must be separated from the lignin structure, leading to the need for a pretreatment process  (Yang & Wyman, 2008).
Figure 4: Representation of the structure of the lignocellulosic material; how the pretreatment method separates lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose; and the outputs: the solid residue and liquid hydrolyzate. Retrieved from: https://www.e-education.psu.edu/egee439/node/653
The problem is that the most common pretreatment method which is dilute acid pretreatment generates byproducts such as hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), furfural and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that inhibit microbial metabolism, severely affect redox system and cause fatal disruptions in the cell system; ultimately leading to the death of the cell (Kumar & Sharma, 2017; Höck et al., 2013; Ask et al., 2013; Jönsson & Martín, 2016; Wang et al., 2013).
Figure 5: Our representation of how the furan output harms the bacteria and decreases the ethanol yield.
Our Solution
In order to enhance the ethanol fermentation process, we engineered ethanologenic E.coli strain KO11 to increase its tolerance to the toxic byproducts by integrating FucO and GSH genes.
Figure 6: Our representation of engineering the ethanologenic E.coli strain KO11 with our genes and creating Bio-E.
Figure 7: Our representation of Bio-E’s gene circuit.
The byproducts furfural and HMF act as thiol-reactive electrophiles and as a result, cellular glutathione levels get depleted in their presence, leading to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (Kim et al., 2013).
Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a kind of free radicals are molecules that are unstable due to their unbalanced electron state. These radicals are an inseparable deadly byproduct of anaerobic life and many other reactions essential to organisms. (Free Radicals and Reactive Oxygen"

About us
For the 2018 edition, it will be the third time when the UCLouvain participates, representing the only Belgian university to the competition! To meet the challenge, we decided to establish a great team compound of medical students, civil         engineers, bioengineers, biologists and IT specialists. Although we come from diverse faculties, we consider the differences of skills as a real added value and we have all something to say around the table. The responsibilities were         attributed according to our expertise and to our preferences.
During this adventure, we realized various enriching collaborations in particular a conference to the European Parliament including several other teams. Furthermore, to reach a bigger impact with our project, we were brought to meet various         leading players in particular in the field of resistance in antibiotics.
In a few words : “It is a great experience with great people”.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the Baltic Sea ecosystem is particularly susceptible to hazardous pharmaceutical substances [14].
One of the main substances that contributes to pharmaceutical pollution and its implications in the Baltic Sea ecosystem is the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX). SMX has been detected to be one of the most prevalent Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) not only in WWTPs’ effluent streams but in rivers located in the Baltic Sea region too, as presented in Figure 2 [14].
Figure 2. The top 20 pharmaceuticals measured in highest concentrations in river water samples in the Baltic Sea region [14].
It has been found that SMX may alter the catabolic function of bacteria comprising marine biofilms by altering their carbon source utilization (15). Changes on the transcriptional profile of genes associated to cell envelope and outer membrane were observed, as well as changes of genes involved in replication when freshwater biofilms were exposed to SMX concentrations as low as 1.94 nmol/L (16).
SMX has even been detected in flounders (Platichus flesus) inhabiting the Baltic Sea in concentrations exceeding 50 μg/kg, meaning that SMX can even move up in the food chain (14).
Additionally, SMX contributes to the rising problem of antibiotic resistance when it is released in the aquatic environment. It has been shown that resistance to SMX alone is one of the most common single antibiotic resistances and remarkably, is associated with the main cross-resistant profiles. Consequently, it becomes apparent that SMX except for its ecotoxicological effects also drives antibiotic resistance by its presence in aquatic environments (17).
Given that the removal rates of SMX in WWTPs are inadequate to substantially prevent or limit its release in the aquatic environment of the Baltic Sea, SMX’s occurrence in the region will continue to persist. In support to this conclusion comes the fact that the biggest WWTP in Sweden, Henriksdal, located in Stockholm, removes 48% to 73% of SMX existing in the influent (18). As Sofia Andersson, a process development engineer in Henriksdal WWTP stated when we visited the facilities in Stockholm: “Pharmaceuticals, in general, are not degraded in a WWTP, they go either to the effluent water or the sludge’’ (Study visit S Andersson 10 Jul 2018). A statement aligned with the monitoring data on the removal rates of SMX.
Altogether, for these reasons, we believe that SMX occurrence in an aquatic environment is one of the key drivers of pharmaceutical pollution in the Baltic Sea. It poses an"

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project#Tyrocidine_-_-_TEXT.html," genome of Bacillus subtilis.
Since our efforts to express tyrocidine have been hampered by difficulties in assembling all parts, we have tried to tackle the problem with a number of different experimental designs.
Cloning all of the parts described above into a single plasmid. 
Splitting the construct up into two fragments which could subsequently be cloned together by simple restriction enzyme cloning. Since the efficiency of the used method for assembling the fragments, the Gibson assembly, decreases with increasing length, this approach rules out assembly problems due to the length of the construct. 
Assembling all parts in one plasmid while cloning the XylR repressor in a second plasmid, which can be cloned together by using restriction enzymes cloning.
 
Cloning of Tyrocidine construct
The parts of the tyrocidine construct were amplified by PCR reaction and the linearized biobrick plasmid was cut by the adequate restriction enzymes. The parts were run on an agarose gel to verify their length and purified before they were assembled by Gibson assembly. The constructs were transformed into chemocompetent E.coli and grown overnight on an LB agar plate with the specific antibiotics. The reaction was controlled by amplifying the tyrocidine construct in the Gibson assembly mix by PCR or by doing a colony PCR of the transformants and running the amplified fragment on a gel. 
Discussion
Our efforts to express tyrocidine have been hampered by difficulties in assembling all parts. All parts could be assembled except for the xylose repressor xylR, which we have not been able to assemble with any of our various experimental designs described here .
The repressor has been amplified from the BioBrick BBa K733002 . The part has been used by the iGEM team of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology 2012, which indicates that the biobrick is functional. 
If given more time, the tyrocidine construct could be amplified with primers containing restriction sites and cloned into a plasmid which already contains XylR by classic cloning techniques, like the BioBrick BBa_K733002 or BBa_K733018. This plasmid could then be further amplified in E.coli and transformed into a B. subtilis strain which already has the xylose repressor integrated into its genome.
Furthermore it has to be taken into consideration, that the BioBrick used for the construct which was distributed might be defect. A problem to which our attention has been drawn during our participation in the Giant Jamboree in Boston.

Material
Resuspended DNA to be transformed
10 pg/µL positive transformation control DNA (e.g. pSB1C3 w/ BBa_J04450, RFP on high-copy chloramphenicol resistant plasmid. Located in the Competent Cell Test Kit .)
Competent cells (50 µL per sample)
1.5 mL microtubes
SOC media (950 µL per sample)
Petri plates w/ LB agar and antibiotic (2 per sample)
Equipment
Ice and ice bucket
Lab Timer
42°C water bath
37°C incubator
Sterile spreader
Pipettes and tips (10 µL, 20µl, 200 µL, 1000 µL recommended)
Microcentrifuge
Procedure
Resuspend DNA in selected wells in the Distribution Kit with 10 µL dH20. Pipet up and down several times, let sit for a few minutes. Resuspension will be red from cresol red dye.
Label 1.5 mL tubes with part name or well location. Fill lab ice bucket with ice, and pre-chill 1.5 mL tubes (one tube for each transformation, including your control) in a floating foam tube rack.
Thaw competent cells on ice: This may take 10-15 min for a 260 µL stock. Dispose of unused competent cells. Do not refreeze unused thawed cells, as it will drastically reduce transformation efficiency.
Pipette 50 µL of competent cells into 1.5 mL tube: 50 µl in a 1.5 mL tube per transformation. Tubes should be labeled, pre-chilled, and in a floating tube rack for support. Keep all tubes on ice. Don’t forget a 1.5 mL tube for your control.
Pipette 1 µL of resuspended DNA into 1.5mL tube: Pipette from well into appropriately labeled tube. Gently pipette up and down a few times. Keep all tubes on ice.
Pipette 1µl of control DNA into 2ml tube: Pipette 1µl of 10pg/µl control into your control transformation. Gently pipette up and down a few times. Keep all tubes on ice.
