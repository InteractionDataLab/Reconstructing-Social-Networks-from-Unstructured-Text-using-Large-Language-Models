Collaborations
We collaborated with two teams as part of the Human Practices: Singapore’s A team NUSGEM and Toulouse’s team INSA-UPS. We worked on three aspects of the Human Practices that seemed the most important to us in regards of synthetic biology: bioethics as well as the impact of our projects on the economy and society. See Human Practices .
We collaborated with the iGEM team Dalhousie Halifax NS by summarising a research article as requested. We summarised a recent study describing the developmental delays affecting children born with the congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) during the last Zika virus epidemic in Brazil. As a result of our collaboration, the team Dalhousie will publish selected articles, including ours, on the website Think of the PLOSibilities on October 18th. This web page was created in 2017 in an effort to promote open-access publishing. This publication thus provided the opportunity to inform the public about the social crisis emerging in Brazil and the special care those children are going to need.
We also collaborated with the team UCSC from the University of California Santa Cruz by sharing information and discussing extraction protocols. They suggested to use a riboswitch in order to detect our final products within our cell cultures. We, however, could not find one that allowed this detection for our products. Our team, on the other hand, suggested them to use HPLC to purify and detect their products. We also explained to them how we financed the HPLC column which is quite expensive and how we collaborated with a university laboratory which granted us access to their equipment to perform HPLC. Moreover, their team helped us get public input by sharing our ethical survey and answering it themselves.
We wanted to give the opportunity to the academic community to learn more about synthetic biology and its implications. To do so, we collaborated with UCLouvain to publicly present the conference Biotech4Change that was presented at the European Parliament. We scheduled a viewing session opened to the public on the campus and we were able to watch and interact during the event.
We initiated a collaboration with the team UAlberta from the University of Alberta. We contacted Julia Heaton in the interest of combining our technologies. The UAlberta team designed an adrenaline biosensor and we wished to use it to detect and quantify"

Software
Description
As a tool for the implementation of this construct design strategy, a software application was developed to aid in the appropriate consideration and placing of restriction sites in the master molecule, enabling a simultaneous consideration of the multiple factors affecting the efficiency of the final design. Enzyme compatibility, including digestion reaction conditions and cohesive end affinity, as well as their availability and other characteristics, are taken into account as the user points out the limits they wish to define for each module, so a future manipulation of the fragment can be carried out with as little enzyme as possible.
To aid in the generation of modular restriction sites in the master molecule. Multiple factors can be considered toward enzyme compatibility, including:
• Digestion reaction conditions
• Cohesive end affinity
• Availability
• Other characteristics
The user points out the limits they wish to define for each module, so future manipulation is possible with optimal enzyme use.
The software can be accessed here (opens in a new window).

Technische Universität Dresden: iGEM Goes Green
We edited and added to their ecology tips and have given them a lot of feedback of additions to their iGEM Goes Green pamphlet. We have employed many of the tips they had in their pamphlet in our own laboratory and at school. You can learn more about more about our contributions to the iGEM Goes Green cause in the designated subpage, iGEM Goes Green , showing how we have made a direct effort to help reduce our impact on the environment in the iGEM laboratory and beyond.
University of Bristol
University of Bristol iGEM provided mentorship and advice regarding our wiki. They helped us build our own website with their expertise. We tested a tool they created, IDE, or iGEM Development Environment, which hosts a local server. Regarding our website, Bristol iGEM provided help to us when we were stuck at a point where we did not know how to move forward in the HTML and CSS programming process. Thank you, Bristol iGEM!
Nazarbayev University Astana, Kazakhstan
Nazarbayev University, Kazakhstan provided mentorship and guidance about our project. They provided a varied perspective to help us broaden our scope. We also talked about their project and provided some of our own insight.
University of Nebraska-Lincoln
We made adjustments to their “Safety Cases and Their Use in iGem Competitions Feedback” that serves as a means to help other iGEM teams. These changes we made ultimately helped in the greater development of the document itself, and thereby clarified important purposes central to their cause.
Below is the feedback we gave to UNL on their Safety Cases.

E' NOTE effects on Human Practices
In this season, XMU-Software Team successfully created an assessable synthetic software E' NOTE for standardizing the logs of experiments and guiding new iGEMers to the world of synthetic biology.
We modularize the procedure of experiments in this GUI app which provides a series of standard tables of wetlab that investigators could use to record their schedules, graphs and other data easily. According to our design, every team member would be directed by our produce once they started their project. It means that our program largely reduces the difference among new iGEMers from different backgrounds and helps them to catch up with their project quickly. In the meanwhile, E' NOTE is also a communication platform opened to all participants not just in one team but furthermore, in different teams where they could share their electronic journals and experience. This new function dramatically breaks the barrier among countries and encourages students to transcend traditional discipline boundaries to push iGEM and synthetic biology forward.
In a word, our project strongly improves the development on different area and field.
Wall painting of Synthetic Biology
One of the Xiamen University' s main tourist attractions, Furong Tunnel which attracted more than 1,000 tourists per day, was chosen as the place for wall painting of the slogan and symbol of our iGEM team. Epitomizing the core elements of iGEM software team -- software and synthetic biology, our wall painting mainly represents a combination of biology and computer language. We believed that the safety needs a good cooperation between wet lab and dry lab. This wall painting had attracted hundreds of passengers to take photos for it. Furthermore, some of them asked us for more information about iGEM when we were painting.
iGEM paintings in Furong tunnel
Our Human Practice activities turned out to be a brilliant and unquestionable success. It provided a bridge for communication among domestic iGEM teams, a platform for showcasing the definite charm of synthetic biology, a joyful gathering of all the former, present, and of course future iGEMers.

At 19:00 we measured OD (our OD-device), absorption (spectrophotometer) and transmission (spectrophotometer) for 19 diltuions in the range of 2.5-100% from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and P. putida liquid cultures. Measurements were conducted in biological as well as technical triplicates. Aim of this experiment was the comparison of our OD-device to commonly used devices in terms of OD determination.
Prepartations for sensor-chip production the following day (2014-10-04) were done accordingly to the sensor-chip manufacturing protocol :
At 22:00 we prepared over-night cultures from B0015, K1319017 and K131026 by inoculating 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks each containing 50 mL LB medium for sensor-chip manufacturing the next day. The flasks were incubated for ~12 hours at 37°C on a shaker.
Our BioBrick K1319021 enables expression of the TEV protease inducible by the autoinducers of Pseumomonas aeruginosa. In order to construct this BioBrick, a Gibson assembly of K1319008 (IPTG-inducible expression of TEV protease) and the synthezised composite HSL-promotor J23101.B0032.C0079.B0015.J64010.B0034 activated by the respective autoinducers (HomoSerineLactones) was perfomed. Prior to this, we used two PCRs to linearize pSB1C3-K1319008, serving as backbone for Gibson assembly, and cutting out J23101.B0032.C0079.B0015.J64010.B0034 as well as adding adequate overlapping sequences.

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental"

SDS-PAGE
5ul sample is loaded in a 10% SDS-PAGE separation gel. We use 250kDa marker Precision Plus Protein™ Dual Color Standards #161-0374. Parameters can be seen in protocols.
According to the result of SDS-PAGE, target protein(285kDa) is not eyeable(line 2) compared with the negative control, native BL21 (DE3) strain without engineering(line 1). However, the recombinant tcdA1 strain turns red, indicating that it expressed mCherry, which can be confirmed in SDS-PAGE.
There are two possible explanations to the results. One is that the expression level of macro protein like TcdA1 is extremely low, which is unrecognizable in SDS-PAGE. The other is that TcdA1 didn’t express out of unknown reason.

We fed the same amount of termites separately with tcdA1-expressing BL21, tcdA1-expressing BL21 embedded with CNCs and control group mCherry-expressing BL21. For more details please go to our Protocol
However, only one termite died in six days and further improvements are needed. In addition, further works are needed on the large-amount expression of TcdA1.

Since 2011, iGEM has launched high school division. This is a good opportunity for high school students to experience the cutting-edge synthetic biology and it gives potential momentum to the development of biology.
More and more high schools have chosen to participate in iGEM during the past four years. The number of teams from Asia, especially from China is increasing slowly, but teams from Beijing remain unchanged. We think high school students are the best candidates to be the future iGEMers.
According to the official website of iGEM, 54 high school teams are participating 2014 jamboree, including 10 teams from China, two out of which are from Beijing. They are Haidian Foreign Language School and Beijing No.4 Middle School.
In order to encourage more students to participate iGEM, we visited The Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal University and gave them a lecture about iGEM on October, 17th. We also paid attention to social justice. As we are students from Beijing Normal University, we focus on education justice. Hence, we also paid visit to a school in the rural area of Weifang. We also have a Open Day of our lab. The details are as follows.

Edinburgh,2010,Team:Edinburgh#Bacterial#Red light producer_-_-_TEXT.html," on the wildtype to produce three different red light mutants. We successfully produced two red mutants of the firefly luciferase: mutants 356K and S284T. Both of these glow a nice red colour, but S284T glows much brighter and should be used for work where red coloured bioluminescence is required. Measurements of bioluminescence / OD showed that the S284T luciferase glows at about 35% of the brightness of the wild type green one. The 356K luciferase glows significantly less and is very hard to see, even in a dark room.
Problems
This part is one of the only ones with no major setbacks. The main problem will be attempting to activate the red light sensor with something which might not be bright enough. We did not have time to attempt this over the summer. If this does not work, it would be interesting to see if one can combine the codon optimised green luciferase which has been mutated for increased brightness with the mutations for red light.
Another evident problem is that the luciferin necessary for luciferase activity cannot yet be produced within an E. coli chassis, and thus needs to be added externally. This is mitigated somewhat by the development of BioBricked luciferin-recycling enzymes by Cambridge 2010 . The genes required for it are not currently known, but when they are discovered their addition to this system would improve it greatly.
BioBricks
Our BioBricks for this component of the project consist of the two successfully mutated luciferases S284T and 356K, and their composite constructs.
BBa_K322246 : firefly luciferase from Photinus pyralis, S284T mutant.

Figure 3 shows the results of the spectral analysis of the S284T mutated firefly luciferase BBa_K322246 . The emission spectrum is very close to that shown in the literature ( Figure 1 ), which proves that our mutations have been successful.
Two major points that need to be emphasised when using this BioBrick are the temperature sensitivity of the luciferase, and its pH sensitivity. During"

INSA_Toulouse,2013,Team:INSA Toulouse#contenu#lab practice#results#logic gates_-_-_TEXT.html," gate construct ( BBa_K1132032 ) is on chloramphenicol and the Bxb1 construct ( BBa_K1132027 ) is on kanamycine, we used 20 ng of each plasmid to transform E. coli and let it growth on chloramphenicol and kanamycine. Some colonies were red after transformation. However, in these conditions, the genotype of the gate (presence of the switch) is hard to verify due to the presence of two plasmids in the cotransformed strain. We therefore resorted to deeper characterization with fluorescence measurements. The positive control is a plasmid expressing constitutively RFP and the negative control is the co-transformation of XOR1 with a plasmid not containing any recombinases but on the same antibiotics resistance.
On the above graph, there is a clear difference when XOR1 is cotransformed with Bxb1 contrarily to the negative control. Analysis of the fluorescence of the strain demonstrated that the level of RFP production of the negative control is probably due to light diffusion by the cells and not real fluorescence. Therefore the in vivo switch of XOR1 is confirmed. The lower fluorescence of our strains compared to the positive control could be due to the presence of a weak promoter in front of RFP and/or the longer than usual distance between the promoter and the coding sequence.
Summary
The following table summarizes our results with the different logic gates and the recombinases. Green cells are successful experiments while gray ones did not give interpretable results and the blue ones have not been done yet.
Discussion
Our main achievement here is the demonstration that some of our designed gates can be switched using the specific recombinases. All the Molecular Biology constructions for this characterization have been successfully realized. Our characterization of the different gates demonstrates that the gates do not have any transcriptional leakage and that non-specific recombinases cannot switch the gates. The single switches performed by one recombinase were demonstrated with a quick and dirty, but amazingly efficient in vitro protocol, for AND1 and XOR1 gates. This further demonstrates the successful gate design. The absence of result with the other recombinases has been caused by wrong molecular constructions or by not ideal conditions of the in vitro protocol. For the XOR2 and AND2 gates, the absence of results is due to deficient FimE sites, the design of these gates can be used by replacing the FimE sites used in this project by other one which are working well. Our results show that the best solution for in vivo characterization of these gates would be to integrate them on the chromosomal DNA"

Introduction
Dynamic instability of microtubule during its lifetime is very interesting and worth researching. When a cancer patient is cured by taxol treatment fortunately, it should be owed to taxol's interaction with microtubule in dynamic growth process. So it's significant to explore principles of this process. We established a series of math works to clarify mechanisms of microtubule dilution system. Then we got data from wet parts of our project. Our model predicts observed data and phenomenon. In conclusion, we have presented a model that utilizes basic kinetics and it has been proved by experimental observations. We can use it to predict results in other conditions for guidance.
What we have done to analyze the dynamic process can be divided into three steps.
Fig.1 Our process
First we proved that taxol has a significant influence on microtubule growth by using the data which are provided from wet parts. Then we presented two differential equations model. One is an original differential equation model that can predict taxol’s influence on amount of microtubule. The other is a partial differential equation model expounding analytic solution. Since it’s hard to understand if someone lacks of necessary math skills, we build a program in MATLAB@ to visualize the kinetics in microtubule disaggregation.
Modeling theory
Microtubule is made up of 13 protofilaments. Now there is a widely accepted feature about the microtubule that microtubule has highly complicated dynamic instability. Under vitro cultures conditions, on the one hand, subunits will polymerize automatically to form fine structure when subunits condition is above the critical concentration; on the other hand, the microtubule will depolymerize into subunits when subunits condition is under the critical concentration. Apart from that, the single microtubule will always in the stage of aggregation and disaggregation.
Tubulin is made up of two tubulin monomers which are nearly the same as each other. These two tubulin monomers are named α tubulin monomer and β tubulin monomer. Microtubule"

Hello world! I am Ismail from Karachi, the city by the sea and I wish to to solve and revolutionize the way we deal with real world problems with the help of synthetic biology.
I enjoy reading about science, history, politics, and people who have changed the world. I love to travel, meet new people, have new experiences and I usually spend my free time either swimming and diving off the coast of Karachi, or having crazy road trips with my friends. I believe that anger and hate are two of humanity's most dangerous enemies, and the world can be a much better place if we all become a little more compassionate, open, and understanding. After all, we are all 99.9% the same — DNA–wise.

From these graphs, we can make a general conclusion that the toggle switch provides at least 35 minutes for the peptide accumulation. By the time the promoter P2 initiates the transcription and later efficiently translation of the mRNA of the tandem repeat genes (ll-37, gf-17, and grammistin-Pp1), the antimicrobial peptides are capable of being synthesized at high rates. When the repression of the promoter ptet (tetR) is relieved and the lysis gene acmA (AcmAm) starts to be transcribed, the antimicrobial peptides can be accumulated to high concentrations. Thereafter, enough amounts of antimicrobial peptides will be released to eradicate Staphylococcus aureus through the cell lysis.

Gluefilm
Glue is convenient but can become troublesome at times when it stick to everywhere. However with our gluefilm this will no longer be a problem. We intend to solve this problem by producing a glue that only becomes sticky after two fitted surface are put together mechanically for a period of time.
With biofilm stratification, glue production can be limited to anaerobic layer. This only requires a simplified version of our stratified biofilm circuit: the anaerobic circuit. We can use Mfp5 BioBrick made by the Berkeley 2009 iGEM team to produce glue:
In the microaerobic   environment and oxygen rich environment no reaction occurs. As a result, the   surface of gluefilm is not sticky. When a suitable surface is placed on the biofilm. oxygen   penetration is limited and thus all the e.coli will produce glue and the two surface will be   stuck together.
Gluefilm can be easily used in aqueous environment. It can stick two complementary surface together but is not sensitive to suface that has different shape because too much space cannot not isolate oxygen. Its tolerance to shape differences can be controlled by controlling biofilm thickness.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#17 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria have successfully taken up the vector plasmid and integrated it into it's own genome (in the correct area, i.e. in the amyE gene). It had been previously shown that the transformants were resistant to chloramphenicol, a property inherited from gfp-rrnb, and today it has been shown that the transformants have lost their ability to break down starch with amylase (a characteristic inherited when the gfp-rrnb plasmid integrates into the B. subtilis's chromosome at the amyE gene).
Stochastic Switch Team
Jess plates out the 'transformed' E. coli cells onto plates under aseptic conditions - not realising that the wrong procedure was used for transformations
This week the stochastic switch team will be rehydrating and transforming bricks from the distribution needed for the very last part of the lab work. The bricks we will be using are fror swapping the tester promoters in our synthesised stochastic construct with inducible promoters that will be linked to the rest of our project's systems.
Summary
Today we rehydrated 7 biobricks for the distribution: R0062; R0079; C0161; C0179; J44000; C0178; C0062.  Which code for: LuxR promoter; LasR promoter; LuxI; LasR; HixC; LasI; LuxR respectively.
We rehydrated the bricks and transformed E.coli (DH5alpha) cells however we used the wrong protocol and therefore needed to repeat the transformations on Tuesday 18th. We also tested our Bacillus integrations from last week. In a fume cupboard we exposed our starch plates to iodine vapour. No halos could be seen around the colonies, so it was confirmed that the GFP-rrnb had integrated into the bacillus chromosome at the amyE locus.

We plan to follow the protocol for Method A again, however, this time, keeping in mind to add 40ul of our stock lysozyme instead of just 4ul.
We will carry out the usual treatment of the spores with lysozyme, buffer solution and L-alanine. However, we will also attempt one extra ""treatment"", which is carrying out the same ""treatment"", but without the addition of"

- KP We had our presentation today. It was good practice and I learned some things to improve on in the future. There was some confusion on the quorum sensing, because we thought that HapR was a repressor and that it shouldn’t glow green in the presence of cholera. It turn out that it is the other way around and that it should glow green in the presence of cholera and red in the absence of cholera. That still doesnt explain why our tests are glowing green in the absence of cholera. We will have to work backwards and find out exactly what it is that we have. I feel that we have a clearer view of what we need to do. Also, I need to do more research other than wikipedia on lambda phage and its lytic and lysogenic cycles, because in our presentation, I said that that lambda enters the lytic cycle when it is in a cell that is healthy and lysogenic cycle when the cell is in trouble. That is what it says on wikipedia. Anyway, when I said that, I was told that I was wrong and that it is the other way around. I will look into that. We also hopefully got our quorum sensing system worked out now. All we need to do (once we figure out what we actually have in our plasmids) is add the cro transcription site after the GFP, and in the presence of cholera more cro will be produced and lambda will enter the lytic cycle!
- KK Today was our presentation in class. This is the link to our powerpoint presenation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14mUxVrUdTvNXaPGifXZs_lpXeMrFd-4CxSZ9o1bPqYo/edit#slide=id.p Our presentation gave a background for our project - though we ought to have been clearer WHY we want to use phage - and also the work that we’ve accomplished thus far in our group. We went a long time over in our presentation; it took a long time to explain the quorum sensing circuit, Lambda, and other things. Dr Grose sent an email with several suggestions for presentations in the future. They include being more concise with our time management and better coordinating within our group so that we don’t end up repeating ourselves. In the future we will be expected to be more polished presenters.

How to Improve the Yield of Bacterial Cellulose(BC)?
We refine the fermentation condition to improve the yield of BC.Based on related literature, we found out that pH is an significant element influencing the yield of BC. Therefore, we set up culture media with different initial pH and phosphoric acid solution as buffer. After measure the parameters of pH, residue sugar and the yield of BC after 10days of fermentation. We confirm the optimal pH for the fermentation of G. xylinus is around 5.
How to Stabilize the pH during Fermentation?
We have tried to express an alkaline producing gene in G. xylinus,but the growth of G.xylinus is poor. Therefore, we introduce E. coli to produce alkaline for G. xylinus. We have located a alkaline-producing gene called glsA and verified it in E.coli. In order to maintain the pH at 5, we found a part pASR and used it as the promoter of glsA. After verification, the data proves that our modified E. coli is capable of stabilizing the pH in the culture media at 5.
How to co-cuture G. xylinus and E. coli?
The growth conditions and incubation time for these two strains is very different.However, we can still determine an fermentation conditions,a formula of culture media, the inoculum amounts, and synergistic factors for these two strains with the sole purpose of a higher yield of BC. We conducted experiments to determine the optimal formula of culture media and inoculum amounts via response surface method(RSM)
Is there another way to improve the yield?
After establishing the co-culture system of E. coli and G. xylinus, the yield of BC has been improved. However, we still want to take a step further. Thus we choose to work on G. xylinus by overexpressing some key genes involved in producing BC and switched different promoters. When we co-culture the modified G. xylinus with E. coli,"

Week 10 (9/10 - 9/16)
1. After many ligations and transformations of part 5 into E. coli TOP10 without any result, it was decided to order new primers for Pfet3, to achieve annealing temperatures closer to each other.
New primers were also ordered for Tadh1, because the old primers did not match the yeast-DNA.
2. A Midi-Prep of the pSB1C3 vector with a following restriction digest was executed.
3. After a lot of unsuccessful ligations and transformations of part 2 in pGEM some colonies grew on the plate. Therefore a Mini-Prep with following restriction digest with XbaI and SpeI was performed. After a gel electrophoresis the right band of 1650bp was visible.
Part 2 was sequenced, but the primer SP6 and T7 did not match the DNA. Perhaps the insert (Part 2) was not in the pGEM vector. To achieve sequencing results custom sequencing primers were designed: The aim was to get a 150bp overlap in the center of the luciferase gene. The two sequencing results reach from the center of the gene to approximately 100bp outside of the gene.

Report regarding Bioproduction of Thepatical uses proteins
As a part of our Human Practises collaboration, we asked the Jurist of the Evry/Paris-Saclay team, Maxime de la Fouchardière, to help us about the legal issues that could come with the production of recombinant proteins in France and in general in the EU.
Studying and producing proteins for the research.
Our first question was about the production of recombinant proteins for the research purposes, would it create any issues. Maxime told us that research in France and moreover in Europe know actually very few regulations regarding the act in itself or its subject. This freedom is guaranteed by the French Code of Research. Besides this legal freedom, there are strong regulations regarding biomedicals studies, if they are conducted on animals or on human beings. Nevertheless, if GMO in research is authorized, their use and their deliberate release are strictly set by the French Environment Code. It means for us, that we can use and produce recombinant proteins as long as the GMO we use to produce them is safely kept.
But let’s not forget that our project is to produce recombinant proteins for human therapeutic use. Maxime then explained to us that in France the drug market is tightly controlled by the French Agency for Drugs Safety, the ANSM. According to the Fench Public Health Code, is considered as a drug every substance that is said to have any curative or preventive properties. To be authorized, a drug candidate must go through the Drug Marketing Authorization process or AMM in France. This a difficult procedure where the drug needs to fulfil precise criteria: it must have a favourable risk- benefit balance, have a therapeutic effect and have the same composition as the one registered in the application form. It must go through several phases of test on animals and humans where a lot of data will be gathered to provide the right information on the well-used of the drug.
This whole process can take up to 10 years and costs billions of euros.
However, it exists few case where a drug can be sold with no AMM:

2. Future scientists — from kindergarten to college
To propagate synthetic biology and share the fun of iGEM with future synthetic biologists, we organized a series of activities and lectures to students of all ages. Kindergarten: A mini-lab For kids in kindergarten, we host a mini-biolab to introduce some basic concepts regarding microorganisms in an interesting way. Moreover, we helped the lovely children cultivate their interest in synthetic biology as well as  inform them of the significance of keeping personal hygiene.  PS: Safety is guaranteed during this activity.
Canton primary school: Volunteer teaching When our team is working as volunteer teacher in rural areas of Canton, we also always bear the responsibility of sharing the idea of iGEM to more people. In Canton, to broaden their horizon to a grander world, our deliver introduced our project and some basic situations of iGEM to hundreds of seated students from primary school and junior high school. Though due to the limit of equipment and knowledge, they could not be iGEMers now, we have planted seeds of synthetic biology in their naïve heart which might grow up to a glorious tree one day in the future.
Senior High School: A newly set-up iGEM team
As for senior high school, we organized some lectures to introduce synthetic biology and our project. Firstly, we held a lecture in High School Affiliated to Fudan University (FDFZ). And this lecture gave us unexpected pleasure.
FDFZ is a well-known high school in Shanghai having a long history. And thanks to the abundant resource of Fudan University, the students of FDFZ can get easy access to top theory and technology in the science field and the atmosphere of exploring is really thick there. Thus, we reached a biology teacher in FDFZ discussing about holding a lecture in FDFZ and the possibility of establishing an iGEM high school team to help them participate in this creative competition. To attract more students to our lecture, we prepared beautiful posters for every classroom and made sufficient plans.     The outcome is more than fantastic. The number of students that came to our lecture is far over our expectation, and they were all eager to know iGEM and how to take part in it. Thus, we organized two interviews together with a teacher of FDFZ to select suitable students for future competition. In the interview, we asked about lots of things such as their basic knowledge of modern biology, experience in laboratory, the understanding of iGEM and their current ideas. To our surprise, some had attended"

Future Directions
We have also considered adding a fusaric acid detoxification component into our system in efforts to promote the survival of the E. coli. It was discovered that Klebsiella oxytoca has a three enzyme detoxification system that was identified and sequenced, fdt-1, fdt-2, and fdt-3. While it may be needed for testing purposes later, as the survival of E. coli in our induced conditions is invaluable, this part will not have an analog in our Bacillus amyloliquefaciens system, as B. amyloliquefaciens has its own mechanisms of protection.
As we hope to apply this basic design to a B. amyloliquefaciens vector, we also designed an analogous system. We found proposed sequences for promoters and ribosome binding sites native to B. amyloliquefaciens to swap out our E. coli sequences. For our sensing mechanism we plan to incorporate the operator phlF interacts with upstream of the antisense component. The same paper provided a proposed signal sequence for export used on the n-terminus of an amylase gene. We propose to put this sequence on the n-terminus of our TLP gene and remove the entire secretory system of our E. coli design. We also found a proposed terminator sequence. We plan to codon optimize the protein coding regions and adjust the antisense accordingly.

To test the feasibility of chosen droplet coalescence volume ratios simple MDA reaction were tested. First of all, single circular DNA templates were encapsulated into 10 pL droplets and the emulsion was collected in a 1 mL syringe. Then, these small droplets were reinjected into the microfluidic droplet merging device. At the same moment 40 pL droplets, containing the MDA reaction components without a DNA template were generated at a constant rate (~ 100 000 000 droplets per hour). The droplet electrocoalescence was initiated by applying 10 kHz 300 mV square electrical wave. Fused 50 pL droplets were collected and incubated off chip at 30oC for 6 hours. The analysis of reaction prove (16 Fig. 1), that the content of two compartments fused and single DNA templates were amplified as the product looks exactly the same as simple droplet MDA reaction.
Next, a control experiment, mimicking the full microfluidic workflow of CAT-seq was performed. First, 10 pL droplets, housing in vitro transcription and translation reaction reagents, pUC19 DNA, substrate nucleotides and purified esterase were generated and incubated in 37oC for 3 hours. After the incubation, the droplets were reinfused into the microfluidics merging device and fused with 40 pL droplets, containing MDA reaction reagents without DNA template and dCTP molecules. The merged emulsion was collected and incubated at 30oC for 6 hours. The DNA agarose gel analysis show that ONLY if extracted CAT-Seq esterase enzyme is added the DNA is amplified (16 fig., well +Est). These results conclude that substrate nucleotides, catalytically converted by the added enzyme in 10 pL droplets, are incorporated into the DNA strand by phi29 polymerase which was successfully added to the reaction by employing droplet electrocoalescence. It also proves, that any of the reagents, present in the reaction do not affect the stability of substrate nucleotides, as no product is seen when the esterase is not added.       Proof of droplet merging.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Lattice-Model_-_-_TEXT.html," that the difference in the resulting desiccation tolerance will become less pronounced at higher concentrations. This complies with observations by Boothby et al. 2017 , who observed that the curve was flattening out towards the saturation point after around 1 g/L.
Figure 14: a) Number of direct neighbours to Cas13a over a) CAHS 94205 and b) SAHS 33020 concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 g/L at 800 moves per chain at a volume fraction of 0.1. A logarithmic function was fitted to the data. The resulting R^2 of the fits is between 0.7 and 0.8 for both.
The normalised energy of CAHS 94205 and SAHS 33020 over concentration shown in Figure 15, shows a similar trend of a steeper slope and therefore better protection of Cas13a for higher TDP concentrations. Furthermore, we could observe in the development of the system’s energy over time, that the energy of SAHS 33020 simulations generally displayed a steeper slope than that of CAHS 94205 simulations for all concentrations except 0.1 g/L. This implies again, that of all TDPs SAHS 33020 is best suited to preserve Cas13a activity upon drying. It also means that SAHS 33020 will likely show better activity preservation at lower concentrations than CAHS 94205.
Figure 15: a) Normalised energy of the system against the number of iterations per chain for simulations with concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 g/L for a) CAHS 94205 and b) SAHS 33020 at 800 moves per chain and in a volume fraction of 0.1.
While we cannot give recommendations for higher concentrations, it appears that a concentration of at least 1 g/L of either CAHS 94205 or SAHS 33020 is advisable for drying Cas13a. However, SAHS 33020 seems overall best suited for drying Cas13a and may even confer enough desiccation tolerance to Cas13a at lower concentrations. This is important to keep undesired side effects, such as the activation of Cas13a through TDPs as observed in the experiments, at a minimum.

Rationale and Aim
Assess robustness of a GFP reporter construct in a range of environments.
Background Information
Successful advances in synthetic biology require development of precise and robust standards for measurements of parts and devices. Biological systems are extremely sensitive to cellular and environmental changes, therefore standardisation of gene expression is essential for reliable measurements. The lack of these standards presents a potential limitation to the development of Sensynova and other genetically engineered devices. To address this issue, we examined the variability found between identical genetically engineered devices under different environmental conditions and as a result of using different assembly standards.
Optimum DNA Assembly Standards
Gibson assembly proved to be the least time-consuming method to manually produce the synthetic GFP reporter gene compared to Golden Gate and BioBricks. The production of the GFP reporter construct using the Biobricks method was unsuccessful; the multiple steps involved, time consuming methodology and inefficient enzyme activities throughout this process lead to a limited number of parts that were able to be joined. Additionally, it was found that joining the smaller parts; the promoter and RBS was more challenging than joining the larger parts in the manual assembly. The Golden Gate assembly method successfully produced the GFP reporter construct, however it involved more steps and was more time consuming than Gibson assembly. A major limitation of this investigation was human error and a difference in user. The Gibson assembly construct had a higher GFP expression level after 24 hours, at 7.46x105 AFU/OD600 with the standard error of 6.51x104 AFU/OD600, compared to the Golden Gate assembly construct which had the final GFP"

In a few words, we proceeded by selecting the corn syrup fraction which was insoluble in 90% ethanol, but also soluble in 70% ethanol. This fraction was obtained by following a sequence of 5 operations, repeated 4 times:
Dissolving corn syrup in water
Adding ethanol to reach the desired concentration (three times 90% and once 70%)
Stirring
Decantation
Retrieving the liquid or solid phase, depending on the stage of the protocol using a centrifuge.
After the final retrieving, we had to dry our product. To proceed, we needed a freeze-dryer, device which is not in possession of the BBGM lab. We asked Professor Benjamin Elias, who runs another lab of the university, if we could use their own, under supervision, what he accepted. Thanks to this support, we could dry our “homemade pentamaltose” as we called it and continue our experiments.
Before using this maltopentaose in our experiments, we first had to test each of the produced batches to be sure only our positive control, with the leaky porin phenotype, ˝pIV*˝ could grow in its presence. To do so, we developed a very simple test: we prepared seven petri dishes with our M63 medium. The plan of the test was as follows:
1 dish received nothing (control dish)
1 dish received homemade maltodextrin and was inoculated with pIV phenotype
1 dish received industrial maltodextrin and was inoculated with pIV phenotype
1 dish received homemade maltodextrin and was inoculated with pIV* phenotype
1 dish received industrial maltodextrin and was inoculated with pIV* phenotype
1 dish just received industrial  maltodextrin
1 dish just received homemade maltodextrin
After an overnight incubation at 37°C, the seven dishes were checked and the batch was accepted if only the 2 dishes with incoulated pIV* expressing bacteria showed colonies and only them. The 5 others had to stay blank.
Even though this quick test was regarded as enough to pursue our experiments, we wanted to know the exact composition of our homemade product. So we sent samples to our Cargill contact who made chromatography analysis of them. The results are shown in the chromatograms at figures 2, 3 and 4:

Due to the wave length for                     measuring OD is 350nm, which is between the ultraviolet light and visible light, there is a high                     requirement for instruments and always leads to a huge deviation. As the high technologic                     instruments could not be owned by every laboratory in different areas, our fusion proteins which can                     detect the relatively accurate concentration of anti-microtubule drugs will have a broad application                     prospect.

UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," reaction is 340nm, however the NADH has a broad spectrum (see figure below).  Based on the differences in NAD and NADH spectral signals we hypothesized that the 365nm LED should provide a sufficient signal to detect the NADH to NAD conversion.
We purchased the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and compared NADH sensitivity on the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and EPOCH spectrophotometer.
Test #1: NADH Sensitivities
We first compared the linear ranges of the devices and found that there was a linear relationship between NADH concentration and absorbance between 6 micro molar and 400 micro molar for both devices. This means that both instruments had the required sensitivity for our assay under ideal conditions:
Protocol for colorimeter test #1:
All test solutions were prepared from a single freshly made 0.5 mM NADH stock solution. Each test solution was measured in triplicate on both the IO Rodeo colorimeter and the EPOCH spectrophotometer.
Test #2:  FabI Inhibition Assays (i.e. functional prototype)
In order to illustrate the utility of a device that meets our design requirements. We then tested to see if the IO Rodeo device could be used for an inhibition assay.  As illustrated in Figure below the NADH oxidation rate is significantly lower in the presence of nM triclosan levels than in the absence of triclosan.  The IO rodeo portable spectrophotometer is also able to detect various levels of triclosan inhibition...right out of the box!
This assay used triplicates of 2 nM P. falciparum FabI. 100 uM crotonyl-CoA, 100 uM NADH
We are now working in refining the assay to measure and improve robustness (accuracy when tested by multiple users), specificity (substrate and alternative inhibitors), and sensitivity (more detailed inhibition curves and optimization of conditions).  We will also be working with high school students to see if the assay can be used successfully in high schools.

Can we detect enzyme inhibition in waste water?
In order for our show we had a functional prototype, we needed to show enzyme inhibition in waste water. We performed this experiment using triplicates of 15 nM P. falciparum FabI. It appears as if life is a bit slower in waste water…
This shows that our biosensor works in waste water!

Title：Simulating genotype-phenotype interactions using Functional-Structural plant models
Lifeng Xu College of Computer Science & Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, 310023 Hangzhou, China
Email: lfxu@zjut.edu.c n
Crop breeders and breeding scientists presently face a multitude of problems and challenges: Cereals, namely rice, maize and wheat, constitute the basic staple foods and the demand for them is rising with an ever- increasing human population. Therefore, understanding plant growth and morphology is particularly of great importance to agronomy. Modelling efforts within the Functional-Structural Plant Model (FSPM) domain are mostly concerned with the acquisition, transport and use of matter and energy from sources to sinks through pathways dictated by plant structure, such as light, carbon, water and soil minerals, and how this affects growth and morphology of the resulting plants. Genotype-phenotype models of crops in the form of spatially explicit models of morphogenetic development, based on the interaction of compartmentalized physiological processes, and coupled with quantitative genetic information, can be used to better understand crop systems and ultimately to aid breeding of new crop plant varieties. In order to illustrate our approach of simulating genotype-phenotype interactions, an FSPM of rice will be described here. The rice model can simulate growth and morphology of rice plant from germination to seed maturity, in combination with selected ecophysiological processes including photosynthesis and sink functions based on a common assimilate pool. Furthermore, it was linked to a quantitative genetic model, thereby simulating the genetic reproduction processes to form new rice population. The rice FSPM reproduces plant architecture, morphology and the QTLs for certain traits (in this case: plant height) of rice from germination to maturity. The potential use of the model with further extension would be as a tool in domains of FSPM education and scientific research.

Caltech,2010,Team:Caltech#Human Impact_-_-_TEXT.html,", fruitfully. Teams contribute to the overall body of available genetic parts, and can protect their innovation by patenting their unique procedure or a few parts specific to their application.
How does this apply to 3D printing, for example?
In our case, Caltech owns the IP for our project, since the entirety of the work was funded by the institute. However, each team member is eligible to receive a fraction of any profits derived from the technology that Caltech receives. However, we are submitting all the parts we produced to the Registry, meaning any other team can build on them. The only restriction is on the 3D printing procedure itself, which is protected by provisional patent: CIT 5637-P.
The Bottom Line:
We hope that our example will become the accepted means for teams to protect their innovation while still making their parts available for use by others. The Registry is predicated upon principles of generosity and openness, and its success is dependent on the willingness of teams to both utilize its resources and submit their own additions. However, there is no reason why this philosophy should be incompatible with entrepreneurial development, as with any other open-source system.
We believe that the BioBrick™ Public Agreement is a good step in the direction of a sustainable Registry and we hope future teams wishing to protect their work will consider doing so in a way that does not inhibit future iGEM innovation. That is, we hope they avoid patenting primary gene sequences whenever possible, and instead submit as many high-quality bricks to the Registry as possible. Rather, teams should work to patent their particularly innovative process. If a gene patent seems unavoidable, we encourage them to grant a free license to the Registry to distribute their brick for purely nonprofit research purposes.

Docking Domain
Overview
The fidelity and efficiency of acyl transfer on the interfaces of the individual PKS proteins is thought to be governed by helical regions, termed Docking Domains   (DD), which are located at the C-terminus of the upstream and N-terminus of downstream polypeptide chains. The length of docking domain is about thirty to ninety amino   acids (Figure 1) [1]. It not only participates in the regulation of protein function, but also completes the transshipment of upstream intermediate, and   forecasts its vast prospects in the development of new drugs [2].
There are two types of docking domains. Class 1 is from actinomycetes and mucous bacteria while class 2 is from cyanobacteria mostly [3]. Class 1 DD is   also in the form of dimer just like the polyketide synthase. At present, the class 2 DD is seen to be a genetic engineering tool because of its shorter length and   tight combination, and it will has great application prospect for deeper researches.
Docking domain consists of ACP-side docking domain (ACP DD) at the C-terminus of the upstream and KS-side docking domain (KS DD) at the N-terminus of downstream. The   two parts locate in the downstream of ACP and upstream of KS respectively, and lie in the different modules. Each DD has formed specificity of the binding because it   has specific connection site. Namely each docking domain is unique in the whole polyketone synthesis pathway. With this important feature, we can ensure the connection   between adjacent modules does not have randomness, which makes the product unique.

Patent application
In order to make our products for the market, and ensure our intellectual property rights can be fully protected, we visited the Taiwan Ministry of Interior Trade Patent Commissioner, Mr. Cho-han Wu. We explained the current situation of our products, and to asked a lot of questions about Taiwan and US patent law. In the course of the discussion, we understood the importance of the use of patent protection, and we also learned a lot of about patent law.
Future plan
For the machine learning, we will collect more data to make the prediction model more accurate.
For the APP, we will beautify the interface and also try to make our product allow personalization and customization.
For the device, we will make our product able to load a large amount of consumptive materials at once and add extra space for activating them.
For the bacteria detected, we will make our product detect more varieties of bacteria which affect our oral condition.
After we finish improving about our product, we will try to expand the market.

While exchanging knowledge with Saint Joseph Istanbul iGEM Team from Turkey,  we talked about our projects and since it’s their first                  year experiencing iGEM, we gave them advice mostly on how to characterize a part. We also helped them in the means of medal criteria and                  how to finish their work on time; we suggested them to start filling both their wiki page and pages in the registry. In order for them                  to interact with us any time they are in need, we exchanged our phone numbers and kept in contact at all times.

iGEM 2018 Turkey Meet-up
With the attendance of all iGEM 2018 Teams from Turkey, we held a meet-up in our school's conference center on the 8th of September, 2018.
Our goal in this meet-up was to get to know iGEM teams from Turkey, to gain helpful new insights, polish everyone's presentation skills,                  and to exchange advice, tips and thoughts.
Since it's the first time that another high school iGEM Team from Turkey  will be participating iGEM this year, we were especially enthusiastic                  to have Saint Joseph HS iGEM Team as a guest, and share our experiences with them.

Increasing knowledge for master students
Ragnhild held a lecture the 16th of August for master students. It was held at Kristine Bonnevies house at the University and there were also pizza afterwards.
Learning material for high school students
The UiOslo team have used the iGEm season to teach synthetic biology to kids and high school students.  Because of this we have generated a 3D file for a bacteria. The idea behind this was to generate a bacteria that could be taken apart so one could have a look inside the bacteria, of what it contains and how it is build up.
The 3D-model is made in the online 3D-modelling software at https://www.tinkercad.com. The 3D-  model represent a E. coli bacterium and shows its DNA, plasmid, ribosomes, pili and flagellum. Unfortunately because of time limitations and technical difficulties, the 3D file was not printed.  However the 3D-model is available online, and we have given the file to the “Biologylab” at Department of Biosciences. Hopefully, they can use another printer and use it for educational purposes. The 3D-model represent
a E. coli bacterium and shows different parts which can be helpful during lectures about e.g. protein synthesis and gene transfer.
In addition to this, we contributed to generate electron microscopy pictures of our clinical isolates. These pictures will be used to educate high school students and contribute to increase knowledge    about biology among high school students. The bacteria was fixed and sent down to the electron microscopy department at UiO. These amazing pictures is made by Antje Hofgaard who works as an senior engineer at the department.
Public engagement
We have done a lot to get public attention about iGEM, but also about us and antibiotic resistance. We have used social media, we have a blog, radio, magazines, different newspapers and even published a comic book to hand out. We have also gotten help from the headmaster to write about us in his blog, and we have also made it on different webpages.

Background
To ensure that our bacterial won’t do harm to both people and our environment, we need to put a set of kill switch system into the bacteria, so that we can control the growth of it by changing the content of culture medium.
In our project, we trigger the kill switch of E.coil. by adding IPTG into the culture. IPTG can induce the expression of gene coding Limulus anti-LPS factor (LALF) downstream the lactose operator, so that the growth of E.coil. will be inhibited.
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Integrated Practices#ED_-_-_TEXT.html," they have experienced it directly themselves. Obviously this is only on a small scale, but by asking students from across the UK for their experiences we may be able to begin to understand how widespread the problem is.
As a man, I have never experienced sexism towards me.
This was a feeling that was reflected in many of the interviews with male students, however for the majority, they still had more to say. Many of the male students interviewed, cited the gender inequality they observed as being prominent in the senior positions, with one student saying that “there is not enough female figures of authority in science, specifically in biology”. This is something that is easily observed within the university: when looking at professors in bioscience the majority of them are male. However this doesn’t mean that nothing is being done to change this, or that nothing has been done already to encourage more women into senior roles and this is something that we look into further with the second video.
Interestingly, male physics students had another view of gender inequality in science: one student saying “I was surprised by the amount of women in physics, even though it makes up a very small proportion” - they later went on to clarify by saying “I thought it would be less”. This is very poignant as it is an area physics governing bodies are trying very hard to address. There seems to be an innate understanding that fewer women are likely to take up physics at a degree level and we have heard stories of males being taken aside to discuss the prospect of physics degrees, with females not even considered by teachers.
The view that stood out the most came from a female student the University of Exeter’s team.
I definitely notice I get treated differently to some of the other males in the team.
Through highlighting the opinions of students in both our team and universities across the country, we have brought the issue of gender inequality home. There is no doubt that some students at University do not believe there is an issue, however the fact that there are people who have experienced it directly and students who have observed it indirectly, shows that there is at least an understanding of a wider problem. This initial understanding acts as a platform for us to talk to those at the university who are working on improving equality and diversity within Biosciences and Physics, as well as further emphasise the statistics that support the case for there being inequality in these fields.

The CSE was used to get the public involved in trying to find bacteria that could live on, and degrade expanded polystyrene (EPS). We asked them to bury a strip of EPS in the ground and leave it for a length of time (around 2 months), to find out whether bacteria might establish colonies, thus indicating that a colony could at the very least bind to, and possibly degrade EPS. The kits were Risk Assessed, and a copy of the assessment was included in the kit, along with instructions, a strip of EPS, and a self seal bag to put the EPS into. This was all contained in a stamped, addressed envelope at a cost to the public of £2 (+50p postage if bought online via our blog to cover the cost of sending the kit to the person). We recently had our first batch of kits back, ready to analyse.
Frequently asked Questions:
> How deep should I plant the strip? If you are wondering how deep to plant the strip, you can plant it as deep as you want. The main thing to keep in mind however is being able to re-locate the strip ready to send back to us (can be aided by the photo). The small segment at the square end (about 2cm) also needs to be accessible to the microbes we are locating so this part needs to be in contact at the least.
>Should I protect the strip from removal? If you have children, dogs or gardeners it is advisable to plant it so that it cannot be seen, be that deeper in the soil so it is not visible, in harder to reach places such as under bushes or secluded areas, or covered by a plant pot. (Remember to take the photo to help re-locate).
> How long should I leave it for? Each experimental kit has a due date on them for you to dig up and return the strip. If you are unable to make this deadline, it is best to leave the experiment in for longer rather than sending it in sooner.
>Where should I plant it? You can plant the strip in any location you like, be that your garden, allotment, near a pond or in a plant pot. In order to increase your chances of finding the microbe it is best to plant more than one kit , sampling different areas of your garden which may have different microbial habitats (multip"

We talked to him about the idea of taking our biomaterial 3D printer to space, this is an exciting thought for us, as we thought that if we want to colonise Mars, let’s not start polluting right away. Although he warned us about the difficulties of growing bacteria in space. We also asked him advices about how to launch a startup because of his position as founder of SynBioBeta, and among every thing he said, one drew our attention: “Just do it”.
Dan Widmaier
Dan Widmaier is the CEO of Bolt Threads, a company working on producing silk fiber by replicating the process used by spiders. Spider silk has amazing properties such as high tensile strength, elasticity, durability and softness. We talked to him during the Hello Tomorrow summit in Paris, and discussed our biomaterials mostly, but also the cell-free system. Indeed, he was interested in our cell-free system, however he made some comments. While it is a great experimentation and prototyping technology, it is somewhat limited for mass market commercial applications.
Anne Meyer
Anne Meyer’s lab recently created an additive-layer bacterial 3D printer with a affordable modified 3D printer. Anne is interested in using her printer for both creating biomaterials with new physical properties like graphene and for research applications like studying biofilm. Our interview with Anne gave us great insight on how bioprinter will soon find meaningful real-world applications.
Fundamental research
We looked into possible applications of our 3D gene expression control in various field in biology, health, food industry and even space! We believe our tool can really bring a difference compared to existing technique, this is why we seeked the input of professionals to discuss the large number of applications.
Brain Control
Optogenetics is closely linked to neurology as activating individual neurones by shining lights allow for a fine resolution mapping of the function of the nervous system.
Developmental biology
Conditions of the microenvironment are key to determining cell fate and small changes result in large variation of the morphology of a mature organism. Although large advances have been made in the field of developmental biology thanks to higher resolution imaging, a lot remains to be understood about the underlying molecular mechanisms and signal diffusion interactions. Being able to dictate specific 3D locations of activation of genes determining developmental processes would allow a more comprehensive overview of each gene and the mechanisms of interactions between them.
Hence, we thought that by using our tools to light activate certain cells within an organism for targeted gene expression,"
Fudan-CHINA,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," lies in achieving the same level of system output with fewer resources (i.e., lower chain generation rates).
What we do
Based on the above, this is the main content of our modeling:     • We establish a differential equation model based on the system mechanism described above. As is partly veriﬁed by our wet lab , we quantitatively prove that the maximum of dynamic range can be reached by changing the production rates of PC and TC chains[1] and demonstrate how to do it.   • For the high background noise from wet lab results, the model above successfully explains why the excessively high chain production rates enhance background noise. Furthermore, we provide a method, that can be used in further experiment, to simultaneously achieve greater saturated output and lower background noise.   • We also establish a model based on birth-death process, so that we quantitatively prove that the dynamic range is negatively correlated with protease cleavage ability under normal condition, which gives a explicit guidance on further experiment.   • Furthermore, We advance the birth-death process to a more general continuous-time Markov chain, which demonstrate that it is feasible to increase system efﬁciency by changing binding abilities, as long as we design a dedicated degradation pathway of free TC chains without transcription factor. What’s more,we obtain a method to improve system efﬁciency while preventing system saturation output from decreasing. This will be one of the ideas for our further experiment.
Production rates
Introduction
In the wet experiment, we can control the expression rates of TC chain and PC chain by regulating the content of plasmids transferred into the cells, and then indirectly control the quantitative ratio of the two chains on the membrane. Although the expression rate and the number of receptor chains are not strictly proportional, there is no doubt that there is a positive correlation between them.   We establish a system of differential equations that can reflect the reaction mechanism of the entire system in detail and use it to quantitatively prove that the dynamic range can be improved by changing the production rates of PC and TC chains, under normal condition. In addition, via the model, we provide a specific method of changing the two values mentioned above.    In the first place, we assume the operation of the system can be described by a seire of chemical equations, and obtain the corresponding differential equations, through law of mass action. The production rates of the two chains can be balanced with a dilution rate that all substances in the system have, so the system can reach a stable state after a while. The initial differential equations and a simulation with appropriate parameters are both shown in Figure "

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook-R_-_-_TEXT.html," use a technique to measure the weight of an object using a coat hanger, and depending on weight, calculate the amount of lactose inside that container. This would be the dairy that the people have on hand. Depending on weight, we will have a chart that says how much lactose is in that container. The people will be guided to portion a certain amount of the lactose into an ice-cube-like container and grow the yeast in there. Because there will be a specific amount of lactose in each section, and our promoters are sensitive to galactose, our yeast will stop producing progesterone after it consumes all of the lactose.
We have found multiple ways to insert our genes into Y.lipolytica and we made pros and cons lists for each method to decide which one would be the most effective and time-efficient. The methods are regular homologous recombination using homologous arms on our plasmid, EasyCloneYALI: CRISPR/Cas9‐based technique for engineering Y.lipolytica specifically, and Drag and Drop cloning.

We confirmed that using a constitutive promoter would be better than an inducible one, at least initially, because it will use up energy to keep producing progesterone after the growth media has been consumed. Our website has gone through several prototype designs, but it seems like we may be getting close to a final design we would like to use to represent our work. One fun feature that is a work in progress is an interactive map that will, when moused over, provide information about different countries and our outreach there. We have also been working on finalizing our logo, which will include the name of our project: PoPPY. PoPPY stands for Portable Progesterone Production in Yeast, an accurate description of the goal of our project. A low this week for the team was realizing that most of the survey responses received from one of the groups we reached out to about contraceptive accessibility were unreliable, since many answers between supposedly different women were the exact same, word for word. However, we hope that this was a problem specific to the group, and not the norm. We have some more legitimate groups who are willing to send us photos of the women filling out the surveys, and we hope to see good results. A high for the team this week was finally understanding how Cre-Lox recombination, a method that we will use in"

Goettingen,2016,Team:Goettingen#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"
To test the physiological function of our Synporter protein, different assays for B12 detection were performed. For the assays, the periplasm and cytoplasm fractions of the cells were examined.
The periplasm fraction of the producing cells was gained by centrifugation.
5.1. Microbial Assay
The microbial B12 assay relies on the growth diameter of the E. coli DSM4261 strain on an agar plate, in dependence of the Vitamin B12 (or methionine) concentration in the medium.
For this purpose, agar plates with synthetic Guttman medium (free of B12 and amino acids, 1.5% agar-agar) were prepared. The E. coli detection cells were grown in liquid synthetic Guttman medium supplemented with selected amino acids (no methionine) and Vitmamin B12. Afterwards, the cells were washed with PBS buffer three times, in order to make the cells virtually free of Vitamin B12. The cells were resuspended in PBS buffer, and mixed with warm, liquid Guttman medium (free of B12 and amino acids, 0.8% agar-agar), and then poured on the prepared agar plates. For the assay, small paper platelets (usually used for antibiotic tests) were placed on the top agar layer, and soaked with differently concentrated calibration solutions of Vitamin B12. The plates were incubated overnight, and the diameters measured after 16 h. From the different diameters, dependent of the Vitamin B12 concentration, a calibration curve was calculated.
In order to determine the B12 content of our periplasm and cytoplasm fractions, the assay plates were prepared exactly as described above, and paper platelets were soaked with the respective solution. Comparing to the calibration curve, the diameter indicates the B12 amount.
5.1. Photometric Assay
In order to determine the Vitamin B12 concentration of a sample photometrically, the corrinoids in our samples needed to be converted into dicyano cobalamine. This was achieved by treating the samples with sodium cyanide or potassium cyanide. Other components like proteins and lipids which would distort the measurements, can easily be separated by precipitation through acidic and basic conditions as well as heating and subsequent centrifugation.
After measuring a spectrum of the supernatant from 350 to 650 nm, the Vitamin B12 concentration could be calculated with help of the extinction coefficients of dicyano cobalamine.

A simple worm construct:
Promoter Brick
Protein-Coding Brick
3' UTR Brick
We expect that future worm BioBricks will be submitted to the Parts Registry just like every other standard biological part, and use the conventional ligation standards such as Standard 10, which we utilized for our project. In the future, this will make sense to extend so that it fully supports protein fusions through the use of introns to conceal scars by placing intron splice sequences at the starting and finishing parts of fusion-compatible bricks, or by using special primers to insert the intron sequences during PCR to provide more control over which ends of the bricks are concealed. For now, however, this article will concentrate on the format we’ve put into practice.
Promoter Format
The majority of C. elegans promoters used in research don’t draw a distinction between the cis-acting recognition sites used during the RNA transcription process and the upstream region of the transcript used during polypeptide translation, instead combining the two and labelling that the promoter. Promoterome , for example, goes as far as including the start codon itself in its definition of the promoter. While this is simplistic for synthetic biology’s purposes, for the time being we have largely chosen to keep this format, although to cope with the scarring caused by ligation, we do not include the start codon in the promoter, and so typically remove the three final nucleotides of the promoter sequence.
Coding Brick Format
The coding brick, in our format, extends from the start of a synthetic Kozak sequence , past the start codon, through the coding DNA itself, and ends with the stop codon. It may contain introns. The Kozak sequence we typically use are the nucleotides GCCGCCACC placed immediately before the start codon. This improves translational efficiency, and can be altered to provide the additional flexibility of controlling expression from within the protein-coding component of a complete gene. Note: under certain circumstances in C. elegans, the UGA codon does not stop translation, but instead appends the rare amino acid selenocysteine. While this has not impeded us so far, it may be preferable to use UAA or UAG instead to be safe.

Generel example on a normal PCR-program
98°C for 2:00 - Denaturing and warm up
98°C for 0:10 or 0:20 - Denaturing after each cycle
59°C for 0:30 to 1:00 - Annealing
72°C for 2:00 - Elongation
Go to number 2 - repeat 35
72°C for 5:00 - Final extension
End
Always use heated lid and set the machine to wait until the lid have the right temperature. If not default set to lid temperature to 104°C. The method will usually be changed with regard to annealing temperature and/or elongation temperature; depending the length of the PCR-product. Others methods can also be used such as ""ramp-PCR"" , ""touchdown-PCR"" , ""touchUp-PCR"" , ""gradient-PCR"" or a combination of these. In addition to these often used standard procedures there are tons of methods to do and improve your PCR and also for cloning and quantification purpose, e.g. Nested-PCR, Hot start-PCR, quantitative-PCR, Assembly-PCR and many more.

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Cell Display_-_-_TEXT.html," the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. It seems promising as a carrier of enzymes. Fusions are carried out at the INP C terminal.
Three strategies for INP-based cell display. After Van Bloois et al (2011)
Van Bloois et al (2011) speak highly of INP, and claim that it can be displayed at a copy number of around 100,000 copies per cell without affecting viability.
INP has major domains at its N and C terminals, as well as a number of internal repeating domains. There seem to be three strategies for using INP (see figure):
Use the entire INP protein; fuse at its C terminal
Delete the INP internal domains; fuse at its C terminal
Delete all of INP except the N domain; fuse at the new C terminal
BBa_K265008 should be suitable for the 2nd strategy.
Linkers
It is probably desirable to create linkers between the carrier and the protein of interest, to give the proteins space to fold. The new assembly protocol that we are investigating — BioSandwich — should be ideal for this.
Complete system
The complete 3 cellulase system could contain a promoter, driving expression of three coding fusions:
INP -- (Linker) -- endoglucanase (e.g. BBa_K392006 )
INP -- (Linker) -- exoglucanase (e.g. BBa_K392007 )
INP -- (Linker) -- β-glucosidase (e.g. BBa_K392008 )
An alternative: protein chains
The protein chain idea: a long fusion protein is created with INP fused to (say) 3 enzymes in a row...
Instead of making three different fusions, it might be possible to make one fusion that had all three cellulase enzymes linked together; we call this ""beads on a string"". As it happens, the exoglucanase (Cex) and the endoglucanase (CenA) both have a cellulose-binding module (CBM), but they are at different ends of the sequence. So here's the plan:
Create a fusion of:
Exoglucanase (catalytic domain) -- CBM -- Endoglucanase (catalytic domain)
This can be done by homology or by introducing an NcoI site into both Exo- and Endoglucanase at the appropriate locations, then ligating and doing fusion PCR.
We can then use KpnI in a similar way to attach a β"

d-AuNPs Testing: d-AuNPs stability upon salt
The dAuNPs are tested for their stability under different salt concentrations. 20 µL of the d-AuNPs solution, 20 µL MilliQ and 20 µL NaCl solutions (range from 0 mM to 2000 mM) were added in one of the 96 wells on the 92 wells plate. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.
The aggregation of d-AuNPs occured at a final NaCl concentration of 1M*⅓ = 333 mM, but increased when adding more salt. At a final concentration of 2M*⅓=666 mM NaCl, the aggregates were the most intensively changed of color. One mistake was made by"

Concordia,2015,Team:Concordia#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Other parts are on their way and may be ready any day by now. A second round of primers have been ordered and will be used to amplify the last components of our scaffold. The iGEM compatible expression vector now has its final design and its components will be ordered soon. Also, we started working on our fusion enzymes by amplifying their docking domain; while the enzymes themselves are still being discussed. α-galactosidase is the latest idea for our digestive probiotic bacteria !
Dry lab work:
We started a project on gofundme.com in order to raise money and send the whole team to the Boston Jamboree, and our sponsorship package will be reviewed and send in the next few days. We finally presented our entire project organization to our supervisors and are currently looking for teams to collaborate with. For this purpose, we contacted the other Quebec team, iGEM Sherbrooke, to organize a regional meeting. We could also extend to others teams by attaching their enzymes on our scaffold. Finally, we will officially be at the international startup festival hosted in Montreal Saturday the 18th of July to make demonstrations on Biology and talk about our project.
Week 3
Wet lab work:
Work finally paid off this week in the iGEM Concordia lab. Our troublesome GBlocks parts are turning around and after troubleshooting for bad antibiotics in our plates we succeeded in inserting XDock2,  CBD, coh2S1 and CWAm6 into their backbone, making it five parts ready to be submitted to iGEM. Our first sequencing order also confirmed the insertion of our promoter from last week. Assembly of the scaffold construct can therefore start and the last missing parts will be ready soon. Concerning our iGEM compatible expression vector, the first part is now in its backbone and we only need the MCS from IDT to be ordered and inserted before we can use it.
Dry lab work:
On the dry lab aspect of our project, our sponsorship package has been modified and reviewed all week and a final version is to be expected soon. A samosa and cupcake sale was organized during the week in the university and in the streets of Montreal in order to raise money to go to Boston. Also, our intervention at the Montreal International Startup Festival under the Bricobio booth was a success! Kids loved our strawberry DNA extraction and we had a chance to reach out of the community and explain our project. Finally, we are still looking for iGEM teams ready to collaborate with us, especially if they have are working on an application for our extracellular scaffold or our iGEM compatible expression"
Fudan-CHINA,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"-human ones, the SynNotch system first realized orthogonality of biosensors used in cancer cell therapy.
However, receptors like CAR and SynNotch can only recognise antigens on cell surface. According to data of tumour markers published by National Cancer Institute (NIH), the 35 mostly used tumour markers in clinical practises include 21 which are mainly inside the blood. Because of the fact that the cell therapy biosensors mentioned above can only target cell-surface antigens, and that the range of these antigens is limited, all of these systems are actually circumscribed in both researches and clinical trials.
To break the limitation, we decide to develop a cell-therapy transducer system that is able to recognise free ligands. By importing a totally orthogonal signal transducer, we successfully extend the range of recognisable tumour markers to both cell-surface and free antigens.
To demonstrate our work, we choose non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for a specific case of application. NSCLC morbidity has been increasing to top in the world these years, occupying 85% of diagnosed cases of lung cancer5. However, screening for NSCLC by CT has a high misdiagnosis rate, not to mention the fact that the relapse rate and mortality are both considerably high. As a consequence, it's urgent for us to develop a new method for its treatment.
We want to find certain antigens to indicate development of NSCLC. And the first one, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is a broad-spectrum tumour marker, with the sensitivity to NSCLC of 85%5. By representing the level of angiogenesis, which is a critical stage for tumour to develop and metastasis, VEGF can be a reliable indicator for lung cancer.
85% sensitivity is ideal, but still not enough. That's why we also look at a more straightway marker, D-Dimer. Being the smallest fragment from degradation of fibrous protein, D-Dimer can be an ideal indicator of NSCLC development6, thus help us to design a cell therapy treatment to prevent NSCLC from relapse.
By recognising VEGF and D-Dimer, our system – the Synthetic Transducer Engineering Platform (STEP) – can be activated for treatment of NSCLC. The detailed design and its application can be viewed in the project design and applied design pages.

Questions I
Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab?
Working in the lab entails certain risks for lab members. Our project does not raise specific chemical and biological safety issues beyond those risks normally involved in working in a microbiological environment of biosafety level 1. Our experiments are carried out in a S1 lab minding general precautionary measures and safety standards. This implies wearing cloves, potective glasses and lab coats. We are using E.coli strains TOP10 and JT2 (MC4100-derived) for our experiments, both of which are not pathogenic. All material contaminated with bacteria is autoclaved at 121 °C and 1 bar overpressure.
Our lab work also includes using UV light to trigger our sensor. UV light is a known carcinogen and can cause skin irritation, therefore special"

However, miRNAs present in saliva are less well documented. Saliva may also be less accurate as its composition can change depending on what was recently eaten so we didn’t look much more into this, but it could be a good area for further research.
Another cost involved in the test is the upfront equipment costs - see how we made a combined densitometer and fluorometer for less than £4 on our hardware page !
Screening cost-effectiveness model
To demonstrate that our test would be cost effective as part of a screening programme we built this cost effectiveness model. To do this it combines cancer prevelance data, the sensitivity and specificity values of our test, our cost analysis data and treament cost data.
We used Tammemägi et al.’s model to calculate the probability of someone getting lung cancer in the next 6 years. It is more sensitive than the simplistic criteria used by the National Lung Screening Trial, and thus a better way of selecting individuals for screening. Tammemägi et al. showed their model would be more cost effective method as more cancers were detected per number screened as it missed fewer cases of cancer. [16]
Although Tammemägi’s model was for lung cancer as a whole, we assume the risk factors put you at equal risk of non-small cell and small-cell lung cancer. As the miRNAs on which our test  is based do not indicate small cell lung cancer, we have built the model around NSCLC. All other figures are NSCLC specific.
A quality adjusted life year (QALY) represents one year in perfect health. The ‘quality adjusted’ part accounts for the quality of life for that year, for example 2 years with a 0.6 quality of life score would be 1.2 QALYs. QALYs can be used to measure the benefit a treatment provides (if any). Treatments costing less than £20,000 per QALY are deemed cost effective by NICE. Treaments between £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY may be decided to be cost effective by NICE if there is a high degree of certainty in the cost per QALY or when there are substantial benefits not captured in the cost per QALY figure.

For improving our project and get further feedback, we’ve visited several government agencies and a private enterprises.
Agricultural Chemicals and Toxic Substances Research Institute(TACTRI)
We got to know how dioxin is being test in food and they gave us suggestions on many things list below:
How we can do on pretreatment of samples.
Testing enzyme activity after protein purification.
Break down product by using isotope method.
We’re doing experiment on level of ppm, which is capable of testing dioxin in soil but not in food.
Dioxin that had gone through Cl - degradation should be test of the toxicity.
Testing dioxin using biological or microorganism method is still under breakthrough. However, once the                     method is applied, it is sure to be the best compared with heat and chemical methods.
EPA Environmental Inspection
From the agency, we had feedback as followed:
We got to know how dioxin is being test in environmental level.
Chemical method is used to test the concentration of dioxin.
Houli Refuse Incinerator Plant
We saw how garbage is being burned down and in order to avoid the production of dioxin(250 ℃ ~400 ℃ is especially                   significant), temperature is being controlled. In addition to this, after garbage is fully burned, two                   chemicals are formed: incinerator bottom ash and fly ash. Fly ash should be carefully coped with. They                   use active charcoal to stabilize fly ash and cleaned out with bottom ash together. Product such as brick                   is made by mixing ashes with concrete.
The major method using in the incinerator is heat method, as mentioned previously, breaking down dioxin by                   extremely high temperature. They’re interested in the method using in our project, microorganism method.                   Since dioxin is hydrophobic, it appears in soil most of the time. If we can successfully applied our method                   by phytoremediation, plant would be able to be cropped and break down"
