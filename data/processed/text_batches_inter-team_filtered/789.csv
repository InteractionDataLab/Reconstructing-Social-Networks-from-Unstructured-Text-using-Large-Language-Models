It's in the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI), I discovered and enjoyed really, Synthetic and  Systems Biology in a multidisciplinary and international  atmosphere that fitted me well. It's also during my master that I  heard about iGEM. It's for me, a unique opportunity to work in a  lab and to be confronted to its management. Moreover it allows  to completely get involved in a project that is ours from the  emerging idea to its realisation. Last, iGEM needs us to surpass  ourselves. That's something that motivates me a lot : pushing  further our limits to accomplish something that we can be proud  of.

iGEM competition is the platform for young researchers to develop  their talents in such a world competition. Participating in iGEM  competition will give me the opportunity to think of a scientific  problem and design how to  solve it autonomously with  colleagues from different disciplines. It will enhance my  capabilities to work in a group and share ideas with fellows.  Synthetic biology is a great tool for future discoveries and i see  iGEM as the gateway for me to develop interest and equip  myself in this upcoming field of science.

While having a bachelor's degree in Biology of Lyon 1  University, physics and computer science have always  interested me. iGEM meaning interdisciplinarity: the mixture of  all basic sciences, represents, in my mind, a unique opportunity.  It is an adventure not only from the personal point of view:  working and setting up a team with students from different  backgrounds and interacting on different views of Life Sciences  induced, but also from a professional point of view: to have the  possibility at our study level to take part in the creation and in  the development by ourselves of our own scientific project, so  means a source of intellectual enrichment, at which I am willing  to take part.

They had also covered good ground with regard to their wet lab work, and had it   divided into three sub-­parts, each handling a particular aspect of the wet lab work. While IISER   Pune wishes to compete in the Health and Medicine track of iGEM, IIT Delhi wishes to compete   in the environment track. IIT Delhi also made a very descriptive presentation of their idea, which   was appreciated by the audience. After each of the team presentations (which typically lasted   about an hour), there were question-answer sessions held, where the clarity and idea of each of   the teams’ projects were scrutinized. Very useful suggestions and points were raised for each of the teams post their  presentations, and all the discussions (both formal and informal) were very productive and   propitious for the teams, in general. We learnt a lot about iGEM through this meetup, got to meet   a lot of people, and are confident that the advice and suggestions given during this meetup would   definitely help us give this first attempt at iGEM our best shot.
NCTU Meetup (July 19-­23, 2015)
This was the third time NCTU organized its own meetup, and this time, it kept it open for all the   Asian iGEM teams. It was organized on a pretty grand scale with 30 teams (from countries like   Taiwan, China, India, etc) participating in it. The two Indian teams participating in this meetup   were IISER Pune and IIT Kharagpur. The option was given to teams to either go and attend the   meetup in person, or to present their ideas via video conferencing (Skype). Accordingly, our   team went ahead with the second option, and was allocated a video conference slot for the   evening (Taiwan Time) of the third day of the NCTU Meetup (21st July). The main idea behind our team’s participation in this meetup was to get advice and   suggestions from experienced iGEM teams with regard to our project ­ wet lab, policy and   practices (social outreach, meetups, collaborations, lab visits), modelling and so on. The format   of the online conference was 20 minutes for the presentation and 20 minutes for the question and   answer session. Harsheel, one of the senior members of our team gave the presentation of our   project idea, and the questions that followed (which were pitched by the audience gathered at the   seminar room in NCTU, Taiwan) were tackled by"

Preparation of 2% (w/v) sodium alginate stock solution using food grade alginate (obtained from Helena Shomar Monges). 2.05 grams were dissolved in 100 mL of Milli-Q water with continued stirring at 50°C. The next day (18/06/2015), a homogeneous solution was obtained. The mixture used was a blend of sodium alginate, CaSO4 and sodium pyrophosphate obtained from Minerals Water (UK).
Experiment 1: Continuous extrusion of sodium alginate and CaCl2 (aq) from separate tubes in close proximity.
Syringe pump settings:  Inner diameter = 4.61 millimetre for 1 mL Luer-Lock syringe (BD);
1. Extrusion without movement into Falcon Tube. Conclusions of the experiment:
- Rate = 0.50 mL/min;
- Total V=0.20 mL;
- Rate was too high, next run should be at a rate of 0.25 mL/min;
- Initial formation of single drops, later continuous strut which become solid after 210 seconds.
2. Two times tried with a volume of 0.30 mL at a rate of 0.25 mL/min. Both tries were only droplets, not a strut;
3. Settings were a volume 0.15 mL at a rate of 0.35 mL/min. It is extremely important to have the two nozzles as close as possible to each other to prevent droplet formations and favour struts. It appears there is too much CaCl2 (aq) compared to alginate.
4. Settings were a volume of 0.15 mL at a rate of 0.1 mL/min. In this case no droplets were formed, only a strut. So, we need a slow extrusion rate for a smooth line.
Change in the experimental setup: 3-way valves make the recharging of the syringe more practical. Therefore, in the experimental setup two 3-way valves and tubes were added.
23/06/2015
In this case movement is into petri dish.
Extrusion of alginate in CaCl2 solution draws the strut behind the needle and tends to form beads around the tip at low extrusion rates. The extrusion of both substances from the two needles seems more controllable in this way. During the formation, the alginate beads swim, but then they sink to the"

EC_50=(1+K1*kdMA/kdMB)/K2
It was assumed the constants kdm = kdMA = kdMB, therefore the equation is reduced to:
EC_50=(1+K1)/K2
The EC50 of the Smu THF riboswitch with the chimeric metE expression platform with (6S)-THF is about 32*10-6 M. (Batey et al., 2011)
Reorganizing the equation:
K2=(1+K1)/(32*10^-6)
K2=31250*K1+31250
Since the B9 Riboswitches bind two THF molecules at once, the unit of k2_B9 would be M^-2*s^-1.
Assumed Constants: Values of k1, k1’, k2_B9, k2_B12, and k2’:
There was not really a way to easily find out k1, k1’, k2_B9, k2_B12, and k2’. They had to be assumed from the ratios. From our previous calculations it was assumed: K1 = 0.1, then K2 = 34375
Since binding with vitamin would stabilize the hairpin on mRNA, the reaction constant would be  it was assumed that
k1 = 0.1 s-1,  k1’ = 1 s^-1,  k2_B9 = 34375 M^-2*s^-1,  k2’ = 1 s^-1
There was very little information on the binding strength of cyanocobalamin, the type of vitamin B12 that was used in the experiment, with the vitamin B12 (AdoCbl) riboswitches which primarily bind to adenosylcobalamin. Therefore, the same numerical value was used for both k2_B9 and k2_B12 while the units are different.
Value of kA:
The translation rate of ribosome was approximated to be 8.4 aa*s-1 while Ribosome per mRNA is about 3.46 Ribosome/100 codon. (aa=amino acid) (Siwiak and Zielenkiewicz, 2013) Length of GFP (BBa_E0040) = 720pb = 240 aa*GFP^-1
Therefore:
kA = Translation rate/number of amino acids = 8."

MARGUERITE BENONYDesignerI am a 23 years old product designer and a member of 2013 Paris Bettencourt iGEM team. While I was studying applied arts, I became deeply interested in Biology and harnessed my designer's energy to seek the potential of an exciting upcoming field witch is the synergy between design and biology.Whilst investigating this friction, I discovered Synthetic Biology. I became instantly amazed by its potential in real life implication and the role that design could have in this technology. Naturally, I then wanted to acquire actual wet lab experience in Synthetic Biology, enabling me to explore how designers can work with scientists and what are their roles, missions, interest would be. I believe iGEM is the best place for this investigation!

SDS-PAGE Protocol
Written by Kayla Nemr, with Seray Cicek, Sarah Bi, and Roy Lee
Introduction
Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is a technique commonly used in molecular biology which allows for the separation of proteins depending on the size of each protein and helps identify the proteins that are being separated.
Please watch videos shown below to understand the protocol more in depth.
Making the gel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDi_n_0NiF4
Running the gel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUjLO-ek2C8
Staining the gel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-1dXzU4iOw
Basic Terminology and Concepts
Protein ladder: a premade solution containing proteins of known sizes. Analyzing the electrophoresis alongside the ladder makes it easier to identify the various sizes of the fragments in the tested protein samples by comparing them to the known protein sizes of the ladder.

in vivo validation of predicted tRNA synthetase structures
In order to test the functionality and specificity of our modeled aaRS, we selected the most promising 11 amino acid sequences and ordered seven synthetase sequences of NPA via IDT, and four     synthetase sequences of CBT-Asparagine by courtesy of Genscript, where we had previously won a grant of 500€.      Since the DNA synthesis by GenScript and IDT were delayed by several weeks, we could not perform the best practice characterization of these parts.     Finally, we received only three of the ordered syntheses in sufficient quality for further experiments. All of them encode predicted CBT-tRNA-synthetases.     We subjected the sequences to a positive selection as initial characterization. Plasmids encoding the predicted best candidates were cotransformed with our     positive selection plasmid into E. coli(BL21 DE3). Due to the IPTG induced promoter, we tested different IPTG concentrations, including 0 mM, 5 mM,     10 mM, and 15 mM. In addition, we tried different concentration of the antibiotics: kan15, cm15/kan15, and cm15/kan15/tet5. The numbers of resulting colonies is presented in figure 10. Our in vivo results show that our in silico designed enzymes kept their native function and are      able to integrate amino acids through an amber codon matching tRNA.

2.4 Construct Design and Modeling
To test whether we could bind multiple metal ions on the same protein and if this relationship would be monotonically increasing, we designed peptides with one, two, and three copper binding domains in tandem (1xHHTC-Re HNLGMNHVLQGNRPLVTQGC, 2xHHTC-Re HNLGMNHVLQGNRPLVTQGCHNLGMNHVLQGNRPLVTQGC, 3xHHTC-Re HNLGMNHVLQGNRPLVTQGCHNLGMNHVLQGNRPLVTQGCHNLGMNHVLQGNRPLVTQGC; see biobrick page for sequence information). These three peptides were synthesized by Elim Biopharmaceuticals (Hayward, CA), and provided as a lyophilized powder at >98% purity. They were also modified to possess N-terminal acetylation/C-terminal amidation to avoid having a charged peptide [17]. 10 mM MES pH 5.5 and the Pierce BCA assay were used for reconstitution and concentration determination, respectively [18].
To check whether the proteins would retain their respective conformations when added in tandem, we used a tool produced by the Zhang lab (University of Michigan) for de novo protein structure prediction (QUARK) [15]. Based on the structures, we were able to hypothesize that the HHTC-Re domains would each be able to bind copper atoms, even when restricted spatially by ordering them sequentially without spacing.
Figure 1: Depiction of the design of the HHTC-Re repeating peptides, along with predicted ab initio structures as per the QUARK database and algorithms. Individual HHTC-Re domains retain their conformation, even in the 3x peptide.
We also developed 3 fusion proteins: CBD-2xHHTC, CBD-3xHHTC, and CBD-6xHHTC for use in the actual filter, comprised of a CBD, and HHTC metal binding repeats interspaced with a GSGGSG flexible linker. These constructs also included a Lumio tag for downstream verification of protein production, and a 6x His tag for protein purification. A challenge incurred when designing these parts was that the His tag maintains"

Malate concentration distribution
For our project, malate is the chemoattractant that results in the movement of E.coli. In this section, we will first model the concentration distribution of the chemoattractant, malate in the soil. Then, we will model the bacteria concentration pattern as a result of this distribution of malate. Finally, we will infer some useful information by analysing the results of the modelling.
We will model the concentration distributions of malate and bacteria using the Keller-Segel model which is governed by the two equations shown below. Solving the equations will give the concentration distributions of the malate and the bacteria respectively

UChicago,2014,Team:UChicago#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," bunch of our media was contaminated (again) so we had to remake all those. We also transformed our IPTG+GFP and our AroF+mCherry constructs, along with Cam, Kan, Tet, and Amp linearized backbones from the kit plate (other plasmids, cut in order to isolate the backbone).
(I’m calling this transformation.jpg now.)
Tuesday
Yep. Transformation of our ligated parts and the backbones seems to have failed. We left the plates in the incubator for one more night because these cells have an annoying habit of only growing after two days. At least our stab streaks were good: all 7 of the plasmids, including the important melA constructs, grew successfully, and were made into overnight cultures. Oh hey! After a few hours more there is some growth on the backbone plates, except for the Tet backbone. Transformation efficiencies are pretty terrible, as is par for the course here. Seriously need to fix that.  We also redid our AroF+mCherry and our IPTG+GFP ligations with 3A assembly and the standard ligation procedure. Better work this time. We also miniprepped and fragment isolated more mCherry and GFP so that we have enough for the inevitable future redos. We’re also continuing work on determining the MIC for rifampicin for our fluctuation assays; this time growing them in liquid culture.
Wednesday
Made glycerol stocks of most of Monday’s new plasmids, and miniprepped K193601 and K193602. Ran a bunch of PCRs to make sure we had our promoters. Didn’t get IPTG+GFP, but at least we got a little bit of AroF+mCherry. We also checked our MIC liquid cultures, and it looks like the MIC we got was about 8ug/mL. We also transformed our ligation products into our competent cells and competent cells from another lab. The other lab’s cells will most assuredly have better transformation efficiencies than our cells.
Thursday
Looks like our 3A fragments were cut incorrectly due to mislabeling somewhere along the line. Would probably explain why they failed this morning. We can make our competent cells better, more competent. We have the technology. And buffer. Which we made today.
Friday
Plated some XL1-Blue cells to start making our competent cells. Hopefully these ones work better. Also tried ligating and transforming more mutators and promoters; hopefully we can do this without mislabeling things again. (ipredictfailure.jpg)

Our Project
For this year’s iGEM competition our team has set out to find a method for producing new regulatory parts used in the construction of complex biological devices.
Background & Motivations
Transcription is the first step of gene expression that can be regulated. Key elements of this regulation are proteins recognising and binding specific DNA sequences that either recruit the full  transcription machinery or prevent it from assembling on the DNA. It is this class of proteins, called transcription factors (TFs), that we intend to engineer.
Existing DNA binding proteins can be a starting point for developing these new TFs. By changing their residues it is possible to modify the affinity of these proteins for a specific binding site and alter how they interact with the activation or repression mechanisms of the downstream gene transcription. Investigating these effects can improve our understanding of how the residue composition affects the TF's ability to recognise a given DNA consensus sequence.
Engineering new transcription factors will not only give us a better idea of how they work but also extend the tool kit of the synthetic biologist. Within synthetic biology, TFs are used to design biological circuits where they act as building blocks for reporters, inverters, logic functions and switches. Extending the tool kit with new TFs will enable combinations of devices that currently share the same regulatory elements and thus cannot be used in the same system.
Goal
Our project’s outcome will be a method to derive pairs of TFs and DNA binding sites meeting selection criteria for orthogonality, affinity and specificity. It will include setting a selection scheme that allows for high-throughput identification of functional TF-consensus sequence pairs in vitro and in vivo. We plan to use bacterial cultures in parallel with chemostat platforms and MITOMI to screen a library of TFs against a set of consensus sequences.
Our research will begin with the tetracycline repressor (TetR), a transcription factor which down-regulates (represses) the transcription of the adjacent gene. This protein and its mutants are often used by synthetic"

Pink, blue, and purple chromoproteins are the most distinguishable. Therefore, we decided to use them as reporters towards real application scenarios.
Replacing sfGFP with chromoproteins
After selecting three chromoproteins, we used Golden Gate method to replace gfp gene with chromoprotein genes. We successfully constructed BBa_K2507009, K2507010, K2507011, K2507014, K2507015, K2507016 and Co-transformed with BBa_ K2507004/ BBa_K2507006 into E. coli Top10.

We combine BBa_ K2507004 with BBa_K2507009, BBa_K2507010, BBa_K2507011. b. Schematic diagram of ligand-induced signaling through TtrS/R and plasmid-borne implementation of the sensor components. We combine BBa_ K2507006 with BBa_K2507014, BBa_K2507015, BBa_K2507016.
We cultivated the bacteria in different concentration of thiosulfate or tetrathionate. After validating the system in the laboratory strains E. coli Top10, we confirmed that the system with chromoproteins indeed works as a thiosulfate sensor, as intended. By linking thsR with chromoprotein genes (BBa_K2507009, BBa_K2507010, BBa_K2507011) , this system can respond to thiosulfate by producing a signal visible to the naked eye.

If the genetical process of our kill system is stopped, GM microorganisms might proliferate without operation of division counting. More worth case is when several units of division counting halt simultaneously; it leads breakdown of whole system.
Also loop system might not start if there is leaky expression from Pbad even under an arabinose free condition. Moreover, the gene mutation can not be overlooked. Even from one cell of E. coli, the final number of cells after 100 multiplications is calculated as 2^100≒10^30. For such a great number of cells, it is no wonder some of these are observed to gain mutation leading to loss of kill switch function.
Another problem might rise from a horizontal gene transfer. Procaryote cell can take in exogeneous DNA  from surrounding environment. If a wild strain took in gene derived from modified GMO and that gene was not lethal one, the situation would be regarded as a irreversible release of modified gene.
To solute these problem, there are several method: installing kill switch repeatedly for insurance, using lethal gene which degradates host cell’s genome and plasmid. Despite of plenty choices for safety, any choice is not sufficient for perfect protect. Although our project would be the technical basis for release of GMO, we shouldn’t forget discuss problems carefully.
APP
Overview
To spread the knowledge of synthetic biology, we made an Android game app where E. coli culture and genetic engineering techniques are included.
This project was launched with our co-developer, iGEM Tokyo-Tech. iGEM UT-Tokyo was responsible for the game deign and iGEM Tokyo-Tech for the coding.
E. coli can be increased by tapping the main screen. Also, E. coli increase with time wihout any treatment.
Experience point, which will lead to level up, can be accumulated as E. coli increase. Items, new genes and genetic engineering technique can be gained as the level goes up.
Notice that we have only gone to the point to make E. coli increase. The procedure of genetic engineering will be added in the coming version.
Result
Although our team and Tokyo-Tech had reached an agreement that we develop application together and we decided that Tokyo-Tech work on coding, NO products about it have been given by them (by 20 Oct 2016).

Part 3 AI-2 Responser Device
Abstract: We successfully constructed two devices that could respond to AI-2 by producing GFP, to provide an independent means to use AI-2 Controller to alter heterologous gene expression. we show that a 1:1 mixture of AI-2 Response Device with AI-2 suppliers activated QS-activated gene expression from the WT (AI-2 producing) cells. And 1:1 mixture of AI-2 Response Device with AI-2 controller could significantly depress QS-activated gene expression from the WT (AI-2 producing) cells.

Key Achievement
Constructed two devices which could respond to AI-2 by producing GFP.
Characterized AI-2 Response Devices by adding exogenous AI-2.
Demonstrated two AI-2 Response Devices can work under simulated conditions in the lab.
Design of AI-2 Response Device
For AI-2 Response Device A, this composite part consists of the AI-2 (autoinducer-2) quorum sensor-inducible promoter BBa_K1981101, a GFP coding sequence BBa_E0040, a double terminator BBa_B0015.

From this experiment we cannot see any clear proof of lasing in our cells. This could be both due to our setup or due to the constructed cells. Previous studies show that lasing usually occurs at an excitation power under 1mW (Gather & Yun, 2011; Fan & Yun, 2014) . However, up to this excitation power the Biolaser cells follow the same slope as the fluorescent cells, which means that no lasing occurred. From 2 mW and higher the cells most likely bleach. Since we expected the cells to lase at an excitation energy under 1 mW, we did not take such high energies into account while designing our setup. Probably we exposed the cells to the excitation laser for a too long time, or the power was probably too high that the cells eventually photobleached anyway. It is also possible the maximum fluorescence intensity of the cells was reached, and therefore the intensity doesn't increase.
Even though the excitation laser eventually most likely bleached or saturated the fluorophores, this was probably not the reason why lasing didn’t work. Lasing should have occurred at an excitation energy between 0 and 1 mW, and at these energies the fluorophores did not bleach. It is possible that our cells were lasing at the low energy prior to bleaching or saturation, but the system was not sensitive enough to measure this. However, we did find a more probable reason why the cells did not lase. Modeling showed, that in a cavity as big as E. coli (around 1 µm) we need an intracellular fluorophore concentration of 0.1 M to get lasing. In our cells the maximum concentration we can achieve is in the nM to µM range and therefore lasing physically not possible in our cells. To get lasing, we would either need much larger cells or a much higher concentration of fluorophores. Therefore, it was most likely not due to the self-built setup nor our synthetic biology design of a biolaser that we did not observe lasing.
Back to Top
Discussion and Conclusions
We have successfully calculated, designed and built a custom optical setup that could allow us to measure lasing in cells. Using this self-built setup, we were able to image fluorescent cells and measure the intensity of the fluorescence. We have confirmed that the setup worked. We also measured whether lasing would occur in our fluorescent mCerulean polysilicate-covered cells. Despite the effort, we did not observe any lasing in cells. Our models"

After some weeks of cloning, the results of the final cloning-work were outstanding - finally: Biobrick-Submission was the goal. Attaching prefix and suffix to our biobricks and cloning them into our vector pSB1C3 sounds like simple restriction-cloning. In theory it is an easy (especially due to Snapgene, a great, free programming tool, which helped us during the whole iGEM competition) simulation of a whole restriction-cloning process completed within minutes. Unfortunately, the real practical part in the lab looks a little bit different - every step takes hours and many problems and pitfalls emerge. After many working steps, finally a successful transformation turned up, got cloned and after restriction-digest and ligation process, we finally got clones to test, but it was still far from being finished. Sadly, often after colonyPCR no clones with the biobrick in it were found. Instead, only the vector without insert (biobrick) turned up. We were far from giving up and after a few night shifts in the lab, we finally managed to get our biobricks, which were ready for submission.

RIVM Kennisparade
During the open day of the RIVM: The Dutch national institute for public health and the environment, we presented our project to visiting parents and children. By making a comic on biosafety, we tried to educate children on the safety aspects that come with the use of GMOs. You can read the comic on our
biosafety page
. Moreover, we presented our project using our poster, and distributed the postcards of the postcard collaboration.

Events where we presented our project
Dutch Biotechnology Congress
The NBV, the Dutch Biotechnology Association is the association for all professionals in the field of applied life sciences in the Netherlands. On the 17th of April, they organised the yearly Dutch Biotechnology Congress (NBC-17) in Wageningen. iGEM Wageningen 2017 was present with a poster presentation. The highlights of the conference can be found on the website of NBV .
Ultimaker Education Session
On the 4th of July, we participated in the Ultimaker Education Session in Zaandam. Here, the newest inovations in 3D-printing techniques were showcased. We presented our device, both in a presentation and a posterstand, and got some valuable tips on refining the settings our 3D-printer from Ultimaker.
Benelux Meetup
On the 24th of June, we organised the Benelux meetup: an iGEM meetup for all Belgian and Dutch iGEM teams. Part of this meetup included presenting the project. More about this day can be found on the
meetup page
.
European iGEM Meetup
iGEM TUDelft organised a European iGEM Meetup. On the 7th of July, various teams from all over Europe gathered in Delft for a symposium. This included three interesting speakers that talked about implementation of synthetic biology, and posterpresentations of the iGEM teams.
Go-No Go presentation
In order to involve our collegues here at the university in our project, we presented a Go No-go presentation, where all researchers and students in the relevant chair groups were invited to.

We found that our high school’s students share the same opinion about GM food as the general public. There is a basic lack of information about the mechanisms of GM food production and function, which leads to misunderstanding about the subject. After seeing the importance of promoting GM food, we collaborated with the school magazine Imaginist.
School magazine - Imaginist
We reached out to Imaginist, our school magazine, to discuss the legitimacy of GM food. In the October issue of the magazine, we presented a positive but objective opinion towards GM food. We argued that for different cases, where different GM food is designed according to various types of mechanisms, some mechanisms are rational and may lead to a reliable improvement of the product. At the same time, some GM food may result from random mutations. We need to examine GM food carefully before it appears in supermarkets, but advantages of GM food should also be acknowledged properly.
Club
Joining clubs and student organizations provides students the opportunity to work with their peers, explore complex issues not encountered in the classroom, and to be part of something larger than the seats they occupy in the classrooms.  We established iGEM club within our school in order to spread knowledge of genetic technology. We have organized two activities this year: knowledge lecturing and experimentation.
Many members of our club are unaware of basic molecular biology concepts such as applications associated with DNA, ribosomes, and the basic principle of the central dogma of biology. Therefore, we offered three lectures to provide a brief view of biology at the molecular level.
In the first session, we introduced the concept of synthetic biology. Beginning with the cell theory of Leeuwenhoek, we showed how human interpretation of living organisms changed and how we use biochemistry as a tool to understand organisms at a molecular level. We also incorporated the core concepts of bioengineering: modularization and standardization.
In our second and third meetings, our lecturers showed the whole process of a typical genetic engineering experiment, from obtaining the genetic sequences, to cloning:  building vectors, transformation, and finally identification. We wanted our club members to know how the common technology is used in genetic technology, such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), aids in understanding the purpose of our machine and its abundant usefulness. Since these concepts are abstract, we presented them through text, pictures, and videos. After each lecture, we provided a Q&A section, helping club members better understand these concepts.

Peshawar – Tutoring the first Pakistani team
We provided guidance to iGEM Peshawar , the first team to represent Pakistan. We assisted them with                various aspects of Mathematical Modelling, Human Practice and cloning.
An opportunity for collaboration unveiled itself when we learned that the Pakistani team from Peshawar                University is focusing on detection as a project. During the initial conversation we were amazed to learn                that the said group is the first Pakistani team to compete in iGEM, thus they were in need of guidance with                most aspects of the competition. We decided to aid them and share all the knowledge and experience that                was accumulated in our project and in past Technion iGEM teams. To achieve this, we used different                platforms for communications mainly a Facebook group, where the Peshawar team could get an immediate                answer to any question they had, and multiple Skype sessions each with a different focus such as                mathematical modeling, Human practices, Cloning and more.
Mathematical modeling
We aided in the modeling process of Peshawar’s system, specifically using differential equations and logic gates.                The aim of the model was to predict the expression of the reporter protein as a function of the inducers’ concentration ( View PDF ).
Cloning
The Peshawar team had issues with the plasmid transformations into competent cells. After we got                a full report on the exact steps they followed, we helped debugging their protocol.
We also shared our protocols of chemical transformation and competent cells preparation with them.
These instructions helped the team overcome their obstacles and proceed with the project.
Human practices
We shared the layout of our educational program with Peshawar. Moreover, we advised the team regarding                an appeal to the government with a request to promote"

Human Practice Overview
Synthetic biology, the design and construction of new biological system not founded in nature is developing rapidly as a new branch of biotechnology, with many anticipated benefits and a high impact on society (Schmidt, 2010). The public, including bioethicists, media and venture companies always focus more on the result of a certain product, while most of the scientific workers pay more attention to science itself. Hence, a bridge connecting the two sides needs to be constructed. Our human practice strives to be the bridge to link the public and synthetic biology together.
We launched a Synthetic Biology Street Research on July 15th to know the general Chinese people’s awareness, understanding, interest and concern. As Tian’anmen and Wangfujing Street are most popular places of interests in Beijing, they are visited by oceans of tourists from different places of China. Hence, our pre-survey covered the whole China. According to the survey result, we divided BNU’s human practice into the following five parts.

We: Can we lose weight by just stop eating anything? 
Coach: Yes. But, I must say that if you stay in the condition of hunger for too long, the cell in your body may gradually reduce the consumption of energy. Thus, as long as everything is back to normal, your weight will bounce back rapidly. So, to sum up,   how to maintain is far more important, and also, far more difficult.  
We: We’ve heard of some activists on weight losing. They even take methods such as liposuction and gastrectomy. What’s your opinion?
Coach: Fat will still accumulate after liposuction, and gastrectomy is an irreversible harm to our body. To be blunt, I’m on the side of disapproval.

Nutritionist
Motivation
When visiting the fitness coach, he suggested that we also consult a nutritionist, assuming that the answers agreed by different professions may be somewhat different. Based on the recommendations of the fitness coach, we found a nutritionist from Cheng Ching Hospital, hoping to get the answer that is beneficial to our project.
Highlight
Processed sugar intake accounted for a person's daily calories required 10%
Excessive diet can hurt the body
The amount of calories required for a day minus about 400 calories is the most appropriate calorie needed for dieting
Fat is also one of the main causes of obesity
Note the control of blood sugar
Conclusion
After this interview, we found that the point of discussion nutritionist and fitness coach stand are similar in many ways : for instance, going on diet should not be excessive, controlling  food and drink is important. These are complementary to what we want to do. This interview also let us adjust our project in order to support the public in pursue of a healthy and better life.

using beta-arrestine binding to the activated MT1 receptor
using the transcription factor RZR
On May 7th, we went to Juelich Research Center to discuss those ideas with experts,             to see which approach is most suitable in our project and to work out what difficulties we would have to face.
After a warm welcome of Michael Osthege, a former iGEM-Team member of RWTH Aachen in 2014 and 2015,             and some basic chat about how to organize the team, we went to see Dr. S. Binder, founder of SenseUp, who gave insights into his StartUp.            Afterwards, we presented our ideas to Prof. M. Pohl (biocatalysis and biosensors), Jun.-Prof. D. Kohlheyer (Microscale Bioengineering),             Dr. Drepper from Institute for Molecular Enzyme Technology IMET (Bacterial Photobiotechnology) and             Dr. J. Marienhagen (Synthetic Cell-factories).

With their advice, we figured out that using the cascade would be too time-consuming and unspecific.             The fewer components, the better because intermediate steps work as a black-box for us.             We would not be able to see if other substances interfered with our receptor in between.             Furthermore, if we did not have a signal at all, we would have serious difficulties to localize the steps,             where problems could occur. Because of this, it would not be specific enough and evidence that the detected signal             came from melatonin would not be given. In addition, we learned that using living cells for quantitative measurement could be tricky.             We decided to focus on beta-arrestin binding and on RZR and to abolish the idea of a G-protein coupled cascade.

Using luciferase under the control of the Estrogen Response Element as reporter
During our first months of research we noticed a research group in the Aalto University (Helsinki),             who developed a yeast-cell based assay for the detection of different analytes, i. e. Estrogen, using different nuclear receptors.
We decided, that the system would be suitable for our project, as we also planned to use the specific nuclear receptor RZR             (Retinoid-related orphan receptor-beta) for the detection of melatonin.

Did more research into periplasm fractioning
In order to see if the protocol works, need JC8031 with ClyA culture, a JC8031 DeLisa cell line control (same cells, no GFP) and a cytoplasmic GFP control (if there is GFP in the fraction, full cell lysis happened and that’s bad)
Plan:
Grow up overnight culture of GFP device from interlab kit
Grow all three cultures in 25 mL LB cultures with Cam until OD=0.5 per DeLisa paper
Induce JC8301 cells with .2% arabinose (weight/final volume)
Grow for 6 hours at 37
Use cold osmotic shock protocol from Biefeld iGEM team on the drive, BUT use ice cold water instead of cell fraction buffer 2 because Kelly says Triton and SDS can interfere with protein function
Measure fractions on plate reader, use wavelength from interlab study
Need: to make cell fraction buffer (need Tris) autoclave media?, grow up cytoplasm GFP, did Paul make some arabinose?
Made some 3M sodium acetate solution to try ethanol precipitation—Kelly says it’s worth a try—see Paul for final pH

JMU_Wuerzburg,2018,Team:JMU Wuerzburg#Introduction Malaria_-_-_TEXT.html," With the infection of erythrocytes by merozoites, the asexual reproductive cycle begins: They enter an erythrocyte, form the ring stadium, the trophozoite and finally the schizont. Then the erythrocyte bursts and dismisses the merozoites into the bloodstream and the cycle starts again (C). A few merozoites are reprogrammed to form gametocytes, erythrocytes with precursors of the gametes. Within 15 days they reach the periphery, where they are absorbed by a mosquito during a meal (D). This is where the mature gametes occur, which unite to form the zygote, which becomes a dividing sporozoite. (E, F) The sporozoites can then be injected into a human again. 8

Regular diagnosis for Malaria
Malaria is usually diagnosed by microscopic identification of Plasmodium parasites in a blood smear or with immunochromatoraphic rapid diagnostic tests (RTDs).
These RTDs are lateral flow immuno-chromatographic antigen-detection tests working with small amounts of patient’s blood. Malaria parasites producing antigens differ from every species of Plasmodium.
Figure: RDT cassette 10
A drop of blood is added to hole A, while some drops are added to hole B. Inside the cassette is a strip made of filter paper and nitrocellulose. The buffer carries the blood along the length of the RDT. If certain antigens of the parasite are visible they bind to specific antibodies which are connected to the nitrocellulose strip. A labelled antibody then can bind them so a visible band together with a test band shows a positive result. 9 10

Medical Service
Overview
In this part, we will give you a detailed look on the current situation of hospitals and medical service in China. We will point out the problems of medical service in China, the difficulties for the public to get medical help and the development of medical appliance.
Hospitals now face the serious problem of imbalance between those in big cities and in villages and countryside. That is, while most public hospitals in cities are being more and more crowded, it’s more and more difficult for hospitals in villages to keep running.
As for the public to see a doctor, we found that most Chinese feel it hard and expensive to see a doctor. But for medical appliances, it’s amazing that the situation is better than that of hospitals and medical service.
Based on the messages mentioned above, we came up with our project, a biosensor for detecting diseases, in the hope of helping the public to find early symptoms of certain disease and to get early diagnosis. The biosensor we made could be used at home, that is, people do not need to go to the hospital, waiting in a line, spend a lot of money to know their state of health.
Current Situation of Hospitals in China
Current Situation of Public Hospitals
Public hospitals in China can be divided into two parts: the municipal ones and those at grass-roots level. Among most people’s concept, municipal hospitals are much better than grass-level ones and thus they are more willing to go there.
Municipal hospitals always have better conditions for treatment and sanitation. Doctors there are of higher academic levels and they usually have rich experiences on their specific field [3]. Consequently, most people tend to go there to get medical help.
As for hospitals at grass-roots level, however, it has even become a serious problem to prevent the number of them from declining. Most of these hospitals in cities own the same features: small-scaled rooms,"
Potsdam,2017,Team:Potsdam#Protocols_-_-_TEXT.html," or a face shield, gloves  and a lab coat.
Note: If you will be purifying the DNA for later use, use long-wavelength UV and expose for as  little time as possible to minimize damage to the DNA.
Note: The fragments of DNA are usually referred to as ‘bands’ due to their appearance on the gel.
6. Analyzing Your Gel
Using the DNA ladder in the first lane as a guide (the manufacturer's instruction will tell you the  size of each band), you can interpret the bands that you get in your sample lanes to determine if the  resulting DNA bands that you see are as expected or not. For more details on doing diagnostic  digests and how to interpret them please see the  Diagnostic Digest  page.
7. Purifying DNA from Your Gel
If you are conducting certain procedures, such as molecular cloning, you will need to purify the  DNA away from the agarose gel. For instructions on how to do this, visit the  Gel Purification  page.

GFP production model for diffusion simulation
Sunday, August 3rd
We need an efficient way to simulate diffusion experiments. A receiver cell at the end of a channel receives AHL produced by the well at the other end of the channel, and starts to produce GFP. By using quasi steady state aproximations (considering that binding is much faster than transcription and diffusion), we have a simple equation for GFP production as a function of AHL :
Equations and approximations for the model of GFP production by sensor cells used in simulation of diffusion and cross-talk experiments
By using producer cells on one side of the channel and receiver cells in the other side, and putting cells in a punched cylinder in agar, we should see fluorescence appear at different times depending on the channel length (1 to 4mm) :

First millifluidic chip
Thursday, August 2nd
Here is our first millifluidic chip for diffusion experiments ! This time we used a layer of PDMS thin enough so that we could peel it without breaking it. In some wells will be added producer cells or pure AHL, and in the wells on the other side of the channels, receiver cells. There are several lengths of channels, this should enable us to retrieve diffusion parameters by recording when receiver cells start glowing.

OUR NOVEL MULTISTEP APPROACH
Virulent races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), or wheat stem rust, have caused devastating effects on cereal grains worldwide, impacting global food security. We are engineering Escherichia coli DH5α and Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY100 to detect Pgt and improve response times to virulent strains. To detect Pgt, we are creating a device that will germinate spores from the Puccinia genus. The germinated spores produce ribitol, a sugar unique to Pgt. Our engineered DH5α will produce a fluorescent signal in the presence of ribitol, thus detecting Pgt. To detect specific virulent races of Pgt, we will modify yeast to contain the stem rust resistance gene Sr35 from Triticum monococcum; Sr35 recognizes its corresponding effector AvrSr35, secreted by Pgt, as part of the plant’s innate immune system. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation, our yeast will detect AvrSr35, a first step in being able to indicate the virulence of the germinated Pgt spores.
Transform Escherichia coli DH5α with a plasmid carrying a promoter induced by ribitol, a compound unique to infectious structures formed by fungal spores, upstream of a fluorescent protein.

Our model describes a general AKR enzyme. The difference between AKR1C2 and AKR1C9 is probably not in the expression of the rate reaction, but at the rate reaction's constants. Because these constants can vary in different environments even for the same strain of enzyme, it means that each direction of the reaction can be inhibited on different conditions (as in [5] for rat liver and rat skin). For that reason, we will need to make an assumption about the constants in order to show that the model describes it.
We'll assume that \({K_1} < < {K_2}\) so that for \(\left[ {NADPH} \right] \approx \left[ {NADP} \right] >  > {K_1}\),
\(\frac{{\left[ {NADPH} \right]}}{{{K_1}}} >  > \frac{{\left[ {NADP} \right]}}{{{K_2}}}\)
From this assumption and equation (II) we will get:
\[\begin{array}{l}\frac{{{V_{{m_f}}} \cdot \frac{{\left[ {NADPH} \right]}}{{{K_1}}} \cdot \frac{{\left[ {DHT} \right]}}{{{K_s}}} - {V_{{m_r}}} \cdot \frac{{\left[ {NADP} \right]}}{{{K_2}}} \cdot \frac{{\left[ {3\alpha diol} \right]}}{{{K_P}}}}}{{1 + \frac{{\left[ {NADPH} \right]}}{{{K_1}}} + \frac{{\left[ {NADPH} \right]}}{{{K_1}}} \cdot \frac{{\left[ {DHT} \right]}}{{{K_s}}} + \frac{{\left[ {NADP} \right]}}{{{K_2}}} + \frac{{\left[ {NADP} \right]}}{{{K_2}}} \cdot \frac{{\left[ {3\alpha diol} \right]}}{{{K_P}}}}} = \\ = \frac{{{V_{{m_f}}} \cdot \frac"

    Meeting with VC
    Business Plan
Being in the early stages of starting our business, there’s nothing more exciting than just the idea of merely getting a meeting with someone who has even the vaguest interest in financially backing our project.
On the 16 of August we've met and presented our project to Mr. Yigal Vidal, head of the North Maccabi Healthcare. Maccabi Healthcare is the second largest health maintenance organization in Israel.                     Maccabi Healthcare is about to open a big research center and an incubator for medical startups.
Maccabi operates 150 medical clinics throughout the country, as well as 20 medical diagnostic and therapeutic centers, 43 pharmacies and two hospitals - Assuta Medical Center and Ramat Marpeh.
In the meeting we discussed how we came up with the idea for our project, our potential product pipeline, and our team.
The meeting encouraged us to write tips for the future iGEM teams that will meet angel, VC or other type of investor.
Here are some Do’s and Don’t’s, and a great list of websites that helped us to prepare for the meeting.
Do:
Research. Do the VCs you meet invest in your market and in companies of your size/stage, and are they active? Have they been making investments recently?
Prepare pitch that will include the following slides:
Current status: funds raised to-date, monthly budget, revenue, team size, team expertise, customers, metrics
• Problem you’re solving
• Market size & potential
• Solution
• Competition
• Go to market strategy
• Unfair advantage
• $$$ (how much you want to raise and why)
Be specific about your existing and target customers. Demonstrate that you understand their purchasing decisions, based on real knowledge and interactions with them. Be prepared to provide references -- the stronger your customer buy-in, the better.
 Make sure you can answer each one of the following questions.
Don't
Don't be late nor outstay your welcome (typically one hour, but check in advance and keep to it).
Don’t overpromise. Potential investors are going to ask a lot of questions. The key here is to be honest with them"

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#HP#Future_-_-_TEXT.html," for more      space to make sustainable the living of new generations, without using      the green areas.
Within this fictional scenario, CryptoGErM could offer a potential      solution.
CryptoGErM is a system for the storing and safe-sending of      information. By making use of the first purpose, we could store the      whole current information contained in books, newspapers, articles and      other physical paper-based within bacteria to reduce the      space needed for the storing of such information. Bacteria, such Bacillus subtilis is able to store up to 1.5 GB of      information; furthermore, 1 mm3 of DNA can store up to      109 GB of information. [1]
Just to put an example of this fictional application; it is      estimated that the the information contained by the U.S. Library of      Congress is equivalent to 200 TB, currently it is stored in a physical      space of 186,000 square meter. If this information is stored into DNA,      it would only occupy 0.0002 mm3.
Furthermore, storing int DNA is more eco-friendly, because it does      not require any specific medium to keep it functional, in contrast with      current magnetic and optical storage medium that requires energetic      supply to continue working. Just in 2015, 416.2 terawatt hours of      electricity were used by world’s data centres. This consumption was      “significantly higher than the UK’s total consumption of about 300      terawatt hours.” [2]
Storing information in the DNA of bacteria, will replace the current storing medium (Fictional scenario)
Spores of Bacillus subtilis from 2016 found in the New Groningen
Second fictional scenario
This fictional scenario was created as an extreme case by using the    long-term stability of Bacillus subtilis spores.
One of the advantages of our system is that the spores can survive    for several years even if they are exposed to hard conditions. So far,    studies have shown that spores exhibit incredible longevity in a broad    range of environments on our planet. Actually, there are reports from    research groups that have recovered and revived spores from samples as    old as 105 years. This data shows the capability of our    system to store information for hundreds or thousands of years, even in    a hard-conditions environment.
This application seems promising in a near future, as we found out    after the interview we had at the Groninger Archives; Jan Jaap Hoogstins,    collection manager from the Groninger Archieven, explained"

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," facilities that would reduce our lab's impact, we could easily change our own behavior to reduce our contribution. At the core of our efforts to change our own habits, we recognized that every decision, even those which are seemingly minor, contributes to a larger impact.
What does that mean?
For us, implementing sustainable habits meant giving each decision a little extra thought. Did we really need to use 12 disposable culture tubes to grow our different yeast strains, or could we achieve the same result with a reusable culture block? Extra care in our decision making forced us to confront our impact in a way that illuminated opportunities to be more sustainable. We quickly put this extra care into practice, double-checking that equipment was turned off when not in use, incubators and freezers were properly closed, and sharing autoclave cycles with labmates. We kept a tally of many of our actions in a lab notebook, so we could later assess the impact of our actions. This tally later evolved as part of our collaboration with Sustainability@BU to improve their app to help scientists gauge their impact.
Lab Maintenance is a key area for reducing impact
Another theme from our work with Sustainability@BU was that lab maintenance work provides a major opportunity to improve impact.
Incubators and freezers are both significant energy consumers in the lab, because they expend energy to maintain a set temperature. When left open, not only are samples contained inside placed at risk, but the equipment consumes even more energy in an effort to keep its set temperature.
Over the course of the summer, one of the Khalil Lab's -20oC freezers was open overnight because the ice buildup inside prevented the door from closing properly. Leaving the door open jeopardized valuable samples and enzymes inside, in addition to consuming a great deal of energy due to the extra work for the open freezer. Encouraged by this unfortunate event, we took another look at our online resources and found that developing a monthly schedule for de-icing freezers helps reduce energy consumption, in addition to ensuring that the freezer closes properly. We also got into the habit of double-checking our freezers and incubators to make sure they were properly closed (fun fact: one of our incubators only closes if you slam it like an old car door!).
Similarly, a single autoclave cycle can consume up to 900 liters of water1.  In order to reduce unnecessary use of the autoclave, we coordinated with our labmates to consolidate and share autoclave cycles, so the autoclave would be run less frequently. Tracking the number of autoclave cycles we consolidated was one way in"

Programmed polyketide synthesis
Polyketides, including macrolides, tetracyclines, anthracyclines, and other polyether compounds with anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, anti-cancer, immune suppression and other functions, are a large class of natural products produced by bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi or plants. For the heterologous expression of polyketide synthase, the main method of the technology is transferring full gene cluster into heterologous host strains.However, such method can’t synthetize various polyketides by the same polyketide synthase domains. In this project, we use polyketide synthase domains as a synthetic unit to diminish the size of the target gene fragments. Meanwhile, we optimize the linkers between domains. Furthermore, the host strain E. coli should be genetically modified in order to enable the synthesis of the corresponding substrate. In this way, polyketide synthase domains can be assembled more quickly, enabling the programmed polyketide synthesis. In addition, using our system, we can design polyketide independently. This system can select the corresponding synthesis polyketide synthase domains to synthetize polyketide programmedly.

I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.
UrbanTundra_Edmonton,2017,Team:UrbanTundra Edmonton#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," useful. On earth, perchlorate is a chemical substance that is found both naturally and in manufactured products. Generally, perchlorate contamination is a result of utilizing products containing perchlorate. Acting as a strong oxidizer, perchlorate is commonly used in solid propellants for rockets, missiles, fireworks and other pyrotechnics (Backus et al. 334). Perchlorate deposits on soil surfaces initially as a result of utilizing pyrotechnics, such as fireworks during a festival. The particulate matter containing perchlorate consequently disperses into remote areas by wind (Ye et al. 2495). Furthermore, sufficient precipitation may transport the perchlorate contaminants away from the area through surface runoffs (Kumarathilaka et al. 671). Although disruption of the thyroid gland’s functions requires large doses of perchlorate, perchlorate is a chemical that is found in various locations on Earth and can lead to various adverse effects that must be carefully considered.

Next stage is modelling,  where we use powerful computers to simulate as accurately as we can the behavior of the part, device or system that we are working on. It is present in both  the architecture and synthetic biology design cycle. However, we use different types of modelling in the two fields, and for different purposes.
There are several types of modelling in synthetic biology. To begin with, biophysical model models the behavior of the compounds in the system, such as membranes. Biochemical, stochastic and deterministic modelling are used to determine chemical pathways in the cell to help us identify different ways we can influence the system. Population modelling helps describe a certain behavior of a cell population, such as growth.
This shows the predicted biosynthesis of peptidoglycan in the presence of xylose.
In synthetic biology, we model to help us establish control parameters in order predict how our design will work. However,  because cells are extremely complex, modelling is a difficult and time consuming activity. At the moment, we don’t yet have enough information to make accurate models and it is not guaranteed that the final product will behave as the model shows.
In Architecture there are also several types of modelling.  To begin, with there are development models, which are 3D and often quick, small and very conceptual. These are used during the design stage and is probably the most common technique that students studying architecture use to develop their ideas. This phase in the design cycle is probably the most important as this is when the visual and conceptual characteristics  of the design are more or less determined. Another type is computer aided design modelling which comes in the next stage of the design cycle, testing and validation.
Step by step structure model diagram.
We use this to accurately test our design on a practical level; to see if it works and what needs rethinking.  An improved computer aided design model is very often used by architects in order to visually convey their project to others. This model is often very detailed and visually pleasing as its main purpose it to sell the design to the client. After this stage, if the client is satisfied with the design, the last stage occurs, implementation.
However, unlike in architecture, in the design cycle of synthetic biology the implementation phase (inserting out designed DNA in to a host cell), happens before the testing and validation stage as we cannot otherwise accurately predict how a host cell will respond to the DNA insertion and if the design has been properly realized. If the result is not what it should be, the design cycle is applied again (specifications, design,"

Biosystems, 2017
An interest in artificial intelligence coupled with a philosophical inclination developed an   affinity for the notion of consciousness, which, in turn, entertained the idea of ""biological  programming."" With this newfound interest in research, I sought to find a lab position in   biotechnology at UCSD; however, research in a DNA biotechnology lab did not suffice. Prior   to iGEM, I never considered Synthetic Biology as a potential avenue in biotechnology research.   However, after Jenhan, our team coordinator, provided me with a brief description of Synthetic   Biology, I was undoubtedly convinced that I had found my niche in research.
As our software project unfolded during the summer, I became responsible for the visualization   and analysis of our complex genetic network. Following the integration of the different genetic   circuits that we found in literature, I proceed to generate a graphical representation of our   database that conveyed the relationship between the different genetic circuits. In addition, I   performed a structural and connectivity analysis, to demonstrate the increase in potential genetic   circuits that our network can provide.
This project introduced me to the potential of Synthetic Biology, and demonstrated the   importance of engineering and computational principles in synthetic and systems biology.
Rohit Mande
Rohit is a fourth-year Bioengineering: Bioinformatics major who is interested in entering the bioinformatics or synthetic biology industry after graduation.  He has an active interest in the design and analysis of biological systems,, and hopes to continue to do DIYbio work outside of college.    He is primarily looking forward to iGEM as  a way to collaborate and work with  undergraduates who share the same interest.  Outside of academics, Rohit is the Internal Officer for the Undergraduate Bioinformatics Club (UBIC) and is an active member of the UCSD Quiz Bowl club.
Bioengineering: Bionformatics, 2015
I initially heard about iGEM through an email from the Undergraduate Bioinformatics  Club (UBIC) at UCSD, of which I am currently serving as the Internal Officer. I was looking for a  research opportunity over the summer to further gain exposure to computational biology before my  final year of college. When I first met Jenhan, I was a little taken aback to discover that most of  the team had already been involved with the competition for a few weeks, but when I heard the  scope of the project, my interest immediately grew and I was excited to be a part of UCSD's first  ever iGEM"

It is evident that the amount of alive yeasts with pYES2-Bax was evidently decreased after the induction by galactose, and almost disappeared after 24 hours, while the negative control colony still stayed alive.
To test the effects of Bax, we insert the coding sequences of Bax into vectors pYES2 (URA as marker), subsequent to Gal1 promoter, so that Bax will be induced by galactose. We transformed the recombined plasmids pYES2-Bax into yeasts at the same time the pYES2 plasmid as a negative control.The yeasts containing pYES2-Bax or pYES2 were cultured to log phase in liquid URA-deficient SD media with 2% glucose as carbon sources, and were then dropped into liquid SD-URA-glucose(2%) media respectively and cultivated for one day. 10μl galactose aliquot was dropped on SD-URA-glucose(2%) plate periodically.

However, the project will continue on well after the Giant Jamboree. Information will be continuously and regularly updated, and because of its nature, ""Project Riboregulator"" is not part of our work for competing awards of any kind or in any year, but rather, a tribute to the Part Registry and iGEM community alone.
CR and TA riboregulator system
Figure 1. Riboregulator Overview Diagram
Artificial cis-repressing and trans-activating riboregulator system was introduced to the iGEM community by Isaacs in 2005. The riboregulator system as a whole acts to regulate translation at the RNA level. One component of the system, crRNA, which contains a cis-repressing sequence at the 5' of the RBS, the RBS, and the gene of interest.
The cis-repressing sequence can form a loop form complementary base pairs with the RBS to prevent the recognition of RBS by ribosomes. The translation crRNA is also commonly described as a ""lock"" because it ""locks"" the RBS and prevent translation. The ""key"" to this system is the taRNA. taRNA can interact       (in trans) with the cis-repressing sequence to unlock the RBS and therefore activate translation (Figure 1.).
The benefits of this system, as described in Isaacs et al.'s paper, are leakage minimization, fast response time, tunability, independent      regulation of multiple genes etc.

AUC_TURKEY,2015,Team:AUC TURKEY#Urease_-_-_TEXT.html,", many groundbreaking discoveries were made after this discovery, making urease one of the most commonly known and investigated enzymes of today. Since 1828, urease has been scrutinized in studies and has been described in terms of structure, activity, property and functionality. Urease was also the first enzyme to be crystallized by James B. Sumner in the year of 1926. It was his achievement that got him the Nobel Prize in 1946 and the world the understanding that enzymes were structurally proteins.7 8
Structure and Activity of Urease
All ureases have functionally and structurally similar properties.9 The structure complexes are not uniform, as there exist several chimeric structures, but in effect and complex activities the enzyme structures are have great similarity. The nickel-complex of all ureases are the main effector of the reaction complex. The ureases that will be utilized in our project originate from the species of two different kingdoms, from the bacterium specie Sporosarcina pasteurii and the fungus specie Endocarpon pusillum. The functional efficiency and characterization of these two urease species are assumed to be different. There is an abundant foundation for research on S. pasteruii but the Endocarpon pusillum is an urease that remains to be characterized.
S. pasteruii is a trimeric enzyme with three chimeric parts, tagged as UreA, UreB and UreC. Almost all bacterial ureases have a similar trimeric enzyme structure and have very close activity levels.[8] These three subunits contain the α, ß and γ active sites that work in coordination to structurally change in the presence of urea to breakdown the molecule.10 The effectivity of the S. pasteruii can be understood with the relative kinetic activity of the enzyme with its counterparts, the Soy-Bean Urease and Jack-Bean Urease. The kinetic degradation rate of SBU is 1/100 of S. pasteruii urease and this relative value is 1/14 for the JBU.[8] S. pasteruii urease has a significantly higher enzymatic kinetic activity in respect to other common ureases. Also, urea is abundant substrate meaning that this reaction can reach high activity levels through high substrate concentration. E. pusillum urease is a relatively newly discovered member of the urease family of enzymes. E. pusillum is a lichen-forming fungus species, making the expected structure of the urease similar to those of other"

WLC-Milwaukee,2015,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," are found naturally, and are essentially nontoxic, given they “consist of a core of genetic material (nucleic acid) surrounded by a protein capsid”[5]. This is promising, especially for rural areas that may not be capable of developing new antibiotics to fight infections, and also for bacteria that simply cannot be killed by conventional means.
Advantages and Drawbacks
As with any scientific development, there are possibilities that phage therapy may not work as well as hoped or have unexpected side effects. Thus, it is always wise to review possible disadvantages and risks.
While the advantages include non-toxicity, no possibility of cross-resistance, relative cost-effectiveness, and potential for single dosing. Some disadvantages include the following:
Phages may kill gut flora, removing any probiotics necessary for healthy digestion, and render the patient more ill.
They also pose a danger to immunocompromised individuals by way of infection—“many protein-based pharmaceuticals can stimulate immune systems, antibiotics that lyse bacteria will release bacterial toxins in situ, and live-attenuated vaccines both actively replicate and evolve including within the context of infecting body tissues”[6]. It should be noted that phages are viruses and should be handled accordingly.
There is a potential for ineffectiveness if the phage lacks lytic capability (reproducing and destroying the membrane of affected cells at once) or virulence.
This may seem discouraging, but it should be noted that pharmaceutically-based phages go through a rigorous selection via the FDA, EPA, and the USDA after intense monitoring by pharmaceutical companies. They are selected by high virulence (so long as it does not subject patients to worse illness), non-toxicity, non-temperance (does not undergo lysogenesis), and other specifics.
Conclusion:
It may be advisable to use phage therapy in tandem with antibiotics until the alternate becomes a necessity. The decision to use them largely rests with facilitators of medicine, such as pharmaceutical companies and hospitals, but as this technology has seen marked success in the former Soviet Union, it is increasingly evident that it is a viable weapon in the fight against antibiotic resistance by virtue of its design and by the advancement of the study in post-Soviet Europe.

Integrated Practices
Introduction
An important segment of human practices is the integration of suggestions and advice learned from experts into our own project. Our team contacted potential stakeholders such as the Warwick Printing Company and worked to incorporate information learned from the interview into the experimental procedures of our project. To delve into the business realm, we also reached out to a business liaison at the University of Lethbridge. Overall, the advice from the different experts greatly improved the project design.
Warwick Printing Company
This year, team members received the opportunity to interview the president of a local printing business here in Lethbridge. Warwick Printing Company is a company that prints to consumer demand, printing books, posters, and any other paper material. President Dave Warwick had a number of useful pointers to give to us about our product that we then took into consideration. For example, when asked about the possibility of using our product in his company, he stated that as long as our ink remained consistent throughout uses, and remained cost efficient, it was a possibility. His advice on looking at consistency when developing our product helped us to consider a method of checking the ink’s consistency in the creation of our ink. In addition, Warwick shed light on the effects that the recent increase in technology has had on his business. He explained how technology has been working with his company, not against it, and advised how the printing industry has nothing to fear in technology. Overall, the advice received from this interview was very helpful in the designing of our product. This has influenced our decision making process regarding the creation of ink. For example, after hearing Mr. Warwick’s suggestions for our ink, we decided to implement quality control tests, such as photobleaching, to compare our ink to the inks found in the current market.
Interviewing Dave Warwick led to the arrangement of a tour of their facility. On July 12, 2017, members of our team were given a tour of the Warwick Printing building. We were lucky enough to have the president of the company, Dave Warwick, be our tour guide. He took us through the entire building, starting with the design area. This was a section in the building for workers to create designs"

Learining from other biology reaction network simulation software – Berkeley Software Team 2009, SynBioSS, TinkerCell, CellDesigner, because the realization of our game need simulation too. Thinking about the big picture of our game, the simulation, the UI, the database, the play modes. (Liao)Chen Liao promoted a way to do the simulation – every biobrick will have an input and an output. Though following discussion proved it was not a great idea, it is a good start for the simulation part of out game.
Kun Jiang
To start our project, I begin a detailed study of biology related softwares, including SynBioSS, CellDesigner and TinkerCell. Especially, TinkerCell is a open source software, so I can read it's source code to carefully research biology simulation software.  Those softwares provide me a lot of ideas, direct our development and influence our design.
Luojun Wang
Strict rules for safety have been considered and made.To start our own human practice, previous works have been investigated.
Shangyu Luo
Having made sure that our project will be about a game in synthetic biology, we begin to discuss the components of our software. Basically, we divide it into two parts: fore-end and back-end. I will work on the later one which includes simulation, database, interface, etc. Furthermore, I focus on the model and simulation of biological reactions and try to find a proper method to serve for our project.

Our Experiment
We first identified the genes comprising the pathway for tryptophol synthesis to be ARO9, ARO10, and ADH1 from the Saccharomyces genome database. These genes were then optimized for expression in E. coli and made compliant with iGEM RFC10 by the removal of illegal restriction sites. The genes were synthesized through IDT and ligated into DUET vectors. We chose DUET vectors because they have the T7 promoter for high protein expression. The plasmids with inserts were then transformed into DH5a E. coli cells for plasmid growth. Miniprep was performed on the DH5a cells in order to extract the plasmid, which was later transformed into BL21 E. coli cells for amplified protein expression. The BL21 cells underwent a cycled series of competency and transformation with a DUET plasmid containing a different insert. Overnight cultures from each transformation with another DUET plasmid were remade competent until we had all three genes of interest in one cell. We then tested for the presence of tryptophol in our cell culture using HPLC, and plated our cell culture against a fungus in the Chytridiomycota family.

Chytrid Identification & Isolation
In order to combat a disease, one must first learn and study the disease to figure out its weaknesses. UFlorida got into contact with Dr. Matt Smith in the Department of Plant Pathology at the University of Florida. Dr. Smith has close relations with the UF Plant Disease Clinic and has experience working with chytrids. Since B. dendrobatidis is  a virulent fungal pathogen, it was irrational to directly work with it in lab. Instead, another species from the same family, but far less threatening than Bd, would be sufficient to study. Following Dr, Smith’s advice we attempted to isolate and identify a chytrid species from the primary lake on campus.
Methods
1. Gather pond water from varying spots around the lake
2. Vacuum filtrate lake samples to remove organic matter (and mosquito eggs)
3. Pop popcorn kernels in microwave"

7) Found a pretty cool thing (though it's from 2002 so a bit old): at MIT they covalently linked a little gold ""antenna"" to enzymes or DNA, and when they stimulated the bacteria with an electromagnetic field, this disrupted the structure of the protein/DNA the antenna was attached to (because it harvested the energy of the field) so that for example the enzyme wouldn't function anymore (the effect is reversible). Couldn't find the whole article for free but here's a short summary: MIT Researchers Merge Electronics with Biology (Gabriela)
also: apparently there's some evidence that bacteria do somehow emit electromagnetic/sound waves to stimulate growth? but I haven't found much on the subject yet
8)Create a biosensor for CO (carbon monoxyde), that would turn red or green if the threshold of toxic CO is reached. Use of dried E. coli cells and a GFP cassette : an inducible promoter sensitive to CO and then the GFP gene so that the E. coli cells would turn green if there is too much CO. This could be then detect and associated with some sort of an alarm. (Caroline)
9)Engineer cells so they could synthesize ozone (no idea if it is possible), and make them resistant to cold and to create a support for them. An application would be to send these cells in the ozone layer to recreate it. (Caroline)
10) An application in personal medicine : some treatements are efficient in patient with a certain allele while it has no effect (or an adverse response) in the patients with the other allele. An alternative to sequencing every patient would be to engineer some cells so they bind to the receptor of the drug, and would fluoresce only if not bound. Use of an inducible promoter to make the control (all cells fluoresce at the beginning and when we add the ligand no more fluorescence if it is bound).  (Caroline)
11) Make heavy metals precipitate (by using a chemical reaction involving the metal ions) with the help of bacteria having such a reaction in their metabolism and refining it (Basile)

Spinning with the godet, attempt 1
90% v/v Isopropanol coagulation bath
We first tried a godet speed of 15.67 steps/second
Yesterday, we tried to measure the speed at which the fiber comes out of the tubing and obtained ___.
godet was way too slow. The thread drooped to the bath floor and the thread coming out of the PEEK tubing was just bunching at the bottom.
Tried bumping the speed all the way up to 15.6719 x 14
This cut some of the slack in the thread
However, I observed something strange: it seemed that the faster that the godet reeled the thread, the faster the thread came out of the tubing
So it never happened as we envisioned -- that the thread would be taut coming out of the PEEK tubing
Spinning with the godet, attempt 2
I was frustrated with the godet, so I had the idea to reel the silk around something that I could spin with my hands. Used a 25 mL pipette
I used tweezers to pick up the fiber and wind it around the pipette
I spun the pipette slowly at first, but realized that the fiber in the bath was still slack
I then started spinning the pipette as fast as I could -- remarkably, the fiber tolerated this, and was still slack in the bath!!
Spinning with the godet, attempt 3
Hands getting tired. I decided to let the motors do the work.
Set up the godet outside of the bath. See picture.
Silk spinner or shitty Rube Goldberg machine?
Here's the weird part, the fiber ended up being kind of slack-ish?
The thread would drop vertically down from the PEEK tubing as it emerged
But before touching the floor, it would be pulled upward towards the surface
Right below the thread, there would be some white stuff. Not sure what it"

Problem
Indonesia's oil production has been decreasing from 315 million barrels in 2012 into 238 million barrels in 2014 ( ESDM ).
This affects oil price and thus goods price that has been increasing steadily. One contributing aspect is low recovery in conventional oil recovery method that can only recover 20-40% oil from reservoir. This production can be increased into 30-60% by Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). Until 2011, implementation of EOR by waterflooding and steamflooding has contributed a 40% increase in Indonesia’s oil production ( source ). In the future, chemical injection can become another EOR alternative.
One of EOR methods by chemical injection is surfactant injection. The need of biodegradable and environment-friendly surfactant is important. One of biosurfactant is rhamnolipid, but it’s naturally produced by opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, ITB_Indonesia designs GRAS bacteria, E. coli, to be able to produce rhamnolipid in a controllable and observable manner.

We tightly communicate with several iGEM teams to improve our idea and appreciate their work.
With Shanghai JiaoTong University
On 19th April, we invited SJTU to have a mini iGEM communication meeting with us.
Our guests helped analyse which project is significant to the reality and can be achieved.
Members from Tongji University shared their opinions upon the last year's iGEM projects.
What’s your expectation for iGEM? What should an iGEM team do? What’s the challenge?
What’s synthetic biology? How is it developing currently? What's the trend?
Members from Tongji University shared their opinions upon the last year's iGEM projects.
How to lead a team? How to work efficiently?

On 19th April, we invited members from Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU) to have a mini iGEM communication meeting with us.
During the meeting, SJTU introduced iGEM competition and synthetic biology, shared their experience in team management, and discussed some last year's iGEM projects .
Thank SJTU for giving us a mini but meaningful iGEM communication meeting. We are looking forward to our further collaboration.
With Fudan University
On 8th June, We had another communication meeting with team Fudan.
Team Fudan's project idea was fantastic!
They said they need certain vector in their project.
We are happy to help them.

According to the document literature [3], the probability that the ribosomes bind to RNA can be obtained as follow:
$$ { P_{bound} } = { 1 \over { 1 + { { N_{NS} } \over P }exp({ {{{\epsilon }^{S}_{pd}}-{{\epsilon }^{NS}_{pd}}} \over {{k_B}T} }) } } $$
Because $ { {{\epsilon }^{S}_{pd}} - {{\epsilon }^{NS}_{pd}} } \approx { {{k_B}T}ln({ {K^{S}_{pd}} \over {K^{NS}_{pd}} }) } $ , therefore the expression above can be further simplified into the following:
$$ { P_{bound} } = { 1 \over { 1 + { { {N_{NS}} \over {P} } · { {{K^{S}_{pd}}} \over {{K^{NS}_{pd}}} } } } } $$
Then, convert the probability into reaction rate [4]：
$$ v = {{1000*{ P_{bound} }} \over {Volume*Avogadro}} $$
Then, in terms of the theory of order of reaction, translation rate can be converted to reaction rate constant.
$$ k = { {1000*{ P_{bound} }} \over {Volume*Avogadro*{{[mRNA]}(0)}} } $$

4) Hansch-Fujita Equation
Hansch-Fujita equation models are regression models used in biological sciences[8]. It firstly summarizes a supposed relationship between chemical structures and biological activity in a data-set of chemicals. For our model, we treated the stem loop as our target chemical substances and hoped to determine a quantitative mathematical relation between the values of the free energy (ΔG) of different stem loops (the target substances) with the constant of decay.
Hypothesis
The target chemical’s activity was the function of physiochemical properties, structural properties and error. The terminator could function like a stem loop.
Following was the hansch-fujita equation:
$$ {lg{1 \over {C_{inh}}}} = { {lg{{C_{m}} \over {C_0}}} - {0.0434{ {\Delta G} \over {RT} }} } $$
