Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

OFF-CAMPUS ACTIVITY
Jiangnan University
During this iGEM year, Jiangnan University, for the first time,                             participates in iGEM competition and established two separate teams each having an independent project.                             As they are new teams, there was much information and requirements that they had little understanding.                             On this condition, this year we set up both a cooperation relationship and mentorship.
On April 1st,                             our team and the teams in Jiangnan University held a meetup for a more detailed assistance provided by our team leader on how to succeed in meeting cardinal dues in iGEM competition and which aspects should be given high attention.                             We also imparted several tips on team management. In turn, Jiangnan iGEM team promised whatsoever help they are capable of to us.
During Conference of China iGEMer Community,                             our team with them also gained a chance to have a deeper glance of our mutual projects.                             By this chance, both of our projects had undergone the test from questions come up by each other

University of Hong Kong
During the Asia-Europe Meeting in Shen Zhen, our team had a brief discussion about us projects with Hong Kong University (HKU). Both of us had a great interest in each other’s project and would like to seek further collaboration. On 27th July, we went to Hong Kong to have a thorough and impressive meeting with the iGEM team in HKU. We shared the experience of doing transfection experiment in HEK293T and discussed the possible ways to increase the production of the exosome. In addition, some problems encountered when conducting Interlab experiment were discussed, HKU iGEM team offered us some pressure suggestions.

In this year's CCiC, we presented our project design and the work we had achieved by then.                             Also by this opportunity for iGEM community in China to showcase a variety of synthetic biology projects,                             we found that LZU-CHINA possesses a similar"
BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#HP#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," the contrast group, we’ve sent out XX questionnaires to iGEMers all around the world.
The MSLQ is based on a general cognitive view of motivation and learning strategies. There are essentially two sections to the MSLQ, a motivation section, and a learning strategies section. The motivation section consists of 31 items that assess students' goals and value beliefs for a project, their beliefs about their skill to succeed in a project, and their anxiety about tests in a project. The learning strategy section includes 31 items regarding students' use of different cognitive and metacognitive strategies. In addition, the learning strategies section includes 19 items concerning student management of different resources.
Through our adapted questionnaire, nine scales of feedbacks on students’ motivation towards iGEM could be presented, which are Task Value, Self-Efficacy for Learning and Performance, Test Anxiety, Rehearsal, Elaboration, Organization, Metacognition, Time and Study Environment Management, and Effort Regulation. However, due to the limitation on the quantity of valid feedbacks, we can only explore the internal relationship among the following scales, which are XXX.
Here’re our major results.
Destop Pet System:
This year our theme is based on a Chines literature classic story named Pilgrimage to the West, in which the Monkey King is one of the main characters. To offer a more interactive experience, we created a desktop assistant system with the cute animated figure of the Monkey King. This system can react to simple instructions in natural languages and send back with related information on synthetic biology, iGEM, and our team. Besides, the animated Monkey King will send out warm greetings and farewells to the users upon opening and closing.          这里有三个动图！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！

This is the fourth year since our university has joined in the iGEM community, whereas majority of our fellow students know little about this fantastic opportunity for fast personal growth. For the purpose of elevating the influence level of iGEM, we set up a website(加超链接到我们搭建的宣传网站) to exhibit the achievements of our past projects, to propagate the idea of synthetic biology and iGEM, and more importantly, to create a platform to document and share protocols, training videos and first-hand experiences for future"

Information & Material Sharing with other teams
Peking University is among the earliest ones to establish iGEM team in China, and we would like to share our experience and experiment materials with other teams. OUC-China iGEM team and Tsinghua_A iGEM team participate in this competition for the first time this year. We 3 teams have some online discussions, and a lot of information about iGEM 2011 competition and team organization affairs has been shared with these 2 new teams.
Besides,  we are very glad to have discussions with Yifan Yang at Peking University on  May 23rd, 2011. Yifan Yang was a member of 2007 iGEM Peking University  team and is currently an advisor of 2011 iGEM Paris_Bettencourt team. Ideas of  the two teams had been discussed and Yang also shared his current work on cell  aging.

Professor  Miha Mraz's visiting in Peking University
Professor Miha Mraz, one of the instructors  of 2010 iGEM Slovenia team from University of Ljubljana, visited Peking  University on June 17th, 2011. At the Center for Theoretical  Biology, he gave a talk on the introduction to Slovenia and University of  Ljubljana, the experience of previous iGEM Slovenia teams, and modeling and  bifurcation analysis of biological systems. Prof. Miha Mraz's visit has surely  promoted the link and communication between Slovenia team and Peking University  team.

UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," depends on a commonly measured co-factor, NADH
In addition, our device requirements needed an enzyme that could also:
over-express well in E.coli,
show activity on its respective substrate at <2nM level of enzyme,
was inhibited by triclosan at the >2nM level of inhibitor, the higher level of TCS found in treated wastewater and toxic to algae [18]
While the FabI class of enzymes are promising, it was unclear which of the thousands of enzymes we should use since all Bacteria and Eukaryotes have a fabI gene. In addition, the commercially available native substrate for FabI (crotonyl-CoA) is unstable and costly.  Therefore alternative substrates would be needed to be used in a practical setting. The wet lab portion of our project focused on:
Discovery of an enzyme that met all of our criteria,
Identification of an alternative substrate that would enable practical use,
Our wet lab effort can be broken up into four components:
1. Enzyme Selection
2. Chemical Biology Substrate Screening
3. Enzyme Engineering
4. Prototyping in Real World Waste Water
5. Future Directions
        ↥
The need: A FabI enzyme that can show nanomolar inhibition using triclosan
(Why nanomolar inhibition? Work done by Chalew and Halden showed that levels of triclosan leaving waste-water treatment plants was up to 9 nM, which happens to also be the toxicity threshold level for algae. [18])
Strategy 1a: Scan the registry to find characterized FabIs with inhibition data
We first scanned through the iGEM parts registry for existing BioBrick Parts that code for FabI. We found Bba_K771303 from the 2012 Shanghai Jiao Tong University iGEM team, however we were unable to find enzymatic characterization data on the part. We therefore proceeded with our literature search for FabI enzymes with inhibition data. Strategy 1b: Alternate candidates were found by mining the literature to find characterized FabIs with inhibition data
Triclosan inhibits type 2 fatty acid synthesis (FASII), an essential pathway in the Bacterial and Eukaryotic domains by interacting directly with the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) [3]. Evidence that we could use the enzyme to detect triclosan came from binding studies and crystallographic data initially from Heath et al. They showed that triclosan binding increases the enzyme’s affinity for NAD+ and tr"
UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," put forward. They gave us a lot of technical considerations: including the ability of our protocols to differentiate between cell-free DNA and circulating tumor DNA. They also wondered how we would amplify the signal to noise ratio in the readout itself. They also emphasized that a diagnostic test alone has limited utility, but we need to be able to generate additional clinical insight from that data . Dr. Kreisberg’s team also emphasized that in order to improve overall accuracy for a test implemented in a clinical setting, we would benefit from a workflow with reduced complexity.
Takeaway:
Talking with CCMI helped us validate the framework and troubleshoot some of the key aspects. By walking through our workflow with others, we were able to anticipate and address some of the problems that we would run into. In addition, talking to Dr. Kreisberg helped us confirm the inclusion of an exonuclease amplification strategy in our workflow. In order to simplify our workflow, our team decided that the eventual implementation of a microfluidic system or microchip platform would be extremely beneficial. This also addressed an earlier point by Dr. Alexandrov, as we were able to provide high-throughput capability.
Dr. Douglas Densmore, Boston University
After these discussions, our team realized that we did not have enough experience in working with microfluidics. Thus, we turned to Boston University for a collaboration because their hardware team was working with microfluidics. In talking to Dr. Densmore, we first explained the general framework of our idea. He then explained that there were several classes of microfluidic devices, including paper, controlled flow, and droplet-based microfluidics. He gave the advantages and disadvantages of each classification , and suggested for our use case, it would make sense to consider controlled flow . He also explained that if we were to go in a point of care direction, it would make more sense for paper microfluidics but those are typically one-step based and not as accurate as controlled flow which is designed with precision through AutoCAD and soft lithography techniques using materials such as PDMS. He also explained some of the work that he does at the CIDAR lab, which develops broad-use tools for microfluidic chip design and fabrication.
Takeaway :
Our team decided that for the most part, we would focus on the implementation and verification of the genetic circuit, and worry about microfluidic integration towards the end. We also decided that a controlled flow microfluidic device would make most sense for our use case. We also launched contact with the Boston University iGEM team and had a video call to discuss our overall idea. They helped"

Growth Curves
ATF1
The ATF1 gene encodes aldehyde dehydrogenase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ATF1 catalyzes the conversion of isoamyl acetate from isoamyl alcohol. The ATF1 gene was previously submitted by the MIT team in 2006, and here we compared the activity of isoamyl acetate production between ATF1 and ATF2.
ATF2
It is the gene encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase of yeast. We have submitted a new BioBrick part, which was the ATF2 gene encoding the enzyme that produces isoamyl acetate from isoamyl alcohol.
YJL068C
This gene encodes an enzyme involved in the production of aromatic odor in yeast cells. we submitted a new BioBrick part that encodes an aldehyde degradative enzyme.
Growth Curves
Valuable information about reporter genes
We examined the growth of various transformants expressing reporter genes such as GFP, RFP, and CFP. You can see the effects of reporter genes on the growth of E. coli cells through the growth curves. Our data suggest a helpful clue for iGEMers when they choose appropriate parts in their future studies.

In 29th September 2018, our team visited the Middle School attached to Northwest University. Since the professor Edvard Moser who won Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine gave a speech to Northwest University in 26th, our team got connection with the Middle school attached to Northwest University.
The headmaster of the middle school invited our team to give students a presentation because their students have shown great interest in biology. So in 29th, we visited the middle school to give a lecture to Grade 8.
Our team members separated into 7 classes. All members use different ways to teach students basic biology and synthetic biology in a brief. We also introduced the information about iGEM and the project of our team. Some students were so active that they even said they want to attend the competition. After presentation, we had a finding differences game. During playing time, we taught students safety norms in laboratory.
At last, we handed out our self-made questionnaire to students. All students finished the survey.
In 6th October 2018, our team visited the Middle School attached to Northwest University again. The teachers in Senior Three invited our team to give a presentation to students to encourage them since they will attend the Collage Entrance Exam soon. During the presentation, some students were impressed by iGEM competition. They said they wanted to join the competition in collage. Some of them even wanted to be admitted to our NWU. About our project, some students who have their thoughts gave us suggestions to improve our project.
The cooperation with the Middle school attached to Northwest school has given us great help in our human practice. Before we leave, the teachers expressed their expectation"

Included by Voigt in his work, but expressed at low levels. Nitrogenase mutants which didn't contain homocitrate had problems with substrate association
nifW

hesA
Related to molybdenum cofactor; part of tdiF_MoeB_HesA protein family which are involved in molybdopterin and tdiamine biosyntdesis; E. coli has botd tdiF and MoeB
May have role in creating Molybdenum cofactor, a necessary component to the FeMo-co core.
hesB
Fe-S cluster biosyntdesis, necessary for enzyme syntdesis
Fe-S clusters are important components of the Fe protein and the FeMo protein. Closest match within E. coli had 49% identity. To ensure correct metallocluster synthesis, we need to use this gene.
cysE2
serine O-acetyltransferase
Serine O-acetyltransferases are important enzymes in cysteine metabolism. Since the formation of FeS clusters is predicated on cysteine reactions, presence of this enzyme may help increase synthetic efficiency
Our analysis left us with 14 genes to be included in the minimal nif plasmids. We also designed a 15-nucleotide ribosome binding site to insert directly upstream of each gene.
RBS sequences were designed by the Penn State Salis Lab's RBS Calculator .Each RBS was designed to have a Translation Initiation Rate close to 50,000 au (Arbitrary Units) as descrbibed in considerations 1.2a & 1.2b of the Salis paper .
Plasmid Design
The literature also indicated that the expression levels of each gene need to be finely tuned in order to achieve optimal nitrogenase activity. We decided to use 2 different inducible promoters to give us more control over expression levels"
Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#Water Report_-_-_TEXT.html," Innovations are needed to improve quality and cost as well as public confidence in the process.
With many of these facts shaping the outcome of our project, we came up with an implementation plan that addresses a good proportion of these consideration. We have created an modular filtering membrane that can respond to the needs of the area it is used at. Its ultrafiltration component removes a all pathogens from the water, making reclaimed water potable, safe for close body and domestic use and agricultural irrigation. Additionally, it eases public concerns regarding the use of recycled water due to its high quality output. Membrane filtration systems such as ours are scalable and they can complement and enhance already existing smaller water processing plants that act as decentralised water systems. The membrane material can endure pressure orders of magnitude higher that the standard for ultrafiltration, making it a long-term, sustainable solution. Our efforts to create a mass production model for the system ensure a cheap water processing solution, making it more accessible. Finally, by using a GM- derived biomaterial rather than deliberately releasing GM bacteria in the water supply, we create a Synthetic Biology water innovation that feels safer to the public.

    For biologists, it is quite frustrating to find suitable BioBricks and collect useful genetic information in large volumes of literature. Now with BioDesigner Coral, biologists can search BioBricks, design with the help of recommendations and obtain genetic information of BioBricks in a more comprehensive way. It can analyze user’s design, then give recommendations about parts they may need. Through analysis of massive literature, we find useful information about genes, BioBricks, and the relations between genes. All genetic information will be exhibited in a network graph through visualization method to help users understand and use them better. Clicking on the nodes in the network, which represent genes or BioBricks, users can obtain relatively accurate information about related genes, corresponding protein, and relevant literature.

The given plasmids were first transformed into ‘E. coli’ then miniprepped to retrieve the plasmids.  Some of the miniprep product undergoes StuI digest (see step 4), while the rest undergoes EcoRI (E) and SpeI (S) digest. The E and S digest cleaves the reference promoter out of the plasmids.
The E + S digested plasmids were then ligated with our promoters of interest, which have also been digested with E + S to have compatible overhang. The ligation results in a complete plasmids with integrated promoters of interest
The complete plasmids then underwent StuI digest. The StuI digestion site is in the Ura3 gene. This step results in a linear DNA with parts of Ura3 gene on both ends.
The linear DNA from step 3 can then be integrated into the yeast genome due to the homologous Ura3 domains flanking the DNA.
The linear DNA pieces were then transformed into YPH500, a yeast strain that has a mutation in its Ura production gene. The transformed yeasts were then plated on Ura deficient YPD plates. Only cells with successful integration of linear DNA are able to grow.
Colonies were then picked and grown overnight. The GFP production of the cells was then analyzed using flow cytometry. The GFP production of strain with our promoters of interests was then compared to the GFP production of strains with the reference promoters.  The relative strength of our promoters was quantified.

B) crRNA 1-3 yield off-target probabilities below 1 in 10 million for all possible sequences on the B. subtilis genome. C) crRNA 2 yields off-target probabilities below 1 in a million for all possible sequences on the E. coli DH5α genome. D) crRNA 4 yields 10 on-target hits (blue) on the B. subtilis genome, while off-target probabilities (orange) remain below 1 in a million for all possible sequences on the B. subtilis genome.
We establish that the two designed crRNA sequences target their designated bacterial species specifically. crRNA 1-3 contains 7 on-target hits on the E. coli DH5α genome, while crRNA 4 contains 10 on-target hits on the B. subtilis genome. From this it can be concluded conclude that the designed crRNA sequences allow differentiation between the (Gram-negative) E. Coli and (Gram-positive) B. subtilis species. Arguably, designing one crRNA that targets both strains could be beneficial in distinguishing between for example a viral and bacterial infection by requiring less experiments, however a Gram-positive or negative distinction could is already very helpful.
We also compute $P_{FP}$ for the four simulations (Figure 11). For all simulations, the probability of acquiring a false-positive result was found to be low: in the order of one in a million times. Moreover, having multiple on-target sites on the genome of the bacterial species to be detected decreases $P_{FP}$ on the targeted genome. The $P_{FP}$ on the non-targeted genome, however is unaffected. This implies that having more on-target sites intuitively also increases the sensitivity of the assay. However, the off-target probability on non-target species remains unaffected by this.

Subtilis. (off-target genomes) is significantly lower than for the targeted genome, because there are multiple on-target sites.
We conclude that the design of the crRNAs is reliable as only minute off-target effects in the order of one in a million are observed. In addition, we gain a deeper insight into the effect of having multiple"

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Synthetic Biology_-_-_TEXT.html," I often have difficulties to respect it». We can create « pieces » of living organisms without of their context, stock, reproduce, transmit and assemble them. If we create biologic systems like we assemble “legos”, do not we risk considering living organisms, whose human, like simple assembling of pieces? And in this case, the respect that we consider to have face to them can be altered. Of course, we can consider that our creations are only biologic engines, synthetic distinctive machines of « natural » life forms.
But where is the limit between these ones and the artificial life? The way of one and the other were created change their natures? It is however necessary to qualify the impact what biological synthesis could have on the way we consider life: how reminded François Le Fèvre, when «we synthesized urea, the first organic synthetic molecule, it has an entire debate to know if we created life or not»; and, how emphases Lluis Mir, we could ask same questions at the beginning of chemistry. Two hundred years later, it can make smile.

Problematic linked to applications
Control of the evolution of synthetic biology products
Synthetic biology leads to the creation of living organisms which should not have exist without the human intervention and are not the fruit of a natural evolution. Will be able to control it? We are not controlling mechanism of the information storage in the living world, and we are far to be able to predict how will behave a group from its separate elements. We create parts, but will be able to predict emergent properties of their assembling? Furthermore, synthetics organisms, because they are living, evolve; will we be, asked Thierry Magnin, « in measure to control propagation of these lively engines that we construct? » Thanks to their capacity to evolve, do they risk to escape to our control? Willy Rozenbaum observe that the pression responsible of the evolution will exist even for organisms which are not due to this pression; and that « it is more performant and less nocive that will go out of this; because these presion will stay ».

To assess the risks and benefits of a science, we have to wonder for what it is intended, and if the risks are taken by beneficiaries. In the case of synthetic biology, risks are taken by the society and it must be the same for benefits. The financial interest of a small community does not have to harm the majority.

In the plate, each bottle added four samples, and the OD600 and fluorescence values were measured in a enzyme-labeled instrumen. Thereafter, the bacteria solution was added to the 96 hole plate every hour, and the OD600 and fluorescence values were measured for 5-6 hours until the fluorescence value was substantially stable and no longer increased. And data for various treatments per time period were obtained. Finally, the fluorescence intensity corresponding to each OD at each time is calculated according to the method already stated above.
Analysis and discussion of results
Fig.23 A) No IPTG without ampicillin. B) IPTG without ampicillin. C) No IPTG with ampicillin. D) IPTG with ampicillin.
Preliminary analysis of results
We have obtained the experimental results shown in the above figure through repeated experiments. Through the experimental results, we found that the system we constructed with TGATG and T7 RNA Polymerase as the core did not exert our expected results. The single-cell fluorescence intensity of the control group in the overall experimental results was generally greater than that of the experimental group, which is contrary to our expectation of increasing yield. One possible reason is that GFP is a smaller protein meanwhile T7 RNA Polymerase and gdh are both relatively large proteins, so the T7 final part plasmid transferred into the experimental group is much larger than the plasmid transferred into the control group. Therefore, compared with the GFP-only strain, the strain containing the T7 system has a greater burden due to the production of T7 RNA Polymerase and gdh, so that the strain with the T7 system has a lower yield than the strain containing only GFP. In addition, by reviewing the literature, we find T7 promoter is a very strong promoter. It has been shown in the literature that it can be ligated into a medium copy number plasmid to produce 50% of the protein in the whole cell, not to mention the vector we use is a high copy number plasmid. Therefore, when a large amount of gdh is produced, a large amount of nutrients are consumed for the production of gdh. So that other biochemical metabolic pathways within the cell are inhibited. This is adverse to the growth of cells. For these two issues, on the one hand, we speculate that if the sequence of the target gene is relatively long and the expressed protein is more complex, that is, when the target gene is expressed, the bacteria will be"

In the summer of 2017, Prof. Amann and Prof. Kirner taught the synthetic biology class for the first time. Several students of the 2018 HSHL iGEM team took their class this year or the year before. This way most of us got a broad overview about the topic “synthetic biology”.  Part of the class is designing a theoretical project, which could take part in the iGEM competition. Amyra Schmitt, our student project leader, started the course last year and she and her group members had the idea, which is now the idea of our iGEM project. Actual brainstorming to realize this idea started beginning of this year, around February 2018. Our initial lab work started in April.

Toulouse_France,2016,Team:Toulouse France#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," today, what is happening is that only 8 young women are involved in the iGEM adventure in Toulouse. Actually the selection to be part of the team was made based on the skill and motivation of the student and not on his gender. At the end of the selection process, it turned out that the most appropriate candidates were all women! Not to say, we are quite proud of the results!
We are of course aware of the statistical study from the 2013 iGEM Paris-Bettencourt team showing that parity inside a team positively influences its success. Against this statistic and for modestly contribute to the fight for men-women parity, we would like to demonstrate that only complementary skills are the secret ingredient to the success in this competition, beyond the gender.
WHY SAVE ART ?
Art is a paradox in itself. Indeed, at the time of the Renaissance, an interesting definition of art appeared: it is a disinterested and free activity, pleasant in itself, having no utility for production. But if art is aimless, why of all times, men made art and attempted to protect it?
In other words, is it really necessary to save art? Indeed, one may think that science is useful only when it is in the service of health or the environment. But why limit oneself? Combining science and disciplines based on beauty and aesthetics for example is an interesting combination. Art has existed for as long as we did, and has always seemed to be associated with what makes us humans.
However, isn’t a work of art destined to disappear? In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, Buddhist conceived mandalas (support for meditation and visualization, symbol of the universe) in the sand (very sensitive material overtime). These disappear with the tide and weather. For Buddhists, a work of art made of sand, then destroyed, allows the artist to understand and accept the transience of material things and to detach oneself. Even today, ephemeral art is practiced for example in the Landart. This is a trend of contemporary art that uses the framework and materials of nature (wood, earth, stones, sand, water, rock, etc.). Thus, at any time, ephemeral art persists. Does it really make sense to save these frescoes? Moreover, despite all our efforts, the world tends toward entropy (second law of thermodynamics), which means that the universe tends toward disorder and disintegration. Will we actually counteract this law of nature by saving the frescoes in the cave? Or maybe, we could be satisfied with the survival to transmit this work as long as possible to the future generations? Humans have"

For plasmid DNA, the NEB Taq PCR instruction manual indicates that we need 0.1-1 ng/mL of DNA in the final 50 uL reaction.  This means 0.05 ng of DNA for 1 ng/mL in 50 uL.  If 2.0 uL of plasmid DNA is added to each PCR reaction, this means that the desired concentration is 0.05 ng / 2 uL = 0.025 ng /uL.
Because we read online that one should use 1 ng of template for the entire reaction, we ended up diluting the plasmid in each case to 0.5 ng/uL and using 2 uL of each per reaction.

Looked at plates to discover that the transformations had barely worked, if at all.  Observed colonies on the following plates: positive control 256 (1 colony), 54, P0661, CFPx2 (1 colony), and 259 (1 colony).  Approximately 16 hr 20 min in the incubator.  Since the transformation mix from yesterday had been saved in the fridge overnight, decided to add some more LB to this and then to replate it after an incubation perdiod.  Added 200 uL of LB to each and then placed in incubator with shaking for 4 hr and 8 min. Will prioritize replating the following parts: 323, 266, 329, DD21, DD25, and 1A.  On a fresh plate for each part, added 50 uL to half the plate and 200 uL to the other. Put in incubator at 4:57 pm.
Also decided to replate the parts that only had a single colony per plate.  Did a streak from that one colony for half of the new plate and use 200 uL of transformation liquid from yesterday on the other"
DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project#Intein_-_-_TEXT.html,"PS) are not exclusive in their ability to produce short cyclic peptides. CyBase contains 818 entries of ribosomal head-to-tail cyclic peptides from 105 different species [1]. The peptides vary from 8 to 80 amino acids in length and in number of internal cysteine bridges that stabilizes the cyclic peptide [2]. Ribosomal cyclic peptides are potential drug candidates and their synthesis may be exploited to produce peptide drugs with increased stability or bioavailability. In one mechanism of cyclization (Figure 1), self-splicing proteins (inteins) bind and catalyze their own excision, while forming a peptide bond between the N-extein and C-extein. Numerous of inteins have been characterized, including split intein Npu DnaE from Nostoc punctiforme PCC73102 (Npu) (Figure 1) [3][4]. When the Npu DnaE intein catalyzes its own excisions, it leaves a six amino acid scar behind. The scar is called the extein. Npu DnaE has a native scar of “AEY/CFN”. This scar can in large parts be changed to other amino acids to better fit a potential synthetic peptide target [4].
 
Experimental Design and Methods
The BioBrick  BBa_K1362000  was added by Heidelberg to the iGEM registry in 2014. It contains Npu DnaE inteins surrounding a RFP selection marker, which can be cut out with restriction enzyme BsaI. Digestion of BBa_K1362000 with BsaI generates to different overhangs, thus making it possible to insert the coding sequence (CDS) for your protein of interest. The BioBrick was used to cyclize different proteins. To our knowledge, it was not used to cyclize short peptides.
We decided to try and cyclise a synthetic 10 amino acid peptide which has similar amino acid sequence to tyrocidine. In addition, we searched the cyclic peptide database for bioactive cyclic peptide, which contained part or the entire or part of the extein scar in its native sequence. We selected a hit for a cyclotides with 33 amino acids. The sequences for both native peptides along with the sequence chosen for cyclization experiments are shown in Table 1.
Table 1 Peptides selected for this study. Npu DnaE requires a cystine at position 1 in the extein[4]. For tyrocidine the"
Vilnius-Lithuania,2016,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Human Practices#all_-_-_TEXT.html," to have a discussion about synthetic biology and our project that was broadcasted live via Youtube. The viewers could write their questions to the team in Youtube. We covered a number of topics ranging from the treatment of phenylketonuria to using synthetic biology approaches for dyeing jeans (this was actually the project of Berkeley iGEM 2013 team called “Blue Jeans” ).
Mutual event with 'Society for Innovative Medicine'
This was an event to present both Vilnius iGEM and ‘Society for Innovative Medicine’ (‘Inovatyvios medicinos draugija’). We decided to collaborate because we had a few mutual goals such as looking for new approaches in medicine or encouraging students to get involved in scientific research.  Our team presented iGEM competition our project and a few of other teams (such as Edinburgh 2006 and their arsenic biosensor) to better illustrate synthetic biology in general. We also encouraged students to join Vilnius iGEM 2017 next year!

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#PolicyAndPractices#artificialcell_-_-_TEXT.html," the laboratory completed synthetic production method, which is why they can be labeled as ""genetic artificiality"" (Birnbacher 2006).
The ambiguous and imprecise formulation can lead, as much as the phrase ""living machine"" to ethical problems. It is indicated that the synthetic modified organisms differentiate from ""natural"" organisms and are in contrast ""unnatural"". Splitting organisms in these two groups leads to an apparent dissection of the concept of life, even though both are ""natural.""
Again, as with the distinction between ""living"" and ""non-living"" this leads the division between ""natural"" and ""artificial"" to an altered prospect on life and a problematic classification and grading of the unit life (Boldt / Müller 2009).
Conclusion
Thinking ahead, the possibilities of creating new organisms through manipulation, reduction and modularization leads to man as a kind of ""Creator"". This opens up new ethical, social and philosophical areas of conflict. In this article the problem arising from the use of terms like ""living machines"" and ""synthetic / artifical cell"" were highlighted.
Particularly problematic is in our eyes, that there are several types of interpretation.
A science which has the possibility to improve the lives of people with new, low-cost and effective methods of environmental protection, the treatment of diseases and many other areas, should provide an unambiguous basis for an informed discussion. The fact that terms imply false and failing to reach full potential scenarios, prevents a qualified debate on opportunities and risks in this field. An example of this can be seen in the genetic engineering debate, in which, through ignorance of the topic often irrational fears are raised which prevents a professional informed debate on this matter.
It is crucial to apply a definition, which is without ambiguity and reflects real possibilities and boundaries of this field. A proposal for a solution could be ""mechanical living organism"", through which the problem of the misleading hybrid character of terms is dissolving.

1.1 Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, and/or environmental safety?
1.2 Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry, how did you manage to handle the safety issue, and how could other teams learn from your experience?
1.3 Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
1.4 Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices, and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, and/or environmental safety?
The researcher is not being exposed to any sort of biological element that would cause serious harm to him or her in anyway. The strand of E. coli being utilized in our project would not be resilient in the human body, should contamination occur. Thus, there is very little risk of infection from our bacteria. All other researcher activities use standard biological engineering and molecular biology protocols and methods that pose little harm to the researcher when proper safety precautions are observed. Some testing involving radiation is involved, but that testing would be done independently of our research group in a controlled facility.
Our project idea could actually promote public and environmental safety, if successful. Practical use of this project would help to ensure that radiation levels within a certain area is not within dangerous levels able to cause serious harm to a person. This helps to promote public safety such that people can be told to stay away from certain areas that have high levels of radiation easily.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry, how did you manage to handle the safety issue, and how could other teams learn from your experience?
Any new BioBrick parts for our team do not raise any immediate safety concerns, and so none are listed as such in the registry. However, should the idea behind our project become a reality, some concerns as to containment of our genetically engineered strains of E. coli should be addressed. If our bacterial dosimeter is to be used in the field proper safety and handling issues should be dealt with and are being factored"

Secretion Strategy:
E.coli is commonly used as a chassis in innovative iGEM projects that aim to prove a concept and make the case for a novel function in a biologically engineered machine.  In our case, we aim to degrade and synthesise plastic and the degradation part of our system needs to be extracellular. There are many strategies for secretion. You can read about these on our Secretion Guide page and find the corresponding biobricks and projects. If you are currently in the process of designing a Genetically Engineered Machine in E.coli, this page provides a good starting point to look for information.
We chose the pelB secretion tag as it has been demonstrated to work in many cases, sometimes with very high transport efficiency (1)(2). pelB has been used in iGEM projects for many years and is part of 50+ constructs. The UC-Davis team last year used it to secrete LC-Cutinase, a PET plastic degrading enzyme (BBa_K936013) successfully, which is somewhat similar to our plastic-degrading enzymes.
Safety:
We considered the safety aspects of using the PudA enzyme, since its sequences were originally from a Risk Group 2 (RG2) organism. We submitted our safety information to iGEM for review. Safety forms were approved on October 2nd, 2013 by the iGEM Safety Committee. We did not use the organism only the part itself and the final sequences were codon optimised for expression in E. coli, which included the elimination of the forbidden restriction sites.

iGEM Team FAU Erlangen for iGEM Team Aachen
Our teams met for the first time at the German iGEM meetup in Marburg held in the beginning of August. The team from Erlangen consists of many chemistry students and so they are more into this field than we. Getting our non-canonical amino acids solved in various solvents turned out to be more difficult than we expected. So we asked them for help. They took the time to dig deeper into this topic and sent us literature they found. In addition, we arranged a skype meeting, where we discussed possible strategies for solving our non-canonical amino acids. The counterpart of this collaboration can be seen on iGEM FAU Erlangen's wiki .
iGEM Team Technion Israel
iGEM Team Aachen for iGEM Team Technion Israel
The iGEM Team Technion uses a Tar receptor in their project fused to a linker and a GFP Protein. Based on this expression system the team wants to check the function and the location of the Tar protein in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli.This receptor is required for chemotaxis in E. coli and used by the team in Israel for several purposes.  Because of problems with the linker, our team suggested to build an expression system without linker to check the possibility of fusing the proteins without any linker sequence.  Thus we are able to check its influence and can discuss, if the linker could be a reason for iGEM Team Technion’s problems.
Figure 3: Expression system designed by team Technion, once with linker (top) and once without (bottom).
To build this expression system, we used several parts from the iGEM Kit plate and put them together partly using the common restriction sites of iGEM. For performing the experiment, we wanted to use the same conditions and parts, which the iGEM Team Technion used for their expression system. Therefore, we used the BioBricks BBa_E0040 (GFP), BBa_K777000 (tar receptor), BBa_J04500 (promoter and RBS) and BBa_B0015 (terminator) to build the expression system, which can be seen in figure 3.
The work for the collaboration started with the transformation of the single BioBricks. Afterwards, we cloned GFP and the Tar receptor as the first two parts of"

BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"ose. Main considerations in this model are the process of repression, induction, transcription, translation, degradation and catalysis.
The assumptions we made are:
(1) AraC protein is enough to combine with the arabinose
(2) The concentration of repressor protein will not change while a part of them are combined with the promoter sequence
(3) When the arabinose doesn’t exist, PBAD promoter can be completely silent
(4) The effect of PBAD promoter’s will be fully terminated by the terminator B0015
(5)The ""in-promoter"" will constitutively express the RFP protein when the inhibitor protein doesn’t exist
The reaction processes of circuit are described as below:
PBAD promoter activity:
""In-promoter"" activity:
And groups of differential equations are:
We chose the cI-PR circuit to apply this model. There are some parameters for promoter activity equations:
The initial values and description of variables are:
So we can get the curve describing the relationship between the RFP intensity and time under the different concentrations of arabinose (Fig. 4).
Fig.4 PBAD promoter induced by different concentration of the arabinose from 0.0000％ to 0.0050％ and the PR promoter respond to different concentration of inhibitor to express the corresponding RFP intensity. More arabinose added, less RFP expressed.
From this curve (Fig. 4), we can clearly see the RFP intensity changes with time going on. The concentration of the arabinose will affect the expression of RFP negatively.
After this, in order to get the relationship between the RFP intensity and the concentration of arabinose more intuitive, we also got this curve about the relationship between RFP intensity and arabinose when the RFP intensity was stable (Fig. 5).
Fig.5 this curve is about the corresponding RFP intensity under the different concentration of the arabinose.
From this picture, we can know the ""in-promoter"" activity have a relationship with the different concentrations of the arabinose. That means when we add different concentrations of arabinose, the concentration of inhibitor will also be different. We regarded the concentration of arabinose 0.003% as a threshold, the corresponding expression of RFP (stands for killer) is about 12.05 units. At this point the expression of killer is regarded as just be repressed. Once the concentration of inhibitor decreases further, the killer gene can start to work. Conversely, more inhibitor remains, the killer will be repressed harder. Thus"

I am a first year PhD student from the Frontières du Vivant PhD school. I studied Molecular Biology at University of Zagreb (Croatia) and did a semester long exchange at Uppsala University (Sweden) where I studied Microbial and Evolutionary Genetics and Bioinformatics. I spent almost whole last year working on application of synthetic biology in fundamental research and participating in iGEM as a part of the Paris Bettencourt team on a highly noticed and successful project.  My primary scientific interest is application of synthetic biology for creating bioproducts as well as using synthetic biology in fundamental research. Also, I’m quite interested in developing synthetic biology as a tool for creating living organisms from scratch as we build many non-living constructs today. I joined iGEM team again this year because I had a lot of fun last year and because it is a unique research opportunity that only rare get to experience.

BIT-China,2013,Team:BIT-China#humanpractice.html_-_-_TEXT.html," our team, COFCO has provided us with great opportunities to communicate with fermentation companies and biological experts. COFCO is the largest supplier of diversified products and services in the agricultural products and food industry in China. We set up the bridge of cooperation for COFCO that they use our product to promote their fermentation technology. This relationship can help us verify our result in manufacturing. And our product might be industrialized.
Discussion and Learning
In September, our team has got an opportunity to go to COFCO for communication.
Engineers and experts in COFCO provided many valuable practical suggestions for us. They suggest us to confirm our data resource further. To overcome these problems, we built the model “heat＆quantity” to predict the optimal temperature. This communication help us understand the aim of our work better.
Industrialize
By now, COFCO have used our product in saccharomycetes in testing phases. It's predictable that this project will be utilized in fermentation to economize the costing of fermentation industry.
In the last term, our school have already held several lectures about iGEM in Liangxiang campus of BIT. So this time, we mainly focused on the project of our team and recruited new membership for next year’s competition. We spent about one hour to show our project in detail, meanwhile we also exchanged different suggestions and ideas with audiences who are from life school or other majors. By our lecture, the students have a further understanding of whether synthetic biology or iGEM. What’s more, these junior students are so enthusiastic that more than forty of them wanted to join iGEM. We really appreciate it and we believe with so much power our team can perform better in the next year.
This night, our team made a lecture in The high school affiliated to Minzu University of China which aimed at introducing synthetic biology and iGEM to high school students. During the lecture, firstly our teammates summarized synthetic biology briefly. Then we showed some simple examples in advanced synthetic biology and our project according to the audiences’ knowledge. After that, iGEM was introduced specifically especially the high school iGEM. We displayed the situation of teams of Chinese high school in the past few years. In this aspect, those young girls and boys showed great passion and asked us many valuable questions. Certainly, each of us answered these questions patiently and encouraged them who are interested in iGEM come to BIT for the further communication. Meanwhile, we built up relationship with the biology club of High School. Hopefully, in the near future, more and more Chinese high school students will participate in iGEM family"

Overview

Simulations
Simulation 1: The state of system prior steady state
We can see that between time units 0 and 7 in the top and bottom plot (where [PlacI] = output amount of LacI and [Pout] = output amount of protein) there is a period of transition towards a fixed concentration. Initially, levels of [PlacI] rise until they reach a constant level, while levels of [Pout] experience a “bump” prior steady state, which settles at a value close to zero when [PlacI] = 2.
Expression of LacI repressor protein is constitutive, therefore, the switching on has already taken place prior IPTG induction. Therefore, we assumed that prior IPTG induction, levels of [PlacI], and consequently, [Pout] were originally at their values of steady state, as shown below:
Simulation 2: How does the amount of LacI protein affect the amount of protein of interest [Pout] produced?
The greater the strength of the promoter, the greater the transcription rate (PoPs, here represented as kml). In these simulations we are showing that by varying the strength of the promoter for different arbitrary PoPs values (from 0-5), we can regulate the initial basal expression of protein of interest [Pout]. From the simulations, when levels of Plac are originally low (for a low PoPs output, kml = 0 or 1), we obtain a high basal expression of [Pout]. This changes when the strength of the promoter is increased (kml=3,4,5), as now levels of [Pout] initially are zero. So initial repression of production of protein of interest is effective when the strength of the PLacI promoter is high.
Simulation 3: How does promoter leakiness affect the basal amount of protein of interest [Pout] produced?
From Equation 4, we remind ourselves that [Pout] at steady state is given by:
Therefore, increasing the leakiness factor k leak (from 0-50%) will increase the basal  amounts of [Pout] expressed prior IPTG induction, as can be seen from the figure below. This means that in the absence of IPTG, a residual amount of protein of interest will always be expressed.

I just finished my fourth year of Biological Sciences specializing in Cellular, Molecular and Microbial Biology at the University of Calgary. I have research experience related to the phytoremediation of the oil sands and as such, I hope I will be able to apply some of that knowledge to this project. I have never been involved in iGEM before, but I am very excited to be participating in the wet lab portion of it this year. I am positive that iGEM will be a great opportunity to learn about synthetic biology and to develop my independent research skills. Some of my interests outside of academia include playing competitive soccer, riding my bike and traveling.

A more accurate model using Gillespie algorithm
To make the model more convincing, we use Gillespie algorithm, which is a kind of stochastic simulation algorithm to generate a statistically correct trajectory (possible solution) of a stochastic equation.
Summary of the steps to run the algorithm
“Step 0 (Initialization). Input the desired values for the M reaction constants c_1,. . ., c_Mand the N initial molecular population numbers X_1,. . ., X_M. Set the time variable t and the reaction counter n both to zero. Initialize the unit-interval uniform random number generator (URN). Step 1. Calculate and store the M quantities a_1 = h_1 c_1,, . , , a_M = h_M c_M for the current molecular population numbers, where h_v is that function of X_1,. . ., X_M defined in (1). Also calculate and store as a_0 the sum of the M a_v values. Step 2. Generate two random numbers r1 and r2 using the unit-interval uniform random number generator, and calculateτandμaccording to (2) and (3). Step 3. Using theτandμvalues obtained in step 2, increase t byτ, and adjust the molecular population levels to reflect the occurrence of one R_μ, reaction; e.g., if R_μ is the reaction in (4), then increase X_1 by 1 and decrease X_2 by 1. Then increase the reaction counter n by 1 and return to step 1. “(Danlel T. Gillespie, 1977, p. 2345)[7] We define for each reaction R_μ and h_μ according to the equations below.

Module 5: Salt Tolerance
Description | Design | Construction | Characterisation | Modelling | Results | Conclusions
Characterisation of BBa_K729005 (IrrE)
From our results, we observed that E. coli transformed with the IrrE gene exhibits greater salt tolerance than their non-transformed counterparts. This is revealed in the greater optical density (OD) the cells grow to in high salt media, as well as their increased growth rates in the exponential growth phase. Our results are consistent with the results obtained in the original paper, establishing the fact that our cells are indeed expressing the IrrE global regulator.
Characterisation of BBa_K398108 for Comparison
We have observed that the results we have obtained for the characterisation of BBa_K398108 are consistent with those of the TU Delft '10 iGEM team. From the growth curves obtained (see graph below), an increase growth rate during the exponential phase is observed in E. Coli expressing BBa_K398108 as opposed to the wild type when the salt concentration of the media is elevated.
However, while we have managed to replicate the results of the TU Delft '10 iGEM team, we question the viability of this BioBrick for conferring salt tolerance in E. coli. While the growth rate is improved for the cells expressing the BioBrick, the overall cell density is not - from our results, the final OD of the cells in the stationary phase is not higher than that of the wild-type.
Examining the literature, a better gauge of salt tolerance can be found via an increase in OD over the wild type cells in increased salt concentrations, which this BioBrick has not been shown to do. As such, the choice to use K398108 to confer salt tolerance on our cells would remain questionable at best"

Between A type cells, there is a region of attraction      $(R_0 \leq r_{ij} < R_{cutoff})$,      where the force points towards the other cell,      hence moving them closer together.      In the repulsive domain $(r_{ij} < R_0)$,      two regions were defined, emulating lower      repulsive forces $(\frac{R_0}{2} \leq r_{ij} < R_0)$      and higher repulsive forces due to a higher spring      constant when the cells are even closer $(r_{ij} < \frac{R_0}{2})$.      For the purely repulsive interaction      scheme there is no attraction and therefore      the spring constant for $R_0 \leq r_{ij}$ is zero.      More details about the implementation of the      cell-cell interaction scheme, more specifically      regarding the nearest-neighbor search algorithm,      can be found in the paragraph on the agent-based      module below.
Equation of Motion
Now we are ready to construct the equation of motion for cell type A and B as a       superposition of an adapted Keller-Segel SDE (6)       and cell-cell interaction forces (10),                         yielding (11).

Skyping with the Stockholm team
Our first contacts with other teams started together with 2014 Aalto-Helsinki team, as university students from Stockholm building a new iGEM team from scratch contacted Aalto-Helsinki. In one of the very first meetings of the Aalto-Helsinki 2015 team we had a Skype session together with Aalto-Helsinki 2014 and the new Stockholm team. We first exchanged ideas with Stockholm and Aalto-Helsinki 2014 gave them advice in starting a completely new team. We kept close contacts with the Stockholm iGEM team throughout the summer, often having Skype sessions for updates on both teams' progress and for sharing experiences and ideas.
We were eager to meet the Stockholm team already before the Giant Jamboree, and were strongly supportive of expanding the planned Swedish iGEM meetup to a Nordic iGEM Conference, which was indeed realized in Uppsala in the end of July. On our way to the conference, we visited the Stockholm iGEM team lab at the AlbaNova University Center and met with the team. Our wonderful guide Sarah from the Stockholm team also kindly gave us a tour around the Royal Institute of Technology and Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm.

Based on these results, it was concluded that the old BL21DE3 batch already was contaminated with kanamycin and chloramphenicol resistance. The new batch does not show this, and therefore meets the requirements to continue in vivo screen work. Also, the plates poured on 22/8/2018 show good viability and chromogenic conversion of X-gal.

As you can see in Fig 7., the OD value in response to the decreasing concentration of glucose was gradually reduced to 1.89 much less than average 2.71 in control group without suicide gene expression, implying that the suicide proteins killed the cells in the loss of glucose in the environment. Moreover, when the bacteria were grown in M9 media with 0.5mM glucose for 4 hours, the survival rate was decreased to 34% compared to 56% of bacteria without suicide genes (Fig. 8). And the cell numbers were reduced to 671 compared to 1120 of bacteria without suicide genes. Both data confirmed that this suicide device works well and indicated that killing process began when glucose in the media was running out.
Background
Salmonella typhimurium LT2 has two glucose-specific transporter systems, PTS system and sodium/glucose cotransporter. PTS system contains two subunits IIA encoded by crr and IIBC by ptsG which are assembled to a high-affinity active transporter. The other is a Na+/glucose cotransporter encoded by STM1128 that contributes to facilitated transport with lower glucose affinity. Based on our research, the glucose transporter of Salmonella has a lower Km compared to human small intestine, Staphylococcus and E. coli (Table 1), indicating a higher efficiency for glucose uptake. In our project, we created the glucose transporter device and genetically engineer microbes with these two systems.
In order to express the genes in E. coli for demonstration and in probiotics for proof-of-concept in a real world. We chose promoter CP29 that is a strong constitutive promoter working well in both E. coli and Lactobacillus spp1. The biobrick part, CP29-RBS-aeBlue (BBa_K1033280) was used and to be assembled with the transporter genes.

Feel free to browse through the cloning guide.
Golden Gate, Gibson, 3A, Standard Assembly – whenever you want to stitch two or more pieces of DNA together, you have a lot of options! But choosing which option to use for any particular task can be dificult, and that’s just the beginning; while each method has its advantages, they also all come with downsides or potential problems that must be troubleshooted. Thankfully for future iGEM teams, this task just got a little easier with TU_Eindhoven’s Cloning Guide, which was our collaboration project for this season.
We wish we could take credit for this excellent idea, but it was the TU_Eindhoven iGEM team that reached out to us and asked if we could write a chapter of their guide for them. Realizing the benefit of such a guide, we happily agreed!
Our team was assigned the 3A Assembly method. To complete the guide, we assembled our protocols, wrote an FAQ section, documented our personal experience with the assembly method, researched its history, and weighed the pros and cons of 3A. We also included a couple of diagrams and sources for further reading. To validate our protocol, we successfully used 3A Assembly to combine a yellow chromoprotein from the distribution kit with a promoter and a new backbone.
We checked in several times with TU_Eindhoven throughout the competition season for feedback on the guide’s progress. After incorporating the suggestions, we sent back our final version so that it could be incorporated into the complete guide. Keep an eye out for it to check out our contribution, as well as the sections on the rest of the cloning methods, which were written by other 2015 iGEM teams. It just might make your next cloning protocol go that much smoother!"

- Part: BBa_K726016 - Link: BBa_K726016
YoeB and YefM are new submissions to the registry and we have demonstrated that both constructs and parts work as desired.
Experience and Improvements with Existing BioBrick Parts
VioABE is an improvement on the previous submitted part by the 2009 Cambridge iGEM team ( BBa_K274003 ). This is because our part contains only the three necessary genes to produce the green pigment. It is smaller and easier to clone, yet achieves the desired output.
The part necessary to produce the green pigment is now reduced in size from 5.9 kb to 4.8 kb
As reported by other teams in the Experience section, attempts to retrieve the Cambridge submitted part from the registry have failed. The restriction sites were not correct and we found that it failed as a PCR template for any of the four genes reported. Therefore, we obtained a template from another source (Dueber Lab, UC Berkeley) and are submitting the DNA for these three enzymes for use by future iGEM teams.
Finally, we have made the extraction of violacein ( BBa_K274002 )"

The promiscuous activation in the control samples with probe alone might potentially indicate a bottleneck in our detection scheme, with high concentrations of probe triggering unwanted indiscriminate background signal from Cas12a,                       and low concentrations of probe not being sufficient to trigger RCA efficiently.
However, there are numerous optimization strategies that we will consider in order to improve on our proof-of-concept detection scheme: increase the amount of phi-29 in the RCA reaction, in order for the amplicons to reach a concentration                       significantly higher than that of the probe, and dilute the RCA product before starting the Cas assay, as well as exploring other probe designs.
In conclusion, we present an innovative proof-of-concept miRNA detection platform based on dumbbell probe RCA-Cas12a, present encouraging preliminary results and believe that further optimization will lead to a sensitive and specific                       assay. Finally, we envision that it will be possible to engineer our assay for point-of-care detection.

Future Work
Our products at present is using aqueous formaldehyde solution as a test to be detected and absorbed in the experiment. So we plan to find more suitable methods for detecting gaseous formaldehyde in order to further advance practical engineering applications.
We will expect to further optimize our prototype in the following aspects, such as universality, portability, sensitivity and accessibility, to make it be more closer to actual needs.
Also, we are planning to advertise this competition to our schoolmates and help them to prepare for the next game. We will cooperate with our school advisors to set up IGEM club for students who have the spirits in synthetic biology.

PAL with T7 promoter Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) catalyzes the conversion of L-phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid. This part is a modification of University of British Columbia’s 2013 PAL biobrick part (BBa_K1129003) from Streptomyces maritimus. Specifically, our part contains a T7 promoter, allowing for inducible expression.
Biobrick: BBa_K1692004
Codon-optimized PAL with T7 promoter and FLAG tag Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) catalyzes the conversion of L-phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid. Our PAL construct is codon-optimized for expression in E. coli. The original sequence is derived from Anabaena variabilis. We chose the A. variabilis variant of PAL because the literature has characterized it as functioning well, in contrast to University of British Columbia’s 2013 PAL biobrick part (BBa_K1129003) from Streptomyces maritimus, which has much lower activity.  Our construct includes the PAL coding sequence, a T7 inducible promoter, a ribosome binding site, and a FLAG-tag peptide sequence for easy and efficient protein purification. We have sequenced our construct and verified that all these components are indeed present.

UbiX UbiX is a flavin prenyltransferase that normally plays a role in ubiquinone biosynthesis in E. coli. UbiX transfers a prenyl group from dimethylallyl monophosphate (DMAP) to flavin mononucleotide (FMN), thereby creating a cofactor that happens to be essential to the functionality of FDC. This part is contains the protein-coding UbiX sequence from E. coli.

Plasmid Builder
A browser-based, interactable plasmid design tool
Plasmid Builder is a GUI for AngularPlasmid , by Vivix, and was created so iGEM teams without AngularJS experience can make visual, interactive plasmids for iGEM wikis (or any other website). Unlike the info-rich but hardly sharable plasmid maps of Geneious, SnapGene, LabGenius, Benchling, Savvy, etc., Plasmid Builder is a web-based tool that simplifies the process of adding and customizing plasmid parts and then exporting as HTML. The components of AngularPlasmid have been wrapped with a constructor so new plasmid parts and tracks can be updated from the browser; the two-way data-binding of AngularJS allows for real time updates and changes.
*There are some features of Vivix’s AngularPlasmid that we left out for the sake of usability, so check out his library if you are comfortable with AngularJS and want additional customizability.

components
View Section
The View component is central to Plasmid Builder. As the parts are added or adjusted in the Parts component, the plasmid map updates to reflect additions, changes, rearrangement, etc. Using the download button, the full plasmid map is exportable as HTML-embeddable SVG elements for inclusion in iGEM wikis.
Parts Section
Parts come with a number of potential customizations. Length can be input as number of BPs, or ending basepair location (can be changed with the settings button). The color and opacity are selectable using the color-selection tool, and the size, direction, and linkable-URL can all be input in the top portion. Existing parts can be edited or deleted entirely.
Design Section
The plasmid’s name, size, width, font, color, font-sizing, tick-count, tick-spacing, etc. can all be customized with the tabs of the plasmid component.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," biological systems from standard and exchangeable parts obtained from cells. Generally, there are several common difficulties for the iGEM teams which would be hard to solve sometimes due to the knowledge-gap without a well-studied biological mechanism. Some of the examples are listed as follows:
1. Hard to define standardised biological parts.  Absolute measures, standardised characterisation, have to be deployed in order to reduce the associated complexity of parts comparison.
2. Not available for predictable design procedures resulting in tedious trials and errors. The teams have to optimise the systems at all costs.
3. Hard to avoid unexpected cell-cell interactions. Biological machineries need to be insulated from the natural cell machineries as much as possible.
4. Hard to avoid variability and lift the stability of the system at the same time.
We hope to have a brief investigation on the difficulties that iGEM teams would usually encountered to see if our Tristable Switch would be able to eradicate the problems. Making use of the advantages of that the Tristable Switch proceeds, for example, higher specificity, ultra stability and being toolkit-like, hopefully, iGEM teams could further improve their projects or be provided with alternatives. Difficulties that came across during biosensing are brought into focus owing to its popularity among iGEM teams.

USTC-Softeware and USTC are like sisters and brothers for we both are USTCers, for we recruited and brainstorm together and for we went through all the processes beside the other. We frequently meet and exchange our advice on each other's project.
This year USTC-Software build a software to find the center of a circular interference pattern (available online, https://fringe.herokuapp.com/#userconsent# ). And they tested their softeware using Spring. After testing, their arithmetic turned out pretty quick, but they also found some disadvantages. By finding the closest two points on two interference lines and lining up them, the center is on the line. But if there only part of the interference line, the result comes out wrong. So the accuracy strongly depend on the lines you chose.

For bees, once removed from the colony the bees (contaminated with mites) are then placed in hard-walled tubes in the field and sealed before being transported from the hive to the University. The bees remain in these sealed tubes for the duration of all testing. Bees are fed sugar water laced with E. coli containing our Oxalic acid producing part. The Bees will then be visually inspected for mite infections. Mites are obligate parasites of Bees and all colonies have some level of mite infection. Removed mites due within 24 hrs of removal from a Bee host.
It should be noted that the Nuclease (BBa_K1792004) and Dextranase (BBa_K1792002) protein origin come from level 2 organisms (Canadian rating) but the proteins themselves when isolated are nonpathogenic.  The Petal Death Protein (BBa_K1792000) is produced in small quantities in E. coli so there is no risk of acid burns while working with the construct."
