Also there was no difference between the  different concentrations of TMRM, so next time we can use the lowest one (10  nM) or perhaps even lower.
Conclusions:
Using fluorescent microscopy with TMRM is a  semi-quantitative method for the assessment of mitochondrial membrane  potential. It could be that even if UCP1 was correctly expressed, it didn’t  lower the membrane potential enough for us to see. Next time we could use  spectrometry to more quantitatively assess the function of UCP1. Additionally,  many times fatty acids are used for the activation of UCP1. We didn’t use fatty  acids this time, and it might be the reason for the inactivation of UCP1.

Operon mer
Over the ages, exposure to toxic elements enabled microorganisms to develop highly complex and efficient systems to overcome poisonous environmental conditions. As an example of those systems, there is an operon (Mer operon), which function is to transform, by enzymatic reduction, mercury Hg2+ into Hg0, its volatile form. Operon Mer has been found in a wide range of bacteria that differ on number of genes involved. Those are usually located on plasmids and chromosomes and normally components of transposons and integrons. Mer operons can have different structure and are constituted by coding sequence of functional protein for regulation (MerR), transport (MerT, MerP and/or MerC, MerF) and reduction (MerA).
Transport: MerT and MerP transporter proteins
Transport of Hg in bacteria involves a complex system based in chemical interactions  by cysteine residues. First, in periplasmic space Hg2+ is binded to a pair of cysteine residues on MerP protein. Then, it is transferred to another pair of cysteine residues on MerT, a cytoplasmic membrane protein. Finally, it is transferred to a cysteine pair at the active site of MerA (mercuric reductase), as represented below:
Regulation: MerR
MerR protein is responsible by regulation of mer proteins expressions. MerR binds to a region called MerO (operator) which is located upstream merT gene. MerO is between -10 and -35 region to RNA polymerase recognition site for the merPT promoter, which are structural genes. MerR itself has its own promoter (PmerR) that reads differently from merPT promoter.
Under Hg2+ influence, MerR binds to it, causing allosteric change in the protein, moving it from the operator region and allowing RNA polymerase access to transcriptional start site and start proteins transcription, regulating the bidirectional promoter depending on presence or absence of Hg, because MerR gene negatively regulates its own synthesis.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,", so we can’t simply split the d[AHL] into many parts and give one to each node. Instead, we rely on the FEM algorithm to solve the spatial distribution problem for us by assigning to the bacterial geometries a constant production coefficient of 1, then hijack it by multiplying the resulting node increment coefficients by the d[AHL] produced by the bacteria.
Much is assumed or reverse-engineered in order to arrive at this coupling mechanism. To verify that the model is still on track, we run test simulations with a single bacterium and a small surrounding space. The results should be similar to (but not exactly the same with) the non-diffusive model. Indeed, there is close agreement ( figure 11 ).
Figure 11:
A: The spatial equilibrium model for 1 bacterium in a 2.12E-4 nL volume.
B: Same conditions, but simulated with the diffusive model. A diffusive barrier simulates the cell wall. Good agreement with the equilibrium model.
C: Diffusive model without the cell wall. Again, quite similar to the case with the wall, but much simpler to scale up. This bacterial model is used in the larger geometries.
Implementing Growth
Growth requires adding new bacteria to the geometry, but the finite element method doesn’t accommodate such changes. Consequently, the solution has to be stopped and restarted every time a new bacterium is added. This would be computationally prohibitive.
Instead, the complete growth curve is precalculated and then quantized adaptively to levels corresponding to adding many rings of bacteria at the same time, possibly adding millions of new bacteria at each growth step ( figure 12 ). The final number of bacteria generally depends on the nutrients provided by the growth medium and, for an agar plate with few added nutrients, is expected to be around $10^{8.9}$ bacteria [ 2 ]. To further mimic the way bacterial colonies grow, once there are enough bacteria the older cells in the center die.
Bacterial growth constantly dilutes the cytoplasm - a process which heavily affects QS ( figure 3 ). Here, the growth model is implemented in large discrete steps. In each step, the ratio of existing to new bacteria is calculated and a dilution performed on the existing ones, in order to keep the quantity of every chemical species constant during the growth step, apart from the DNA, which cancels its dilution with replication. This discrete dilution event creates minor artifacts on the simulations that manifest as discontinuities on the graphs.

Caltech,2010,Team:Caltech#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,": the dual-wavelength system can be used to easily select any group of cells in a 3D volume, without disturbing the media. Cells can be directed to lyse when activated, as in our case, or can be given any other transcription-based command, perhaps for protein production or regulatory network response.
For example, we plan on also adding three PHA (polyhydroxyaldehyde) synthase genes, which will allow our cells to create PHA plastic polymers from soybean oil (specifically: Acetyltransferase phaA (<partinfo>BBa_K156012</partinfo>), Reductase phaB1 (<partinfo>BBa_K156013</partinfo>), PHA synthase phaC1 (<partinfo>BBa_K156014</partinfo>)). To prepare the cells for printing, we will inoculate large liquid cultures and grow them to a high cell density, before transferring them to a medium optimal for the production of plastic polymers, which will activate plastic synthesis. We can then centrifuge the cells to isolate them from their medium and use them for printing.
The function of the lysis pathway is to release our crosslinking material (i.e. plastic oligomers), exposing it to the extracellular environment. Prior to lysis, the cells will be resuspended in an optically-inactive medium containing our crosslinking reagent, like AIBN, for example. Thus, lysis will release plastic monomers and expose them to AIBN, beginning the crosslinking reaction, possibly with UV initiation.
Simple representation of how pinpoint light activation could be achieved for 3D printing purposes.
Our reaction will be carried out in a 3D reaction volume containing our optically-inactive media and highly-concentrated cells grown overnight to (over-)express our desired product. We will then select a given plane of cells with our infrared plane array, and select the desired shape of cells within that layer using our red light from the third axis (a simple mask will be used to specify the shape). In this way, we can proceed through the entire volume layer-by-layer to create an arbitrary 3D object. Because of our positive feedback loop, we hope to minimize the amount of light activation per layer, which will minimize diffractive activation and the total amount of time required.
After light activation and lysis, we simply wait for the crosslinking reaction to complete, and then rinse the media from the plastic, isolating the desired 3D product.

Results:
Analysis: Sample 26 looks very close to the right lengths, so we will prepare some of the 1200 BP length PCR products for sequencing.
Miniprep of follow-up colony PCR
Date: 27/7
Methods: ON, Miniprep
Protocol: MP1.1
Experiment done by: LC
Notes: Samples L4, L5, L6, L9, L10, L14, L21 and L26 (L for ligation from the follow-up colony PCR) miniprepped and NinaB samples from the 4 frozen cultures of it.
Results:
All ligations were around the same length, just under 2000 BP. Even though the correct length should have been about 1000 BP longer, this is not surprising since uncut plasmids often show 1000 BP less in length. NinaB was also too short and there was a second band showing higher up in the gel (weird!). The concentrations averaged around 80ng/ul for the samples.
Analysis:  We decided to do a new miniprep where we start with a higher concentrated overnight culture, which we will achieve through boosting the ON before doing the miniprep.

Project Introduction
As the field of Synthetic Biology is on the rise, iGEM is growing up very fast and the number of parts in the parts registry is increasing with the addition of more complex parts each day. After facing some difficulty while running our algorithms on the parts registry, the need for standardization of parts entry was apparent.
 
By following the basics of professional software development approaches, we are aiming to overcome the issues that can be observed while building extensive and complex databases. Entity Relationship Model (ER) diagrams has been applied in order to design an extensible database. We are currently developing Software Requirements Specification (SRS) to define the requirements for each part in the registry and building blocks of the software such as algorithm, user interface, web server etc. Software Design Description (SDD) approach will be helping us while developing the final software and design art elements of the software that will deliver the database requirements . Our Quality Plan (QP) will point out the risks of the designed software and help us with the risk management.These professional software development approaches are helping us to communicate with a common language between the Software oriented and Biology oriented members in the team. We are using graph theoretic modeling to visualize the relations between iGEM Parts and to standardize the represantation of the parts as much as possible by graph theoretical methods. It will help us when we try to find input output relations between the parts. Furthermore, our program will be able to provide alternative pathways to construct the most reliable Biobrick devices with respect to given inputs and expected outputs as a Biobrick Guide.

Collaborations
During the course of our participation in the 2018 iGEM Competition, we started communicating with many other teams, from our country and also from all around the world. Through talking and exchanging ideas we managed to help each other improve our projects. But also, those collaborations made us realise that the iGEM Competition offers more than just the experience of competing. It offers us the chance to connect with people who see the same subject, synthetic biology, in a different perspective than ours. We hope our collaborations benefited others as much as they did us and that in upcoming years Greek teams will be able to participate in more European and global collaborations.

iGEM Bulgaria 2018 Team
Trying to engage in more meaningful collaborations with other iGEM Teams, our team took the initiative to host the members of a team in our city Athens, Greece for some days during the summer months. We came in contact with a lot of teams, but we ultimately managed to host only the iGEM Bulgaria 2018 Team, which also works on a diagnostics project, similar to ours.
Before hosting iGEM Bulgaria in Athens, we had a series of Skype sessions, in which we discussed and exchanged opinions on our projects. In one of these sessions, we broached the subject of reporter proteins, such as Horse Radish Peroxidase (HRP) and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and we examined their advantages and drawbacks. Their feedback was significant in helping us settling down to our current reporter protein.
During the team’s visit in Athens at July 23-26, we both presented our work and had an in-depth discussion on our projects, focusing on what difficulties we have had or we might have in the future and how we could have a meaningful collaboration that could promote both our projects. At that specific time, we were in the process of designing the assembly of our parts. Slavil, the iGEM Bulgaria’s team instructor, provided us with insight on the matter, by giving us helpful tips on primer design and different assembly methods. We also discussed about possible opportunities of comparing our work and validating each"

GluColi: a future alternative to toxic glues?
Glue has become a material of everyday life but we have to know that common glues contain Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). These substances are air pollutants and toxic. (19) (20) (21) For example, cyanoacrylate commonly sold under trade names like super glue can cause various toxic issues depending on their precise composition, (22) .
According to Yves Brun, Indiana University biologist, concerning Caulobacter crescentus’s glue: ”This natural, non-toxic glue [...], has the strongest adhesion force of any known natural material. Unlike commercial super glues, which are often toxic, it sticks well under water, even salt water, and, thus, has a wide range of potential applications ”, (13) .
Indeed, succeeding in the production of our GluColi could offer a wide range of useful applications. That could cover fields ranging from medical purposes to ship repairing and automotive or aeronautic industry.
Bone reconstructive surgery has lead to a large demand for bone graft, (26) , (27) . Consequently, synthetic bone graft substitutes have been developped with mixed success and surgical acceptance. Bone engineering has still lots of challenges to cope with. Surgical adhesives are part of this field of research but toxic issues are sometimes reported. Looking for new adhesives is today of great interest (28) . In that, GluColi may play an interesting role.
GluColi and a free-antibiotics alternative
There is no Ethic Comity at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Medecine. However the governing body of the ULB supported us in the achievment of our project.
In this work, we intended to be as far as possible aware of some ethical issues, in particular the use of antibiotics and the toxicity of the current adhesives. Antibiotics are used to select all types of plasmidic vectors in bacteria which is a significant concern in industrial cultures producing recombinant proteins or DNA. As plasmid-free cells grow faster than plasmid-carrying cells, the yield and the"

In addition, the presence of mobilization functions enables conjugative transfer of pUC18R6KT and its derivatives to a wide range of recipient bacteria (Figure 2,B).
Figure 2. Structure of the pUC18Sfi (left) and pUC18R6K-T (right) plasmids.
In order to construct the pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Gm delivery plasmid, the miniTn7BB-Gm transposon was cleaved from the commercial plasmid pMA (Mr. Gene) with SfiI and ligated to SfiI-digested pUC18Sfi. This strategy removes all multi-cloning restriction sites from pUC18Sfi, except for the flanking SfiI, thus guaranteeing that the unique sites in the transposon are not duplicated. The remove of the multi-cloning restriction sites was verify by analytic digestions. In order to construct the pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Gm delivery plasmid, the pUC18R6KT backbone was reverse PCR-amplified with primers bearing SfiI sites using as template the pTNS2 plasmid ( Choi et al., 2005 ) and the PCR product was digested with SfiI and ligated to SfiI-cleaved miniTn7BB-Gm. Again, this strategy removes all polylinker restriction sites, leaving the unique sites in the transposon as such. In both cases, the orientation of the miniTn7BB-Gm insertion was determined by digestion.

This implies that our promoter construct is approximately 23 times more sensitive to the chemical than the threshold of the cytotoxicological limit defined in literature. From our curve fit, we also found that Vmax value occurs at a copper sulfate concentration of 5 uM. As defined by the EPA, the relevant dose is 6.25 uM. Because our Vmax is very close to the EPA defined value, it implies that our promoter operates within the range defined by the EPA to be of interest.
The data that is displayed on the wiki is data that was found twelve hours after induction in the cell line, CHO-DG44.
We also conducted an analysis of our data for our MT2 construct. However, we found that the error was too high, and therefore we determined that it wasn’t sensitive enough at this time, and further experiments are required.
Our transgenic (MT1) mammalian cells proved to be much more sensitive to copper sulfate than the defined EPA range of concern. This indicates that the metallothionein 1 gene is being expressed in the cell when exposed to these concentrations of copper sulfate. This gene is typically activated as part of heavy metal induced stress pathways and has been implicated as a chelator of heavy metals in yeast. This suggests it is possible that similar stress pathways are stimulated in human cells at similar concentrations-- concentrations approximately 400 times lower than the EPA cytotoxicological level. Further experiments are required to examine this finding, and investigate what it means for human health.

iGEM Collaboration
This year we worked closely with the Vanderbilt iGEM team and the University of Maryland College Park iGEM team .
The Vanderbilt team asked us to help them with their Policy and Practices section. Their project concerning ways to minimize random mutation ""hot spots"" in DNA raised some important questions about the integrity of DNA and a limitation ""ceiling"" for any such device that helps counter evolution. In return, they offered to cater their kill switch project to make it suitable for our BioBrick. For further steps, we could add their time dependent kill switch as a backup to our concentration dependent kill switch, SacB (BBa_322921), in the event that our negative-selection system does not work as well as planned.
We also attended the iGEM meetup hosted by the University of Maryland College Park. We had a a fun day discussing our projects with the other teams in attendance and also enjoyed listening to talks by the guest speakers. The meetup was a good way to collaborate with other University teams as well as with researchers and government officials already in the field of synthetic biology.

NTU-Singapore,2018,Team:NTU-Singapore#IHP_-_-_TEXT.html," treatment, fearing for the variation in the results and the consequences that come after.
In general, the discussions in Singapore are capable of reaching the consensus that at the very least, we should treat it just like traditional medical methods, where the technology itself is morally neutral, but its morality depends on how people use it. Majority of the voices agree that only applications in disease treatment should be allowed but not for enhancement purposes, to prevent the unregulated use of gene editing and they call for all stakeholders, including scientists, politicians, and the public to bear the responsibility of regulating gene editing together. 
For example,  Singapore has Bioethics Advisory Committee made up of a group of specialists, professors, and doctors in the medical field to review relevant laws and rules associated with gene editing. Where necessary, it engages public and reviews all the ethical, legal and social implications arising from gene editing and suggests to the government bodies what are the best actions to be taken. This exemplifies how different stakeholders shall cooperate and the recent call for legalizing mitochondrial replacement therapy is a realistic example.  A summary of all arguments can be found here.
 Our Takeaway
There is a myriad of views towards gene editing, especially for germline editing, with some arguing that it is a social leveler while some others arguing the opposite.  The most discussed issues regarding gene editing are the social ones. People are worried about the social change that will be caused by gene editing technology.
Most Singaporeans hold an attitude of cautious acceptance towards gene editing. They look forward to its power, meanwhile take caution on its potential negative effect. Their assurance is partly for the fact that Singapore has relevant authorities to keep research and application in gene editing under careful observation.
 Our Actions
The overall attitude towards gene editing in Singapore is a receptive one, so we are assured that our research will be supported by the public and will hold a good opportunity to be applied in Singapore’s society. However, we still see many issues being raised, like affordability and safety. We should measure and rank their relative importance. Hence, from the pilot testing of our survey in National Junior College, we decided to expand this survey further.
Our Investigation: A Trinational Survey
 Motivation
With a properly designed survey, we hope to draw a rigorous conclusion from the analysis of survey data. More specifically, we want to understand the following:
•   To better understand the awareness level, concerns and preferences about gene editing of the general public. 
•   To put the public opinion of Singapore in the context of our region, by comparing with other countries.
•   To correlate people’s attitude towards"

The next step was to transfer the three cultures into a centrifuge and allow them to spin for 10 minutes, at a speed of 8,000 rpm and at a temperature of 4 degrees celsius. Because balance is required in a centrifuge (i.e. even numbers), we only used two of the tubes.
Hanny preparing pre-culture sample
Once spun, the supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in calcium chloride, which had been placed in a fridge since the solution was made. The concentration of the calcium chloride was 0.1M and the volume was 40ml.
The cells emersed in the calcium chloride were then held in ice for 40 minutes.
Once 40 minutes was complete, the cells were once again centrifuged at a speed of 8,000 rpm and at the temperature of 4 degrees celsius. After being spun, the supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 1ml calcium chloride again. This solution was again pre-chilled in the fridge, was again 0.1M but only 1ml was applied this time round.
50% glycerol was then applied to the mixture. Because the concentration of the glycerol to cell mixture was supposed to be 10%, we applied 0.ml to 0.9ml of cell mixture.
The resulting mixture was then placed into 50 microfuge tubes (each with a capacity of 100 microlitres) with these tubes being placed into a flask of liquid nitrogen. This process shock-freezes the E.coli cells.
After being given a few minutes to confirm freezing of the cells, the tubes were immediately scooped out of the flask and transferred immediately into a -80 degrees celsius freezer for storage.

Introduction
In our project, we eliminate algal bloom by designing E. coli to secrete proteins that can lyse the   cyanobacteria. To make our project feasible in future applications, we have to find ways to enhance the killing   effect. As our model indicates, binding our E. coli to the cyanobacteria can help us achieve this goal. So we   searched for proteins that can bind to the targeted M. aeruginosa cells and we chose to work with microvirin   (MVN), a mannan binding lectin in Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806, since of its high specificity to the   cyanobacteria and its availability to the E. coli. Microvirin is a protein consisting of 108 amino acid   residues and it has one mannan binding site which can bind to the LPS of the M. aeruginosa cells. [1] In our project, MVN was displayed on the surface of E. coli cells using a kind of truncated INP   (INPNC). By this way, we could bind our E. coli to M. aeruginosa and thus help us increase the overall   killing effect.
However, cyanobacteria are usually floating in the surface water due to its gas vesicles and colony formation in   the field. So we also equipped our cells with gas vesicles to deal with the problem that E. coli cells mostly   sink to the bottom when put into water. This will increase the opportunity for an E. coli cell to approach a   cyanobacteria cell and enhance the killing effect too.
Design
To make our genetically engineered E. coli bind to Microcystis aeruginosa, we used a kind of   truncated Ice Nucleation Protein (INPNC) to display microvirin (MVN) on the surface of our E"

Need to do further research on related works besides Tinkercell that help with simple visuals. Can we make a tool that can be used by citizen scientists as well as undergraduates?  It’s an interesting thing to keep in mind

Suma mentioned that a really useful software for designing primers was ApE.  I will spend the next few days fiddling with ApE to see how it handles restriction sites, and also organization.  Can we design something along the lines of ApE, but for a tangible user interface?
Review protocol with Traci.  We saw that each lab member presented their results and data to Traci individually, but there wasn’t a lot of group interaction involved.  What if the electronic lab notebook had a conference sharing/ powerpoint presentation-typed feature that allow the entire lab to exchange data?  That would be pretty cool!      Wet lab observations at MIT.  We interviewed iGEM members there about how the system works:  how do they do background research on parts, how do people interact in the lab, what is the physical set up of the lab, and what they would want improved in their lab. The MIT team has a little more emphasis on presentation and research of background information before the division of labor even starts; can we design the tool to cater to their need for a strong database to get background research from?

Introduction
Receptor
BRET
Methylation
DeTaXion is a bacterial-based sensor for the detection of pharmaceutical contaminants in surface water. In its final form, DeTaXion will consist of a series of bacteria that can detect a wide variety of compounds. This will be achieved by engineering the chemotaxis pathway of Escherichia coli to emit a visible light signal in response to different pharmaceutical compounds. The project consists of three main aims:  Aim 1: Explore the possibility of using the ligand binding domains from different transmembrane receptors.  Aim 2: Development of a Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) readout for the activity of the chemotaxis pathway.  Aim 3: Adjusting the dynamic range of the chemotaxis system to enable detection of a broad range of contaminant concentrations.  Below we describe the results in each of these aims, including a description of the successful use of our submitted parts BBa_K2736101 and BBa_K2736105 .
Explore the possibility of using the ligand binding domains from different transmembrane receptors.
Approach
In its final form DeTaXion will use customized receptors that can detect different compounds. These receptors will be designed from a variety of existing transmembrane receptors (from the chemotaxis and other pathways), and further engineered with the help of prediction software such as Haddock, to provide the best possible binding affinity between receptor and ligand.
To provide a proof of concept within the scope of this project, we tested the possibility of swapping ligand binding domains.
Figure 1: Schematic representation of the Tar receptor, CusS receptor, and our Hybrid receptor. Both Tar and CusR receptors contain a HAMP domain, involved in signal transduction to a kinase control domain. Based on the homology between the HAMP domains, we designed a hybrid receptor based on the extracellular domain of the Tar receptor and intracellular domains of the CusS receptor.
Results
We created a hybrid receptor consisting of the intracellular domains of the bacterial copper sensing protein CusS, fused to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the Tar receptor (Figure 1). The Tar receptor is one of the main receptors of the chemotaxis pathway, and senses Aspartate (Bi et al., 2013). CusS is part of a two-component signaling pathway and senses copper and silver ions. In the presence of copper, CusS phosphorylates the response regulator CusR, which in"

So, our work is reasonable and legal. We will also explain which databases BioMaster refers to. In addition, BioMaster provides links only to the literature, which can be opened directly on the relevant websites and do not constitute infringement.
Q7: Does BioMaster need to be responsible for the user's actions?
A7: BioMaster is free to use, which means that there is no interest dispute with the user. Users should adhere to the principle of voluntariness when using. So even bad result comes due to the software, we are not responsible for that.
Safety with Bio-Chess
The PC version of the Bio-Chess has the same rules as the physical version. Users need to download the software to use it. We uploaded the game to the network platform. The game has passed the security check so users can be assured to use it.
Q1: Where can it be used? Will it cause environmental pollution?
A1: Users only have to download it to their own computer to play the game. Bio-Chess can only be run on a computer so it will not cause environmental pollution.
Q2: Who will use the PC version of Bio-Chess?
A2: Our target players are anyone interested in synthetic biology. Teachers and parents can use it to inspire children's interest in synthetic biology.
Q3: Will it harm the privacy of users?
A3: The game doesn’t require login so it doesn’t collect users’ personal information. It causes no harm to users’ privacy.

Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"One of the main strengths of synthetic biology, compared to other scientific disciplines is the strong community it is build upon. Yet this community is nothing without active participation and interaction. We therefore see it as a very important responsibility of all iGEM-teams to constantly improve and newly apply parts submitted to the registry. As we were working with functional nucleotides, we soon took notice of BBa_K1330000, better known as Spinach2.1 from DTU Denmark iGEM team 2014. This modified version of Spinach2 was made compatible with the RFC 10 standard without change of functionality.
Envisionning the introduction of the power of aptamers and aptazymes to the iGEM community, we improved part BBa_K1330000 by making it depending on and thereby capable of sensing ATP - we call it BBa_K1614019. We show a possible application of this improved part in the optimization of in vitro transcription conditions and furthermore enhance the readout and the activity by software engineering. Besides, one could imagine sensing other small molecules in a standardized way.
BBa_K1614016 - Malachite Green aptamer
Establishing a read out system that would give the information that the DNA was fully transcribed into RNA was provided by the Malachite Green Aptamer. Therefore we provide a new biobrick which contains a hammerhead ribozyme fused to the Malachite Green Aptamer (BBa_K1614016). This aptamer can bind malachite green dye which lead to a fluorescence at 652 nm if excited at 630 nm. This part was used for the detection of fully extended RNA during in vitro transcription in presence of malachite green dye. The ligand dependent aptamer folds correctly during the transcription thereby emitting light that was measured in a 384 well plate format. Experiments have shown that the Malachite Green Aptamer can be used as a universal read out system by adding a Hammerhead Ribozyme that cleaves at the 3’ end of the RNA of Interest. This setup allows the cleavage of an RNA of Interest (ROI) from the Hammerhead Ribozyme-Malachite Green Aptamer.
Experiments with the Substrate of the RNA cleaving DNAzyme have shown that the Hammerhead Ribozyme-Malachite Green Aptamer cleaves from the substrate. Hence, the substrate and the Hammerhead Ribozyme-Malachite Green Aptamer could be purified on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."

He started with the history of iGEM and its  recent development. Then, Mingjun Zhang introduceed the primary responsibillities of members who want to participate in the competition. After that, some main contributions that iGEM has made to the development of synthetic biology were also introduced, including the construction of RSBP and some novel ideas raised from the competition. In addition, some achievements that the previous teams made were also included in this part.
At last, this speech was concluded with the introduction of our own project. Since the time was limited, we just introduced the basic ideas and the important progresses of our project. We also illustrated some of our results from experiments, human practice and wiki.
The talk was a big success, since the audience showed great interests in synthetic biology and the treatment of solid tumors. It also promoted the public awareness of iGEM among universities in Northeast region of China.

5.HUST-Cheering Meeting
We always wanted to have a chance to communicate with iGEMers from other teams. During July 7th. – July 9th. , we attended a HUST-Cheering meeting in Wuhan. We were glad to have an opportunity to change our thinking about iGEM with other brilliant iGEMers in China.
The HUST-China team gave an excellent presentation. Their project focused on a new type of biological filter. They designed two ingenious plasmids that can work in prokaryote and eukaryon. This excellent team is also the sponsor of the meeting. They also held many other meetings to introduce the ideas of iGEM.
NCTU-iGEM team talked about a new protein they produced. They named it Pantide and it could be used as an alternative option as an insecticide by decreasing the efficacy of ion channels in lepidopterous larvae. Their presentation was really flawless, and they also talked about two biobricks they made.
NJU-iGEM team mainly introduced a plasmid that could produce hydrogen in prokaryote. The team members were very experienced researchers and we consulted a lot from them.
We also presented our project and many iGEMers gave us advices. They think our project is really interesting, and our modeling is really good. They gave us some advices on improving our experiment, and we are very grateful about that.

4. Market and Competition
Market. Our first products are planned to target the market of pre-clinical, cell-based drug development in the pharmaceutical industry. A market analysis of MarketsandMarkets showed a global market of cell-based assays of $10.8 billion in 2015 and forecasted a growth to $18.3 billion for 2020. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was calculated to be 11.16% between 2015 and 2020. The market was segmented into consumables, instruments, services and software. Our product is part of the segment consumables, which was estimated as $4.5 billion in 2015. This segment is considered the total market for our product (Appendix 9).
Fig. 3: The market is divided into three segments since our primary market consists of tissue products. The market volume is 100 m. $ today and will be growing within the next 5 years.
In this total market, we focus on the segment of 3D cell structures. According to a market analysis of BBC Research, the market for 3D cell culture was valued at $586 million in 2014 and is forecasted to grow to $2.2 billion until 2019, showing a 5-year CAGR of 30.1%. The segment of cells and tissues will grow from around $100 million in 2014 to around $300 million in 2019 (Appendix 9). Although, for the time being, the market of consumables within cell-based assays should be considered the total market, it might be important to monitor the market of 3D cell culture as well because in the future our technology could be used for other applications in this field.
During the interviews with different companies, we were also seeking a potential first customer. The Head of in-vitro pharmacology and toxicology at company B was highly interested in our product. In case of a successful proof-of-principle of our technology, a further presentation was requested. The interviews led to the conclusion that, in contrast to basic research, the pharmaceutical industry is willing to pay much money for cell-based assays as long as they provide them with valid information about the tested drug candidates and save them money in the long run by reducing the number of animal models or even clinical studies. Adoption barriers might be tough in establishing acceptance of the product. It might be necessary to perform studies that show the successful distinction between failing and approved candidates that all seemed promising during 2D cell culture tests.

ATP Measurements with WashU_StLouis iGEM
Over the past few years iGEM teams from WashU in St Louis have been investigating methods to transfer the nitrogen fixing ability of cyanobacteria Synechocystis into E. coli. This year they are looking at increase electron donor and ATP production with the idea to improve nitrogenase activity. To increase ATP production they wanted to introduce phosphoenolpyruvate kinase (PCK) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) genes to E.coli. From us they wanted some sensitive supplementary analysis of ATP synthesis by their PCK and PGK constructs.
WashU sent us two plasmids to us for test using an ATP-Luciferase Assay with our FLUOROstar Optima luminometer.
We transformed these plasmids to obtain E.coli that contained eith pBAD-PCK or pBAD-PGK and then followed this protocol:
> E.coli were grown o/n. Subcultured 1/10, grown for 2hr before arabinose (at 25mM, 200uM, 1.6uM) was added for 5hr. This was repeated in triplicate.
>Centrifuge cultures, resuspend in 100ul PBS. Add 900uL 0.1M Tris pH7.5, 2mM EDTA. Boil for 5minutes, centrifuge to remove cell debris. Freeze samples.
Luciferase reactions were set up as follows:
>Reaction buffer: 50ul Luciferase, 50ul 600uM luciferin, 50ul sample (containing known [ATP] or 50ul PCK/PGK sample)

FQCRICMRNFSzif268 F2 Backbone/Helix F1/TGEKPlinker
The Persikov data shows weak predictive power for OPEN amino acid sequences. Our conclusion is that Persikov's program is not well-suited for incorporation into our helix generator. Testing Persikov's helices in his program yeilded mostly accurate results (approximately 24/25 matched known binding information). This is an important test because it proved that we are using the program correctly and that the program is in fact working properly. However, testing the OPEN sequences in Persikov's program resulted in numerous false negative values which informed our decision not to use Persikov's program to check our own hellix-generating program.
Phone Call with Dan
How conservative/risky should we be in terms of using other backbones?
Conservative
Possible Pros:
More likely to get something that will work
Depending on how ""smart"" our probabilities are (from our ZF generation algorithm), we could cover a lot of novel space without straying too far from zif268
Worst Case:Something we can show for iGEM (we covered the same ground OPEN did, and found many of the same ZFs, but with a targeted approach, a ""smarter"" method-- not throwing random things at it; Chip is not ours, but the program is ""smarter"")
Possible Cons:
Might end up covering the same ground as OPEN, but doing a ""worse"" job than they did
Less likely to discover new/groundbreaking things (i.e., TNN triplets)
Less Conservative
Have 3-6 target sequences (we're currently going for 8)
More backbones from non-zif268 than zif268
Pros:
We could get luck and find something no one has ever seen before (TNN, ANN). If we throw enough things at it, we're more likely to get luck.
Cons:
Risk: Many of these backbones (from entire ZF world)may NOT bind DNA (i.e., may bind proteins)
Risk: May not find anything that"
BIT-China,2017,Team:BIT-China#Project#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," artificial sweeteners is becoming more mature. Meanwhile ,as a food additive, artificial sweeteners are also more widely used in the field of food production. But the potential harm of artificial sweeteners to humans is still a controversial issue.
Therefore, it is imperative to detect the ideal sweetener to tackle the problems we mentioned above as well as satisfy our gustation.
THEN WHAT?
We hope to design a bio-system via synthetic biology methods which can measure the sweetness of various sugars and identify them by corresponding signal expression in microbe.
First and foremost, we found the mechanism why people can feel sweetness: the human sweet G protein-coupled receptor T1R2-T1R3.
It’s a pair of extracellular proteins with homodimer, which has six structural domains.
Different sweet substances combine with different regions of T1R2-T1R3, then triggering intracellular G protein-coupled pathway and leading to downstream signal expression.
After complex nerve transduction, a ""sweet"" feeling was led at last.
At the same time, we chose Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a kind of yeast as our host strain with the function of glycosylation.
In the design, the yeast original G protein-coupled receptor Ste2, which is related to yeast mating, will be replaced by the T1R2-T1R3.
Then, to amplify our signal, some side effects genes will be knocked out by homologous recombination technology.
After building a completed system, we will take some kinds of sugar to judge their sweetness according to the strength signal.
Fig.1 The design of Sugar Hunter
BUT HOW?
Our project is divided into three subsystems:
Receptor Expression system: Using OE-PCR, and other methods to achieve the synthesis of T1R2-T1R3 G protein-coupled receptors T1R2-T1R3.  
Confirming the expression and position(if on the cell membrane) of T1R2/T1R3 in our engineered yeast by immunofluorescence.
Pathway Optimization system:  Using trp, his, and ura as screening marker fragments with homologous arms to knock out ste2, sst2, and far1 genes by homologous recombination in yeast.
* ste2, sst2 gene can inhibit the signal transduction of Gpa1 protein.
*far1 gene can cause interference signal for sweet yeast normal physiological function after transformation.

Here's the result:
Here are the two opinions after the events :
Student A :
This time, the member of Mingdao iGEM 2017 hold a activity - drink sampling, which done the survey and the endorsement at the same time. I think the activity is great because the main goal of iGEM is to satisfied people's requirements after finding it, and the objective of genetic engineering is to make people's life more convenient. By the way, the drink taste better with sugar in most people's opinion.
Student B :
Although I’m not one of the members of the IGEM team, I still learn a lot from the course concerning this project. During the preparation, I saw some previous souvenir, which makes me wonder what kind of surprise they will bring us this time. First, they asked us to drink some beverages. Some were normal and some were sugar-free. This really confused me. Then, they asked us which one we preferred. I thought that they were doing some research to study the dietary habit of Mingdao students. Though didn’t participate in the game they play later on, I could surely feel the hard work they put into carrying out this project. You guys really did a good job. I sincerely hope that this activity can benefit your experiment. But, I suggest that next time the activity could be more simplified, or you can try walking instead of standing at a particular place!

After lunch, the PhD student Hanna Sigeman (from RSG-Sweden) held a lecture about bioinformatics.
“All of our team members that have attended the workshop were very positive about it. The topic was well chosen; group dynamics, team-building and feedback are important aspects to discuss during that phase of a project. The speaker was a charismatic person who could convincingly get his message across. The group exercise to practice giving feedback stood out, it was a good way to avoid misunderstandings and discuss eventual emerging problems. We have repeated the same group exercise a few months later and found it to be very good for our group dynamic again. It was also good to open people up and get a better idea of what we could expect from each other.

The participating teams competed for two prizes. One being the Judges Awards where the judges together choose one winning team. Second being the iGEMers Choice Award where each participant vote for the team they liked the most. Due to personal connections with the judges and other natural reasons, our team abstained from competing for the awards.

Tentative schedule: First night cocktail party, dinner. Conference at iHotel. We pretty much just pay for food.  First day box lunch, possible dinner. Sunday, offer breakfast, people leave. Estimating 100 people attending.  Maybe poster session highlighting IGB work, vendor show (vendors pay to participate, location source of funding for iGEM!).
Maybe the union as an option, visitors can walk around campus. Hampton out by Beckman.
We were given 500 dollars to come up with cooperate brochure. Who we are, description of research, donation possibilities.
We may need new space if our current space gets taken. Possible use of training lab. If we go with training lab, we’ll have to find equipment list.  Ie: pipette sets, power supply, thermocycler, tabletop centrifuge, hot plate, glassware, gel boxes. Maybe borrow stuff from senior design lab from bioengineering.
Put together list of supplies that we need donated. We can ask around to see what we can get donated.
Lab training sessions early may or late june with prof. Rao. Courtney may be able to do some lab training in a couple weeks as well.
Advisor Availability this summer: Daycare on campus closes for 2 weeks in summer, so Courtney won’t be here then. Prof. Rao: june will be on and off Prof. Jin: Second and third week of june out of town. Prof. Manaster has to look stuff up, she’ll get back to us. prof. Rao wants some of our smelly e. coli.  Credit Hours possibility—possibly getting fall credit for summer work so tuition isn’t an issue.  Probably 4 hours of credit.

We solidified the synthetic mosquito repellent      idea. We spent the week conducting a literature      review to determine what research has been      conducted on the rhamnolipids and bacteria      strains. We pinpointed a few subtopics that we      could pursue such as freeze drying and skin      grafting. We divided the research among ourselves      and put together a powerpoint containing a summary      of our ideas to present to our faculty      advisors. After the meeting, we made a      comprehensive project timeline schedule and made      experimental plans for the following week.

Molecular Cloning
We started molecular cloning with a PCR amplification of      the RhlAB operon from the P. aeruginosa P14 genome      extract. For the screening assay, we used a superfolded      GFP.  With our faculty members, we discussed whether we      should clone using EcoRI restriction enzyme cuts or Gibson      assembly. Initially, our PCR was unsuccessful because the      primers we designed had too few base pairs annealing to      the sequence. After ordering the correct primers, we used      Gibson assembly to insert the gene into the backbone,      which was successful. Additionally, we transformed      plasmids without the RhlAB insert into P. putida      KT2440. Then, we picked colonies with different GFP      intensities to obtain a library of different constitutive      promoters as well.

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#pumi_-_-_TEXT.html," of 5. After 5 hours 15% ABTS are oxidized only through CuCl2. Nevertheless this result does not have an impact on the reactivity of the BPUL laccase at pH 5, which is still the optimal pH. Therefore it has the same pH optimum as TVEL0 .
Figure 12: BPUL laccase activity measured in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer with a range of different pHs from pH 1 to pH 9, 0.1 mM ABTS to a final volume of 200 µL at 25°C over a time period of 5 hours. Before the measurements samples were incubated with CuCl2. The optimal pH for BPUL is pH 5 with the most ABTSox.
Figure 13: Negative control for pH activity Tests using 0.04 mM CuCl2 H2O instead of Laccase to determine the potential of ABTS getting oxidized through CuCl2.
In regard to our project an optimal pH of 5 is a helpful result. Since waste water in waste water treatment plants has a average pH of 6.9 it has to be kept in mind, that a adjustment of the pH is necessary.
BPUL CuCl2 concentration
Another test of BPUL was done to survey the best CuCl2 concentration for the activity of the purified BPUL laccase. 0.03  mg mL-1 of protein were incubated with different CuCl2 concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.7 mM CuCl2. Activity tests were performed with the incubated samples, 0.1 mM ABTS and 100 mM sodium actetate buffer (pH 5) to a final volume of 200 µL. The reactivity was measured at 420 nm, 25°C and over a time period of 5 hours. As expected the saturation takes place after 3 hours (see Figure 14). The differences in the activity of BPUL laccases incubated in different CuCl2 differ minimal. The highest activity of BPUL laccase is observed after incubation with 0.6 mM CuCl2 (52% of added ABTS). With a higher concentration of 0.7 mM CuCl2 the activity seems to be reduced (only 48% ABTS got oxidized). This leads to the assumption that CuCl2 supports the BPUL laccase reactivity but concentrations exceeding this value of CuCl2 may have a negative impact on the ability of oxidizing ABTS. This fits the expectations as lacc"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," 12 Sphere radius dependency on IA channel width. Changes in IA channel width seem to cause     greatest impact to the output. By increasing it by 5µm, liposome radius grows by 2.86µm.
Fig. 13 Sphere diameter dependency on IA channel width. Simplified graph shows an explicit     tendency of liposome growth with increased width parameter. This implies that increasing or reducing the parameter     should affect our system in a highly predictable manner.
As we can see, channel width has a huge impact on the size of liposomes. Even by keeping flow rates of all         phases the same, droplet radius variations depend solely on channel dimensions. We have tested channels from 10         µm to 15 µm, but other widths should also comply with given results and the only limit on minimal channel         dimensions could be the quality of photolithography used in production of microfluidic devices.Using given             results we can now calculate the required width of the channel in order to produce liposomes of needed size             as well as synthesize them in whole range of 5-30 µm.
Conclusion
From the simulations we’ve gained much invaluable information about liposome size determination in silico,         which led us to saving some of our most expensive reagents, such as Purefrex IVTT system. Also, we         could conclude that the system worked just as expected and it matched real life experiments surprisingly well.         All of the studied parameters affected liposome size to some extent, IA channel-junction width being the most         sensitive and effective, flow rate ratio being easiest to control for fine adjustments, while dynamic viscosity         ratio tuning may be used in tandem with flow rate regulation.
Discussion
Although we can choose from a vast selection of different parameter values to achieve needed results, there are         consequences to every change since microfluidics’ experiments are so delicate. For this reason, parameters for         every experiment should be properly evaluated in order to evade failed attempts and wasted materials. For         example, proper junction between all three phases sometimes might be so sensitive, that even slight variations         can disrupt the flow. In this case, it might be wiser to avoid extreme flow rate changes and design devices         with a bit different channel dimensions at first. Moreover, liposome velocity increases with IA phase flow         rate, so by colliding with each other in post-junction, risk of them bursting also increases. This is also the         case with viscosity changes because it may sometimes be hard to regulate dynamic viscosity ratio without         disrupting osmotic pressure. To conclude, every experiment should begin with selection of the right"

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," pathogens remains considerably far from what is practically possible as there are still quite a few operational difficulties left to resolve before a straight line can be drawn from de-skilling to the prevalence of acts of bioterrorism. However, vigilance remains of importance in response to do-it-yourself synthetic biology movements and how-to protocols as misuse by non-state actors, who can now have greater access, cannot be excluded as a problem (Kelle 2012; Tucker 2011). Such non-state actors certainly became more prominent in the aftermath of the Cold War since biosecurity issues were now facilitated by weakening international borders. Many new actors from various geographical levels of organisation emerged during this time in response to this development, which in turn undermined the authority of governments in favour of an emerging governance structure. Especially after the anthrax attacks of 2001, biosecurity gained prominence as an issue through such initiatives as a verification protocol to reinforce the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972. When this eventually failed, states now had to start negotiations with non-governmental stakeholders in order to set up agreements on dual-use practices. Nevertheless, the international politics related to dual-use governance remained predominantly based on a state-centred framework (Nightingale and McLeish 2009).
Another challenging property of synthetic biology for governance, then, relates to its interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary nature. In order for synthetic biology to devise solutions for a plethora of practical problems, the discipline needs a variety of various other disciplines to come together. Synthetic biology, in fact, forms a nexus for biology, chemistry, engineering, computational science, information technology and nanotechnology. It has therefore also been called a converging technology, creating ever greater possibilities for innovation within a highly heterogeous space of scientific knowledge production. Furthermore, besides the crossing of borders relating to political power and scientific disciplines, synthetic biology also urges initiatives to transcend the realms of nation states through an increasingly global and international diffusion of the technology. Progress in synthetic biology has to a greater extent been marked by the efforts of transnational programs which have created a dynamic enabling collaboration between scientists and non-scientists regardless of the geopolitical underpinnings (Pauwels 2011; Tucker 2012; Zhang 2013).

Overview
Models
Simulations
Assumptions
The protein cI is constitutively expressed by the strong promoter J23114.
Restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI
At higher temperatures, DpnII and TaqI will not undergo conformation changes or undergo denaturation. Therefore, they will work at optimal levels from 28°C to 42°C.
No saturation of enzyme restriction sites will occur. Restriction enzyme concentration will always be in access of the substrate.
Cell growth
Assume that cell growth prior killing by thermoinduction is not constrained by availability of resources. (This correlates to the classic assumptions for exponential phase)
Cell death
We assume that the rate of cell death is a function of restriction enzyme concentration at the time. Ie, the system has no memory.
More precisely, we assume that each cell has a constant probability of dying due to the action of the restriction enzymes in any unit of time.
It is this probability of dying that is modelled as is a function of the internal concentration of restriction enzymes only.
A hill function is often chosen because initially, there is very little killing with the increase of temperatures. Then, when threshold temperature is reached, killing is expected to be the dominating feature.
Predictions
If the temperatures are below threshold, little restriction enzymes are being produced; hence population of live cells will increase exponentially. (Cell growth is not constrained by resources such as food and space.)
If the temperatures are above threshold, the population growth of live cells will be constrained by the concentration of restriction enzyme.
Initially, cells will grow exponentially as the restriction enzymes take time to be produced. When enough restriction enzymes are being produced, cell death will begin, and an exponential decrease in cell population will be observed.
When we increase the temperature, we produce more restriction enzymes at a faster rate. Hence, at higher temperatures, the exponential decrease in live cell numbers will occur earlier. Furthermore, the maximum live cell population at a given temperature will also be lower with increasing temperatures, because a greater concentration of restriction enzyme means more cell death in the same amount of time.
If the lambda cI promoter is strong, there will be a higher rate of cell death than cell growth; we will see a decrease in live cell population. However, if lambda cI promoter is weak, there might not be enough killing, so we will only see a reduction in growth of cell population, ie: a"

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.

TU-Eindhoven,2013,Team:TU-Eindhoven#AnearobicTesting_-_-_TEXT.html," that each of the constructs was correctly implemented.  The ligated vectors were then transformed into BL21 bacteria as preparation for protein expression.
Protein Expression
For anaerobic protein expression a BioReactor, wherein anaerobic conditions can be reached by creating a flow of nitrogen through the culture, was used.  First the ligated vectors were transformed into BL21 bacteria by heat shocking the bacteria. To test the FNR promoter the pBR322-EGFP construct was used, since EGFP can be measured with ease. 4L of LB medium was prepared and autoclaved within the vessel. This was subsequently inoculated with the bacteria, which were then grown aerobically until the optical density was approximately 0.6. Upon reaching the optical density of 0.6 the air supply was turned off and the vessel was continually flooded with Nitrogen ensuring an anaerobic environment.  At several moments a sample was taken to follow the EGFP production curve. During the entire experiment the culture temperature was kept constant at 37 °C (equal to body temperature in which the bacteria should be able to function).
Upon analysis it was revealed that no EGFP had been produced. A possible explanation for this problem could be a mutation in the FNR coding gene within BL21 bacteria. This would mean that FNR production would not occur upon the bacteria entering an anaerobic environment. This was later confirmed by further researchNoFNRBL21Constanze Pinske et al, Metabolic Deficiences Revealed in the Biotechnologically Important Model Bacterium Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). PloS one 6.8, e22830 (2011).
Since protein expression in BL21 bacteria was not successful, the pBR322-EGFP vector was then transformed, by heat shocking, into XL-1 Blue bacteria and by electroporation into an MG1655 strain, of which the latter was kindly provided by the University of Groningen. The same procedure for the anaerobic protein expression as was executed for the BL21 was now performed for the XL1-Blue and the MG1655 strain. In and the gel analyses of the BugBustered samples from the anaerobic induced EGFP expression are shown.   After His-Tag purification of the samples, another 12% SDS gel analysis was performed. From the XL1-Blue samples the whole time sequence that was obtained from the Biofermentor was purified, since the unpurified gel clearly showed increasing intensity of some bands. There is a not so clear band at the height about 29"

Assembly of amilCP with and without His-tag
As part of our collaboration with the Biosensor project one of the response genes used in the kit was amilCP (BBa_K592009), which we decided to improve by adding a His-tag.  The results of the assembly of amilCP (BBa_K592009) with promoter and RBS (BBa_K608003) is shown in figure 13 by a digestion. The expected bands for a double digestion with EcoRI and PstI are 2029 bp for the backbone and 774 bp for the amilCP. For the single digests the bands should be 2803 bp which corresponds to the bands on the picture.

We miniprepped colonies 1 and 2 of the construct that hopefully is pC13AT in pAg13H, and linearized half of each with HindIII before transforming into protoplasts of C. heterosporus. We cultured pAh13EA as a vector in insert more of our constructs into for characterization in C. heterosporus, and planned out a timeline for the rest of our cloning into the two new vectors. We ran new PCRs of the inserts from pC13AT, pC13AU, pC13AV, pC13CC, and pC13CE, and they all appeared successful this time! We miniprepped the cultures of pAh13EA and digested that and pAg13H with EcoRI and HindIII, in attempt to get a cleaner digest. We transformed the redone ligations of pC13AU and pC13AV in pAg13H into E. coli. We submitted pC13DU, pC13DV and pC13DW for sequencing and then ran a Gibson assembly of pS13EB with pC13DU, pC13DV and pC13DW and transformed.
We continued transferring constructs into C. heterosoporus vectors, and transformed the first completed one into the fungus. We electroporated pC13P + pC13BA ligation into BL21-AI and then plated it on an LB agar plate with chloramphenicol.

We plated an overlay of 1% agar and 1000µg/mL geneticin onto C. heterosporus. Yesterday’s digest of pAh13EA resulted in strange bands due to not knowing the sequence, and we redigested the vector with KpnI and HindIII instead. We also repeated the EcoRI/HindIII digest for pAg13H, since it seemed to be incompletely digested. Then we digested the newest PCRs with each of those sets of restriction enzymes, and dephosphorylated the vectors. We ligated pC13AT, pC13AU, and pC13AV into both pAg13H and pAh13EA, as well as pC13CE into pAg13H, and pC13CC in pAh13EA.

Module:Pathway finder
Our Path finder combines metabolic network databases, cell signaling pathway databases and gene interaction databases, to find a path between components which is usually genes or their associated proteins.[1] A click on the 'PATHFINDER' button will lead a way from one node to another through components registered in the databases that you want to make further investigation.
We took trp operon in E.coli for example, as the operon concept is considered one of the landmark events. The operon is regulated so that when tryptophan is present in the environment, the genes for tryptophan synthesis are not expressed.
Choose trpR and trpE genes as start node and end node. Path Finder gives 4 paths as Fig.1.
Fig.1 - A list of paths found by the 'Pathway finder' represented on the webpage.
The first route is considered as best-matching path, as it reveals mediate interactions between two genes. TrpR, the repressor for the trp operon is produced upstream by the trpR gene, which is constitutively expressed at a low level. When tryptophan is present, these tryptophan repressor dimers bind to tryptophan, allowing the repressor to bind to the operator, and leads to the transcription of trpLEDCBA. You can choose either one or all of these routes, which will be presented on the Pano. The latter circumstance is shown as Fig.2.

Bring innovation and societal needs closer
Connecting human practices closely to our project was our main goal and because we were working with the CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we tried to know more about it and to learn how to use it in a responsible way.  Innovation often tries to answer a societal need. However, this societal need is not always reached for different reasons: because the innovation is not fit for the users, because it has deep negative impacts, because the project was not enough defined at the beginning ...etc. Sometimes the project even missed its goals, only because the desire to meet it was not followed by strong principles. Thus, in this project,bringing innovation and societal need closer animated us.
Our work to bring them closer was possible thanks to Responsible Research and Innovation principles. Responsible Research and Innovation is a nascent governance concept which aims to guide research towards societal goals. Those principles have been developed by the European Commission. Responsible Research and Innovation works as soft law: it is not meant to substitute to written law (hard law) but to complete it. Soft law like RRI has the advantage of quick adaptability, when written law is often late because it can't change as fast as science. Thus, we believe RRI is a good framework for the use of the CRIS"

INTRODUCTION
In the past iGEM competitions, human practice was always the vital and indispensable element.As a group of creators, we devoted ourselves to producing a practical and effective Bio machine.To achieve that tough goal, we need to not only spend a ton of time in the lab but also do something relative to the society which will be our target consumer and real beneficiary.Therefore, we took some actions .we designed the questionary and gave them out on the website and different communities to see whether people were interested in our project.To find out the existing questions among the sweeteners found already and to improve our project, we interview some relevant authoritative experts.Besides, market demand and trading policy are also significant for us to know about and that’s why we went and discussed with Sixin Wang, the chief engineer of SdicZhongluFruitJuiceCo., Ltd(the NO.1 company that focuses on producing concentrated apple juice) and some of the bosses in the COFCO (the one of the top 500 corporations and the most advanced food suppliers in China ) right after we finished our original plan.In the later period, we organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University to have a large scale conference to popularize iGEM and collected the critical advice so that we can be improved.On the final stage, we met the bosses of COFCO again and we were proudly encouraged by them and they believed that we were likely to be successful in the future market.
QUESTIONARY
During we were sending out the questionaries on the website and communities, we realized that different people prefer various flavors, but most of them still were the fans of sweetness which make people feel happy and warm. According to what we found,  there is an excellent opportunity  for us to research the sweet food.Prior to we design the specific plan, it is necessary for us to learn about the existing questions relevant to the sweeteners that have been observed already.
INTERVIEWING THE EXPERTS
After we interviewed the specialists who are famous in the food and sweeteners area, the current situation of sweeteners was getting clearer in our mind.Generally,"

Testing and Quantification of Promoter Activities
Overview
This is an additional part of our project, designed to testing and quantify promoter activities for having moderate expression level of target protein, or more detailedly saying, for knowing if TEF2 and TDH3 promoter work and for better control of induction of Gal1 promoter, the only inducible promoter used in our project. We employed GFPmut3b ( BBa_K294055 ), one of the most widely used fluorescence protein, as a reporter. After making a comparison between FCM and ELIASA, we chose the latter one for quantification of fluorescence since it was more convenient to manipulate and was accurate enough for comparing promoter activities. Considering that the fermentation process will span a period of time from several hours to several days, we did not have timed induction of Gal1 promoter included in quantification process.
Design and Result
With employing GFPmut3b ( BBa_K294055 ) as a reporter protein, we designed three similar devices only differing in promoters as shown below.
Promoter Testing
Plasmids carrying the above-mentioned devices were transformed into competent S.cerevisiae cells. Transformed cells were plated on 2% agar in media A (yeast nitrogen base, MET, LYS, HIS, URA), complemented with 2% glucose and cultured at 30℃ for 48h. The colonies were then inoculated in the liquid media A complemented with 2% glucose and were grown at 30℃ overnight. For those contained TEF2  or TDH3 promoter, culture was stopped and samples were taken out for testing. For those contained Gal1 promoter, glucose was removed from media with washing cells by PBS till they reached the exponential phase. Cells were then pelleted and diluted and cultured on liquid medium containing galactose concentration of 2% w/v overnight"

Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," chose the -35 region as our mutation region. We mainly used RFP to indicate the promoter strength in our wet experiment.
Results
1. Tried to use one-step mutation, but because of the secondary structure of promoters, we didn’t get positive results
2. Built a library of mutated PTet promoters and characterized the promoter activity through measuring the red fluorescence intensity
3. Selected 4 mutants and got the successful sequencing results
Experimental details [Expand]
1. One step mutation--plan A
At first, we used “Quickchange”, using the methylated plasmid as a template, which was extracted from E.coli, and we designed a pair of 25pb primers containing the desired mutation to amplify the DNA through PCR, and we got the demethylated plasmids. Finally, we treated the products with Dpn1, which was specific for methylated DNA and was used to digest the parental DNA template and selected for mutation-containing synthesized DNA. And we used the method of thermal stimulation to transform it into E.coli.
But we didn’t we get the positive clone of the plasmid. And we thought as a result of the characteristics of the promoter structure, viewing it from the secondary structure, there appears a cervical-loop structure. Also a mutation site just appears in the loop, which results in primers having a comparatively long homologous region. So the complementary pairing occurs between upstream and downstream primer, forming primer dimer, which lead PCR amplification to failure.
2. Digestion and ligation—plan B
To avoid forming the cervical-loop structure, we gave up the one-step mutation approach. Instead, we designed the mutation on the primers and planned to construct the testing circuit through the traditional digestion and ligation.
We designed random primers containing NNNNNN in -35 region.
Through PCR amplification, we purified the PCR product. We used DpnI to digest the template. Constructed the fragment on the vector pSB1C3, we transformed the ligation product into E.coli TOP10. After incubation at 37℃for 16h, we observed the formation of single clone.
Through colony PCR, we selected the clone on the plate and had successfully got the positive clones. To facilitate the characterization of promoter strength, we constructed circuits containing rfp. The whole length is 923bp, counting the region between VF and VR, the positive length should be over 1000. Results shown in Fig.1.

The MRSA bacteria can be killed by use of antibiotics, but an ordinary family should also take precautions. “Wash your hands, do not sneeze on people, and just be clever about bacteria and how it spreads” - quote Hans Jørn Kolmos.
What is the biggest cause to MRSA?
It is hard to isolate a single source that contributes to the development of MRSA, but we know it is a combination of the farming industry and antibiotic distribution.
The media has a tendency to  blame the pigs for MRSA. It is actually estimated that only 40% of all pigs are carriers.
What antibiotics are used to treat MRSA:CC398, MRSA:USA300 and VISA(Vancomycin-intermediate-S. Aureus)?
Tough question, but Vancomycin can treat both the MRSA:CC398 and MRSA:USA300.
Can you see any potential in our project?
It could be a part of a treatment, but it could also be nice to test the bacteriocins on gram-negative bacteria. Bacteriocins could also be used for oral treatment, eg. in the nose, were MRSA is normally found on carriers.
Interviewing plastic companies
14 plastic companies responded to our questions. Each company was asked the following:
Do you have any specific attitudes towards sustainability?
Would you want to work with plastic which have been produced by bacteria?
Do you know the plastic PHA, or poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB)?
If the price of biodegradable plastic was considerably lower than it is as its present), would you then as a company have any interest in this? (it cost 4 times as much to produce at the moment
Would you be able to incorporate such a product in your business?
Here we have listed some of the answers, which we received:
Agstrup Plast ApS:
“It would be a great advantage for us if we could offer production with a bio-material as well. This will give more options for our customers and a more environmental friendly image. However, it will still be the customer's’ decision and the choice will also depend on requirements such as sustainability.”
AMU SYD:
“Plastic produced from bacteria will be an option for us. We also see a great future in biodegradable plastic.”
Fast Plast A/S:
“There could be an issue with using plastic produced from bacteria, since we primarily are producing plastic for food.”
Bogense Plast A/S:

ETHZ_Basel,2010,Team:ETHZ Basel#Modeling#Movement_-_-_TEXT.html," . Therefore, we decided to assume a constant angular speed for the entire period between two directed movement phases. The angular speed was drawn from a tuned distribution, which was optimized to reflect the observed data as good as possible.
General Algorithm
Schematic overview of the algorithm used to model chemotaxis motion as influenced by the CheYp level in the cell.
We use a two state model to simulate bacterial motility, with the two states corresponding to directed movement and to tumbling. At each time step of the simulation, the cell either keeps or switches its state, according to the input received from the molecular model, which determine the values of the transition probabilities between states.
If the model is currently in the directed movement state, the cell mainly moves in its current direction with a speed of 14.2μm/s and changes direction only slightly (see [1] ).
If however the model is currently in the tumbling state, the cell is changing its direction rapidly while staying at the same point.
Coupling to the Chemotaxis Pathway
Bias The sigmoid dependency between CheYp concentration and probability of the cell being in the directed movement state
The quantity that links the CheYp concentration with the type of motion (tumbling vs. directed motion) is called the bias and it is formally defined as the fraction of time spent in the directed movement state with respect to the total time in motion. Our choice for bias formulation was a nonlinear Hill - type function of CheYp concentration, with [CheYp]wt being the wild-type CheYp concentration for which a steady - state invariant time ratio was obtained. Both the functional dependency and CheYp value are well documented in the literature [2] .
Since the mean tumbling length is assumed to be independent of the intracellular state, the mean run length has to be a function of the bias:
Transition Probabilities
At every time step of the simulation, the model decides probabilistically whether to switch or to keep its current movement state. Therefore, bacterial motility can be modeled as a two - state first - order Markov process, in which the future state is only dependent on the current state. Since we have Boolean values for both directed movement and tumbling, we can define the following four transition probabilities, separately controlled depending on whether the cell is currently in the directive movement or in the tumbling phase.
Therefore, the two central parameters of our model are the probabilities of keeping the current state also as future state: p1: the probability of the future state being directed movement, when the current state is directed movement and p2: the probability of"

This is my first year in iGEM and I am enjoying it. Everyone on the team is very welcoming and knowledgable, they are also very eager to help teach the concepts. I am excited to get more involved in iGEM and learn more as I go. Outside of iGEM I enjoy spending time with my friends and animals, I also enjoy exercising, and the occasional video game.

Quantitative Analysis with ImageJ Tutorial
Downloads
The following files are required for this tutorial:
MATLAB post processing script: post_processing.m .
ImageJ macro: Interlab.ijm .
Sample TIFF file: NTNU_Trondheim_Tutorial_Sample.tiff .
Preparing the data set files
The microscope software provides the data set in a LIF format. This file has about 1GB size. While ImageJ can read LIF format, it does not manage the memory very well, and cannot upload the images simultaneously. One method to circumvent this issue is to convert the LIF file into many TIFF files. Each TIFF file contains one fluorescence image and one bright field image. Download the bfconvert utility to convert the Leica LIF files into a set of TIFF files. The utility is available from http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.1.3/ .
Run in a terminal
./bfconvert 150818\ Interlab\ Hyd2.lif %n.tiff

iGEM in schools
An important part of iGEM is to get in touch with non-scientific people, to inform them about our ideas of the competition and synthetic biology in general. Therefor, we asked around and then had the chance to visit two grammar schools, in Brandenburg and in Saxony. We gave presentations about synthetic biology and biotechnology in general and also explained our projects and experiences in the lab. Incidentally, we talked about our studies in Potsdam and scientific work. We ended with a discussion about the pros and cons of genetic engineering, in which the whole group took part. Students as well as the teachers were interested in the topic and asked a lot of questions. We also used the chance to give away the postcards that were sent to us by iGEM Düsseldorf-Cologne .

Depending on weight, we will have a chart that says how much lactose is in that container. The people will be guided to portion a certain amount of the lactose into an ice-cube-like container and grow the yeast in there. Because there will be a specific amount of lactose in each section, and our promoters are sensitive to galactose, our yeast will stop producing progesterone after it consumes all of the lactose.
We have found multiple ways to insert our genes into Y.lipolytica and we made pros and cons lists for each method to decide which one would be the most effective and time-efficient. The methods are regular homologous recombination using homologous arms on our plasmid, EasyCloneYALI: CRISPR/Cas9‐based technique for engineering Y.lipolytica specifically, and Drag and Drop cloning.

We confirmed that using a constitutive promoter would be better than an inducible one, at least initially, because it will use up energy to keep producing progesterone after the growth media has been consumed. Our website has gone through several prototype designs, but it seems like we may be getting close to a final design we would like to use to represent our work. One fun feature that is a work in progress is an interactive map that will, when moused over, provide information about different countries and our outreach there. We have also been working on finalizing our logo, which will include the name of our project: PoPPY. PoPPY stands for Portable Progesterone Production in Yeast, an accurate description of the goal of our project. A low this week for the team was realizing that most of the survey responses received from one of the groups we reached out to about contraceptive accessibility were unreliable, since many answers between supposedly different women were the exact same, word for word. However, we hope that this was a problem specific to the group, and not the norm. We have some more legitimate groups who are willing to send us photos of the women filling out the surveys, and we hope to see good results. A high for the team this week was finally understanding how Cre-Lox recombination, a method that we will use in one of our experiments to integrate our gene cassette into the yeast genome, works. We now expect to run three parallel experiments to get to"

Each reaction will be discussed in detail, and we will derive rate equations (Ault 1974,Pi 2004) .
Reaction 1:As hydrogen ions are numerous are negligible in the reaction, we will ignore it. By the law of mass action, the rate of this reaction is: $$r_1=k_1[GP_{xr}][H_2O_2]_{in}$$
Reaction 2: By the law of mass action, the rate of this reaction is: $$r_2=k_2[GP_{xo}][GSH]$$
Reaction 3: By the law of mass action, the rate of this reaction is: $$r_3=k_3[GS-GP_x][GSH]$$
Summary of Reaction 1-3:In these reactions, hydrogen peroxide is reduced to water. GSH is consumed to recycle the enzyme GPx back into reduced form, to neutralize more hydrogen peroxide.
Reaction 4: ByMichaelis-Menten kinetics and the Ping-Pong mechanism, the rate of this reaction, with rate constant k4, and Michaelis-Menten constant Km4, is: $$r_4=k_4\frac{["

In this part, there were a reverse Lox site and a reverse PO promoter between Ptet and the RBS, and a forward Lox site after luxpR.
PO promoter was from phage (see following) and FinOP is a conjugation inhibition system consisting of an antisense RNA (finP) and a small protein (finO) (reference: https://2009.igem.org/Team:UNICAMP-Brazil ).
 
LuxpR was the quorum sensing promoter, once the cell density of G+/G- reached the threshold, the luxpR promoter would express cre invertase (with an LAA-ssrA degradation tag). Cre invertase would recognize two oppositely-oriented Lox sites, and invert the DNA sequence between them. Due to the inverted orientation of the recombination gene with respect to luxpR promoter, further expression of the recombinase protein ceases and DNA orientation is fixed. (PS: PO promoter didn’t express in G+/G- cells)
Inverted DNA sequence:
The invertion stopped the expression of FinOP, so that the inhibition of conjugation was eliminated and male E.coli could construct sex pili, which meant that it differentiated into gametes.
 
 
Construct :
In the part,reverse Lox site and reverse PO promoter were constructed by PCR using PO promoter BBa_I746361 as template. The biobrick suffix was added onto the 5’ end of the upstream primer, Xbal site and reverse Lox site were added onto the 5’ end of the downstream primer. Therefore, the PCR product was “reverse Lox site + reverse PO promoter”.
Then, we assembled Ptet with “reverse Lox site + reverse PO promoter”
The LAA-ssrA degradation tag of cre-ssrA was chosed among the four ssrA tags with different degeradation rate. The LAA was the fast one. (reference: [2] )
To construct RBS-cre-ssrA, BBa_I718008 was used as a template and the LAA tag was added onto the downstream primer.
 
Test
To test the function of above controlled DNA Invertase device, we also intended to constructed the following construct:
RFP reporter was put between the two oppositely-oriented promoters, and GFP-ssrA was put after cre-ssrA, Plac was used to replace luxpR.
Therefore, we can simply"

Collaboration
We had the pleasure of collaborating with the Boston University Wetlab iGEM team!
One of the many factors we considered when choosing proteins for our system included its modularity, and having the ability to add additional domains. After much consideration, we decided on using Ms2 to build upon current mechanisms to control alternative splicing (i.e. SSOs). With a gRNA sequence attached to the Ms2 protein, not only is Ms2 able to bind to the target RNA molecule, but the presence of the Ms2 can stabilize and prevent the degradation of the RNA sequence before it gets the chance to bind. Furthermore, there lies the possibility of adding more domains to the Ms2 protein to increase the chances that the RNA won't get degraded and will bind to the target.
In theory, the robustness and modularity of Ms2 should be helpful in transporting RNA. To test this idea, we sought a collaboration with the BU Wetlab iGEM team whose project also relies on RNA.
In order to activate the toe hold switches, and therefore activate gene expression, there must be a ""Trigger RNA"" present to bind the hair pin loop on the ""Switch RNA"". This allows the ribosome binding sight to be accessible to the ribosome for translation. This process only works if the trigger RNA is present and not degraded.
This is where M2s comes in. We had Ms2 attached to the trigger sequence, where the trigger sequence in this case was an SSO. We hope that the presence of MS2 would decrease the likelihood of RNA degradation, while also allowing the possibility of adding additional domains to make RNA degradation even less likely.
The ""target"" depicted in the Ms2 picture pertains to the elements on the Switch RNA used to extend the RNA molecule, and make the RBS accessible.
How did our team benefit from this collaboration?
The BU Wetlab team is using a cell-free system to test their toe hold switches. Since robustness was one of the criteria for choosing a sufficient ribosome binding protein (RBP) to"

Expert Consultation
    At the University of Waterloo, we are fortunate to have strong connections with many of the professors who are always supportive of our work. This year, we reached out to professors in the Department of Biology who work in a variety of fields to gather different perspectives on our project. In addition, we were fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to speak to a representative from a biotech company in Canada. The sections below summarize our conversations throughout the year.
Dr. Christine Dupont
    Dr. Dupont is a continuing lecturer at the University of Waterloo whose teaching focuses on microbiology and molecular biology. In our interview, we asked Dr. Dupont about her ideas for how to design the co-culture system. She proposed that we could use two dialysis bags in a medium such that the two populations can exchange material but will not affect each other’s growth. Although this idea was not use in our actual experiments, it helped inspire the final experiments (see Design Page). Finally, Dr.Dupont also provided us with an industrial application: using co-cultures to develop ratios of yogurt flavours. This application is further discussed in the Project Application below.
Dr. Valerie Ward
    Dr. Ward is an assistant professor at the University of Waterloo whose work includes the development of new bioprocesses for applications in biosource engineering and biorefining. The use of stable co-cultures has many promising applications in bioprocessing, so we met with Dr. Ward in the early stages of our project development. In our meeting, we discussed various applications of controlled co-cultures and brainstormed how we could design our project to cater to these applications. One of the main takeaways from the interview was the idea of creating a co-culture of E.coli and S.cerevisiae. Using these two organisms in bioprocessing has many advantages over using just one or the other, as they each provide different environments that are more suitable for different parts of the pathway.
Industry Representative

Neither E. coli engineered with MEP pathway enzymes only nor the one engineered ispA only showed any farnesol by the Gas chromatography/Mass (Figs. 11D and E). Farnesol is generated through hydrolysis of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) by the endogenous phosphatases. Increase in farnesol should be associated with an increased intracellular FPP level. FPP is, in turn, converted from geranyl diphosphate (GPP), whose precursors are IPP and DMAPP. IPP and DMPP are end products of MEP pathway that exists in
E. coli. Conversion to FPP from IPP or DMPP requires ispA (or m-ispA). Following this context, we speculate that E. coli could produce farnesol better than the counterpart control cells under the up-regulated cellular conditions of an increased intracellular MEP pathway enzymes by metabolic engineering in combination with the special enzyme that converts IPP or DMAPP into FPP.
Gas Chromatography/Mass(GC/MS)
Fig. 11: The farnesol standard solution (Ref) was used as a control. The peak corresponding to the farnesol standard at 8.5 min is indicated by an arrow. The peak at 8.5 min was applied to GC/MS. The farnesol standard solution (Ref) was used as a control. E. coli JM109( BBa_K1653025 ) were compared with respect to farnesol formation using GC-MS. The fagment patarn is Similar with Ref.
Efficient export of geraniol from E. coli to the media
We introduce an activator gene of AcrAB-TolC efflux pump (marA) to release the geraniol from the cells and increase the content in the media that shows increase these flavors in the ""Flavolator"". In our study, we confirmed that overexpressing of marA gives host E. coli high resistance against geraniol and reduce intracellular geraniol concentration.
