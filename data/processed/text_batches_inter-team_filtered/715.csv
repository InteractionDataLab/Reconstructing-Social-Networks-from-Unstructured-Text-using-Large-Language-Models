Place the tubes in the PCR Machine and use the following settings:
Initial denaturation - 98°C for 30 sec..
Separation of strands - 98°C for 10 sec.
Annealing of primers – Tm of primer (approx. 55-62°C) for 30 sec.
Elongation – 72°C for 30 sec/kb.
Repeat step 1-4 for 30 cycles.
Final extension - 72°C for 10 min.
Hold - 4°C for infinite time.
Note: If smearing appears on gel, it could be due to too many cycles – optimize between 25-35 cycles. If no correct bands appear on gel, try doing a temperature gradient PCR to optimixe the annealing temperature of the primers.
Once the PCR tubes are taken out of the PCR Machine, turn it off and leave the lid closed until it has reached room temperature, then open it and leave the lid open for the next user.

The boys and girls were always stimulated to speculate, trace hypotheses and show arguments (for or against), but direct answers were not easily given to them. After each group final presentation, students were argued and evaluated by other students (their pairs!), which decided if the group efforts deserved or not a reward (two yummy chocolates…). All of them received candies and applauses, but the real sweetness was on their discovering about how science is made and where biological engineering may take us.
The Brickard Game
BRICKARD is the card game we created as a tool to help explaining synthetic biology in a fun way. The game consists in a deck composed by 40 cards, which are divided into the main biobrick categories:
Five types of Brickards
promoter cards,
RBS cards,
coding region cards,
terminator cards,
chassis cards.
Each group of players receive a mission alongside the deck, with an explanatory text regarding a problem they have to solve combining the cards, just like we do (with the real stuff!) in our lab. The missions were priority based on projects from past iGEM participations. They were:
Mission 1: Fuel from sunlight
Mission 2: Microplastic
Mission 3: Spoiled meat
Mission 4: Malaria and artemisin
Mission 5: Celiac disease
Mission 6: Space exploration
Mission 7: Our own project!
To simulate difficulties faced on real experiments, there were incompatibilities among some cards. Promoter and terminator cards were classified according to an arbitrary force from 1 to 5 (represented by the number of full colored stars on cards), suggesting that different sequences present different affinities and, so, act on transcription on different ways. Thus, weak promoters could just be used with strong terminators, and constitutive promoters must join weak terminators following precise indications on each card description. Some options of chassis may apply, but the real possibility of their use should be justified; besides, each chassis must be combined with a specific RBS (bacteria with bacteria RBS, yeast with yeast RBS and so on), pointing the existence of molecular patterns that turn a sequence specific to a certain organism. Finally, the coding region cards included a sort of key genes to solve the problems proposed; the gene originally used by the related iGEM team was our expectation for each mission, but we were open to new creative, wellsupported devices students might present.

However, many solutions immediately were proposed that counteracted the need for the biosensor-this included the fact that many people buy permanent water bottles that they wash and reuse; it would be more cost effective to campaign recycling efforts than to market a biosensor and it is cheaper to just recycle a plastic bottle and buy a new one than to buy a biosensor. Indeed in the report by the Environmental Audit Committee (potential stakeholders), they suggest increasing the number of water fountains in open spaces and improving recycling through a number of methods including Deposit Return Schemes (which incentivise consumers).
Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus
Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a predatory bacterium that preys on other (Gram-negative) bacterial species (Rendulic et al., 2004). Its enzymes and their mechanisms are being studied in order to better understand the bacterium for future use as a possible therapeutic agent or as a method to penetrate biofilms (Kadouri and O'Toole, 2005; Sockett and Lambert, 2004). Our team was interested in engineering the bacterium to use it (and its enzymes) as a ‘pathogen eating machine’in food processes-for example targeting Clostridium botulinum, which releases the botulinum toxin. On top of it being an interesting species to work on, we had a leading expert on the Bdellovibrio species at our university. However, the main bacterium we were targeting (Clostridium botulinum) is a Gram-positive bacterium so is not recognised by Bdellovibrio. Also, it would take many weeks to engineer Bdellovibrio for single gene mutations, which is difficult to transform using random transposon mutagenesis. This was a project that required many years which our team did not have!
mRNA interference of Streptococcus mutans
Streptococcus mutansis one of a number of bacteria involved in tooth decay and is the most prevalent. According to Public Health England, in the UK, ‘almost a quarter (24.7%) of 5 year olds have tooth decay’ of which 3 or 4 teeth are affected. Dental health problems also have a heavy financial burden on the NHS-it spends around £3.4 billion per year on dental care. What makes S. mutans particularly hard to deal wit his its ability to form biofilms regulated by glucosyltransferases which catalyse sucrose to adhesive glucan."

This indicates that the higher the protein concentration in the solution, the better the activity is preserved; and thus, the better the protection of the enzyme. Such a trend was also observed in our model and by Boothby et. al. 2017 , hence substantiating the validity of our results.
Furthermore, the preserved enzymatic activity at the highest concentration studied (1 mg/mL), did not differ significantly among the four proteins. It is however notable that, unlike the rest of the proteins, CAHS 106094 did not show a significant preservation of activity at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL and yielded a much lower preservation at a concentration of 0.5 g/L in comparison to the other TDPs.
In view of the previous results, we adapted the LDH assay previously carried out to test the protective capability of CAHS 94205 and SAHS 33020 for 18 days and thus evaluate their use for long-term storage at room temperature. Samples similar to those of the previous procedure were prepared and stored dried at room temperature for different amounts of time before their resuspension and measurement.

As shown in Figure 29, LDH maintains its activity when stored dried with the cytosolic and secretory TDPs, while its activity was not preserved when freeze-dried or dried in the absence of TDPs. Furthermore, it can be seen in Figure 29 that for TDP concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL only SAHS 33020 could maintain a significant amount of activity after a day.
Although both proteins successfully maintained LDH activity at higher TDP concentrations, the activity decrease over time was substantially lower for a concentration of 1 mg/mL compared to that observed for 0.5 mg/mL. Moreover, for a concentration of 1 mg/mL, it can be concluded that the variations in activity over time for SAHS 33020 are lower than those for CAHS 94205, suggesting that the mechanism by which the SAHS proteins confer their protection is more effective for long periods of time. Our assays reveal that LDH in combination with SAHS 33020 is still active after being"

Chromoproteins
In many systems for the control of cloning and transformation reporter protein are used, but                         what happens when two different reporter proteins are cloned in the same vector and expressed                         at the same time? That is what here wanted to answer by fusioning two reporter cassettes. In                         this case a constitutive blue chromoprotein and a repressible Red Fluorescent Protein were                         cloned in a pSB1C3 plasmid to observe how both reporters interact and if our hypothesis of                         obtaining a purple color would be true.                         To prove this idea, after the ligation of the both parts with the plasmid, previously                         mentioned, this complex needs to be transformed into an appropriate Escherichia coli strain and                         then, the coloration of the colonies has to be measured.
Another experiment was the repression of Red Fluorescent Protein to prove the expression of                         Blue Chromoprotein one. This kind of system allows the design of complex multiple reporter                         proteins to simplify the selection process and developed stronger controls during the creation                         of synthetic biology projects.

Gas Burner: We used gas burners and heated the air around the workspace to raise the temperature, thereby reducing contamination. Although the gas burner is a common combustion apparatus we are all familiar with, it can cause a massive disaster if used improperly. We made all-out efforts to keep all the flammable items away from the flame and not to pass behind a person who is using a gas burner.

We consider the cell to have four chromosomes with one promoter on each (less chromosomes would let the system work, but with more noise).
The initial values in the model are given by:
insert table with numbers and constants
Notice that all values are integers as the gillespie algorithm works with discrete numbers of molecules. The values were chosen based on a stable equilibrium found by letting the model run a simulation of the inherent system over 450 minutes, with different starting values.
The implemented total production rates shown in the model might seem too high as they range from 1-350 molecules pr. min, while the rates in the inherit system is effectively around 80-100 for relB and 2-5 for relE. The possibility of placing the system on high-copy plasmids, however, makes the high total production values reasonable, as the individual relE promoter only need a production of 0.01-2 (assuming a few hundred copies).
Considering the inherent toxin-antoxin system activating under starvation, we see that the the magnitude of relE copies around 50-80 molecules pr. cell. This makes it reasonable to believe that the cell enters dormancy when a few tens of free relE copies.
Running the model
The model is using the gillespie algorithm to give a stochastic view of the system and is run on matlab. The code uses an implementation by matlab user Nezar (https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34707-gillespie-stochastic-simulation-algorithm).
For the dormancy runs we input deterministic initial values, and then let the system run 30 min without activating the inserted toxin promoter. This results in a stochastic distribution of initial values mimicking variations between cells. Analysis show that 30 minutes is enough for the model to find a stable distribution, which is realistic considering the growth cycle of an e.coli.
For wakeup runs, we use the data generated at the end of a sleep run as initial value and remove the production of relE. We consider a cell to be woken up when the concentration of free relE decreases below 15 copies. This is perhaps a low value, but tests show marginal difference between 15 and 45 copies, where the low bound is chosen to"

The farmers least able to pay for fertilizer will be hit first. Those farmers and any who rely on food produced by them will start suffering. Farmers will start expanding into new lands, including those that were formerly reserved for wildlife or not used due to unsuitable characteristics such as lack of affordable irrigation. That push for land will result in other negative consequences, such as pressuring vulnerable and endangered species and depleting aquifers previously not economically available. Preventing these consequences is an ethical imperative.
Risks
Biocontainment: As with most iGEM projects, biocontainment is a serious risk. Our even more so since the primary use of our technology is directly in the environment we are attempting to protect. Our first line of defense would the build of the phosphorus reclamation module (PRM), the beads used to hold and suspend the bacteria need to be engineered and refined to reduce the risk of leaching (bacteria escaping). Filters would be installed on the input and output flows of the PRM. Both to prevent sediment build up in the filter housing and to prevent bacteria from being released through the output.
Our team has considered the practical and theoretical constraints of a kill switch capable of causing self-destruction if the integrity of the PRM becomes compromised. This killswitch would lower the likelihood that a viable cell could escape the PRM and propagate in the wild. While be believe in reducing the risk of release, cell or colonies do not appear to pose as huge a risk as the engineered system might.
Dual-Use Technology: In the most simple terms, our project takes a resource (Phosphorus in the form of orthophosphate) that is dispersed in the environment and collects it into a highly concentrated form. This allows it to be more useful, removes it from the environment, and increases the value of the concentrated product. However this can pose several obvious risks of abuse.
Calcium phosphate (commonly found in rock deposits), can be mixed with carbon and heated to produce White Phosphorus (also called yellow phosphorus or tetraphosphorus) which was used in smoke, tracer, illumination, and incendiary munitions. There has been debate on whether munitions of this type qualify as incendiary weapons, which are prohibited by Protocol III of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (part of the well known Geneva Convention). While smoke munitions, the most common use of phosphorus, are given an exception for use, the danger still remains that the collected phosphate may be a target for those"

Trinity College Dublin & University College London
This year, Cork iGEM collaborated with both the Trinity College Dublin and the University College London iGEM teams. The Basehunter system was put together in an anonymous way so that the participating teams could not see what reagents were present or absent in order to avoid biased results. Cork iGEM put together tubes containing mastermixes and labelled them using unbiased characters such as A,B and C that were then sent via post. The participating iGEM teams agreed to test the systems and give feedback regarding the protocol. We were unfortunately unable to obtain test results from the UCL team due to time constraints. They did however successfully receive the kit. Mariola Sebastián gave us feedback regarding out Basehunter System,""I really liked that the tubes were labeled with numbers and letters. I think its great because you don't need to know what each one contains in order to follow the protocol, which makes it more accessible, and the simple labeling makes them easier to find and work with.

The aim of this collaboration was to investigate if the Basehunter system could be both easily transported and explained with a protocol. A written protocol and a video protocol were prepared. The video protocol can be seen below and the written protocol can be seen here .
Trinity tested the system and these were the results obtained in the blind testing; Sent to the team were 6 tubes containing the HPV 55bp Detector. Tubes 1-3 were to be positive controls, while tubes 4-6 were to be negative. This was not disclosed to the experimenting team at TCD.
Feedback from the team was positive and they reported - “The Protocols were very clear indeed and easy to follow, and it helped greatly that there was an alternative to using the PCR machine when incubating the coloured tubes.”
These results proved that the detector could be posted to other labs and that the protocols were simply followed. In addition, results achieved were consistent with those obtained in our lab at UCC. See figures 1 and 2 for results reported by TCD.

Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
The project is centered around P. pastoris as an expression system. This species of yeast is regarded as non-pathogenic, ranked in biosafety level 1. The E. coli strains utilized in various laboratory protocols are also ranked as such, and thus the organisms being handled do not represent a direct hazard against researchers or the environment. Even so, the proper precautions are implemented, using standard aseptic practices in the laboratory and specific waste containers for disposed materials. Those organisms conferred with antibiotic resistance for selection of transformants are also stored separately and properly decontaminated by autoclaving. Researchers’ physical integrity is looked after by following standard protective guidelines in the laboratory, including the availability of proper equipment placement to avoid accidents and wearing protective gear at all times. All biological products and processes utilized in the project shouldn’t raise any biosafety concerns.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
The parts to be entered this year in the registry by our team pose no safety issues regarding their target gene products. Because of the antibiotic resistance used as a selection marker, proper precautions were implemented. The pUC57 and pPink-HC vectors used in E. coli include the ampicillin resistance gene, which is of standard use in molecular cloning methodologies. The pPICZ A used in E. coli and P. pastoris includes the Zeocin resistance gene, an antibiotic developed for its use in research.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
There is no local review board in Monterrey specifically devoted to ensuring a correct application of proper biosafety guidelines in laboratories. As a general consideration, the Regulation of the General Health Law on the Provision of Medical Investigation (Reglamento de la Ley General de Salud en Materia de Investigación para la Salud) includes precise technical criteria related to the application of standard procedures, as well as recommendations on ethical principles and safety norms for the handling of substances potentially harmful to humans. This set of norms also establishes certain principles for the regulation of genetically modified organisms, more specifically to those carried out in laboratory spaces.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made"

We received various thought-provoking designs using MagicBlock elements, such as water pollution alarm, synthetic music, and bacteria painting panel .et al, all originated from non-biologists.
During this practice, we received valuable suggestions to improve MagicBlock .
Very importantly, we have received professional insights from professors, which provide direction for follow-up work including human practice, hardware and software design, and modeling.

Modeling
We simplify the actual biology process into basic model that only remains input molecule, promotor, transcription gene, mRNA, goal protein and output molecule from both dynamic perspective and responding ability. In developed model, we consider different conditions including the population growth, diffusion of signal and decay of signal molecules in cells. which will have influence on our block. Finally, we completely construct the model of our block, which will instruct our experiment results and using of our system. Moreover, this model does some basic researches on population and new measurement methods.

Using the equation system as described above, the model may also be simulated in two dimensions. Once more a finite  volume approach has been taken in connection with an explicit Euler scheme. All parameters have been kept constant with the one  exception of the chemotactic sensitivity $K_c$. This has been increased to $K_c = 1.5 * 10^{-1} cm^2/h$ and therefore leads   to earlier pattern formation. Above four simulation videos with Gaussian initial conditions can be observed. A fifth video   shows a simulation using random initial data. The two last videos illustrate the effect of zero flux and periodic boundary   conditions.

Peking,2015,Team:Peking#Design#PC Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," the sensitivity of PC reporter using plasmid and PCR product as the target. (a) Bioluminescence intensity at different concentrations of plasmid as the target. (b) Bioluminescence intensity at different concentrations of crude PCR product as the target. Both showed that PC reporter was able to detect target DNA at a low concentration (0.1 nM).
However, we don’t know whether 0.1nM is the bottom limit of detection. We speculated that with multiple PC reporters recognizing more sites on one target, enhanced bioluminescence signal could be observed. In that way we could get a relatively high signal at a lower concentration of target DNA. The results confirmed our speculation (Figure 9).
Figure 9. Bioluminescence intensity with multiple PC reporters. One, three, and five PC reporters were, respectively, subjected to the measurement using PCR product of 0.01nM.
After validating the specificity and sensitivity of PC Reporter system. We were eager to apply it to detect the real MTB genome. Fortunately, we got the absolutely safe MTB genomic DNA from Prof. LIU Cuihua (Chinese Academy of Sciences).
First, we used the most popular commercial TB NAD toolkit (TB-LAMP) to amplify MTB genome and found out that there was a large yield of non-specific product after amplification (Figure 10a,b), which could be mistakenly considered as a positive result if using the conventional diagnosis method. However, our PC Reporter system can easily distinguish the true from the false (Figure 10c).
Figure 10. (a) Gel electrophoresis of amplification product of LAMP using MTB genome or control genome (E.coli). (b) Amount of amplified nucleic acid measured using the method provided in TB-LAMP toolkit. (c) Bioluminescence intensity generated by PC reporter, which is able to distinguish the true PCR product from the false.
Then we set out to test whether our PC reporter could be applied to the clinical cases where patients might be in an early stage of TB thus the copies of MTB in their pathological samples could not be that many. The key factor is to figure out the minimum copy numbers of MTB genome in crude sample that can be detected by PC reporter when combined with PCR. We performed a series of dilution on the MTB genome before PCR amplification and found that, when the PCR products are subjected to the measurement, our PC reporter can easily reach the detection limit of only 1 genome copy per tube, which is sensitive enough for real TB diagnosis (Figure 11"

RiboJ
In the past many teams have rigorously characterized parts both new and old, so what separates the Circuit Control Toolbox from being just another characterization project? The answer to that is multifold, but mainly consists of the fact that the Circuit Control Toolbox not only rigorously characterizes novel or useful tools to alter transfer functions, but also allows these tools to be generalizable to any circuit, not just to the specific circuit in which they were characterized.
A key problem of generalizing the results of characterizations is that the dynamics of gene expression are influenced by the protein coded for. For our toolbox to be able to to be used orthogonally at the end of an arbitrary genetic circuit, we must be able to use the characterization done in fluorescent proteins on any other protein. That is, we have to be able to insulate a circuit from its genetic context.
Fortunately, Lou et al. from the Voigt lab at MIT discovered a ribozyme which does just that. RiboJ is ribozyme derived from a hammerhead ribozyme, which self cleaves, removing the upstream region, most importantly the 5’ untranslated region (Figure 1).  When Lou et al. 2012 (“Ribozyme-based insulator parts buffer synthetic circuits from genetic context”) measured two different variants of GFP (sfGFP and cl-sfGFP fusion), they found that the relative expression for the induction curves was not always the same, likely due to upstream effects. However, when they added RiboJ before the coding region, the relative expression levels for the induction curves collapsed, indicating that the relative expression had been homogenized for a given promoter (Figure 2). This means that the gene expression dynamics are controlled only by the promoter, and not by the coded for protein, which means as long as the promoter is kept the same and RiboJ is added before all coding regions, our characterizations can be used for different proteins.
Figure 1: Structure of RiboJ, the loop in uppercase is derived from the sTRSV ribozyme, while the additional loop is in lowercase. The catalytic core of the active ribozyme is circled in red and the smaller loop serves to promote translation by exposing the RBS. Figure adapted from Lou et al.

The bacterial population dynamics arising from the synchronized lysis circuit can be conceptualized as a slow build-up of the signalling molecule (AHL) to a threshold level, followed by a lysis event that rapidly prunes the population 。 After lysis, a small number of remaining bacteria begin to produce AHL anew, allowing the ‘integrate and fire’ process to be repeated in a cyclical fashion. We  observe growth  with the fluorescent protein superfolder GFP (sfGFP).

All discussions were closely related to what we consider important to every team's work during iGEM and therefore relevant to each participating team. To further broaden the accessibility we decided to broadcast each session live, making it possible for anyone that is interested to follow the discussion and comment.
All three sessions can be found on our YouTube-page and the questions being addressed are from the correlating chapter in The Ethics Guide Book

It was great to share thoughts with each other to receive new insight and perspectives. We brought a lot of it back and integrated it with our own project, especially in The Ethics Guide Book from which the discussion questions were based.
REDDIT
We created an Ask Us Anything-thread on Reddit where anyone could ask questions concerning our project. The participation was high and it was a fun way of discussing various aspects of our work. The questions ranged from if we like saffron buns to more serious questions wondering about specific project details. It was exciting to see what parts of our project interested others and it was a practice to address the concerns and questions of the public. Some of this was also later integrated with our work on The Ethics Guide Book.

problem: How to make C3 plant operating in sunny and arid areas or how to reduce photorespiration
solution: Create a bacteria which penetrates plant cells, creates high concentration of HCO3− and packages it into vesicles, inactive Carbonic anhydrase is added to the vesicles, releases vesicles with chloroplast localisation signal, releases vesicles into the chloroplast, upon fusion CA is activated and changes HCO3− into carbon dioxide, which is then highly concentrated in a chloroplast and reduces rate of O2 binding to the Rubisco simply by increasing concentration of CO2.

Bacterial infection: Nod factors
Bacteria of Rhizobium spp. are capable of infecting a plant and forcing it to develop an extra organ - Nodule, where these bacteria then intracellularly (a bit like organelles) reside. They do this to develop a mutualistic relationship with plant. We could use this mechanism of infection and acceptance by using the entire ""Nod box"" a cluster of genes involved in signalling to the plant to allow entry through the specially deformed root (induced by the Nod factors) or by crack entry. Each of the two mechanisms involves plant release of the flavonoids in the first place to trigger the Nod factors in the first place.

Modeling Paratransgenesis
Introduction
One of the most important aspects when you think about a problem from the point of view of Synthetic Biology is to look at the biological problem in an “engineering” way.  You know the inputs, design (or re-design) the system you want and predict your output. But sometimes, what’s happening to your system is not intuitive, so you may need an non-intuitive way to predict your system. Mathematical modeling can make you learn about the system you are working on in a way you could never imagine.
What to Model (And Predictions you may want)
When you intend to model your system, you need to know what you want to understand and predict with it.
In paratransgenesis there is a huge sort of different aspects you may look at, as you’re working not only modificating an organism to do something you want, which is with complicated by itself, but also embedded in in natura conditions, what means you will find many factor that will influence your data. Therefore these are some of the “variables” you can discover in this problem:
In the molecular level we generally have protein and RNA as the protagonists of our models, since, in synthetic biology, we basically work with changes in the RNA or protein expression.
Considering the protein expression, you can quantify the expression over time, check if the protein is expressed in some conditions or not or the probability of the expression . And you can also manage some variables like protein degradation, the translation rate or probability of some post-trans"

Results
Sexual communication among moths is accomplished chemically by the release of an ""odor"" into the air. This ""odor"" consists of sexual pheromones.
Figure 1. Female moth releasing sex pheromones and male moth.
Pheromones are molecules that easily diffuse in the air. During the diffusion process, the random movement of gas molecules transport the chemical away from its source [1]. Diffusion processes are complex ones, and modeling them analytically and with accuracy is difficult. Even more when the geometry is not simple. For this reason, we decided to consider a simplified model in which pheromone chemicals obey to the heat diffusion equation. Then, the equation is solved using the Euler numeric approximation in order to obtain the spatial and temporal distribution of pheromone concentration.
Moths seem to respond to gradients of pheromone concentration to be attracted towards the source. Yet, there are other factors that lead moths to sexual pheromone sources, such as optomotor anemotaxis [2]. Moreover, increasing the pheromone concentration to unnaturally high levels may disrupt male orientation [3].
Using a modeling environment called Netlogo , we simulated the approximate moths behavior during the pheromone dispersion process. So, this will help us to predict moth response when they are also in presence of Sexy Plant.

British_Columbia,2014,Team:British Columbia#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,", modularization) onto the 'messy' biological systems fascinating. I feel that iGEM is a rare opportunity, especially for undergraduate students, to get to put together a project of their own design and presenting it internationally.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to better and refine my modelling skills and knowledge from participating in iGEM and if possible to get to touch a bit of wet lab as well.
What inspires you:
The possibility of alternate realities inspires me and in a way I see research as a means that could bridge us from our present state to one of these realities. It is an incredible privilege to be able to entertain our imagination through practical means of testing and experimentation and of those rare moments when we can reap results from it, there are many thanks to give.
Desired Impact on the World:
It would be an exciting realm to be in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Public Health and be able to contribute in that area.
Hobbies:
I enjoy reading the National Geographics, New York Times and every now and then, the Sanger Blog.

Major and Year:
Honors Microbiology and Immunology 4th Year
Why iGEM:
I first heard about iGEM when I was in high school and ever since I wanted to be part of it, for me this is a very exciting opportunity. I first joined the team last year and I enjoyed it so much I decided to return. I can’t wait to make some awesome bacteria! I moved to Canada two years ago from Germany. Now I am really enjoying Vancouver.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to play a bigger role in designing the constructs and systems for our project this year. In addition I hope to improve my public speaking skills and learn even more about the creative applications of microbes through this years Giant Jamboree!
What inspires you:
I love bacteria and all sorts of Microbes but aside from microbiology I am interested in marine biology. Through scuba diving, my favourite destination being Egypt, I fell in love with the beautiful underwater world.
Desired Impact on the World:
I love research and I want to pursue a career in science, what that will look like and where I will be is a mystery right now but I’m sure it will all work out.
Hobbies:
My favourite thing to do here is skiing in winter; I can’t wait for next season. On campus you can find me either in the lab, at the gallery, or at the pool napping. But if there is something you should know about me is that I love"

The feedback we got from some of the guys over there was to think about using metabolic wiring as a digilog signal as well as a digitial signal (so as to provide information on the metabolic load of the sender strain) and, again, to look at introducing elements of selection pressure to the IPD system. We decided to think about these suggestions but take them with a grain of salt from people who might be less familiar with iGEM than other advisers we have had.
Weekend 14th-15th
After a long sunny week where we were trapped inside for all of it, the weekend was mostly cloudy with occasional rain. Welcome to Scotland.
The team mostly relaxed over the weekend, but Philip and Yuma’s dedication recognises no weekend. Philip read some reviews on aromatics degradation, among other things, and Yuma looked some more into an idea brought up by advisors Chris French and Jon – sugar signalling. He and Philip decided it was promising but would require more research.
Week 4 (16th June – 22nd June)
Monday 16th
Today we got to do actual lab work for the first time. We might have done little more than plate out some bacterial cells to make them competent, but it felt very encouraging. We learned some of the practical stuff you never learn about in the course, like how to prepare agar plates, and who to ask for various pieces of equipment.
We met with Dr. Garry Blakely to discuss a mechanism for slowing growth in our proposed population control demonstration of metabolic wiring, and he suggested a ribosome bases approach, such as targeting rpsL. We also further discussed the sugar logic idea as a way of getting started, though it was agreed a better metabolic pathway should be sought out. The main problem we are having at the moment is that all goof pathways produce toxic chemicals that cause horrific nerve diseases or cancer – not ideal.
Presentation skills were also worked on – rather fun – and looked into multicellular IPD, and alternative aromatic pathways.
Tuesday 17th
In the lab we just plated the cells from yesterday onto LB media – apparently the streaking went well. Small victories are heroic victories this early on.
Today was pretty research-heavy, with more metabolic pathways being sought out with limited success. We have a database of possible molecules we can use but they’re all so toxic, presumably because they are membrane-diffusible which is what we need. The sugar logic system would provide an alternative but it is not without its own problems.
Some of the groundwork was laid for the modelling too – mainly skill learning today – and"

For a double digest:
1. To a pcr tube, add 10 ul of miniprepped plasmid or purified PCR product
2. Also add 6 ul H2O.
3. Add 2 ul of the appropriate buffer (look at NEB's Restriction Enzyme Activity chart )
4. Add 1ul of each enzyme.
5. Incubate at 37˚C for 1 hour.
6. Add CIP to the backbone digest. Incubate at 37˚C for 1 hour
7. PCR purify the reactions, unless you need to select out your part through gel extraction. Avoid these when possible, but if your insert is coming from a plasmid rather than a PCR, you need to select the insert you want and avoid having any of the leftover backbone in your ligation reaction. Also, you may need to do a triple digest to be able to size select for your insert. Use Geneious to find restriction sites.
Biobrick Assembly Ligation
1. In a PCR tube, add restriction digested and PCR purified insert to backbone in a 3-5:1 molar ratio, usually 1 ul backbone with 2 ul insert works.
2. Add 5.5 ul H20 (or other, so that the total volume of the ligation is 10 ul)

Characterisation
The Framework characterisation has been performed using a BMG-Labtech fluostar optima plate reader in order to monitor the absorbance (OD600 nm) and GFP fluorescence (excitation 485 nm, emission 510 nm).
The 3 cultures (IPTG detector, processor and sfGFP reporter) were grown separately in LB+ chloramphenicol on a shaker at 37C. After the overnight incubation the cultures were diluted to OD600 0.1 in order to achieve the syncronised growth to reach the late exponential phase. At OD600 between 0.5 and 0.7 the cultures were mixed in ratio1:1:1 and IPTG 1mM was added. To test the functionality of the processor and the output, tests with the specific quorum sensing molecules were performed as described below.
Reporter test. The culture carrying the reporter device BBa_K2205015 was also tested individually after induction with the connector C12-RHL 2 ug/ul as shown in the graph (Figure 6).
Figure 6: The reporter part BBa_K2205015 test shows a significant fluorescence increase after induction with the connecting molecule 2 C12-RHL.
Processor test. The connector 1 (C4-HSL) was added to the co-culture consisting of processor BBa_K2205012 + reporter BBa_K2205015 in ratio 1:1. The plot shows the successful communication via quorum sensing in the Sensynova device. It is clear that the presence of 1mM C4-HSL is detected by the processor cells which produce the connector 2 (C12-RHL) for the reporter cells to detect. This induction in the reporter cells leads to the expression of sfGFP (Figure 7).

FBA Model for Alkane and MFC
FBA
In the alkane degradation and MFC modules, we adopted Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) model to capture the relationship between different variables and characterize the theoretical maximum values of target outputs. The FBA model is widely used to simulate a genome-wide metabolic network, and the flux distribution between metabolites.  With this algorithm, it is possible to maximize an objective function  under a set of constraints provided by the user or the genome database, without specific enzyme kinetics inputs. By using FBA, we can analyse the alkane degradation pathway and electron generating reaction while taking into consideration of the complex metabolism network. This algorithm also helped us bypass the enzyme kinetics part, since little has been documented about the ASS enzyme complex in current literature. However, this method was limited to simulate equilibrium state only, and the theoretical limits are highly dependent on the database and constraints provided.[1] In our project, we used iSO783 as Shewanella Oneidensis MR-1 metabolic model, and made adjustment upon it.  iSO783 is a widely-used S. Oneidensis MR-1 model containing 774 reactions, and 783 genes. [2]
Hopefully, this mathematical modelling can provide an insight into the  interdependence of conditional factors and serve as a guide of our experimental design. 
 
Extracellular Electron Transport
In the MFC, S. oneidensis MR-1 has been reported to transport electrons to electrode in three ways, (1) direct electron transport (DET) mode based on the c-type cytochromes and conductive pili called nanowires, (2) self-secreted flavins to convey electrons and 3) the mediated electron transfer (MET) mode, which relies on exogenous mediators [1].  The DET route, which is a more dominant transport mode without the help of exogenous mediators, is modelled and studied. As reviewed in the MFC part of our wiki, the DET route depends on the c-type cytochrome (MtrC and"

Cooper_Union,2014,Team:Cooper Union#Notebook#Biohack_-_-_TEXT.html," if it has our construct or not we colony PCR'ed the 4 colonies on #130. We also used a positive control of HSP G-block to make sure that the PCR would work because someone deleted our protocol in the machine and so we had to re-do it and hope for the best. These five PCR products were run on a 1.2% gel. For the four colonies, we took 5uL PCR, 2uL dye, and 7uL water. For the HSP, we took 1uL PCR, 2uL dye, and 11uL water.   We also struck out the 4 colonies on a plate and put them in the incubator.   We made 2 gels that were about 0.8% agrose.   Did a digest with UV G-block cutting it with PstI and EcoRI (1 uL of G-block which is about 105 ng, 1 uL each enzyme, 3 uL cutsmart, 24 ddH2O)  We phosphetase treated the cut pSB1C3 plasmid that was cut with PstI and EcoRI that we got from the Denovo group (1uL anarctic phosphetase, 2 uL buffer, 10 uL plasmid that was 10 ng/uL, 7 ddH2O).  The UV g-block and pSB1C3 were then purified and eluted using 10uL. Assuming only 8uL came through, we nanodropped 1uL each. The UV was 4.5ng/uL and the pSB1C3 was 7.7ng/uL.  We ligated these two pieces together. Based on their sizes, and using a 1:3 ratio of insert to backbone, we needed to use all of the uL of both. This gave us approximately 50ng of backbone and 30ng of insert. So we used 7uL of each, 2uL ligase buffer, 1uL ligase, and 3uL water.  Then the new order of stuff came in so we digested the UV+pACYC184 and the GFP+pBR322 and HSP G-block with XhoI and KpnI so that we can swap promoter and reporter genes into our system.

Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#Other languages_-_-_TEXT.html," era de infecciones mortales. En 2016, una de las primeras infecciones con resistencia a todo: Klebsiella pneumoniae fue diagnosticada en los Estados Unidos; todos los 26 antibióticos con licencia se aplicaron, pero ninguno pudo evitar el resultado letal. ¡Una indicación clara de que se necesitan urgentemente estrategias alternativas para luchar contra las especies multirresistentes!
Durante nuestra primera investigación bibliográfica, nos dimos cuenta de que el problema era aún más grande de lo que inicialmente pensábamos, lo que alentó nuestra decisión por proseguir la indagación sobre este tema. Nuestra propuesta es un mecanismo que se encarga de sustraer el hierro, necesario para la proliferación bacteriana, sustituyendo al mismo con galio. La sustitución del hierro a través del galio, no sólo restringe la absorción esencial de hierro para disminuir la tasa de proliferación; sino que también el galio es conocido por sus efectos citotóxicos sobre las bacterias infecciosas.
La estrategia propuesta se remonta y basa en la antigua historia “El caballo de Troya”, ya que las bacterias son incapaces de distinguir entre la captación de galio y la captación de hierro. Estamos convencidos de que al atacar una vía metabólica altamente conservada, estaremos encontrado una estrategia exitosa para combatir a las bacterias multirresistentes. Este año el equipo iGEM de Hamburgo está trabajando en su propio caballo de Troya para combatir bacterias multirresistentes como Pseudomonas aeruginosa y Klebsiella pneumoniae con un enfoque basado en la biología sintética. ""Caballo de Troya"" implica que usamos un vector que entrega un fármaco eficaz que será tomado por las bacterias objetivo. Estos vectores son sideróforos, una clase de polipéptidos que sintetizan las bacterias cuando necesitan reponer sus reservas de hierro para así, poder proliferar. Los sideróforos tienen una alta afinidad por el hierro y son capaces de eliminar iones libres del entorno u otras moléculas, formando un complejo quelato fuerte"

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.

Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Version 2
Following the observations made when testing the initial version of this collaboration chip, the overall chip area was significantly reduced while the actual design was made more spaced out. This, combined with a thicker layer of PDMS, lead to the chip seal holding. The chip was capable of creating the proof of concept droplets out of different colors of water, but when the different solutions were introduced, the viscosity of the sodium alginate solution inhibited the formation of droplets. Now that the chip no longer leaks, it was decided that perhaps shortening the length travelled by the segregated solution would reduce the effects the viscous solution.
Version 3
This version of the Harvard Collaboration Chip was not designed by the 2018 BostonU Hardware iGEM team, but by one of our mentors Ali Lashkaripour. It is similar to last version with a few differences. First, the three liquids meet right before the droplet generator. Second, the overall dimensions of the chip are smaller which leads to a better seal. Lastly, the channels have varying widths due to the initial purpose of chip. This last detail is not relevant to the chip’s purpose here. When this chip was tested with the sodium alginate solution, it behaved similarly to to the last version, with the viscous solution creating tailing droplets but no individual encased droplets. After observing
this repeatedly under a variety of different flow rates ratios, it was decided that a new geometry was needed to achieve the collaboration’s desire outcome.                 Using a similar chip with only a single input, we were able to conclude that the while the sodium alginate solution was capable of forming droplets, it did so independently of the chip geometry. After this test and some literature review, a T-junction was decided upon for the new version of this collaboration chip.
Version 4
This latest version of the chip utilizes a T-junction instead of the droplet generators we have been using in the rest of our chips. Similar to the previous chip, all three inputs meet right before the T-junction. Unlike the other chips, a T-junction uses only a single stream of oil instead of pinching the solution with two streams, letting the droplets formed partially independent of geometry. During the first test with parameters similar to those tested in the last design, the problem remained. While there were some droplets being formed independent of chip geometry, there remains no way of making consistent, uniform droplets with the viscous sodium alginate solution. Additionally this chip, like the other
versions, is prone"

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation"

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#PolicyAndPractices#artificialcell_-_-_TEXT.html," one main goal of synthetic biology.
There are three different approaches aiming at the goal: the DNA-based device construction, genome-driven cell engineering and protocell creation (O´Malley et al. 2008).
The DNA-based device construction approach engages with the method of modularization, standardization and abstraction of biological constructs (Arkin 2008). Building a collection of biobricks and inserting them in organisms gives these new functions. Creating new species, which do not occur in nature (European Commission 2003).
The genome-driven cell engineering approach aims to create a so-called „minimal cell“. Parts of the cell should be reduced to a minimal extend, leaving only necessary properties for survival. Minimizing the genome after the top-down-approach pursues the creation of an organism as a „cassis“. A variable frame where every BioBrick can be introduced into the genome (Gibson et al. 2008).
The protocell creation approach seeks to build a new organisms „de novo“ after the „bottom-up-approach” (Luisi et al. 2006). Unlike the two other approaches the protocell-creation is not guided by an archetype (Boldt 2008).
These three approaches raise different ethical questions.
The ethical implications using the appellation of „living machines“ and „artificial cells“ will be elucidated. Focusing on the implicated hybrid-character of such designation, with regards of the relation between machines and living organisms and the deceptive idea of an “artificial cell”. Also the acquaintance arising from the determination between “artificial cell/living machine” is illuminated.
The term „living machine“ - a hybrid between machine and living organisms
Machine originates from the Latin term „machina“ and means „tool, artificial equipment“ and is defined as „a piece of equipment with moving parts that is designed to do a particular job [...]“ (Pons; Oxford dictionary 1884).
It follows that machines are designed for a particular purpose, according to the plans of humans and adopt a predetermined, defined and by itself immutable function. Machines are per definition not in the position to plan and conduct their behavior autonomically. They cannot change actions by themselves and can only operate in a certain way with the environment. Crucial characteristic for a machine is the autonomy but not the material, organic or inorganic (Deplazes 2011).
In contrast to the heteronomous machine stands life itself. The discussion about the concept of life in synthetic biology is a complex and wide-ranging field, where the difficulties of a definition lie just in the diversity of life"

3. Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
Innovation: We invited all German teams to the CAS synthetic biology conference enabling them to arrange collaborations, discuss their projects with other teams as well as with the experts visiting this international conference. In addition the attendance at the talks about many topics of synthetic biology might have inspired some of the iGEM team members to new approaches.
Safety: We designed the GerminationSTOP with the two different approaches: germination gene knock out and the Suicide switch. This makes the chassis we use for our project safe to use. This was also discussed with the commissioner for Bio-Safety in Bavaria. See the summary of the discussion here .
Sharing: We envision an iGEM world where work with B. subtilis is as easy as work with E. coli. As most work with B. subtilis is done with strains having a plasmid integrated, the sharing of the plasmid is not as essential as the sharing of the strain itself. It is possible to transfer the gDNA and therefore the integrated element into any other strain (if the integration locus is not already used) quite easily. In addition there are strains produced by deletions of genes. It is not possible to share these over plasmids. To accomplish this, the lab of AG Prof. Thorsten Mascher offers to maintain a Bacillus strain collection from which iGEM members can request or send in strains.

In a following shake flask experiment, we saw that the strain with the methanol conversion plasmid reaches in general lower OD values in its stationary phase. But in contrast to the control, the strain grows to the highest densities at the highest methanol concentrations that were used in this experiment.
growth comparisions on different methanol concentrations in 250 ml shake flasks of strain with polycistronic plasmid and conctrol with empty pSB1KRDP vector
methanol concentrations: 0 M, 0.75 M, 1.25 M; both strains BL21 Gold (DE3), experiment with 25 ml LB medium, methanol added after 2h, cultivation at 37°C with 250 rpm, OD600 measured with Aquila devices; n=3
Even though strains with our polycistronic plasmid grow best on high methanol concentrations compared to the others, methanol in the medium still affects the performance of it a lot. The strain grows to the highest densities in the shortest time, when there is no methanol at all in the medium. The lowest growth rate was detected when it was grown on 1.6 M methanol.  Nevertheless, it is still remarkable that this strain has an exponential phase at all of these methanol concentrations.

PRODUCT DESIGN: MICROFLUIDICS
What Are Microfluidics?
Microfluidic technology deals with the development and application of devices that control fluids on the microliter scale. These devices offer extremely high levels of precision over fluid flow regime, making them useful in biological procedures, like PCR and electroporation. These advantages stem primarily from the large surface area-to-volume ratio inherent in the size of microfluidic systems. The large surface area-to-volume ratio allows fluids to be controlled by pressure differentials and other viscous forces, and not the mass driven forces present in normal scale systems. The other large advantage that microfluidic devices offer is low  reagent input, which can maximize the material efficiency of a given protocol (Brinegar, 2017).
The development of microfluidic devices is currently largely focused towards point-of-care diagnostics and organs-on-chip for drug development. However the advantages of a microsystem has applications in many other areas as well.
Microfluidics to Address Mass-Manufacture
A perspective that has been proposed is the development of discrete, functionally closed automated manufacture for the scale out of autologous gene therapy. This model describes a functionally-closed machine that can be deployed at the point of care. This model can be referred to as ""GMP in-a-box""; The advantages of which is that the device itself needs to be validated for a chosen protocol and not the sites of use, which lowers infrastructure, operational costs, and the cost of regulatory compatibility for existing facilities (Hourd, 2014).
We believe that highly parallelized microfluidic systems may offer a solution. The microfluidic environment offers unparalleled control and input efficiency, however conventional systems do not offer a competitive production rate. However, another advantage of microfluidic systems is that they are relatively simple to parallelize. Processes can be scaled by designing multiple end-to-end channels onto the same substrate, which can also be scaled by having multiple devices operating at the same time.
Our vision for this sub-project was to develop a proof-of-concept for process units that would enable an overall production, to display that microfluidic systems have the potential to be used for"

USTC,2015,Team:USTC-Software#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," multiple-inputs-single-output and given functions in Boolean value. By discipline borrowed from electrical engineering and the analysis of connecting logic gates, our software is able to provide several more complex and novel circuit designs.
Meanwhile, circuit¡¯s practical realizability is very vital in order to avoid unnecessary cost and effort in wet-lab. We implement stochastic time evolution modelling to profoundly predict the behavior of circuits. The elaborated S-score, robustness and sensitivity analysis are used in evaluating and screening the circuits.
Through a well-rounded consideration of present difficulties in circuit design, we are motivated to develop such a highly integrated software that can automatically design circuits with both complexity and reliable behavior.
Features
1.Logic: From a truth table to abstract logic circuits
Function:
In BioBLESS, a truth table dialog box will be displayed for users to input Boolean numbers 0/1. All you need to do is to click Boolean buttons and then ¡°Create¡±. The corresponding designed logic circuits with different predicted performances will be automatically generated and displayed in order. You can immediately and clearly see the configuration of a designed logic circuit, which in most cases is supposed to be a complicated multi-input circuit. Besides the function above, gates list will provide many Boolean gates, and users can drag them freely to our canvas to design logic circuits.
Details:
One ultimate goal of synthetic biology is to design novel circuits with the aid of computers.
Concepts and algorithms from electrical engineering can be exploited to establish a framework for computational automatic design of gene Boolean gates and devices. Gene digital circuits can be automatically designed in an electronic fashion. Although the mechanisms underlying biological process differ in many aspects from those in electrical engineering, the framework determining the relationship between the inputs and outputs are universal only if Boolean gates constitutes the basic building blocks.
Therefore with the introduction of electrical engineering, if biologists need to design some gene circuits with specific functions, they just need to input truth tables and then by employing Espresso algorithms, our software will provide a logic circuit composed of different Boolean gates and function parts. Our library of well-characterized Boolean gates is the basis for the assembly of more complicated gene digital circuits. What is equivalently crucial is that the rational design based on digital circuits will bring about the freedom of designing complicated logic relationships between inputs and outputs, but will no longer be confined to mere single-input-single-output design. In our software, eight inputs are available for users. However, it is worth mentioning that the maximum number of inputs is actually not limited to our algorithm but to the space of the user interface.
It is possible that different schemes may correspond to one expected genetic function. In order to pick"

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a"

The idea for our project, degrading fatbergs, was generated by one of our team members, Miguel, during one of our meetings. Our team then did research in the literature to determine what genes might be able to break down fats. Our mentors from FREDsense Technologies, Emily and Robert, helped us find relevant papers, identify our EstA gene and eventually design our genetic circuit, which we had synthesized by BioBasic.
Our project was made possible by help from a variety of different sources:
- Funding from geekStarter/Mindfuel (with support from Anonymous Donor, RBC, Motorola Solutions Foundation, and NSERC/CRSNG), Knights of Columbus High River, Catholic Womens League High River, Cargill High River, and Co-op High River. This allowed us to purchase our genetic circuit, purchase lab reagents and equipment as well as travel to places such as aGEM 2018, and by the end of October, iGEM 2018.
- Throughout the process, our mentors, FREDsense’s Emily and Robert, were invaluable in helping us with the execution and design of different lab procedures as well as providing us with advice which helped moved our project forward. In addition to this, Robert taught us modelling and provided the idea of testing our bacteria using Nitrophenol so that we could use a spectrophotometer to quantitatively model the reaction and use those values for our model. Without Emily, we would not have successfully inserted our gene into the proper pSB1C3 backbone to submit our new part into the registry in time.
- We met with Jason Craigie and Eugene Lund at the Town of High River a couple of times to see how valuable our bacteria would be and how best it could be used to help them. They helped to explain how the waste water system works in our town, gave us a tour, and helped us brainstorm where our bacteria could be used in their system.
- We also met with Sean Murray and Dale Lagrange at Cargill (a local meat processing plant) to talk about how they dealt with fat removal in their waste water system and how/where our bacteria might"

(EVENT PLANNING)
Why
We have created a series of Poly Cards as a new public   education tool of communicating    synthetic biology and iGEM projects.    For better practice of Poly Cards, we    get inspired from TED and hold Syn-Bio    Share Salon in Zhejiang Science and Technology    Museum cooperating with Zhejiang China Association    for Science and Technology. In the process of teaching    and sharing, we try to promoting synthetic biology to the    public, share iGEM projects in recent years, guide them to    brainstorm new ideas, and discuss about safety issue about future.

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#Content#Team#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," socialized much those days. We exchanged among the different teams and we came to the conclusion to set up a collaboration with the iGEM team Aachen.
A Proposal Of The German iGEM Teams Concerning Intellectual Property
During the meetup of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May also workshops took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where only upon a closer look it becomes clear that the rights are company–owned. The issue that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature ( Bryn Nelson ‘Synthetic Biology: Cultural Divide ’, Nature 509, 152–154, 08 May 2014 ) :
""[N]o one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus improve future entries. With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more important. Also it would raise awareness to the topic of the legal status of parts, leading to a debate which could further promote the idea of open source. At the same time we hope that examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of restrictive legal protections.

CAT-Seq dynamic range assessment
Before the activity of earlier generated control libraries could be measured a control experiment was carried out. The role of such experiment was to test the sensitivity of nanopore sequencing as a tool for reading the information encoded with the DNA as a ratio of incorporated cytidine and reference nucleotides. For this, multiple displacement amplification reactions were carried out in 50 pL droplets containing the circularized CAT-Seq esterase gene and different ratios of substrate, reference and product nucleotides:
1) 300 µM 5-methylated cytidines;
2) 300 µM 5-methylated cytidines + 25 µM substrate nucleotide;
3) 300 µM 5-methylated cytidines + 25 µM regular cytidines;
4) 300 µM regular cytidines.
The amplified DNA was extracted and prepared for nanopore sequencing. By applying data preparation and analysis pipeline discussed above, the mean probabilities for every k-mer in the sample DNA were filtered and extracted for 5’-methyl-cytidines and cytidines in all the sequencing reads. The mean methylation score (the reference nucleotide count) was then assigned to each of the sequenced products.

We then performed scaling by subtracting the baseline of Cyt 300µM sequencing reads, which corresponds to zero methylated sites and normalized it over 300µM 5mC sequencing reads (corresponding to fully methylated sequence) to obtain the final score displayed at Fig. 20.

Our Travels
Many people outside our state picture Nevada as a place for gambling and legalized prostitution. Though gambling (not prostitution) makes up a significant part of our revenue stream, there is so much more that Nevada has to offer. In June, we took a trip to California and to visit with various people in the scientific community and act as intellectual ambassadors for the state of Nevada.
iGEM Networking
We met with the Davis, Berkeley, UCSF, and Stanford-Brown iGEM teams to exchange ideas and information. It was a wonderful chance to learn more about each team's school, lab, and project ideas and get feedback on our own iGEM process. We made lots of friends and look forward to supporting our neighboring teams. It was fun and rewarding experience to meet with our iGEM colleagues outside of competition, and Nevada iGEM looks forward to making time every year to meet even more teams. If anyone wants to visit the University of Nevada, just let us know!
Consulting with Experts
In addition to meeting with other iGEM teams, we visited with faculty contacts to talk about our project. The project we chose involves plant pathology and, unfortunately, there is only one USDA plant pathologist for the State of Nevada. With a project so focused on improving agriculture, we really wanted to accurately represent the perspective of those who know the most about the field by designing a project with their feedback in mind.
As part of our travels, we talked with three faculty members and the chairman from the UC Davis Plant Pathology Department. We also met with Steve Lindow from UC Berkeley, best known for developing “ice minus” strains of bacteria that prevent frost damage in strawberries. Through these interactions, we were provided with very useful feedback and direction for our project. We were able to have a very useful scientific exchange with these faculty members, gathering invaluable information for our project and (hopefully)demonstrating that iGEM students can be enthusiastic about research, much like students from their own institutions.

Basic Circuits
Basic Resistance Subsystem Model
Basic circuits contain two subsystems: resistance subsystem and regulation subsystem. Models of these two subsystems were constructed separately.
Main processes include induction of the promoters, transcription and translation of function genes, catalysis of enzymes and acid or alkali production led by enzymes. ODE is used for modeling to describe concentration as function of time. Factors considered are production and degradation, combination and disaggregation and reversible reaction.
Resistance subsystem consists of constitutive promoter J23119, function genes glsA, NhaA and NhaB. J23119 is not influenced by environmental pH, and will lead enzymes production continuously.
Fig. 1 Basic resistance device.
Our model mainly focused on functional genes and enzymes. Assumptions we made are: (1) enzymes will only work in proper pH range and are not activated at other pH level. (2) To prove function of our device, initial intracellular pH is set to ideal value.    For acid resistance device (Fig. 1), description of reaction processes are:
Where description and initial value of variables are :
Fig. 2 Name, initial value and description of variables.
Finally, result showed that with application of acid resistance device, pH could be regulated to a suitable range (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3 Intracellular pH is regulated by acid resistance device. To prove the function of circuit, initial pH was set up to 3.0, when glsA was activated. pH can effect the activity of glsA, while glsA conducts gaseous ammonia production. With the enzyme activity changing, pH will be finally stabilized at a suitable level.
For alkali resistance device (Fig.1), NhaB and NhaA genes’ functions were assumed as similar processes to enzyme catalysis. Basing on this assumption, description of the NhaB circuit is:
Consistent with equations above, functions are:
Where description and initial value of variables are:

Waterloo,2017,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," it difficult for bacteria to develop resistance against them. More importantly, AMP only binds to bacterial transporter protein not found in mammalian cells, which makes them harmless to animals.
Application and Benefit
With Waterloo 2017 iGEM team’s project, the fusion of prion domain with AMP can be achieved to effectively increase its aggregation in vivo. As a result, the efficiency of AMP activity will be magnified, which would improve its function as a bactericidal agent.
Restrictions
The mechanism of AMP remains a relative mystery to us, which would hinder our progress in designing this method. Additionally, S. aureus is seemingly resistance against AMP due to possession negatively charged lipid in its membrane.

Nanosensors Application
General Concept
We could take our prion aggregate and use it as a nanoparticle. By equipping the aggregate with antibodies for a specific protein, we can use it to identify the presence of the target protein to various concentrations as well (a separate test done afterwards).
Application
The whole concept of nanosensors is fascinating itself because it reduces the amount of time needed to identify the presence of bacteria such as E. Coli. This is also perfect for using in labs to enhance identification speed.
Benefits
The price of around 20 nm nanogold is approximately $500 per 1mL of solution. Our application would be more cost effective than synthesizing gold nanoparticles. We could hence make large structures of proteins.
Restrictions
Storing conditions may affect the feasibility of using it in the field.

- The bacteria react significantly less to a normalized repellent concentration of              less than ~3[mm]. This is approximately where the two graphs intersect.
- As the concentration of repellent goes down, the bacteria are less reactive.              This continues as the bacteria's diffusion speed surpasses the chemotaxis rate. In other             words, more bacteria move away from the concentration peak than into it for t>15[mim].
- Projecting this on the chip color experiment, we can predict there will be three shades              of color: weak where the bacteria moved from (low concentration), strong where the bacteria              moved to (high concentration) and on the far end, unchanged as the bacteria were not exposed              to the repellent.
Comparison to Experiments
The experiment ran as the setup shown in the ""Overview"" section: The channel was filled with           bacteria in motility buffer and then the sample was inserted. We used engineered E. coli with a S.Tar PctA           receptor taken from a plate and suspended in motility buffer. The chemo-repellent used is TCE.

As expected, a visible cluster of strong dark blue has formed next to a lighter shade due to           chemotactic activity. Furthermore, the distance the bacteria passed is only a few millimeter           as the model predicted.
The time scale does not line up: The color darkens as the experiment continues. This will           probably be corrected by using more accurate diffusion and chemotactic coefficients.
Some of the inconsistencies between the model and the experiment (like the uneven cluster           of colored bacteria) can be explained by problems loading the chemo-repellent as shown in           the chemo-repellent concentration experiment.
Conclusions
Results
This model predicts the overall behavior of our system. In our experiments we were able to           show that the concentration of the repellent acts as we expected in terms of changes in the           diffusion limit's velocity. When compared to the bacterial concentration, again, the experiments           showed a similar behavior as the numeric solution of Keller-Segal equation.
As explained before, this model requires further fitting to get more accurate results. Not only by using more accurate coefficients, but with improving the system itself.

Prof. Ma Jianyin
National Academy of Foreign Legal History Study
The editor of China Nonprofit Review
We contacted the experienced judges Prof. Ma to get legal opinions on our research project. They were not able to give us a legal assessment, because the state of medical controlling in China based on too many different fields of law to                     find a quick answer. Instead, Prof. Ma explained to us his personal opinion. From his point of view, as long as it was safe and good to humanity, scientific research should be as unrestricted as possible. However, the abuse of antibiotics                     has lead to a series of environmental and medical problems including decreased immunity and antibiotics-resistant superbugs. The fundamental cause is the misunderstanding of biosafty. As a result, scientists should take the responsibility                     of popularizing scientific principles and promoting the legislation about life science. In addition, with the help of social media, researchers can lead discussions, clarify research topics, and help to determine moral values. Prof.                     Ma set a high value on our manifesto calling for laws to regulate the use of antibiotics and biotechnology and encouraged us to doing research for improving the general life quality of mankind.

Transforming with B. subtilis spores
Now that we had stored spores with xylose added in the first inoculation step and xylose added with the SG media (different time points during the sporulation protocol), we were ready to activate and transform them mimicking device conditions. We pelleted the spores and put them in a vacufuge to ensure they were dry since the spores in the device will be in the dried form. For the final device, we were planning on activating spores with water so we added water to the experimental spores after they were out of the vacufuge. Then we added 500 ng of linear thrC DNA (since 200 ng was insufficient) and left the tubes out at room temperature for a day and then spread them on spectinomycin plates. Colonies grew for both conditions (xylose added to bacteria in initial inoculation, xylose added to SG media) and this suggested successful transformation. However, the next day the colonies appeared fuzzy and resembled fungal"

Conclusion
The goal of the Self Destructive Plasmid subproject was to create a plasmid that could be induced to destruct itself. It would do so by expressing an endonuclease that would recognise and cut a sequence in the same plasmid. This linearised DNA was expected to be automatically degraded by the cell.
The final goal of self destruction was not reached. However, a 30 basepair I-SceI homing endonuclease restriction site has been biobricked and shown to be restricted by that endonuclease. It has been combined with an inducible GFP-LVA reporter gene, which has also been shown to work.
The problem is the I-SceI homing endonuclease. First a part from the registry was used, that turned out to be T4 DNA ligase instead of I-SceI homing endonuclease. Construction of this part was done by assembling more basic parts. But the gene for the I-SceI enzyme turned out to have an LVA degradation tag attached to it. This shortens the life time of the protein inside the cell considerably and possibly prevents normal folding. It is hypothesised that disfunctional I-SceI is the reason that the expected Self Destruction did not occur. However, a contribution to the registry was made by documenting the anomalies in the biobricks containing the I-SceI homing endonuclease.

Goettingen,2015,Team:Goettingen#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," scale adaptation with B.subtilis
3.) Research to be done by team:
- Which enzymes: ideally well known
- How many ""dockerins"" on the scaffold
- Which biotechnical processes offer themselves -> e.g. waste water, cow udders
- How can the enzymes be linked to the scaffold: e.g multiple enzymes with the same dockerin for exchangeability
- Which Tags can be used
- Which cloning techniques
- Will the bacteria survive and work continuously or die after their application
- How will they be removed from the product
Ideally we would use a vector system to form a toolkit, which can be modified by the customers. Therefore a modular design and simplicity would be of     advantage.
4.) Planning: Times expected time by 2 or split group into teams, which work on separate goals: e.g. Scaffold group, lipolytic enzymes group, cellulolytic enzymes group,     etc.
Each group should work with multiple enzymes, to guarantee that they create at least one functional tool.
5.) Labwork:
Can start at any time as the Daniel-group will provide us with the resources until we have raised enough money. This can then be paid back at a later     state. Kits and essential chemicals, etc. are also available through the Lab. -> Start on the Scaffold can begin. Julian, Udhaya and Verena will meet     Silja on Tuesday to create the theoretical basis/Clone manager plans.
6.) Meetings will have to take place at least weekly as soon as the labwork has started. Next monthd need to be planned and scheduled with everyone's availability and     working ability, exams, etc.
7.) Logo will have added science things, e.g. helix, magnifying glass. The theme should be used with the university colours (dark and light blue). The booklet can     have a different title layout to the main part, which can also be designed in a modular, toolbox manner.
Think of a name for the cellulosome & make it cool: e.g.: superosome, flexosome, legosome

FAI President Raffaele Cirone and his staff member Lorenzo Della Morte shared with us very invaluable information about how foulbrood is experienced in Italy:
Foulbrood incidence rate in Italy usually has a seasonal trend with the largest number of registered infections during the second semester of the year (July-December). Regarding the impact and incidence of these two diseases on Italian beekeeping, FAI Italian Federation of Beekeepers has consulted the National Centre of Reference on bee diseases, who elaborated an official data reporting 51 complaints of colony infections from 7 on the 20 Italian Regions, for the year 2017. The number of infected and then destroyed colonies is a few tens of units compared to the 1.300.000 colonies, which constitute the Italian beekeeping heritage.
From the FAI point of view, the data is not to be considered statistically reliable both for the low number of registered cases and for the missing complaints. In fact, in order to avoid the Veterinarian Police controls, many beekeepers often don’t report the infection and directly destroy the colonies in secret. According to FAI estimates the incidence rate of foulbrood can’t be lower than the 10-20% of the Italian beekeeping heritage in total.
The treatment methods used in Italy to treat AFB and EFB are the following:
For AFB:
Must be compulsorily notifiable to the Health Authority. It involves serious restrictive measures in accordance with the Veterinarian Police Regulation (DPR 8/2/1954, n.320). Apart from the Beekeeping Best Practices (BBP) there are no official and authorized control methodologies so that the infected colonies must be burned. Furthermore, the apiary is subject to health constraints until the recovery plan has been ascertained. All the beekeeper’s instruments must be disinfected and sterilized.
For EFB:
Must be compulsorily notifiable to the Health Authority. It involves serious restrictive measures in accordance with the Veterinarian Police Regulation (DPR 8/2/1954, n.320). Differently, from the American foulbrood (AFB) regulation, the European foulbrood (EFB), has a less restricted regulation. In fact, the infected colonies must be distinguished in two different clusters related to their clinical picture:
Severely compromised colonies: In this case, the approach is the same as the one for AFB and it lies"

They included the extraction of DNA from fruits, the determination of the composition of meat by DNA markers and live sequencing of minced meat using the MinION nanopore sequencer. Through the everyday example of minced meat, we could reach and inspire many visitors. In addition, we provided a different perspective on the handling of animals in today’s world and achieved an exchange between everyday life, public and science.

7th CeBiTec Pupils Academy – Tomorrow’s Scientists
The pupils academy took place from August 20th to August 24th and September 1st to September 8th for the seventh time at the Centre for Biotechnology (CeBiTec) Bielefeld. On two days, we taught the students simple methods of genetic engineering for example plasmid isolation and transformation. Getting in closer contact through a dinner evening and other activities, we could answer all their questions concerning life science studies and biotechnology. During these two days we were able to communicate the fun of science and to inspire young 20 students to study natural sciences.
Teutolab-Biotechnology – Another Way to reach motivated Pupils
The teutolab-biotechnology offers student classes to experience biotechnology up close beyond the school level. Within two weeks, the pupils get the chance to take a look at biotechnological research: they had the opportunity to develop research questions and implement their solution into practice.
Within the framework of teutolab, we arranged two days with the pupils: One day in the laboratory performing plasmid isolations and transformations and one day introducing them into bioinformatics.   This was yet another way of awakening fascination in science and promoting education!
Figure 17: Vanessa, Johannes and Matthias are looking forward to work with the pupils.

Waterloo,2015,Team:Waterloo#Practices#An iGEM Critique_-_-_TEXT.html," investment.
Registration and attendance fees are funds being put forward by university faculties and departments, by organizations and fundraising efforts. Summed over all the teams involved in 2015, well over $3 million USD is spent, and one can easily make the argument that this funding can be put to more efficient and impactful use. Funding for research with higher potential, outreach programs for more students, and augmented curricula to better help students are just a couple ways this money can be spent that has an impact on a significantly larger number of people than the few thousand involved with iGEM each year.
None of this is to say that iGEM is not a useful investment, or that there's nothing useful gained from participating in this competition. Absolutely there is, as I think every iGEM alumni can attest to. I am simply stating that I and others expect more from such a large investment.
iGEM 2006
iGEM is not Science
This may be a controversial statement, but I intend to justify it. iGEM operates on a year-to-year basis, but science does not. It's a continuous process of research, prediction, and refinement to make a sturdy foundation which is then built upon. This difference in timespan and scope leads to different objectives, which is entirely justified and not something I have issue with. What I do have issue with is the attempt to make the outcome of the two the same, even though the work meets different specifications. iGEM lacks the review and refinement process that general science adheres to, and because of this it is difficult to make a foundation that persists from year to year. Lack of reproducibility, independent verification, and incentive to create work with long-lasting impact (instead of works that appear to have impact) make this foundation flimsy. Even those with the best intentions of making something that will be useful for years to come can slip up.
Take for example, the 2014 Heidelberg team. Last year, their project focused on circularizing proteins to improve their stability, and applications of those developments. Their project was very impressive, and as a result of their hard work, they won the best undergraduate project. Two main parts of their project were software oriented: Circularization with Rods and Angles of Unlinked Termini (CRAUT) and iGEM@home.
iGEM 2007
The CRAUT software is meant to aid scientists in finding appropriate linkers for circularizing proteins, particularly ones whose ends are far apart. As discovered by the Queen's team, parts of the software are broken, and require fixing."

Once you found out the name, you have to get into CSS. Since the appearance of your wiki is very likely to be the same for all pages, we can make use of our template structure that we created before. As the template "".../Templates/Header"" is imported into every wiki page, putting your CSS styling in this template will affect all pages. Just edit the .../Templates/Header page and insert your CSS code:
<style type=""text/css""> body {          background-color: white; /* defines the default background color of the document*/          color: black; /* defines the default font-color of the document*/     }     a {          color: black; /* defines the default color of links */     }     a:hover {          color: gray; /* defines the default color of links hovered by the cursor */     }     a {          color: black; /* defines the default color of links */     }     .firstHeading     {          display: none; /* hides the default heading */     } ... </style>
You can not only modify the framework of MediaWiki, but you can also define classes in your templates and modify them in your global css section. For example, in the button template the link is assigned to the class ""button"", allowing the modification of all assigned links in your global CSS section. CSS is a very powerful technique that cannot be explained in this tutorial completely. Learning mor about CSS can save a lot of time when customizing your wiki. You might also want to take a look at this page from this year's  TU Delft team , where some more iGEM-specific CSS styling is listed. You will also find many tutorials or look-up pages about CSS on the web. And don't forget to take a look at previous teams, they might inspire you or have that piece of code you where looking for...
Congratulations! You made it through the tutorial. Now you are ready to play around with CSS and add some more eye candy in your templates to produce a nice looking wiki. Have fun and don't hesitate to try new things"
