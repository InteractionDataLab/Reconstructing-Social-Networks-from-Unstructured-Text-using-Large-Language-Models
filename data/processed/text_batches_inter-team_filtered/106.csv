With this in mind,    we designed our kits to be low cost, easy to ship and practical for use in labs which may be small and under-resourced. Blaine Doyle, CEO of GlowDx (which is a molecular diagnostic company), gave advised us on how to keep our costs as low as possible while ensuring an effective detector.
Knowledge of  synthetic biology was also limited in Malawi and this may hinder acceptance of our detector. To address this, Donnchadh    explained our project and gave detail on what exactly synthetic biology is to workers in the hospital lab. We also learned of a culture    of seeking medical care from witch doctors in Malawi. Donnchadh explained the concept of synthetic biology to this figure in the community    where he worked, and got her approval of this and an acknowledgment that other advancements in science and medicine can aid in healing also.

It confirms making bacteria into dry powder is feasible.
 
 And also,the dry powder we got is shown in Figure 1.6.1 and Figure 1.6.2
 
1.2.4 Discussion
 We also used the method of dilution coating to measure the viable bacteria cells after 11 hours. But the results are not so well, perhaps the dilution factor is too big.
Conclusion  
 The experimental results have shown:
  ①:The chip's cultivating performance is worse than centrifuge tube although it can meet our basic requirments on short-term cultivation.According to our analysis,it may be due to the hypoxia environment in the chip.
  ②:The hypoxic environment does have a great impact on the growth of bacteria
  ③:Freeze-drying and recovery process of engineering bacteria can be completed
  ④:The bacteria remains relatively high activity after recovery
 In summary, as biological reaction carrier, the chip can be qualified in the short term bacterial culture,so the chip can meet our basic requirements.But the performance of long-term cultivating is poor.According to our analysis,it may be due to the internal hypoxic environment of the chip.Experiments have shown as proof that the hypoxic environment does have a great impact on the growth of bacteria.
 At the same time, although we did not carry out the freeze-drying experiments in the chip, but the experimental results proved that the idea of freeze-dried engineering bacteria is feasible.

Introduction
 As a microfluidic chip, the assessment of the flow of liquid is a necessary part of characterizing the performance of the chip. For the purposes of this project, the risks that may present during the infusion process include:
  ①: Blocking may occur in injection process.As a consequence,the injection would be not smooth,which would even lead to chip damage.
  ②: Bubbles are possibly be produced during injection,which would lead to dead volume increasing and biochemical reaction as well as optical detection process would be impacted consequently.

There are a lot of previously made BioBricks. We can choose from a variety of constitutive and inducible promoters to express the genes necessary for perchlorate reduction in E.coli. Next to these promotors other BioBricks may be helpful for our project. For example some BioBricks which can function as an O2 sensor or a promotor which is regulated by the presence of Oxygen.
We choose E.coli as a host because of the extensive molecular knowledge, vast amount of available BioBricks and phylogenetical similarities to the perchlorate reducing bacteria.
After the transformation, experiments were performed to determine whether the transformation had succeeded. This was performed by checking whether oxygen was formed by adding the transformed bacteria to perchlorate.
Random positioning machine (RPM)
Since many bacteria are known to behave differently in space, we are interested in the effects of simulated Martian gravity on gene expression. Various bacteria are known to grow faster and become (more) pathogenic in space and we wanted to know if this was also the case on Mars. As such, we measured gene expression in 3 different conditions: 1g (control), 0.37g (Martian gravity) and 0g (space, ISS). Of course, we cannot actually travel to Mars to experience its gravity, but instead, we used the Random Positioning Machine (RPM 2.0) by Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands. The Random Positioning Machine by Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands is a machine that allows us to do the impossible: experience Martian gravity here on Earth! The machine calculates a path over 3 axes, that will average the gravity exerted on whatever we put inside. This way, we can simulate any amount of gravity between 0g (e.g. space, ISS) and 1g (Earth). Martian gravity is approximately 0.37g and we performed many of our experiments with this amount of gravity. This way, we can accurately predict the behavior of our E. colinizer, using experimental conditions that would also be experienced on Mars!
Four strains, Pseudomonas putida and three different E. coli strains, were used. These strains were spread on agar plates and these plates were kept under different gravities: the gravity on earth and the gravity on Mars.

Transforming B. subtilis with PCR product
We are currently working on biobricking lacZ. We are planning on submitting this part to the iGEM registry since the lacZ available in the registry has bad sequencing.
Week 21: September 14 - September 20
Now that we had sporulated B. subtilis and confirmed the presence of spores using Gram stains and spore stains, we were ready to activate the spores back to the vegetative state. All that is required for this switch to occur is the presence of nutrients, which describes a regular LB-agar plate. We attempted activation by spreading 50 uL of thawed spore solution (from 4 °C and -20 °C) on plain agar plates. Colonies successfully grew on the plates and based on a qualitative analysis, more colonies grew for the long-term storage spore solution than short-term storage spore solutions. Although we had colonies growing, we needed to confirm whether spores actually converted to vegetative cells.
Figure 9: B. subtilis spore regeneration on plain LB-agar plates. The plate on the left was spread with spore solution stored at 4°C for short-term storage. The plate on the right was spread with spore solution stored at -20°C for long-term storage. Based on colony growth, more cells were viable under long-term storage conditions.
Post sporulation and regeneration staining
Israt had plated regenerated B. subtilis on LB agar plates, which were incubated overnight at 37 ° C so that staining could be done on them to check to make sure the bacteria looked the same when analyzed as  before they were sporulated.  Six slides were made using Israt's plates, four for Gram staining and two for spore  staining.

Measurement
We performed a number of rigorous and thorough measurements, on each component of the circuit control toolbox. We measured the effect of the insulating ribozyme RiboJ on relative fluorescence, and confirmed that it does indeed insulate proteins from genetic context. (Figure 1). We also measured RiboJ’s effect on absolute expression, and discovered that it increases absolute expression (Figure 2). We created a RiboJ promoter library containing the Anderson Library of Promoters as well as additional inducible promoters, this library will form the basis for an ongoing rigorous characterization of the effect of RiboJ on absolute fluorescence.
We also characterized the community collection of RBSs under the inducible promoter pLacO-1 (Figure 3). While our characterization was mostly in line with existing values, it highlighted the need to characterize over a range of conditions rather than at just one level of expression. Since our characterization was insulated using RiboJ, it should be applicable in all genetic contexts, even though past characterizations may not be. Additionally, we collaborated with UPitt and Alverno to measure our RBS characterization parts in cell free systems (Figure 4 and 5). Characterization was also performed on the Interlab parts using FACS.
Finally, we performed the first iGEM characterization of two new parts, which allow for orthogonal control over the output of a given arbitrary circuit. We replicated and characterized both the original and our improved synthetic enhancer on the Biobrick Backbone, which allows for multistate output beyond a normal transfer function (Figures 6-7). We also performed characterization of the effect of molecular titration on transfer functions by using a TetO array to cause a leftward shift (Figure 8). A model was made based on literature values, and our characterization matched our models prediction (Figure 9).

Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften
Scientific institutions holding lectures and demonstrations for the general public – that’s the main     concept of what in Germany is called a “Long Night of the Sciences”. From 6 p.m. to 1 a.m., the public     can visit campuses, lecture halls and other premises of the universities and get to know about current     research topics and results. In the area of Franconia’s cities of Nuremberg, Fuerth and Erlangen there     is also one of these “Nights of the Sciences” – in which our iGEM-team was able to participate this year     regarding a presentation of iGEM itself, our project and our results. We were able to get the whole team     to look after our stand and tell the general public about our time with iGEM. It also served as some     kind of rehearsal for our presentation at the iGEM Giant Jamboree. Team members from Erlangen presented     the biological and chemical parts of our work as well as our engagement in collaborations and Human     Practise projects – our colleagues from Würzburg presented their app and enacted a survey about what     they could improve in the app for the presentation at the Giant Jamboree. Our project met with great     interest and many visitors wished us the best of luck for the Giant Jamboree.
Safety
As our system can be implemented in multiple devices outside the lab it is a crucial factor to guarantee     that it will not cause damage to the environment. A crucial factor is to prevent the genetically     modified microorganisms from entering the environment. As we were working with two stems Geobacter     sulfurreducens and Escherichia coli we had to rely on two different approaches for this goal. As     Geobacter sulfurreducens can only survive under strictly anaerobic conditions, that task is simple to     achieve as the culture dies immediately when exposed to the atmosphere.
For E. coli we chose a cell-free approach for our tissue to prevent contamination of the     environment. This consideration takes into account that cells in the tissue lower the"

These included BioArt (a section that is to be included in next year’s iGEM), Modelling, and Industrial Biotechnology. This was followed by a poster session where we got some very useful feedback and comments on the poster we made; specifically this related to nanoparticles and Microbial Fuel Cells.
That night the UCL students and their SynBioSoc organisers Philipp Böing and Bethan Wolfeden held a pizza party that gave us the chance to socialise with other students in a more relaxed environment.
The next morning the UK iGEM team project presentations continued in the UCL’s Roberts Engineering Building. Once more we were received with refreshments and appetisers. To conclude the event we had a speech by Randy Rettberg, one of the members of iGEM who talked about the main principles of the competition and how Synthetic Biology has the potential to be this generation’s big revolution; just as computers were last century. In addition, he gave us a sneak peak of iGEM’s plans for next year. We are sure these will excite everyone once they are made public.

Ethical Considerations
Knowledge Sharing
This biosensor has the ability to change the lives of people in developing nations. The biosensor allows communities to detect the quality of the water supply. Knowing when the water is contaminated can stop people from consuming dirty water. The ethical dilemma arises when, after testing the water and determining that the supply is contaminated, the community cannot treat the water. Is it ethical to present information to a population that does not have the resources available to address the problem?
Sharing information about a contaminated water supply in a community can create problems. Addressing one side of the ethical dilemma, providing a community with the awareness of contaminated water and thus possible illness may be knowledge that the community does not want. Without the tools necessary to clean the water, notifying communities of a contaminated water source may seem futile. The awareness may be perceived by the community as a means of oppression: an external influence comes in to a village, diagnoses a problem, and then departs leaving the community members to address a problem that is not within their means to address. Water is an intrinsic need; humans depend on it. Coming into a community and then determining that water is contaminated can be perceived as a disruptive force. The community is told that the water is not good to consume, but with the inability to treat the water individuals are left using contaminated water. Problems may arise when sharing information with a community that is unable to solve the problem as the knowledge may be futile and can also act as a disruptive force.
Providing knowledge, however, can benefit a community in numerous ways. First and foremost, the knowledge of contaminated water provides a community with the power of making a decision. The community must become involved in the decision-making process, deciding which actions to take and how to expend accessible resources. Knowledge of contamination allows community members to take immediate steps. Such steps can be rudimentary measures, such as boiling or chlorination treatments. In each situation, using their own culture and morality, a community can decide what"

Education
To begin with, we’ve decided to make a difference among our schoolmates and teachers. Starting several seminars and lectures in our school campuses in Nanjing, Kunshan, Shanghai, we not only introduced our project but also unveiled the field of synthetic biology to students, most of whom were not familiar with this subject earlier.
Team members from NFLS held several seminars with students to discuss global warming, iGEM, and our project. During these seminars, our team members used statistics to analyze the ever-growing trend of global warming and illustrated our projects with understandable simplicity while not losing the gist. Alarmed yet hopeful to our projects, students raised deluges of questions from technical details of our project to the macroscopic influence and safety issues of our projects. While amazed by our contemporary students’ sincere concern on global warming and zealous enthusiasm towards synthetic biology, we addressed their questions properly and helped them understand deeper about synthetic biology. Also, we exchanged our ideas with our biology teachers who offered their genuine encouragement, helped us organizing these amazing events, and offered their intuitive advices to us.
At Kang Chiao International School, team member Keyu gave lectures to his schoolmates on topics including but not limited to global warming, iGEM, and synthetic biology. ""It was an amazing experience to exchange ideas after lectures, to engage with these interesting minds that have intuitive ideas popping out in literally every aspect"" said Keyu.
Boarder education
With voices of different people, we gained some insight into our education agenda, adjusting our focus on different topic when talking to different people. Consequently, our audience always enjoyed our topics and gave us positive feedbacks.
Our educational effort went beyond our campus into broader branch of students, we also gave lectures to interested students visiting our laboratory. Discussing with diversity of students, we gained intriguing ideas from students of different backgrounds. Their concerns about climate change and enthusiasm toward synthetic biology are what motivates us to go further. So in Zhejiang University, we gave short speeches to those visiting biology department on campus. These students not only include students from local community, but also comprise"

In order to calculate mutual information $I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \iint {p\left( {x,y} \right){{\log }_2}\frac{{p\left( {x,y} \right)}}{{p\left( x \right)p\left( y \right)}}dxdy}$  and estimate channel capacity, which is $C = \sup I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ , we need to find the input distribution $p\left( X \right)$ and joint distribution $p\left( {X,Y} \right)$ that optimizes the equation. $p\left( X \right)$ , however, is not known in the first place.

Presentations are one of the most common and effective ways to share information and convey messages. This year, HKUST iGEM Team held two sessions of presentations for the freshmen. One session was conducted on the 26th of September for freshmen from School of Science, and another one was conducted on 13th of October for freshmen from School of Engineering. Through the presentations, we introduced synthetic biology and iGEM, explained briefly about our main project, shared our experiences joining the iGEM competition and encouraged the freshmen to join iGEM in the future.

UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY EVENTS: ESTABLISHING A CAMPUS-WIDE PRESENCE
An important part of our Outreach activities were centered around establishing a campus-wise presence for the University of Calgary iGEM team. Not only is this a good way to get the message out to the community, but in in order to ensure the continued success of our team, it is important for a number of reasons.  For one, we want to raise awareness and generate interest for iGEM  among undergraduates that may consider joining our team in the future.  This year our team is made up of individuals from a variety of different faculties and we want to continue this.  The University of Calgary is also an important sponsor of our team.  To thank them and encourage their continued support, it's important to keep the University informed of what we're up to.  Apart from the success of our iGEM team, a campus-wide presence also allows us to reach a wide-base of students that may be interested in the emerging field of Synthetic Biology. One of our goals this year was to begin to establish a synthetic Biology community in Alberta and reaching out to undergraduates is an important part of this.  If we  hope to see Synthetic Biology courses or programs here, we need students as well as professors to be interested in the field.  Our activities included three research symposiums"
Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," of the host cell and go onto infect other bacterial cells. Temperate phages can follow the lytic life cycle but are also able to follow the lysogenic life cycle. These phages can integrate their genome in the host cell chromosome upon infection where they can remain dormant for long periods of time as prophages. When conditions are favourable, usually due to host cell stress, these prophages can excise from the host cell chromosome and enter the lytic life cycle where progeny phage particles are produced. To date, all phages found to infect C. difficile are temperate phages.
Ever since the first phage was isolated their use as a potential therapeutic agent has been explored, such as in the treatment of wound infections. Traditionally such therapy relies on strictly lytic phages to wipe out the problematic/problem causing bacterial populations. Phage therapy would be an ideal alternative treatment for CDI as their highly specific nature would mean they would not disrupt the natural gut microbiota, only targeting C. difficile cells.
Figure 1: Lytic and lysogenic phage life cycle. After a bacterium has been infected by a lytic bacteriophage, the viral genome material is transcribed, translated and replicated using the bacterial cellular machinery to produce viral proteins. The proteins are assembled to make viral particles and the genomic material is packaged into the virions. Once the bacterial cell reaches capacity, the host cell lyse, resulting in the release of the viral particles. These viruses can go off to infect other uninfected bacterial cells. Bacteria can also be infected by lysogenic bacteria. However, transcription and translation of the viral genetic material is repressed. It is instead integrated into the host genome where it remains and is replicated with the host genome. Upon induction, however, the lysogenic life cycle is switched to the lytic life cycle.
This could reduce the incidence of relapse by allowing the gut microbiota to remain in its protective role against future colonisation. In comparison to antibiotics, the impact of resistance to phage therapy would be minimal due to phages and bacteria co-evolving. As bacteria gain resistance to overcome phage infection, the phages can evolve to evade these systems resulting in susceptible bacterial populations which can be treated. Although phage therapy would be the ideal alternative treatment for CDI the major roadblock is that no strictly lytic phages currently exist.
Project proposal
The main aim of this project was to create a therapeutic for CDI that would allow the natural gut microbiota to remain unchanged and reduce the reliance on antibiotics. To achieve this goal phage therapy was selected as an appropriate alternative due"

Table 1. Translation rates, as computed with the Penn State University RBS calculator, using the MIT 2006 BioBrick ( BBa_J45700 ).
When MIT produced their MeS brick BBa_J45700 in 2006, it was meant to convert salicylate to methylsalicylate and produce a wintergreen scent in the process. However, the scent could only be detected when salicylate was added to the medium, proving that the BSMT1 equation functions yet the PchA and PchB equations may not function. Initially, it was thought that the RBS problems discussed above could be the cause but we could show this is most likely not the case : we entered the MIT brick sequence in the operon specific tool and obtained satisfactory data. Thus, at least in silico the pchBA operon could function, suggesting the lack of salicylate is caused by a different reason. For further elaboration on this topic we refer you to the methyl salicylate wetlab page .
Protein degradation:
The perceived degradation rate results not only from the breakdown of proteins, but also from the dilution due to cell growth. Every cell cycle the proteins are divided amongst the two resulting cells and the amount is thus effectively divided by two. We will look into both to conclude which effect dominates and what ranges are possible.
The breakdown part of the degradation of proteins is highly dependent on the presence of a degradation signal, called degron. These degrons could be hidden in a folded protein and could become exposed for example after a stress reaction (Dougan et al., 2010). One of the most characterized and important degrons is called the N-degron, which is a destabilizing N-terminal residue. With this information, the laboratory of Varshavsky has created the N-end rule, which relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its N-terminal residue (Varshavsky, 1997).
The N-end rule is applicable to a wide range of organisms ranging from E. coli to plants and mammals (Dougan et al., 2010). Of course we are interested in the E. coli N-end rule, described by Tobias et"

Deleting this gene will make it possible to have an increased flux through the TCA cycle. Using this knockout with minimal mutations, we receive an E. Coli which follows the same metabolic engineering principles as the Synechocystis strain proposed by iGEM team Amsterdam, and is therefore expected to be stable in terms of production (Fig. 2).
This strain is previously made by Song et al. , (2013) and produced 1.45g/L fumaric acid from 15g/L glucose in 24h in flask culture under aerobic conditions. This strain can be further optimized for higher fumaric acid yields; however, this always comes at the risk of impairing other functions.
Figure 2. Central central metabolic pathways in E. coli after engineering E. coli for fumarate production. Thick arrows indicate increased flux by the overexpression of the corresponding gene. The X indicates that the deletion of the corresponding gene. Enzymes encoded by the genes shown are: fumA,  aerobic Class I fumaric acid hydratase; fumB, anaerobic class I fumaric acid hydratase; fumC, fumaric acid hydratase (fumarase C); iclR, isocitrate lyase repressor. (Adapted from Song et al. (2013))
Fumarates effect on the microbiome of cattle
In theory, fumarate has the potential to decrease methane synthesis in cattle, as it can redirect the available hydrogen into propionate rather than into methane (Fig 3). Fumarate has been proven to reduce methane emission in both in vitro and in vivo studies (Mcginn et al. , 2004). However, a recent in vivo study found no effect of adding fumarate to cattle feed on methane emission. This finding contradicts earlier findings. It is possible that a higher level of supplementation than that used in the recent study would be needed to alter methane production in vivo. It is estimated that the level of supplementation in the recent study provided about 15 mM of fumaric acid (assuming a ruminal volume of 40 L; 116.07 g/mol), although these calculations do not account for fluid dilution rate and passage of fumaric acid from the rumen, which are in vivo factors that do not occur in vitro. In vivo, cattle were"

c) Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
All the biological materials used in our lab are safe, and all the products of the coding sequences are innocuous to human, so the risk of malicious misuse is low.
A regular safety briefing and a lecture about the basics concerning of biotechnology and genetic engineering are basic elements of our education at the SCUT.
The handling of biological material and safety aspects of chemicals are explained.
A safety briefing was held for all iGEM students by Zhenwu Zhang who is the responsible person for our lab safety.
Risks of Your Project in the Future
a) What new risks might arise from your project's growth? (Consider the categories of risk listed in parts a-d of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the environment, and malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
If our design works and is introduced into a commercial/industrial product, it means the E.coli which can product polyketide will be immune to certain pathogens. This might exert pressure on the survival of these pathogens. Also, pathogen-resistant E.coli would threaten the survival of natural E.coli.
b) Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them.
The plasmids we designed cannot function outside certain cell lines in the laboratory, And the cell we used is very fragile and it will soon die leaving the culture medium. So it will not bring contamination to the environment.

Parameters
Constructing ODEs is only the first step of simulating our design. The parameters, actually, play a significant role in the modeling process. Here are two sets of parameters(T3 RNA polymerase and P2) we used.
We have done an systematic literature review to select parameters for our model. However, not every parameter can be found from existing data, which means we have to guess part of the parameters from trial and error. To check whether we have guessed correctly, we do the sensitivity test. The sensitivity test works like this: We first give both salicylate(food) and arabinose(bell) to make bistable turn to CI state(have memory). After a period of time, we give the E. coli arabinose stimulus and GFP output will raise after a short while. We select the highest concentration point of GFP in the second procedure. The sensitivity of a parameter is calculated by using the following equations. The closer the sensitivity is to zero, the more reasonable the parameter is.
Assumptions
Our model consists of 53 parameters, which makes the modeling process very difficult. To reduce the amount of work without losing quality, we proposed the following assumptions.
Transcription
The average transcription speed in E.coli is 70nt/s. Assuming all the transcription in our circuit works in such speed, we can calculate the maximum transcription rate for each transcription equation by using this formula: Maximum Transcription Rate = Transcription Speed(nt/min)/Gene Length(bp)=4200/Gene Length (nM/min) Ref: http://gchelpdesk.ualberta.ca/CCDB/cgi-bin/STAT_NEW.cgi , NTU-Singapore iGEM2008 Team
Translation
The average translation speed in E.coli is 40Aa/s. Also assuming all the translation in our circuit works in the same speed, we can calculate the theoretical transcription rate. However, in wetlab, we can use different rbs to regulate the translation process, thus, the translation rate can be written as: Translation Rate = RBS * Translation Speed(Aa/min)/Protein Length(Aa) = 2400RBS/Protein Length (min^-1) This transformation does not change the degree of freedom of our system. However, this does limit the range"
NYMU-Taipei,2012,Team:NYMU-Taipei#ymibt.html_-_-_TEXT.html," but also enhances Taiwan's  international competitiveness in genome-based green energy biotechnology. Dr.  Pei-Hong Chen, a team member as well as the first author of the publication in  Energy & Environmental Science journal, stated that,""CO2 Solutions  Inc. in Canada has commercialized the technology of CO2 capture by carbonic  anhydrase and performed several pilot trials in coal-fired industry. With the  technology of engineering cyanobacteria developed by Dr. Chang's team, the CA gene  can be integrated into the genome of cyanobacteria. The engineered CA-producing  cyanobacteria can replicate in nature so as to produce a large amount of CA  enzymes to capture CO2 in the air. This will greatly lower the cost of CO2  removal in the future.""
The genome design and engineering  research team in NYMU led by Dr. Chang has patent applications supported by  National Science Council (NSC) National Program Office for GenomeCAA and  GenomeCAD. Based on the maturity of the technology platform of genome analysis,  design and engineering, Dr. Chang is actively seeking collaborations with  biotechnology and biomedicine industries. His team has already applied  GenomeCAA and GenomeCAD to valuable product research and development. And  through this integral technology platform, the time to market would be greatly  shortened and the effectiveness could be substantially improved.

This negative effect might be associated with the native signal peptide of PtNTT2, which E. coli might not be able to process correctly. Another explanation for the weak growth could be that the native transporter variant has a higher activity compared to the other variants. If the activity is too high, this might lead to a toxic effect and to the observed weak growth.

Sigma D
It was porposed that perhaps sigma D could be used to make a stochastic switch however perhaps not enough is known about how it is regulated?
The factors that are responsible for the stationary-phase elevation in sigD levels are unknown. sigD-dependent transcription declines after the onset of sporulation, and inactivation of sigD itself causes no overt defect in sporulation, therefore sigD’s contribution to sporulation, if any, is modest. Present evidence demonstrates that sigD is primarily involved in the expression of flagellar, motility, and autolysin genes and their regulators.

Synthetic Switches
Synthetic bistable toggle switches constructed from LacI and Cl repressors can also be used. Theese repressors repress each other creating a bistable switch with two negative feedback loops. Bistable switch with two positive feedback can also be considered.

Preparation of the microbe library
For safety and to avoid environmental contamination, microbial isolation was performed in a fume hood in a BSL 2 facility. More safety information in provided on our safety page.
Microbes were isolated from soil samples using either selective or nonselective plating. For the selective plating, M9 agar was supplemented with either quercetin alone or quercetin with glucose to enrich for microbes with the ability to metabolize quercetin.
The resulting culture was incubated at 30 C for 48 hours, then re-streaked to eliminate potential contamination.
To maximize library diversity, we preferentially chose colonies with unique morphologies. After isolation, we performed colony PCR with universal 16s rRNA primers (see methods). Sequencing the resulting PCR products allowed us to identify the strains and position them within the greater bacterial taxonomy.
Quercetin degradation assay
Each of the 189 isolated strains was innoculated into M9 quercitin medium in triplicate and incubated at 37 C for 6 days. At the end of the period, quercitin concentration was measured by absorbance.
Of 186 strains tested, 50 produced quercetin levels significantly lower than controls (Figures 3 and 4). 20 strains degraded more than 50% of quercetin and 2 strains degraded more than 80%.
Both selective and nonselective plating methods were able to produce quercetin-degrading strains. 4 of the 5 strains showing the most quercetin degradation were obtained by selective plating.
However, 40 of the 50 strains showing significant degradation were obtained by nonselective plating.

1.5 The iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA efficiently arrests cancer cell proliferation in vitro
KRAS over-expression has been demonstrated to promote the growth of lung adenocarcinoma cells and be involved in migration and invasion of lung cancer. For further verification, we examined the role of iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA in cell proliferation. An EDU assay using Cell-Light™ EdUTP Apollo®567 TUNEL Cell Detection Kit, was carried out after siRNA-iRGD-exosome incubation and as a control, nude exosomes were also treated to A549 cells. The result indicated that KRAS knockdown had an anti-proliferation effect on lung tumor cells while nude exosomes were not capable of inhibiting the growth of tumor cells.

The red points represent divided cells for cell proliferation rate calculation.

2.1 Establishment of none-small cell lung cancer mouse model with 40 mice to perform validation experiment in vivo
The iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA can be released into A549 cells and suppress the expression of KRAS in vitro. To examine the consequence of KRAS knockdown by anti-KRAS siRNA in vivo, we built a non-small cell lung cancer mouse model for in vivo experiment. Forty mice were subcutaneously injected A549-LUC cells to realize tumor implantation. Then tumor volume were measured through bioluminescent imaging several times after injection. The areas that emit fluorescence in the mice bodies represent labeled tumors (tumors developed from the implanted A549-LUC cells), which helps us to monitor the tumor growth, location and metastasis.
Figure 8. In vivo imaging of tumor-bearing mice. The parts in the mice body representing the tumors xenografted with A549-Luc indicates that the tumors are relatively uniform in size. First panel: the imaging of tumor-bearing mice injected with PBS. Second panel: the imaging of tumor-bearing mice treated with iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA.

Ionis_Paris,2016,Team:Ionis Paris#Motivation_-_-_TEXT.html," of detection exists. The methods must be adapted to the pollutants and the environment in which the pollutant is present. Existing monitoring tools are classified into two main groups: active and passive detectors. Those technologies are then subdivided according to their analysis type: physical, chemical or biological.
*This physical method uses a pump in a continuous manner, a pre-concentration device followed by a chromatographic column and one/two detection systems that use flame ionization or photo ionization.
**The integrated measure by active sampling is a two-step method. First a sampling is carried out by pumping through a cartridge containing adsorbents (graphite black carbon), then the sampling is analyzed in the laboratory by chromatography coupled with flame ionization or mass spectrometry detection.
***The integrated measure by passive sampling is a two-step method. First a sampling is carried out through diffusion tubes containing an absorbent, then a laboratory analysis is made using a chromatography coupled with flame ionization or mass spectrometry detection.
VOC detection methods using biological elements present numerous advantages compared to other physico-chemical methods described above. Even if biological detection methods require laboratory work that can only be carried out by trained people to avoid dissemination issues, they can, by using appropriate technologies, surpass currently used pollutant detection methods [11], [12].
Whole cell biosensors for environmental applications require the selection of a detector sensitive to the pollutant or group of pollutants to be detected and a reporter system, as well as a suitable method of presentation of the biocatalyst to the transducer. [12] As the pollutant recognition profile of a promoter (used as the detector element) is usually made up of only a few molecules, a biosensor’s output can be very specific and informative. [13]
In addition, according to the strength of the output signals, the quantity of initial environment signals (quantity of pollutants) can be determined [13].
By changing the genetic construction, the targeted pollutant can be changed, as well as the sensitivity of the biosensor (the amplitude of its response to a given stimulus). This was demonstrated by the 2009 Cambridge iGEM team in their E. chromi project [14].  The purpose of that project was to create kits of parts that would help the design and construction of future biosensors.
Another major advantage of biosensors is their ability to detect several environmental signals simultaneously and integrate them into different outputs (for example, different bioluminescence colors or fluorescence emissions). This can be achieved by using a single whole cell biosensor consisting of multiple different sensors and reporters or several different whole cell biosensors include"

Duke,2017,Team:Duke#HP#Silver#Social_-_-_TEXT.html,", So it was extremely important to our team that the test be similarly designed to something that the traditional health practitioners are technically familiar with and culturally tolerant of. Malaria rapid diagnostic tests look like a lateral flow assay: hence we have designed our project around the creation of a thermostable Grffithsin lectin for use in a lateral flow assay type test. This integrates with traditional health practitioners that are coming around to the idea of administering orthodox medicines when it comes to HIV/AIDS. The cost (projected to be cheap enough so that NGO’s can purchase them for use in the region, at least less than $5 per unit) would also be conducive to the traditional health practitioner environment. At this cost, relatively free to the practitioner, perhaps only paying costs to travel to a warehouse or distribution center, a stock could be kept, without the need for refrigeration and ergo electricity, to test individuals who come in to the traditional health practitioner clinic.
The cycle
Health is integrated. HIV is integrated. To talk about HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa we must keep in mind culture and social practices. One method of this is to identify how a cycle or pathway of disease effects a population. One such cycle is as follows. In the region, women ages 15-24 are more at risk for HIV exposure and infection than any other group of women, and women are at higher risk than men [4]. Younger marriage is also prevalent and may be a contributing factor to HIV infection. Supposing that a young woman marries an older man what are her risks of infection? Considering that older men are more likely to have had many sexual partners including sex workers during their lifetime, early marriage is really one of the first opportunities for infection in younger women. In this situation, it follows that the husband may pass before his wife, perhaps leaving children. In some cultures in the region, widow inheritance is practiced. In the case of which a man dies and leaves a widower, that widower is then married to the former husband’s closest kin. In other cases, a sexual cleanser has sex with the woman before she can move on with life, in many cases before she can leave the home [4]. If she escaped infection in early marriage, she must now go through another round of potential exposure. During the time that this occurs, children are exposed to two differing schools of thought. Religiously abstinence is taught, while socially and traditionally, sexually risky behaviors are idolized [5]. This can help to perpetuate the cycle of infection to children and thus repeats.
How can testing help?

III.  WHAT IS SB UTP PROJECT 1.0?
Some of the main questions that arise when teams are developing a synthetic biology project are: where to go (institutions)?; under what legal framework for both scientific research and commercial projects do we proceed?; what kind of ethical challenges can we find, and how to introduce these issues into the education system?.The UTP SB PROJECT 1.0 is aiming to set these  questions to be asked and answered when developing a project related to synthetic biology. Our program also seeks to link the sources of information to help address these questions.
UTP-Panama The team encourages other teams and other players in the field of synthetic biology to collaborate with the growth and improvement of our program to include other aspects and problems that we havent developed in this first initiative.
Flowchart2: It shows how do you implement the synthetic biology on your community, institution or country. It is to do some reflections about repercussions of our projects in synthetic biology on the human practices.

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Software Tool award , you must fill out this page.
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honour such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
If you are working on software as your main project, please join the software track. If you are creating software as an addition to your main project, please apply for this award.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA vs hydrolysed DNA?
Assaying for antipseudomonas activity: the Chang paper used PAO1 as target (for DNAse, MccS):
Grow PAO1 in 150uL medium in 96-well, incubate 24h with peg lids → rinse pegs with PBS → immerse pegs in plate containing purified DNase → crystal violet staining (alternatively maybe can just grow biofilms at bottom of wells - harder to wash)
Grow PAO1 similarly, then immerse in culture of DNase-secreting E. coli
Crystal violet staining: stain, rinse, de-stain, measure absorbance at 575nm
Assaying for Art-175: basically incubate PA (the original Art-175 paper used PA14) with purified Art-175 (or supernatant since our Art-175 has secretion tag) and monitor OD at 600nm over time (refer to paper)
Without secretion tag - H# (MccS), P# (DNase)
Need to lyse cells (buffer or sono?)
MccS - Chang’s original paper simply tested for antibacterial activity by adding purified MccS to a culture of PAO1

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Content3_-_-_TEXT.html,") and put it under the control of the same luxIpromoter, which means ndh also has a periodical expression in accordance with the oscillator. NDH-2 is a membrane-bound respiratory enzyme that generates low level H2O2 and superoxide (O2-) and H2O2 will permeate to neighboring colonies. Periodic production of H2O2 changes the redox state of a cell immediately and interacts with the synthetic circuit through the native aerobic response control systems, including ArcAB, which has a binding site in the lux promoter region. Before the oxidizing condition is triggered, ArcAB is partially expressed, so lux is partially repressed. When the concentration of H2O2 is increasing, ArcAB is gradually inactivated, and the repression of lux is relieved. With the periodically produced vapor phase H2O2 that can diffuse quickly among colonies, the oscillation is not only strengthened but also expanded to millimeter scales(Fig. 2-2).
Fig. 2-2  H2O2 functions as an activator to the quorum sensing promoter
When compared with the strong but short ranged coupling by QS, H2O2 might be weaker but long ranged because its disperse characteristic. These two levels of communication between cells formed the basic oscillatory system inside our host.
Reporter
A good reporter in an oscillatory circuit should be steadily expressed and can be easily detected by regular equipment in laboratory, so broadly used reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP) came into our mind.
First, we built regular gfp gene into our circuit and it worked well. Its fluorescence can be observed by fluorescence microscopy under 1s of exposure time on the microfluidic array 1(Fig. 2-3).

However, there is a newly found GFP variant Superfolder GFP, which has shown outstanding performance in many ways. It has two advantages in observing: 1) Fold 3.5 to 4 times faster than regular GFP; 2) Yield up to four times more total Fluorescence than regular GFP.
The greater the fluorescence strength is, the shorter exposure time will be needed, thus can decrease the photobleaching (GFP will be eventually destroyed by the light exposure that tries to stimulate it into fluorescing) that will lead into lapses in data processing.
Besides, we also want to make a comparison between two different GFPs' performances in our oscillatory circuit. For example, peaks, troughs and periods in oscillatory curves. The following picture shows the difference"

Tsinghua-A::Safety
Question 1
1.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
The bacteria upon which we have being operating is non-pathogenic E.coli epi300,an organism at BSL-1 according to standards of CDC in the United States. Minor risks are contained in our research since the organism and plasmids, which causes no severe infection to human and animals, will be handled properly by well-trained personnel after every and each experiment, and the chemicals in frequent use are proved to be friendly, except EB ,which is separated along with related devices in a special section, the contact with which requires such protections as a pair of rubber gloves. Prior to the researches of the project, our team members received all basic trainings on biosafety and laboratory safety in turn ,lectured by professors in the laboratory and participants in 2011 iGEM on Tsinghua-A team. Thus no major safety problem will possibly be encountered, which will be under control if they would emerge.
Question 2
2.Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?  If yes,did you document these issues in the Registry? how did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams learn from your experience?
Almost impossible. Primarily they have being used by a large number of researchers and no reports concerning safety issues have being published, nor have we discovered anything insecure. Secondly they are preserved in special containers and separated from the public. So this should be out of the question.
Question 3
3.Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes. We are supported and financed by Department of Automation, instructed and supervised by its professors and engineers studying life sciences. And laboratory assistants give us quite a lot of instructive suggestions including problems on biosafety.
Question 4
4.Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for"

Plants as Plants: natural factories producing fuel, plastic, flavoring, and more
Welcome, to the Penn State iGEM wiki page! This year our team took on the challenge of working with plants.  Through several projects we hope to help characterize key plant parts and demonstrate the ability of plants to be used as natural factories.  Below you will find a short description of our projects, for more information please refer to the ""Projects"" page linked on the left of the screen.
Team Abstract
Plants as Plants: Natural Factories provides a green approach to the manufacturing of valuable chemicals and materials. Through synthetic biology, we are able to control the expression of genes that regulate the production of desired secondary metabolites. Via the manipulation of established metabolic pathways, we hope to produce vanillin and butanol. The prospect of being able to synthetically produce a biofuel provides vast possibilities for the scope of synthetic biology and green energy. Additionally through the manipulation of the cellulose synthase genes, we hope to increase the biomass of plants by a hybrid plant cell wall. As shown through these projects, the use of plants provides various green energy possibilities. However, due to the limited use of plants within synthetic biology there are various regulation issues. Thus we have additionally worked on characterizing a range of plant promoters as well as introducing the Cas9 crisper system into plants.

Collaborations
Projects designed by one team is great, but with the help of others, it can become all the better.       We would like to recognize the following teams we were able to work with this year that helped       with the completion of our project! We hope that they enjoyed working with us as much as we did       with them.
iGEM Bilkent-UNAMBG Our team’s project consisted of inducing flotation in E. coli cells by expression of gas vesicle       proteins in the Arg1 operon (BBa_K2699000), which was modeled in a bioreactor system by our dry lab       team. iGEM Bilkent-UNAMG’s team project involved the engineering of a cell-surface Penicillin-Binding       Protein (PBP), designed to bind the beta-lactam ring on penicillin. In collaboration with this team,       we were able to explore the potential for a bioremediation platform for separation of penicillin from waste water, by       modeling constitutive expression of iGEM Bilkent’s PBP coupled with our regulated induction of the       Arg1 operon in BL21 cells in a bioreactor system, simply by updating binding rate constant parameters for PBP characterization.
iGEM Queens We collaborated with iGEM Queens by exchanging resources to help complete our respective projects.       In exchange for helping us complete the design the banner illustration for the landing page on our       wiki, we gave Queens our our pSB1C3 backbone with UNS that aided them with the insertion of their       parts into the required backbone for submission.
iGEM Tec Monterrey- Guadalajara We collaborated with the iGEM Tec-Monterrey Guadalajara and participated in their #ScienceEverywhere       campaign that solidifies the international spirit of the iGEM competition. In exchange we surveyed       the members of the Guadalajara team about attitudes towards genetically modified organisms and       were able to compare their responses to our survey responses from students who don’t study or       practice synthetic biology.

68C and 72C are the preferred annealing temperatures.  It seems as though the desired product is present, but it is smeared.  The non-specific band appears lower than 250bp, so it may be different than the non-specific bands previously.
The 68C, ad 72C bands were cut out from the gel, and kept in the -20C.

UC_Chile,2012,Team:UC Chile#Cyano#Notepad#week23_-_-_TEXT.html," right size. YEAH! The rest of colony PCR's although (wednesday's C1.2 and the friday assemblies) were... well, bad results.
Oh, and we discovered our beautiful syne that was growing in the lab downstairs seems to be cough cough dead cough cough. They die with glucose... We  reinoculated our stock for a new transformation and left coli growing with the target construct (psbAB + GFP).
Finally did a PCR run to amplify parts for constructs C1.2, Pcaa3 and ADF3 and several Lux parts.
Wednesday: Today was arduino day finally. We could try the system sensitivity to bacterial light and turns out franky's chick (the light sensor) can measure intensity pretty well. Also, a short experiment was done. We prepared several flasks with e. coli with Lux brick in sob medium and we added different concentrations of glucose to the different flasks (prior arabinose induction). The objective was to find the optimum concentration of glucose able to produce biolumniscence. You can check the details of the experiment in the Results section.
From now on, entries by crazyengineer will be way shorter! u.u It was awesome to write the notebook, but enginering faculty is sucking up the blood out of me (remember we are in working term here in Chile) and as the final days are approaching some other stuff needs to be finished e.g. a shining cyanobacterial lamp.

ASTWS-China,2018,Team:ASTWS-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," a big plan about using biological methods to copper treatment basing on Mbn, but we were lack of recognition of exsiting sewage treatment methods.
We consulted prof. Jiyan Shi, as one of the top researchers in the field of sewage treatment, for advice. He listed the ways heavy metal polluted waters could be treated, which are very efficient and environmental friendly already. However, the regular testing of water quality is not as easy as treating them. Especially for those poor villages in the middle of nowhere. They don't have good access to the testing equipment, and they are among the group of people with lest health care in the nation. So we adjusted our design of proposal, changing from Methanibactine synthesis and real-world application to find a more accessible way to moniter copper pollution (by naked eyes).
Interview to Dr Timothy Guanda Lu
Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering MIT
During the time section of experimenting at Zhejiang University, we are lucky enough to listen to the report of Dr. Lu, a professor from MIT who has extensive experience in the field of synthetic biology, about genetic engineering. We also have asked him for the opinion about our project, such as how does he see the suicide system we designed in our project. Dr. Lu first affirmed our thoughts and pointed out that the design of synthetic biological components must meet the actual needs. Based on his useful advice, we have further improved our project plan, including biosafety of placing the engineered bacteria into environment, further improved the parts design to more closer to actual needs, etc.
Conclusion
1. Heavy metal pollution is a serious problem especially in China because of the industrialization;
2. Copper is an important heavy metal which may result water and soil pollution;
3. Heavy metal (copper) detection and treatment are very important, and biological method based on synthetic biology could be a good solution;
4. General public lacked knowledge on heavy metal pollution but really concerned any potential health risk from pollution;
5. General public lacked knowledge on synthetic biology and had concerns genetically biological products.
Gold Integrated
To sum up, according to the research results mentioned above, we have improved the project from the following two aspects.
Public Science Activities
we found the core issue of public concern is not the new method itself, but the unknown harm and actual effect that new method or things may bring. Against insufficient public understanding of synthetic biology and gene erringeering, our team organized four public science events at Hangzhou Low Carbon Science and Technology Museum (China), Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum as well as Zhejiang Museum of Natural History, Ningbo Foreign Language School.

It was quite disappointed at first when very few students showed their interest in biology. However, as we vigorously presenting our project with passion, the fact that biologists can create plenty of fun experiments in labs attracted groups of people to gather around. Our audiences on this day were not limited to students but parents and any relatives that came along, all of whom contributed to a survey we collected. With rising interest and curiosity in synthetic biology and iGEM, many questions were raised (the most frequently asked questions are listed below) and, as a result, we successfully promoted iGEM, synthetic biology and gave publicity of BioWatcher and idea. While we collected public views toward BioWatcher, we hope, in this way, to raise awareness of both public and individual health condition and appeal to them the importance of early diagnosis and early treatment.
1.    What’s the significance of our project?
**Soluble ligand-receptor interaction The existing known ligand-receptor interactions, such as notch signaling pathway, is only applicable on insoluble ligands. With our design on reporter cell, the receptors can detect both soluble and insoluble ligands.
**Wide application Before this system can be used in human, it can be applied widely in lab experiment animal models, such as zebrafish. The autonomous report system will be a convenient tool for scientists in qualitative measurements.
**Customized detector The detection module on the reporter cell is nanobody, functional antibody variable domain fragment. The programmable nanobodies on the reporter cells can be customized into detecting specific ligands. The range of application of this autonomous reporting system is simultaneously growing with the expansion of nanobody library. Reference: Pieter Deschaght, Ana Paula Vintém, Marc Logghe,Miguel Conde et al. Large Diversity of Functional Nanobodies from a Camelid Immune Library Revealed by an Alternative Analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing Data(2017)
**Non-invasiveness To increase convenience in blood test for all users, we establish a non-invasive biofactor measurement system with the help of autonomous reporter cells and bioluminescence-detecting smartwatches. In this case, the blood test can be taken more frequently and easily at home, which will increase health awareness and transform the catchphrase-- “early diagnosis early treatment” into live.
**Bioluminescence >>drug delivery The induced pathway can be interchangeable. At the moment, BioWatcher is designed to output autonomous bioluminescence signal. The system can be altered into therapeutic application when the bioluminescence signal is"

Ok, then let’s start with your career. What has it been like until now and when did you start working on fighting trachoma?
George:
Yeah, [...] I am just new. [...] I am also a student. At the University of Cape Town. There I am doing my Master's in community eye health, but I started with Optometry. So I am an optometrist by profession. Then there was this opportunity by the Queen that some few people  can do their Master’s in community eye health then I applied and I was lucky. So I have just finished my modules and my thesis. Because my study was in trachoma, they gave me the data for all the endemic countries in the world, so about 54 countries, [and] I had to analyse country by country. [...]. So that’s why I am found in the trachoma studies, but I am not an important person in the trachoma studies. I am also just learning.
Daniel C.:
But that’s interesting. Like all those 54 countries and you studied all of them, how old was the data?
George:
There is this program called GTMP, global trachoma mapping project. So at first data was not collected, like it was not available but then the people said oh, this disease we have to get eradicated and they started to think how could we organize our data and now we have one server. So all the data is on that server in Atlanta and when you collect data, usually in all these countries data is collected with android phones, so it is really easy, it is sent directly to the server. [...] In my study we could simply wait for the information of these countries. So you write a letter to Malawi: please provide us with data. [and] they provide you with data. [...] so from all the countries that accepted, I have the data.
Dominika:
What are you looking for?
George:
There have been some questions about trachoma. We are trying to find out. Some studies were showing that trachoma is more common in females than in males and then there were some systematic views and people came up to maybe 1.8 as a ratio. Say when you see one male [with trachoma] you expect 1.8 females. This data was mainly taken from very high endemic regions and my role is to make sure that I use all the data and say if the ratio is still"

Next, the digested DNA was loaded onto a preparative 1% gel. After the electrophoresis was complete, the correct bands were cut out on the UV transilluminator (365 nm) before the following gel photo was recorded:
The gel looks fine. Cutting out the correct band had to be done very carefully in lanes 1 and 2, because the bands for the vector and the insert were very close together (vector: 3.4 kb, insert: 3.1 kb). Lanes 3 and 4 also show the expected bands, at about 3.2 kb for the insert and about 2 kb for the vector.
Finally, the DNA was extracted and purified from the cut-out gel slices using the Promega Wizard Kit according to the kit protocol.
The following concentrations were measured (Nanodrop):
blue light sensor, RBS, lacZ: 10 ng/µl
T7 promoter, RBS, lacZ: 10 ng/µl

Questionnaire
Last year we did a questionnaire about biosafety. This is the second year that we participate iGEM. Since this year more students showed their interests about iGEM, our curiosity came out. We want to survey the popularity of iGEM. According to the cognitive of synthetic biology of people and the view for our project, we designed a questionnaire about these two parts. We did online and offline survey and the result was better than our expectation.
Here is the result:
Q1:How old are you?
First of all we collected suggestions from many people in all age from many fields online. They mainly are teenagers and middle-aged people.
Q2:Do you know synthetic biology?
Three fourth of the people we surveyed are 17~28 years old. Most of them have a brief understanding about synthetic biology. Only a little of them said they were very interested in synthetic biology and willing to research it.
Q3:How do you think about synthetic biology?
We surveyed how people understand synthetic biology and the data is shown below.
According to the data, many people think synthetic biology is close to artificial expression system to express recombinant gene. This result is basically identical to the concept of synthetic biology.
Q4:Have you heard of iGEM?
We surveyed the acknowledge of people about iGEM.
The result is that about half people don’t know much about it. At the same time, one tenth people wants to join the competition.
Q5:Do you know saline-alkali land in China?
Then we designed this question based on our project and the aim is to know how people think about saline-alkali land. The data we collected"
Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Project#Carotenoids_-_-_TEXT.html,"otene extraction with acetone using protocol described in literature and took absorbance measurement using Omega Microplate Readers (BMG-Labtech).
As a pilot project to test out the carotene measurement protocol, we prepared overnight cultures for pPCB15 in original MG1655, pPCB15 in MG1655 PT5-dxs,idi,ispBDF, pPCB15 in TOP10, K152005 in TOP10 and R0011 in TOP10 (as negative control). Absorbance spectrum measurements were taken, first on intact cells, and then on carotene extract in acetone. The results indicated that absorbance measurements on intact cells were unable to demonstrate the characteristic absorbance peak of beta-carotene at 450 nm. In contrast, absorbance measurement on carotene extract in acetone showed clear peak at 450nm, which was a much better indicator of beta-carotene production. Furthermore, the visually identified ""yellow pigment"" in K152005 was probably not beta-carotene. This could not have been distinguished using visual inspection along. Given these results, we decided to use carotene extraction in acetone and absorbance at 450 nm for future quantification of amount of carotene.
The colours of the acetone extracts were shown below:

We clone and standardize the gene into standard plasmid pSB1C3. After confirmation through enzyme digestion and whole sequencing, we transform the plasmid into E.coli BL21 (DE3) to achieve better expression level.
We observe that transformants have obviously turned red and identify the expected protein band in SDS-PAGE. According to in vivo test on termites, the toxic effect of Plu1537 is far more ideal than our expectation by oral feeding.
In conclusion, we have successfully cloned and expressed the plu1537 in E.coli BL21(DE3). Toxic effects of oral feedings on termites are far better than that described in moth larvae research.
BACKGROUND
In 2009 research Expression and activity of a probable toxin from Photorhabdus Luminescens, toxin protein pit, which is 94% homologous with plu1537, is expressed in E.colo BL21(DE3). Engineered strain BL21 was both orally fed and injected in hemocoel to two kind of moth(Galleria mellonella & Spodoptera litura). As a result, hemocoel injection is more effective than oral feeding. However, our experiment showed that oral feeding is also effectively.
Plu1537 shares 30% amino acid sequence similarity with a 13.6 kDa insecticidal crystal protein Cry34Ab1 in Bacillus thuringiensis (Figure 1), which belongs to bt toxin family.
Bt family is a type of biological insecticidal toxins and may be the most famous one up to now. After years of study, bt family is becoming bigger and bigger. Basically, most proteins in bt family such as Cry34Ab1 form pores in the membrane to kill the cell.
In 2014, the structure of cry34Ab1 was revealed and reported in PLOS ONE. As displayed in figure 1, the structure of cry34Ab1 is simpler, compared with other two toxins we used. Notably, cry34Ab1 (figure 2A) functions only with the assistant of cry35Ab1 (figure 2B)(2), while plu1537 performs its toxicity directly.

We did our best, but were bested by Team Tübingen and their shadowy mastermind. In the evening, we had the chance to publicly present our project to a great crowd. But this was just the start for a joyful night to follow. After a few rounds of drinks organized by team Aachen, we went to the world famous Pontstraße, the place in Aachen that never sleeps... Rumour has it that a certain team had so much fun that they could not show up on the next day. On Sunday, guest speakers held lectures and the teams had the chance to present their project once more in greater detail to each other. It was nice and inspiring to see how the other teams that we don't regard as competitors anymore but as dear friends had progressed during the past months. Unfortunately this already concluded the Meetup and after a short side track to buy some Printen we were already back again on the road to Munich, leaving Aachen with a crying and a smiling eye, due to the great experience we had.

Hi there!
Welcome to our Wiki! I'm BaKillus, the pathogen-hunting microbe, and I'll guide you on this tour through our project. If you want to learn more about a specific step, you can simply close the tour and come back to it anytime you like. So let's start!
What's the problem?
First of all, what am I doing here? The problem is, pathogenic bacteria all around the world are becoming more and more  resistant against antimicrobial drugs. One major reason for the trend is the inappropriate use of drugs. With my BaKillus super powers, I want to reduce this misuse and thus do my part to save global health.
Sensing of pathogens
To combat the pathogenic bacteria, I simply eavesdrop on their communication. Bacteria talk with each other via quorum sensing systems, which I use to detect them and trigger my responses.
Adhesion
The more specific and effective I can use my powers, the lower the danger is of provoking new resistance development. So I catch pathogens whenever I get hold of them and stick to them until my work is done.
Killing
Talking about my work - killing pathogens is finally what I am made for. In response"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," as a substrate that we have little prior knowledge of but that can be adapted into something with an existing biosensor. SOX was specifically chosen to demonstrate that glyphosate, an unconventional substrate which there is not a lot information on, can be converted into formaldehyde which there are existing biosensors for (Ling and Heng 2010). As part of our project, SOX was designed to be an ‘adaptor’ that could link glyphosate into our framework via a formaldehyde detector module. This concept could then be applied to other molecules that have easily detectable substrates in their degradation pathways. The aim of this part of the project was to demonstrate that SOX can be expressed by E. coli cells and that when glyphosate is added SOX can convert it to formaldehyde to be detected via a biosensor.
Figure 1: Biochemical pathway of the degradation of glyphosate to glycine and formaldehyde.
Design Stage
This construct was designed to have 30 bp overhangs with the pSB1C3 plasmid, so that it could be Gibson assembled into a pSB1C3 plasmid digested with XbaI and SpeI. Extra bases were added between the overhangs and the construct so that once the part was assembled into the plasmid, the XbaI and SpeI sites could be regenerated and the biobrick prefix and suffix restored. A T7 promoter was added to enable expression to be under the control of IPTG. This construct was then submitted to IDT for synthesis as a gBlock.
To ensure the codon usage of our SOX protein was not differing significantly from the average codon usage of E. coli, rare codons were removed from the sequence using the IDT codon optimisation tool to produce high protein expression.
Figure 2: BBa_K2205004 Design
Figure 3: Expression vector pSB1C3 with BBa_K2205004.
Implementation
After assembly, SOX was transformed into E. coli DH5α cells and then into BL21-DE3 cells. This was done because DH5α cells are better for transformation, while BL21-DE3 cells are better for protein expression. This led to the expression of SOX being placed under the control of a T7 promoter due to BL21-DE3 cells producing T7 polymerase after the addition of IPTG. Colonies indicated successful assembly, which was confirmed by creating plasmid DNA preparations of the colonies and performing confirmation digests to view on an agarose gel using the restriction enzymes Xba1 and Spe"

The ECFK consists of several tubes containing different lysate reaction components,   ideal to show a range of biomolecular processes. There are two kits: one of them is freeze dried,   which enables simpler manipulations and storage for high schools with low   budget; the other one isn't freeze dried, which enables students to learn how to pipette correctly  and perform more elaborate experiments. The mini kit also contains a detailed description of the experiments that can          be performed with it as well as suggestions of topics (such as cell-free biology) that the teacher could find          interesting to include in his biology lectures. In fact, the ECFK is a diverse toolbox suitable for the demonstration          of biological principles  to groups with basic knowledge in biology, as the teacher is free to provide the          students with an adequate background for their grade level.
We also reached out to our university’s biosafety department to make sure we   were complying with national safety requirements.

Professional Input on Viral Contenders
When the time came to test our software in previously unchartered territory    (eg. with new viruses), our first concern was finding a suitable ‘viral contender’.    It had to be present in a bodily fluid, if possible with high amounts of viral RNA    or DNA circulating. In order to make the best choice and detect a virus having a    high impact on today’s health landscape, we contacted several professionals form    different organizations and labs for their input. This included the following    scientists : Jacques Fellay whose lab is working on Human Genomics of infectious    diseases, virus-host interactions and translational genomics at EPFL; Samuel Cordey    from the Virology lab at HUG in Geneva; Bruno Correia heading the laboratory of    Protein Design and Immunoengineering at EPFL; and Didier Trono from the laboratory    of Virology and Genetics at EPFL.
Their suggestions for a relevant virus that needed quick detection as well    as our team brainstorming led us to single out the Hepatitis virus as a main    contender, of which we then chose genomic sequence unique to Hepatitis C,    genotype 1, as it is the most common of all Hepatitis C (HCV) genotypes.    Today, Hepatitis C is diagnosed by taking blood and liver samples that need    to be analyzed by"

Eat coli - The untapped food resource of the century
Click the picture to meet the 2014 SDU iGEM team.
Our project aims to create a nutrition source of high quality from a yet untapped food resource: Escherichia coli (E. coli). Our project intends to genetically modify a strain of E. coli to overproduce a self-designed   nutritional protein, the OneProt, which contains the perfect distribution of all amino acids, including all the essential   amino acids that must be incorporated through the diet. Likewise, this bacteria will produce essential fatty   acids (ω3-, and ω6 fatty acids), that cannot be produced by the human body. In addition, this amazing   nutrition-combo will be obtained from the degradation of otherwise non-degradable material for humans,   such as cellulose, to make the source sustainable. And of course, we also want it to be tasty!
Our project has several applications. As a current application, the Edible coli is thought as a relief aid for  hunger-stricken countries, since hunger often links to malnourishment due to a diet with a high content of   carbohydrates, the cheapest foods, and a lack of proteins and fatty acids. In a broader aspect, our aim   with this project is to help society on the right track in controlling malnutrition, due to lack of food"

  The study above is mainly about the data, but how many software are really practical and user-friendly? Let’s take the most influential journals in synthesis biology as an example. We studied how many of them have apps.
  As what we have shown above, the development of mobile platform is only decades, and on which the development of scientific software is also at the very beginning, but no doubt the rapidly developing of them has already fulfill us with wonder. All sorts of software are at people’s fingertips, and an exponential growth has already been in sight. We believe that in the near future, the research of synthesis biology will usher in an era of mobile.

In these wordclouds we can observe that images on the wiki were called “picture” in the past and are now called (“fig” and “fig2”). The word “identity” is now used instead in athe form “identification”. We also see that words like (“core” and “effector”) have fallen in use, which may reflect that the engineered systems do not revolve around a single switch and are now composed of many parts.
We see that in more recent wikis the description of the steps has increased because of the increase in use of terms like (“min”, “absorption”,“diluton”,“supernatant”,“positive control”). We also see that the team nature of the project is now more evident on the description due to the increase in terms like (“member”,“student”,“cooperation”). Of note, not all ocurrences of “member” refer people, but sometimes to molecules. The word “class” is used where today we would use “type”, strangely we did not observe a corresponding increase in the use of this last word.

Afterwards gel extraction was performed for the inserts C0060, C0061-B0015 and C0060-B0015 and DNA purification for the vectors. Inserts and vectors were ligated using T4-DNA Ligase (NEB) overnight at 16°C.

Yesterday's ligations transformed into E. coli XL1 MRF' by heatshock and plated on 2xYT agar containing glucose and Chloramphenicol.
Since the chromoprotein DNA from Uppsala iGEM Team 2011 arrived today we now switched to our new cloning strategy starting with resuspending and transforming the newly arrived DNA into E. coli XL1 Blue MFR' by heatshock. Cells were as well plated on 2xYT agar containing glucose and chloramphenicol.
Even if we switched to our new strategy we still kept working on the fluorescence markers. Therefore we digested the BioBricks E0420 (eCFP), E0430 (YFP) and J06702 (mCherry) as well as our promotor-RBS-LasR and promotor-RBS-RhlR-constructs. Still lacking the construct containing LuxR we decided to proceed with the promotor-RBS-construct instead to ligate it to the YFP-Brick. Gel extraction was performed for the inserts and DNA purification for the vector parts. Inserts and bricks were ligated overnight using T4 DNA ligase (NEB) at 16°C.
Since we now have our first constructs containing the inducible promotors as well as the the ampicillin resistence gen we started our first leakiness experiments. All constructs (Plas, Prhl, Plux in combination with the RBS and ampR) were cultivated overnight in 2xYT medium containing various ampicillin concentrations.

TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Ethics macro_-_-_TEXT.html," of synthetic biology, with a focus on ethical issues such as biosecurity, biosafety, intellectual property and artificial life, one can wonder when the public is going to realize that synthetic biology is not so much different from genetic engineering. Could this lead to a large decrease in public appreciation of synthetic biology or genetic engineering in general? Will the introduction of the term “synthetic biology” in fact cause a public backlash on this technology?
Perhaps different questions should be considered. For example, should we wonder what can be done to prevent this public backlash from occurring? But maybe the questions should be on a different level: is the public interested in this field of science? Should the public know more about the scientific background of this technology? To what extent should the public be involved in scientific development? These ethical/social questions are becoming more relevant when biotechnology (or synthetic biology) applications are going to represent a larger part of our everyday life.
Currently, one may argue that in most products we use, in some way or another, biotechnology is already used, people just don’t know about it. With the decrease in oil supplies and the introduction of biofuels, bioplastics, agro biotechnology, gene therapy etc., a larger part of the things we take for granted will become biotechnology based: from fossil fuel based economy to biobased economy. It is up for discussion whether this is in all cases a good development…
3.7 From contradictio in terminis to oxymoron: the hype or promise of synthetic biology?
The question that arises from the previous paragraph is whether synthetic biology applications can really live up to their promises. In other words: the seemingly mistake of the contradictio in terminis of the term “synthetic biology” may really become the deliberate use of the oxymoron “synthetic biology”. Is it just another hype (like in the past e.g. Y2H systems, DNA microarrays, systems biology), or can scientists really accomplish something with synthetic biology, and than in particular some applications that everyone is happy with and see the advantages of? To achieve this, there are two kinds of challenges:
A scientific challenge: can we come up with synthetic “living” systems that do not pose biosecurity and biosafety risks? This may be impossible, but the possibilities and advantages of synthetic biology are numerous.
A social/ethical challenge: can we make synthetic biology applications appreciated by all direct and indirect stakeholders in the discussion on genetic engineering and related topics? Artificial life and intellectual property issues need to be considered, but also general genetic engineering related ethical issues.
The engineering approach of synthetic biology (biological"

1.Necessity of E.coli ΔLysA
  After we have verified that lysine can be the signal upstream the sensor, what we need to do next is to conform the connection between the lysine concentration and the growth of E.coli ΔLysA. Before that, we have to make sure that the growth of wild type E.coli has no connection with lysine concentration. Part BBa_K876070 was transformed into wild type E.coli to test its OD600 and GFP fluorescence every hour with microplate reader. Lysine was added in increments of 0.5ug/mL to establish a range of 0-3ug/mL. It shows that the growth of wild type E.coli has no connection with lysine concentration. From this, we can say that it’s necessary for E.coli ΔLysA to be the signal receiver of lysine.
Figure1: The of the wild type E.coli has no connection with the lysine concentration.
Figure2: The GFP fluorescence of the wild type E.coli has no connection with the lysine concentration.
 To explore the connection between the lysine concentration and the growth of E.coli ΔLysA, we first cultured E.coli ΔLysA in LB medium till its OD600 has reached 0.4. Then aliquots of 100ul were transferred into M9 medium to deplete lysine. After 10h, aliquots of 100ul were transferred into M9 medium with lysine. Lysine was added in increments of 0.5ug/mL to establish a range of 0-3ug/mL. OD600 was measured with microplate reader every hour. The result shows that the OD600 of E.coli ΔLysA has a linear relation with lysine concentration. Thus, we have proved our lysine sensor to be feasible.
Figure3:The OD600 of the E.coli ΔLysA is induced by the lysine concentration.
Figure4:The GFP fluorescence of the E.coli ΔLysA is induced by the lysine concentration.
2.Confirmation in Models
  After we have confirmed that the E.coli ΔLysA can response and transform lysine signal to the fluorescent signal, what we need to do is to amplify the fluorescent signal and improve the sensitivity. To solve this problem and make sure that our own-designed circuit works well, we need to test the effect of"

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#LargePhage#Winterexp#Period1#Dailylog_-_-_TEXT.html," Build a library of multiple sizes of phage capsids and provide tools to assemble these phage capsids so they can be used for drug delivery and nanotechnology
Look into: Metabolic load on bacteria based on capsid size?
Screening methods: Increasingly harsh environments, less nutrients, smaller phage? Using ozone for selection
3/15/13-Keltzie Smith Today we narrowed in on the phage we are going to use as a starting point for expansion. We found that it wasn’t as easy as we thought to simply look up what would be best for us since there are bits information here and there, but not all in the same location- I suppose this is why we are doing the research that we are- filling a gap! In deciding which to use we took into account genome size as well as how characterized it is. We decided that T4 is the simplest and most effective route to take even though it is technically not the largest phage that infects E. coli.  Large phage procedures:
Paper about UV light and backup genes?
Decreasing agar concentration – select for small plaque sizes
Find T4 phage and host
Start growing them (archive sample of the phage)
Determine sequence of the relevant capsid proteins
Mutate them
Determine the sequence again
Find a way to create just capsids of the larger size
3/18/13 3/18/13-Keltzie Smith As of right now our main priority is making sure the T4 we have now is working. Today we started our K12  E.Coli. Next time we’ll see if our T4 is viable, once we see plaques on our plates our next step will be to sequence our phage to determine what we have to start out with an we’ll mutate from there. One thing we are hoping to look deeper into is UV irradiation to select for bigger bacteriophages.

We took a half day for July 4th!
Thursday 5th
We conducted a double digest of the T7 constitutive promoter (I719005) and Ribosome Binding Site (B0034). ( Double Digest Protocol )
We worked on the safety page of our wiki after concern arose regarding the safety of procedures in our planned project. We continued research regarding how we can plan and carry out our project.
Friday July 6th
We created an in-depth plan for how we were going to assess our project. We divided the project up into manageable sections and assigned particular areas to people on our team. One area we decided on was protein engineering in which we hoped to engineer a more efficient cutinase protein. Minipreped J23101 and digested it.
We took a look at the requirements for achieving the Gold medal, and wrote down and organized how we are going to achieve each criteria.
