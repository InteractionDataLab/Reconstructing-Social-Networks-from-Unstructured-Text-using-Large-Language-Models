SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html," the cultures were split in two and 0.2 % glucose was added to one of each pair. Samples were obtained at time 0, before division of the cultures, and at 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min.   The resulting images revealed, that the inducer arabinose was required to stimulate expression of YFP, and that the addition of the repressor glucose to a uninduced culture had no effect. Furthermore, it was evident that addition of arabinose induced expression of YFP, and that subsequent addition of glucose terminated the pBAD regulated gene expression on a low copy vector, resulting in a reduced fluorescence level. 30 minutes after inhibition this reduction was already evident, and after 120 minutes the gene expression controlled by pBAD was even further decreased, as seen in Figure 19.
Figure 19. YFP fluorescence levels in E. coli MG1655 transformed with the pBAD-YFP reporter system on pSB3K3. Left: Cultures with the inducer arabinose added. Right: Cultures not induced with arabinose. Both cultures were split up at OD600=0.1, designated time 0, and the inhibitor glucose was added to one half of each culture. Images were obtained at 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes.
This experiment made it clear, that gene expression controlled by the pBAD promoter is both inducible and repressible as required when cloned into the low copy vector pSB3K3. Consequently, the pBAD promoter was found to be suitable for controlling gene expression of the antitoxin RelB in the implemented dormancy system.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds"

Korea_U_Seoul,2015,Team:Korea U Seoul#Project#Biological Background#content_-_-_TEXT.html,") Four path-scoring criteria
① NADH and NADPH
Like an ATP (adenosine triphosphate) which serves as a convenient and versatile storage in cells, NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) serve as activated carriers specialized in carrying high-energy electrons and hydrogen atoms.
The NAD + and NADH molecules are indistinguishable in structure to NADP + and NADPH, respectively, except the fact that the phosphate group is absent from the former. However, this small difference is crucial for their distinctive roles. Although the extra phosphate group on NADPH is located far away from the region involved in electron transfer (see Figure 1-b), it gives the molecule a slight difference in its shape from that of NADH, so NADPH and NADH bind to different sets of enzymes as substrates. Thus, the two types of carriers are used to transfer electrons (or hydride ions) between different sets of molecules. This role separation is crucial for organisms to regulate two sets of electron-transfer reactions independently. An NADPH operates mainly with enzymes that catalyze anabolic reactions, providing the high-energy electrons needed to synthesize energy-rich biological molecules. In contrast, an NADH has a special role as an intermediate in the catabolic system of reactions that generate ATP through the oxidation of compounds (Alberts B., et al. 2002).
Then, why should we focus on the larger amount of NADH and NADPH as products?
First, in the case of NADPH, it is the key for determining the efficiency of certain biosynthetic pathways. The oxidation during a pentose phosphorylation produces most NADPH which is needed in the biosynthesis of certain metabolites. Therefore, the carbon flow of the pentose phosphorylation path is considered to be the targets of metabolic engineering. For example, microorganisms found in the Corynebacterium genus, having enhanced L-ornithine production, not only activate pentose phosphate pathway but also increase the specific activities of G6PDH and 6PGD, which are enzymes related to the pentose phosphate pathway, by reducing or inactivating intrinsic GDH (glucose dehydrogenase). Consequently, the improved NADPH production makes L-ornithine yield to increase, which may have the possibility of being widely utilized for efficient and economical applications (Cho J., Ko Y. 2012). To summarize, if we find a"
Dundee,2016,Team:Dundee#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," the bacterial coatings had fully dried the inoculated feed was transferred back into a sterile 500ml screw top flask. To investigate the longevity of the product some of the feed was stored in the fridge for weekly testing and some was transferred to an anaerobic tube and stored under nitrogen also for weekly testing.
Weekly longevity testing
On a weekly basis a sample of the stored chicken feed was taken and vortexed in a constant volume of PBS. A 1ml sample of the liquid was transferred to an eppendorf tube and from here a tenfold serial dilution was carried six times of the stock solution and a 3ul aliquot of these dilutions plated out on the same plate. After growing the colonies overnight, a calculation was performed with the number of colonies present on the most dilute sample in order to obtain the cfu/g for the bacterial colonies. Through this method, we would be able to deduce the better method of storage for our product.
Killing experiments
To test if our product is capable of killing E.coli cells, 0.1% arabinose agar plates were made and MG1655 E.coli cells were grown until an absorbance of 0.1. 50ul of this culture was plated out and a coated feed pellet from each construct / strain pressed into the agar. This process was repeated with the slight alteration of mashing the pellet in LB before adding this to the plate.
When the bacterial coatings had fully dried the inoculated feed was transferred back into a sterile 500ml screw top flask. To investigate the longevity of the product some of the feed was stored in the fridge for weekly testing and some was transferred to an anaerobic tube and stored under nitrogen also for weekly testing.
Results
The following data was recorded over five weeks and used the methods described above to test the number of surviving cells on a weekly basis.
From here we could plot the data in order to obtain trends which would inform us about the ideal storage conditions for our construct.
Figure 1. Shows the survival of pcol Ia-ssp2 on coated feed, inoculated with 50 ml agar stored in the fridge and in nitrogen.
From the plot we can see that the number of cells in the construct stored in the fridge has a massive peak at week 4, this may be due to the presence of mould starting to grow on the product. The same construct stored in nitrogen had a much more constant level of cells and no mould was present in these conditions.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," with current diagnostic methods were also identified by doctors who completed our survey. Many patients have to undergo these tests - as there is no other way to rule out NSCLC. Although biopsy and CT scan would still be required to stage a tumor, our sensor could rule out cancer in many patients. Below are some of the problems with current diagnostic methods, and how our sensor be beneficial.
In our survey, all doctors agreed that new diagnostic methods were needed and that liquid biopsies could be more effective than current methods. We carried out research into current methods based off their concerns:
Attribution: NithinRao, in public domain
CT scanning is the best way of making an initial diagnosis of NSCLC. [9] It is more accurate than an X-ray and sputum cytology (examining coughed up mucus) - these have been shown to provide no benefit in screening and can increase false positive rates. [5] Sputum cytology is rarely used in the UK as it has low sensitivity with inconsistent results (although there is promise for the future [10] ). Further tests, such as ultrasound may be used to confirm the results of a CT, and repeat CT scanning is used to assess the growth of a tumor. PET-CT, ultrasound, MRI, bronchoscopy (with possible biopsy) and X-ray are performed for specific cases. [9]
However, CT scanning has its limitations as the initial diagnostic method. It is cumbersome as it requires specialist centers with immobile equipment. [8] The results of a CT scan are difficult to interpret; they are so sensitive that benign lesions are frequently picked up as CT scanning also cannot distinguish between benign nodules and those that will progress to be cancerous. [10] Repeat scans are then required to observe whether the lesion grows (and is therefore malignant) or is benign.
When low dose CT was trialed as a lung cancer screening program it caused high rates of false positives (see the screening section ). [2] . False positive CT scans then lead to unnecessary invasive procedures - like bronchoscopy or even surgery. [5] Furthermore, it takes up to two weeks to schedule a CT and the results from current tests scans can take a further week to come back in the UK. [11] CT scans for NSCLC are usually done with contrast - which needs to be injected - meaning the procedure is somewhat invasive. Furthermore, CT scans result in exposure to radiation which may increase the risk of cancer in the future [12] .
As a result, there is still a need for away to accurately screen high risk population groups "

Insights
We should choose a concrete application, because that sells much better and leads to better human practices.
We should try to center our Human Practices around our future application.
The safe use of GMOs on itself is already a relevant problem which we are aiming to tackle with our project.
We should contact as many experts and stakeholders as possible. Do potential users indeed need our product?
As an application, it could be interesting to improve on an old iGEM project.
Follow-up
We checked previous iGEM projects to see  which ones could have benefitted from our platform.
We searched for a concrete application of Gelcatraz, eventually leading to our focus on wound healing.

May 16, 2018. Meeting Prof. Dr. Patricia Dankers
As we had decided to develop a living material, we wanted to speak to an expert in the field of biomaterials to ask for some feedback on the design and explore possible applications. We therefore contacted professor Patricia Dankers, a professor in biomedical materials for regenerative medicine. We discussed our preliminary selection of dextran as our hydrogel. Prof. Dankers encouraged us to limit ourselves to this gel instead of also exploring other options, as dextran is known to have affinity for glucose and the production of multiple gels would be time-consuming.

May 16, 2018. Meeting Prof. Dr. Patricia Dankers
Regarding potential applications, Dankers recommended to make optimal use of the integrated bacteria by positioning the material on an organ (skin, heart, kidneys) and having them produce something. As examples, we discussed the cases of kidney failure and diabetic wounds. This was already the second time that we were recommended to look into wound infections as an application! She pointed our attention to the huge problem of skin infections which develop antibiotic resistance. According to Dankers, our patch would be very suitable for this purpose, as good bacteria could fight the bad ones. Alternatively, we could try to create a patch to sense kidney failure and secrete medicine in response. With both applications, we would make optimal use of the integrated bacteria by using their secretive powers.
Insights
Dextran is indeed a good choice of hydrogel considering its biocompatibility and affinity for glucose.

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#test#max#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"ase proteins leads to a dysfunctional or a ‘broken’ TCA-cycle, since malate cannot be formed anymore from fumarate. This impairs the efficiency of the TCA-cycle and the production of amino acids; since some amino acids are formed from TCA-cycle intermediates (Waegeman et al. , 2011) (Fig 1a). Team Amsterdam faced a similar problem and aimed  to incorporate a glyoxylate shunt into Synechocystis to increase fumarate production.  The glyoxylate shunt is composed of two enzymes, which are Malate Synthase and Isocitrate Lyase. They form a shortcut in the TCA-cycle (Fig. 1b).  In this way, the glyoxylate shunt restores some of the flux through part of the TCA-cycle, which should lead to a more efficient TCA-cycle. This is predicted to be beneficial for the cell in terms of fitness, as modelled by iGEM team Amsterdam.  For E.coli, a similar approach could be adopted, since E.coli can express the glyoxylate shunt genes to produce malate from isocitrate via glyoxylate. Thereby, in the process of producing malate, also succinate is formed. Because the cell can produce FADH2 by converting succinate to fumarate, the formed succinate will go to fumarate. In this way we are able to gain fitness and fumarate production, by having the glyoxylate shunt active.
Figure 1. The TCA-cycle with and without glyoxylate shunt. 1a). Fumarate is produced in a growth coupled way as a side product of arginine production. By knocking out fumarase, it cannot be degraded to malate. This way Fumarate accumulates. The TCA-cycle however is ‘broken’.1b). By expressing Malate Synthaese (MS) and Isocytrate Lyase (ICL), we can partly fix the ‘broken’ cycle. Now Isocitrate is made into both glyoxylate from which malate is synthesized and into succinate, which can be converted into fumarate. This way we have a better functioning cycle and more fumarate production thanks to the glyoxylate shunt.
However, when we look at the E. Coli physiology, the glyoxylate shunt genes are already present, but repressed by a repressor encoded by the iclR gene (Wa"

""easyFer"" (""easyIron"") is a system that uses an iron detecting biosensor to simplify the iron detection in the blood.
To begin with our investigations of the issues of communication, interaction and responsibility in scientific research, we began by surveying the general public. We designed a questionnaire and submitted it to passerbys in the streets of Lausanne and Basel (in collaboration with the ETHZ iGEM team). This enabled us to introduce synthetic biology to interested laymen. More importantly, it allowed us to identify the preconceptions people have about the scientific community.  Such viewpoints are not those we are often confronted with as scientific students. We also asked the young students that came to our highschool day to fill out the survey. Here is a summary of the survey and an analysis of the most interesting results. Results are plotted in absolute numbers of answers.
Public survey in Lausanne
On a sunny August morning, we held a stand in the Rue Haldimand of our beautiful town of Lausanne. Passerby came and went as they walked to and from the nearby market. Many of them were intrigued by our poster that asked “What is synthetic biology ? Give us your opinion !”. We submitted them our survey and took the opportunity to answer questions about synthetic biology, iGEM and our project. Over fifty people stopped by and talking with them was very enlightening !
We began by asking the subject whether he/she had ever heard about synthetic biology. If the answer was no, we provided him/her with the following Wikipedia definition: “Synthetic biology is a scientific field combining biology and engineering in order to  design and build (synthesize) new biologic systems and units”. Note that the definition does not mention the word GMO. This has its importance later on. The first answers we collected showed us that the term synthetic biology is mostly unheard of, though it mostly conveys a positive impression (see below).
Note: the following results are plotted in absolute number of answers
We then asked the subject whether this definition gave him/her a rather positive or negative feeling about synthetic biology. The answers were enthusiastic, with a vast majority of “rather positive”.
>One of the striking results of this survey came from one of the last questions of our survey: “What is your opinion on GMOs (or Genetically Modified Organisms)?”, to which we mostly got “Rather negative” as an answer.

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html," the day, not incubation times.
The is very good example of the light response element’s capabilities. The first measurement is taken right after the dilutions before the incubation in blue light. We notice the fluorescence is equal for each sample (blue line, 10:43). However, already after one hour of incubation (green, 11:53), we can see a clear response to incubation in blue light. Bacteria grown in low intensity have a much higher fluorescence level compared to the those grown in high intensity of blue light. The difference is over fourfold. We also note that the effect of light intensity to the fluorescence is nearly linear. However, the intensity  here is 10 base logarithm of the actual intensity value. This means that bacteria perceive light intensity logarithmically, that is, doubling the intensity value leads to weaker effects in higher values of intensity. We also need to take into account that the intensity level 0 is not comparable to the other values as the difference between darkness and very dim light was hard to evaluate at the logarithmic scale.
This means that bacteria perceive light intensity logarithmically.
When the incubation is continued (red and turqoise), the fluorescence also tend to increase at every point of measurement. The fluorescence at the highest blue light intensity increases but so does the fluorescence at the lowest intensity. In fact, they change at the same rate relative to each other so that the fourfold difference is maintained. This suggests that this change in fluorescence between the timepoints is caused by the growth of bacteria in the sample leading to a GFP expression multiplied by a scalar denoting the cell density. In other words, the effect of blue light on the single cell level may be constant after the second measurement. Therefore, the full response to blue light intensity may take place already between the first and second measurement. This would imply very fast response times.
However, we observe a great difference at the 5th timepoint (violet, 15:43) because the fluorescence rockets even at higher blue light intensities. This is due to batteries running low in our LED rig. Interestingly, this incident reveals some very interesting dynamics in our light response element. Clearly, the effect of the batteries running low has emerged after the measurement at 14 o'clock. Independently of the intensity, our light response element has achieved the same fluorescence values as the samples incubated in dark since the beginning. This has happened in a time shorter than one and half hours which is the time difference between the measurements. As the main component of the fluorescence is GFP-LVA, the samples incubated in bright"

The real-life introduction of iGEM projects into the environment is largely out of the scope. However, the role of the iGEM competition is to help advance the field of synthetic biology. By working towards ensuring the safety of systems or BioBricks and further developing systematic ways to gain confidence of engineered microorganisms, the iGEM competition can contribute to one of the field’s limiting factors.

On Friday June 24th and Saturday October 8th, Boston University hosted NEGEM (New England iGEM), a meetup for iGEM teams all across New England to gather and share their research work and their plans for the Human Practices and Policies portion of the competition. All of the teams in attendance were given 20 minutes to present their research project and their plans for their Human Practices and Policies. Every person in attendance was asked to fill out an evaluation form about the research, P&P, and presentation style for each team that presented. The questions ranged from “Is their idea well-motivated?” to suggestions on ways to integrate research with P&P to “Was the talk engaging?”. After the teams finished their presentations, other iGEMers, HQ representatives, and mentors asked the teams for clarification on their research, future plans for outreach, and some ethical implications of using their project. Both NEGEM meetups were great ways to meet local teams and learn about interesting new research projects."

NetLogo -- Light Control
The above picture is about the change of cell population with time, you can see that when I turn on the light, the population will decrease; when I turn off the light, the population will grow. So we can approximately get a conclusion that through light's control of cell movement, we can control the growing rate of the whole population.
How to explain this phenomenon in a cellular level? The light will inhabit cell's free moving, which prevent the cells from contacting the surface. And in fact, you can also observe the slight delay, which is a reasonable result considering the do many different states of cells.

ICA Oligo Characterization
The results from 6/3/2015 showed that C-cap could bind to MaSp2 CA.
We want to find out which sticky end the c-cap binds to.
If the C-sticky end is bound, then there should be no problem.
If the A-sticky end is bound, it could possibly interfere with ICA by competing with binding to MaSp2 AB.
We also decided to test the initiator and capping oligos again, but at a higher concentration.
We set up the following ligation reactions.
2 reactions each of BC+CA and CA+AB were set up using 50 ng of each fragment.
AB+Init and CA+Term were set up using 1 uL of 5 uM oligo in each.
Used T7 polymerase for all 6 reactions. Incubated for 10 minutes at 25 C.
After incubation, 1 uL of 5 uM working C-Cap was added to one BC+CA reaction and one CA+AB reaction each, and incubated for another 10 minutes at 25 C.
Results
Cast 2.5 % TAE gel for visualization, used 2 uL of 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 The BC+CA reactions with or without C-cap show no double band character at the 200 bp mark. The CA+AB+C-cap reactions exhibits a double band similar to the CA+C-cap reaction from 6/3/2015 . AB+init exhibits a band at approximately 160 bp. CA+term exhibits a band at approximately 140 bp.
From these results, we can conclude that C-cap binds to the C-sticky end, and not the A-sticky end. We will be able to proceed with ICA as planned.
The initiator and terminator work as intended. The expected band sizes are 161 bp and 141 bp respectively.
All bands smaller than 100 bp correspond to unligated oligos.

Le Plasmide antitumoral
Contexte
Dans le cancer du poumon non à petites cellules, ou NSCLC, comme dans tous cancers,  la perte de la capacité apoptotique des cellules tumorales est du à la perte fonctionnelle de divers suppresseurs de tumeur entrant dans la voie de signalisation de la cascade apoptotique.
L’application du DVS dans la lutte anti-cancer repose sur le fait de réactiver cette cascade apoptotique en apportant au sein des cellules tumorales une version wild-type des gènes codant la version saine des suppresseurs de tumeur non-fonctionnels.
C’est le projet COSMIC de l’institut Sanger qui nous a permis de déterminer quels gènes apporter au plasmide thérapeutique dans le cadre du cancer du poumon à non petites cellules. Ce projet répertorie en effet  toutes les mutations détectées  pour chaque type de cancers suivant leur fréquence d’apparition. Ainsi, d’après leurs données, la perte de la capacité apoptotique des cellules tumorales pour un cancer du poumon peut être du à la perte fonctionnelle des protéines issus des gènes suivant :
Ces différents gènes, jouant un rôle prépondérant dans la mise en place du processus apoptotique et étant les plus susceptibles d’avoir mutés dans le cadre d’un cancer du poumon, compose le plasmide thérapeutique .

Willkommen zu E.XPRESS3D
In diesem Jahr haben wir es uns zum Ziel gesetzt, einen durch Licht kontrollierten 3D-Drucker unter innovativer  Nutzung von Optogenetik zu entwickeln. In einem ersten Schritt wollen wir ein genetisches, logisches AND-gate entwickeln, welches durch Licht zweier unterschiedlicher Wellenlängen (z.B. blaues und rotes Licht) angeregt werden kann. Die Bakterien werden in einer transparenten Gelmatrix immobilisiert, in der sie ortspräzise stimuliert werden, wenn sie mit rotem und blauem Licht zur gleichen Zeit getroffen werden. Ist diese Bedingung erfüllt, wird Genexpression gestartet. Mit diesem System können verschiedene Genprodukte exprimiert werden.
Projektübersicht
Zu Beginn des Projektes überlegten wir uns viele kreative Lösungen, welche die Welt haben sollte, für die sie aber aus unserer Sicht noch nicht bereit ist. Folglich richteten wir unsere Aufmerksamkeit zu einem aktuelleren Thema: tissue-engineering, die künstliche Erschaffung von Gewebe. In diesem wissenschaftlichen Bereich ist ein drei-dimensionales Grundgerüst, an dem sich die Zellen anhaften können, neben anderen Sachen essentiell. Da die Erschaffung und Konstruktion dieser Matrizen immer noch ein Problem darstellt, werden neue Lösungen benötigt. Momentan arbeiten die meisten Ansätze mit Schichten (für Knochen und Knorpel), oder nutzen Nanofasern und Textiltechnologie zur Generierung eines Gerüstes [ 1 ].
Als wir uns dieses Problems annahmen, überlegten wir uns einen völlig neuen Ansatz zur Konstruktion drei-dimensionaler Strukturen. Was wäre, wenn wir Gewebe, Knochen und andere Substanzen einfach drucken könnten? Wie könnten wir das anstellen?
Wir kamen schließlich auf die Idee, etwas in der Richtung der Eingravierung in tiefere Schichten von Glasblöcken zu probieren. Doch anstatt kleine Glasstrukturen zu zerbre"

Eric’s talk on RCA/RCR - Rolling circle amplification, Rolling circle replication
A way for viruses to replicate their DNA, a compact way to replicate their dna needing only 1 strand of DNA.  Uses enzyme phi 29.  A way to produce lots of DNA at a low temperature.
Need a circle, need an initiation point (a single stranded circle), 529 will initiate this at the lesion in a double stranded DNA. Phi 29 has a fidelity for doing this that is unreplicated so far from bascillius setellus (???)
RCA is not old technology, it was developed to make copies, for Sanger sequencing.  To make a lot of copies of something that is a replication.  Make a copy of a whole circle, strand replace and start again making a new circle of DNA.  Pic of process - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_circle_replication.
For our process is to NOT use phi 29 to introduce mutagenesis.  
DNB is a DNA nanoball.
Eric today took M13 and put a nick in it to use it today.  MB-BSM1 is an asymmetric cutting enzyme and will make a nick in the DNA either top strand (MB is the bottom strand).  
Eric will post Protocol used for tonight.

Gradient PCR was ran on part A with lac_LVAR & lac_LVA_F as primers. 2,5 uL template & 31 uL water. Tm graient at 51-70 deg. with 5 samples. PCR program: 1: 98 deg., 2 min. 2: 98 deg., 10 sec. 3: 51-70 deg., 30 sec. 4: 72 deg., 45 sec. 5: GO TO 2 rep 30. 6: 72 deg., 5 min. After running the PCR on a gel, no clear, correct bands showed. This was due to the primers, which had a too high concentration, thus they were diluted.
After the dilution, a touch down PCR was made, starting at 66 deg. going 1 deg. lower per cycle for 10 cycles, thus ending at 56 deg. A gel showed a clear band with the correct bands. In order for us to have a high enough concentration of PCR1 & PCR2 for ligation, we ran a PCR with the program: 1:98 deg., 2 min. 2: 98 deg., 10 sec. 3: 50 deg., 30 sec. 4: 72 deg., 2 sec. 5: GO TO 2 rep 30. 6: 72 deg., 5 min.
after running a gel with the PCR products, bands showed with the wrong lenghts that wasn't religation. Thus we concluded that the PCR1 and PCR2 used was incorrect.
Due to this, we ran a PCR on all of our PCR1,2,3 products with verification primers, to check wether they had the correct lengths, which they luckily had.

What We Do
The  burning  of  fossil  fuels  generates  greenhouse  gases  that  are  damaging  the  atmosphere  and  impacting  the  global  environment.  Energy  from  sustainable  sources  such  as  wind  and  solar  is  difficult  to  store  for  times  when  the  wind  is  not  blowing  or  the  sun  is  not  shining.
In  order  to  build  a  sustainable  energy  source  for  energy  on  demand  we  are  creating  a  system  using  living  organisms.  E.  coli  will  be  engineered  to  synthesize  lactate  which  will  then  be  used  to  feed  a  Shewanella  biofilm.  Shewanella  is  a  bacteria  that  can  transfer  electrons  to  a  cathode  and  produce  a  current  to  light  a  bulb.  The  community  will  be  involved  through  a  DNA  Code  Game  designed  for  middle  and  elementary  school  students  to  raise  awareness  of  synthetic  biology  and  iGEM.

Amsterdam,2015,Team:Amsterdam#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," example: say there are two options for engineering Synechocystis such that it produces carbon compounds on which a chemotroph like E. coli can thrive: 1) via several inserts of foreign genes that allow, through multiple steps, for the accumulation of a sugar, including a gene encoding for a transporter needed to transport the sugar to the extracellular environment, or 2) via a knock-out that leads to the accumulation of sugars that can naturally diffuse through the cell wall. Both are viable and explored options in Synechocystis, but only the second of these is likely not to lead to scale-up problems in the real world. After all, mutations in the foreign genes, bound to occur, would increase the fitness of those strains, quickly resulting in a population in which the insertions are outcompeted in the relentless struggle for optimal growth. A knockout, however, cannot be undone by a simple mutation, and is therefore likely to be significantly more stable in terms of productive capacity as a function of time.
This might sound straightforward, but is an integral part of the aforementioned elephant in the room. And there is a way to take this one step further: by finding target metabolites (i.e. carbon compounds that can be shared and used by E. coli) whose production is directly coupled to biomass formation, we can essentially avoid the fitness pressure that leads to the collapse of other constructs. Another example is in order: the formation of biomass includes several steps in which metabolites are recycled, i.e. they are formed as a side-product of a biomass-formation reaction, and are later converted back to their original form to be used again. If the recycling step of such a process is knocked out, the side-product, which should of course be non-toxic, accumulates. And since the accumulation of side-product is directly coupled to the formation of biomass, there is much less fitness pressure to remove the genetic alterations in order to optimize biomass production, as the genetic alterations are part of biomass formation itself. In fact, any genetic tweaks adopted by Synechocystis in order increase growth rate will, due to this direct coupling, lead to a direct increase in the yield of the desired product as well.  These design considerations, and their potential benefits in large-scale biorefinery applications, led us to focus on exactly the type of growth-coupled genetic alterations outlined above, resulting in a stable Synechocystis strain that accumulates and naturally exports acetate, which can in turn be used by E. coli for biomass and product formation.

My name is Weihan Li, and I am a year 2 undergraduate student from the physics department of Hong Kong Baptist University. I have been an undergraduate research assistant, under the supervision of Prof Leihan Tang, in Condenced Matter Theory and Biophysics Lab for over 1 year and a half. My research mainly aimed at quantatively understanding biological processes, especially metabolism. Attending different conferences and symposiums on synthetic biology, system biology and physics also opened my eyes. I also had the honor to give a 20-minute academic repeort, titled Biological Network Analysis: on oscillation and synchronization, on the International Conference on Complexity and Disciplinary Sciences, which is an encouragement and also a good start for me. In this iGEM project, we worked as a team to realize our dreams to engineer something we always long for with the help of bacteria. I am glad to be a part of the team where I gained not only the knowledge and the valuable wet lab experience, but also the precious friendship. I believe this iGEM project will be a great treasure through out my life!
LI Yan Lin Jubi
hailing from Hong Kong, is a second-year undergraduate reading medicine and surgery. He joined the iGEM team primarily because he sees synthetic biology as a powerful tool for inventing novel therapeutic strategies.
He has thus far taken up three roles in the competition: firstly as fund-raising manager, then as group leader of the Che-Z knockout (2443ompT) team, and now as leader of the Human Practices Advance team. Moreover, as one of the only two clinicians around (alas!), he is also responsible for imagining – and developing – the potential clinical applications of the Bacto-Motor.
Outside medicine, his other academic interests include philosophy, politics and economics and he has represented both Hong Kong and HKU at international debating competitions, advancing to the Octo-Finals of the Worlds Schools Washington DC in 2008. He is also editor-in-chief of Caduceus, the official journal of the Undergraduate Medical Society. While not preoccupied by other tasks, he enjoys classical music, jogging, table tennis and banter – where everybody gets a good laugh :)

While we were constructing our BioBricks™, we realized there was a problem because the insert wasn't ligating to pSB1C3. Everything seemed correct in the transformation protocol, but once the DNA was visualized on an agarose gel our insert was missing and only pSB1C3 was evident. We then thought there was a problem during ligation. Therefore, we analyzed IDT’s synthesized sequence and identified that there were missing additional base pairs that flanked the restriction site so that the enzyme could properly cling and cut the sequence. This issue was troubleshot with the TecCEM iGEM team. They had the great idea to create primers that add six base pairs before the prefix and after the suffix thereupon amplifying the gene of interest. This collaboration was crucial for the construction of our BioBricks. Read the entire collaboration.
Figure 1. Apidaecin, abaecin and defensin 1 amplified with TecCEM’s iGEM team primers.
BioBrick assembly
The three composites of our creation, apidaecin - [BBa_K2834003] , defensin 1 - [BBa_K2834005] , and abaecin - [BBa_K2834006] were characterized with the intention of expressing the peptides in E. coli BL21 (DE3) by IPTG induction. Its antimicrobial activity was evaluated against Gram-positive bacteria with antibiotic susceptibility testing by measuring OD600 in broth.
The three composites were synthesized by IDT® with the prefix and suffix flanking the region of interest. The final parts resulted in a sequence of 310 bp for apidaecin, 415 bp for defensin 1, and 361 bp for abaecin. Once the synthesis arrived, and the PCR was carried out, double digestion with EcoRI-HF and PstI restriction enzymes was made to each composite, and the chloramphenicol linearized plasmid backbone (pSB1C3) for following ligation of the backbone with each one of the fragments. This resulted"

After the adjustment, if we do not count ‘High school’ as a scientific research track, then the Top 3 list is as shown in the table below. Year Track Number of times to enter Top 3 2009-2013 Foundational Research 5  Enviroment 4  Health 3  New application 3 2014-2018 Enviroment 5  Health & Medicine+ Therapeutics 4  Foundational Research 3  New application 2 Total Enviroment 9  Foundational Research 8  Health & Medicine+ Therapeutics 7  New application 5 Table 1 shows the top three tracks that are most popular among the participating teams in 10 years. We find that in 2009-2018, iGEM's participating teams are more concerned with the four aspects of Environment, Foundational Research, Health & Medicine, and New application. This implies that environmental pollution and health care are still the most popular issues in the world. It is worth noting that compared with 2009, the choice of track in 2018 is more diversified, and the track of ‘Art & Design’ and other humanities and social sciences has received enough attention.   Figure4.A   Figure4.B Figure4.A, B show the academic background of the participants. Different colors of columns represent different subjects. We obtained information about the participants’ academic background by counting the Wiki of each team. It should be noted that since many teams do not introduce the academic background of the team members, we have not been able to record the subject information of each individual.  Judging from the information we recorded, the number of players participating each year has gradually increased. Among them, members from Biology & Health Science accounts for the majority, followed by Multidisciplinary and Computer & Engineering. In particular, compared to 2007, the academic background of the contestants in 2016 is more diverse. Other than this, every year, in addition to members of other natural sciences from mathematics, physics, chemistry, environment, etc., there are also members from the social sciences and humanities. We believe that iGEM is playing an increasingly important role in promoting multidisciplinary communication and promoting engineering in the field of synthetic biology.

Finally, Jana (Alejandra) and Iván, our engineers, joined the team along with an army of new instructors and advisors (One of them, Yadira, is in this team photo too). Now, we are a team made of people from very different backgrounds working together to create our amazing Sexy Plant. We love what we are doing and we are going to rock this contest.
After a team meeting in July the students went to have lunch together near the engineer’s headquarters at the end of our university campus. It was around 3 pm, close to 40 Celsius degrees outside and extremely humid atmosphere when we finished having lunch and we realized that we didn’t want to sweat to dead. The biotechnologist of the team had to go back to the laboratory, which is about 20 minutes walking away from the restaurant, too long for walking in the sun in that weather. So we made our way to the laboratory crossing all the buildings with air conditioning we could find in our way, and resting in them for some minutes so we could cool down a little bit. So we turned a 20 minutes walk into a 1 hour expedition through buildings we had never been in during all these years studying in our university.

ABOUT OUR TEAM
The Stanford-Brown-Spelman team is entering it’s fourth year of participation in the iGEM competition. Partnered with the NASA Ames research center, the team focuses on issues related to astrobiology and aerial technologies. They enjoy spending their time soaking up the California sun, eating lots of good food, and of course, pipetting.
Meet Jotthe. Although she may be the tiniest (or as she would say tinniest) member of our team, her many contributions and accomplishments would indicate otherwise. Jotthe enjoys baking, dancing, scheduling appointments to finally get her driver’s license, and of course, long walks on the beach. She also loves sharing pictures of her 15 month old nephew, discussing flag code, and drowning her quesadillas in hot sauce to mask the flavor of cheese. Although she despises the texture of cheese, Burrito Wednesday is quite possibly her favorite day to buy lunch in the cafeteria. As you can see, Jotthe is an intelligent, beautiful, and versatile bioengineer. With her unique"

As shown by the agarose gel, instead of a clean band around 6000kbs as expected we observed multiple bands that were below 500kbs.
Looking Forward...
A general limitation of PCR is its inability to amplify fragments larger than 3kb. We are hoping to use two troubleshooting techniques to overcome this barrier. The first is to adopt the PCR protocol utilized by Ponce et al. to amplify DNA fragments of 6kp (1992). If this was unsuccessful, the second would be to design primers for three groups of genes and amplify them separately. These genes will be ligated in to a single plasmid and will be transformed in to the Escherichia coli strain DH5α as a primary propagation host. Afterwards, using a plasmid mini preparation kit, the plasmids would be purified. The purified plasmids would be transformed in to the cyanobacteria strain PCC 6803.

Sir Tox maakt een toxine aan, Lady Detox een anti-toxine, Miss Daisy verspreid een bloemetjesgeur waarmee ze haar tegenstander verleidt en zo op de knieën krijgt
ik geloof dat er predator-prey systemen zijn in vorige iGEM jaren waar we misschien wat inspiratie uit kunnen halen

Prepare the fluorescein stock solution:
◻ Spin down fluorescein stock tube to make sure pellet is at the bottom of tube. ◻ Prepare 2x fluorescein stock solution (100 µM) by resuspending fluorescein in 1mL of 1xPBS. [Note: it is important that the fluorescein is properly dissolved. To check this, after the resuspension you should pipette up and down and examine the solution in the pipette tip – if any particulates are visible in the pipette tip continue to mix the solution until they disappear.] ◻ Dilute the 2x fluorescein stock solution with 1xPBS to make a 1x fluorescein solution and resulting concentration of fluorescein stock solution 50 µM (500µL of 2x fluorescein in 500 µL 1x PBS will make 1 mL of 50 µM (1x) fluorescein solution.)

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 7_-_-_TEXT.html," following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch BBa_K911001
As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.

Procedure:
4-Iodo-1-nitrobenzen (3,991 g; 16,03 mmol) was dissolved in 120 mL 2-methoxyethanol. Zn           dust (2,388 g; 36,52 mmol) and NH4Cl (1,386 g; 25,91 mmol) was added and the reaction           mixture was stirred at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by TLC (5:1           hexanes/EtOAc). After 30 minutes the solution was cooled to 0°C. FeCl3 × 6 H2O (13,108 g;           48,49 mmol) was solved in 144 mL H2O/EtOH (5:1) and added to the reaction mixture which           then was stirred 3 hours at 0°C. Following the reaction mixture was extracted with EtOAc,           washed with brine and dried over MgSO4. The yielded solution was concentrated under           reduced pressure and purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexanes/EtOAc, 50:1).           The solvent was removed and the product 4-iodo-1-nitrosobenzen (0,541 g; 2,3 mmol;           14%) was received as a green solid.

Figure 13. Fluorescence measurements of K1783003 (Hok-Sok+Constitutive unstable RFP) in BL21 cells grown in media without antibiotic.
Analysis of Fluorescence Loss
Over time, colonies appear to stop producing RFP.
This effect occurs even when the culture is under chloramphenicol pressure.
This effect occurs much more slowly when the Hok-Sok cassette is adjacent to the RFP construct.
With or without added chloramphenicol, Hok-Sok appears to be able to maintain a relatively constant level of fluorescence.
Figure . Representative gram stain of culture. Gram staining of our samples confirms that our samples are gram-negative bacilli, making it highly unlikely that our cultures have been contaminated.
Sequence Analysis
Top right bands of above gel are of negative control in DH5-alpha. They demonstrate that the cells no longer have the plasmid of interest. Gels generally show that plasmids are kept whenever a form of pressure is placed on the cell. Why then, is RFP not being expressed? Our sequencing results showed random mutations in the promoter and coding region of the RFP construct. This is a valuable lesson that, with any BioBrick construct, mutations and evolution is inevitable. However, plasmids that were maintained with Hok-Sok alone (no chloramphenicol) did not display mutations in the RFP construct. The large difference in protein expression over multiple days, as shown by our fluorescence and plating tests, suggests to us that the presence of Hok-Sok, combined with the absence of chloramphenicol pressure, is putting a smaller evolutionary pressure on the  bacterium.
Conclusions and Future Plans
Conclusion
Through our plating tests and fluorescence measurements, we were able to successfully observe the plasmid maintenance ability of the Hok-Sok system. In comparison to a negative control grown without chloramphenicol pressure, cells containing Hok-Sok were able to maintain their antibiotic resistance for a significant period of time, as shown from our plating tests. In addition, we noted the ability of Hok-Sok had a negative effect on protein production, as shown from our fluorescence study. However, this level of production was consistent over a long period of time, contrasting with traditional pressure systems where mutations were able to build up quickly, shutting down production of RFP, which has no biological usefulness for the cell. We thus suggest that the downregulation of RFP production via Hok-Sok is capable of decreasing the evolutionary pressure against the removal on non-essential genes. This effect will be further studied in"

SDU-Denmark,2014,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour21_-_-_TEXT.html," 2010. Vol. 91: p. 11-12. (Link) Figure 5 shows that many countries in Africa, South-East Asia and Latin America have a daily intake of less than 20 % fats, while other countries, like USA, UK and France have a intake higher than 35 %.
It is important to note that even if the dietary ratio between carbohydrates, proteins and fats is as recommended, people may still not eat enough calories per day, and therefore still be undernourished. As an example, Congo has a distribution of 80% carbohydrates, 14% fats, and 6% protein. This shows that people in Congo eat comparatively too much carbohydrates, and insufficient amounts of protein and fats.  In contrast, USA has a contribution of 49% carbohydrates, 38% fats, and 12% protein. This contribution  has too little carbohydrates and way too many fats, and as mentioned above, even a harmful amount of fats.  But as in Congo, people in USA eat very little protein which is fairly poor.
Overall, the three figures show that many countries in Africa, South-East Asia, and Latin America have  carbohydrates as their primary food source, while they eat too little protein and fats compared to the  recommended amount. This might be because of their low income, as carbohydrates are less expensive and  often the only available food source. Source: FAO: Chapter 7 - Food, nutrients and diets. (Link)
In contrast, high-income countries that have access to all food sources also have a wrong composition of  carbohydrates, proteins and fats. It is unknown why people who have the choice, don’t eat the recommended amount of the food sources. It might be that these people don’t spend much time on cooking and make the easy choice of eating  fast food instead, which is rich in fats.
Developing countries have many problems with undernourishment, but the entire world has a problem  with malnourishment.

Results
Cast a 1.8% TAE gel to visualize results. We ran at 140 V for 1 hr 15 min. Used 2 uL of NEB 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 VF/R amplified MaSp AB, BC, CA was digested with BsaI as detailed above. The 443 bp band corresponds to undigested fragments. The 184 and 150 bp bands correspond to residual bands from either side of the desired MaSp sequence. The 102 bp band is the desired product with our engineered sticky ends.
The 443 bp band is rather prominent, it seems that digesting 1.5 ug of VF/R amplified plasmid is too much for BsaI to completely digest.
Gel extracted the 102 bp bands using Qiagen columns with the following yields:

Safety Practices
Safety and security were of our top care during the design and execution of our project, our plan and activities went through several changes and validations to ensure it had met the safety requirements of the university as well as the iGEM organizations.
Safety of Our Project
Before releasing works, we had made sure our operations met all the safety requirements and granted by the University. The University of Edinburgh Biological Safety Committee had created a safe system that would allow us to achieve our goals. For each of us, basic steps of individual project started with gene amplification, and went for cutting-and-ligating, then went for transforming into E. coli and went for bacterial culturing.
Compositions for plasmids constructing and parts building were partly from iGEM 2018 distribution kits with valid registry numbers, for example, we used the plasmid backbone pSB3T5 and pSB1C3, the previous parts BBa_K1149051, the rest gene fragments came from PCR or Gibson assemblies, which are native in E. coli DH5a and were transformed into E. coli BL21DE3. These strains are not harmful to humans and the environmental risk of them is low. The disposal of the cultures and any other related materials were carried following the School indications (e.g. autoclaving). Furthermore, the final product of the biosynthesis was purified and sterilised, therefore does not represent a risk.
Here, we are not only supposed to consider the safety and security issues related to us but more of thinking risks to the community and environment. We needed to think about the risks throughout our project and revisit those issues from time to time. Everyone, people and teams involved in iGEM should take responsibility to the projects, by referring to the iGEM Safety page to understand the policy and rules of iGEM.

Need to do this for gene expression: DspB-DspA contained in the pSB1C3 backbone, was extracted via Miniprep. The NcoI restriction site was introduced upstream of each of our gene sequences (except BBa_K1659501 and BBa_K1659601) via PCR to facilitate their insertion into the arabinose-inducible pBAD/HisB commercial expression vector, and the insert-containing expression vectors were subsequently cloned separately into the standard laboratory E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 as well as a chemotaxis knockout strain E. coli RP437 ∆FliC.

Colony PCR
A colony PCR on the TAT CCP (N-version) was performed as the result from the last gel electrophoresis (insert date) was just a smear on almost all bands. The reason was most probably too much genomic DNA (too much colony picked), so less of the colonies was picked and the final volume was increased from 25 µl to 50 µl.
A colony PCR on the LMWP CCP (N- & C-version) was performed as the result from Mimmis gel electrophoresis was just empty bands (insert date).
TAT: colonies #1-41 +insert, #42-43 -insert.
LMWP: colonies #1 -insert, #3-24 +insert.

After reviewing our current information, we concluded that:
1. PR has to do research to understand where TCDD is located and considered a problem to guess which companies and organizations will be contacted for support.
2. Write a scheme of our proposed solution for marketing reasons (just the idea, not much details, focus on problem and end results). Magnify the problem (it`s around the world, show a lot of research that support that, how bad it is for human health and environment). Show a simple figure of how the solution works.
3. PR team should contact Berta and arrange a meeting to regulate the donation searching prosses.
4. We should find a reductase in yeast cell for the cyp metabolic pathway. Plus we should look at people who tried to express this kind of enzymes in general in yeasts and see what they did and what worked best.
5. We should also look how the fungi extract the enzymes.
Organizations that popped up during the meeting:

Team Meeting about the Enzymatic Pathways.
We discussed the first enzymatic pathway that we found in the literture.
- For now we concluded that we need a reductase for NADPH to recycle the prosses.
- We can degrade the tetra to tri, there are a few enzymes that we can add to degrade the tri (including other mutations of cyp1a1.
- There is a site called ""addgene"" that cells plasmids and viruses so we might find what we need there.
- We might try to send the cyp crystallography to Weizmann to analyze it and improve it.
- We should find a candidate with the most structural information and send it to them.
- We should choose one of the cyps that we think that might work for us, find structural information and send it to Weizmann and try to improve its specificity to TCDD and maybe even degrade it further then triCDD.
Asaf presented his idea for experiments:

Design - Chassis
We chose Bacillus subtilis - a model Gram-positive bacterial species often used in laboratory study - as our chassis. It is ideal as a base for designing mechanisms to fulfill our project aims for reasons we mention below.
Safety.
The safety issues concerning synthetic biology are numerous, particularly when it comes to the area of medical treatment. To reduce the chance of recombinant bacteria causing harm, synthetic biologists try to develop and utilize solutions that minimize the potential hazards of their products. Regarding safety issues, we the HKUST iGEM 2012 team chose to use B. subtilis, a non-pathogenic chassis.
Low degree of virulence.
As a natural member of the human gut microbiome, B. subtilis is considered to be non-pathogenic to humans. There are very few cases of humans being infected by B. subtilis, and of those who have been infected the vast majority had severe immune deficiency. According to Edberg (Edberg 1991), B. subtilis does not produce significant quantities of extracellular enzymes or possess other virulence factors that would predispose it to cause infection. In other word, B. subtilis possesses low virulence to humans and has a low risk of adverse effects to human health.
Establishment of integration vectors.
The discovery of natural integration in B. subtilis raised great attention in the field of molecular genetics in 1978. A series of integration vectors for B. subtilis were designed later for different purposes. For our project we employed an integration vector not only for its stability in B. subtilis, but also its advantages in safety. The employment of the integration vector to some extent minimizes the risk of antibiotic resistance spreading within the normal flora in gut. In addition, since the exposure of BMP2 to normal tissues can induce adverse effects, integrating target genes into the genome can reduce the"
Austin_UTexas,2018,Team:Austin UTexas#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," which assemblies were successfully transformed. This can be visualized in the far-right plate, featuring both E2-crimson (red) and GFP (green) colonies.
At the core of the Broad Host Range Kit is the One Tube Method of testing plasmids in a host bacteria. The One Tube Method involves transforming multiple assemblies at once in a single reaction. The majority of people who get our kit will begin their experiments transforming a mixture of all the plasmids, testing the origins of replication, into a sample of their host bacteria. The idea is that through selective plating and use of visual reporters, researchers will quickly be able to determine which origins of replication work in the non-model organisms. This is the first step in building a plasmid to genetically engineer an organism. Results will be confirmed by one of two ways: assessing the phenotype produced by the reporter gene or sequencing at the barcode region. The reporter is either a specific fluorescent protein or chromoprotein, and each color designates a particular origin of replication. At the DNA level, a unique, non-coding Barcode sequence does the same thing, specifying which origin is present. We created our one tube mixture of initial assemblies by calculating equimolar concentrations.
Figure 4: Collaboration with Rice University — One Tube Reactions. The plates above represent Rice’s attempts to utilize the one tube reactions. As seen in Figure 3, the plates exhibit multiple phenotypes implying that multiple assemblies have been successfully transformed. As in Figure 3, E. coli was plated onto LB plates with varying antibiotics.
Figure 3 represents our first successful trials to see if the one tube method would work. The first mixture had 8 different assemblies (refer to Table 1 in the Results - Assembly Plasmids page for the 8 assemblies) and bacteria transformed with it was plated on 4 different plates, each with a different antibiotic to select for E. coli containing a plasmid with the corresponding antibiotic resistance. The p15a and pMB1 origins have each been paired with a green fluorescent protein in this example, while the pAMB1 origin is paired with E2 crimson, which appears black in normal light and red under UV. This mixture is a preliminary version of what the one tube reaction in our kit will contain, and tests the methodology of combining all plasmids, rather than segregating by antibiotic resistance. E. coli only grew with active reporter genes on the KAN and CAM plates, although there should have been growth also on the CRB and TET plates. We believe we did not see growth on CRB and TET because the DNA concentration"

Aim: picking of clones for a 2 l expression experiment 2 clones of S. cerevisiae containing citrus limonene synthase (mit consensus sequence) were picked from the plate Andrea 29 (22.08.) and resuspended in 100 ml SCU medium + glucose
Vectorfragmentation of structural genes of Xanthohumol
Investigator: Ingmar
Aim of the experiment: The detection of our desired proteins via western blot failed three times. To rule out that recombinations of vector elements did take place, the vector backbone of our gene constructs and of a pYes vector from the limonengroup containing a gene insert whose protein could be detected via western blot was fragmented and the fragmentation patterns were compared.

Gel picture of vectorfragmentation 2
The fragmentation pattern does not show unexpeted bonds. Therefore the gene constructs might have some point mutations which are not visible via Agarose gel electrophoresis. As the transformation of yeast with our constructs resulted in a reasonable number of cfu, it is likely that the URA3 gene and the 2µOri are not affected by possible mutations. Thats why we will continue our work with sequencing our gene constructs including their respective promoters.

Then the protocol ""Plasmid DNA Purification Using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and a Microcentrifuge"" was followed for all of them. .Each was eluted with 50uL and nanodropped. The result was 5.1ng/uL. So we inoculated UV+pSB1C3 #6 in 50mL of SOC and chlor.   10 colonies from the HSP+input backbone (pSB1C3) were colony PCRed. A poke of one colony was mixed in with 200uL of water, vortexed and 20uL of this was used for PCR with 2.5uL each of the forward and reverse 10X sequencing primers.   Two 1.2% gels were poured.  UV and GFP g-blocks were digested with KpnI and XhoI. 3uL of each (around 600ng) were digested with 1uL of each enzyme, 3uL buffer, and water up to a total volume of 30uL. This was digested for 1 hour. Then heat inactivated for 5 minutes. Professor Medvedik purified it.   7/9/14: (Devora)  We used the 2 1.2% gels to run the 10 HSP with the insert backbone colonies that we chose. The annotated gels are posted in an experiment. It seems that there were at least 6 colonies that had the insert so we chose colonies 1 and 2 and inoculated overnight them to be mini prepped tomorrow.   We also mini prepped the UV+pSB1C3 colony 6. There was one tube that had a crack so we had to get rid of it and then some of the white chunky stuff fell into one of the spin column so there was assumed to be a lower yield then there should have been. We also realized that the PE buffer that we had been using never had the ethanol added to it, which could be why all of our other mini preps were not going well. The plasmids were combined and it was nanodropped, showing 43.8 ng/uL of plasmid and we have 150 uL of it (because we had 3 spin columns and eluted with 50 uL).

. Therefore, in our experiment, the prospecting result of getting target strains is also \frac{1}{16}
.
The ideal result
Therefore, the overall probability of getting the target strain is: (accurate rate of manual operation ) * (plasmid expression rate) * ( F2 stable expression rate ) * 100% = 60% * 10% * \frac{1}{16}
*100% = 0.004.
Fig 2.1  The possibility of target strains by Mendel's laws
The effect of crossing over
However, this probability does not consider the chance of crossing over. Crossing over is the exchange of genetic materials between homologous chromosomes and results in recombinant chromosomes during sexual reproduction. [2] Therefore, crossing over may affect the rate of stable inheritance by exchanging genetic materials. According to the formula, the rate of crossing over is: (numbers of recombinant genotype offspring)/(numbers of total offspring)*100%
Therefore, the possible rate of crossing over in our experiment is: \frac{10}{354}
=\frac{5}{177}
And the final rate is : 0.004*(1-\frac{5}{177}
)=\frac{86}{22125}
=0.3%
\0.004\times ( 1-frac{5}{177} )=\frac{86}{22125}=0.3 \times
The fitness of our model with our real data
Based on our model, we calculate the probability of getting the genetic stable worms in order to precisely implement our experiments. More importantly, our modeling reliability has been tested and confirmed by comparing the calculated result with raw results from the experiments. 1) The rate of miniMos injection is about 6%, that is six worms with correct insertions within 100 worms. And in reality, we actually obey this probability. In our project, we injected about 500 worms in total, and finally got about 25 worms with expected insertions.  2) The probability of getting stable inheritance F2 is \frac{1}{16}
in theory, and we found 2 plates of worms showed both GFP and RFP at the site of neurons among 40 F2.  Overall, these results showed that our model is a good guidance to explain our results, it is feasible.

For bees, once removed from the colony the bees (contaminated with mites) are then placed in hard-walled tubes in the field and sealed before being transported from the hive to the University. The bees remain in these sealed tubes for the duration of all testing. Bees are fed sugar water laced with E. coli containing our Oxalic acid producing part. The Bees will then be visually inspected for mite infections. Mites are obligate parasites of Bees and all colonies have some level of mite infection.

It is imperative as synthetic biologists, we spread word about our ever growing field to others. As a part of our human practices work, we decided to educate students of various colleges, for which we visited and gave talks about synthetic biology and our project at the A.C.Tech campus of Anna University, Sankara College in Kancheepuram and Sri Ramachandra Medical College to a total of 280 students.
A presentation was give to undergraduate and graduate biotechnology, food technology and bioinformatics students to enlighten them about the basics of synthetic biology and also about our project. To analyze the knowledge gained by the students we issued questionnaires before and after the presentation.
The students were informed about the iGEM foundation, its multifaceted programs and values. As the students knew the basics of Genetic Engineering we were able to explain in detail to them about the intricacies of iGEM, the registry of standard biological parts and synthetic biology. Our project was also explained in detail and students understood our plasmid constructs and how we incorporated a part of a previous iGEM teams project(Groningen 2012) into ours, reinforcing how iGEM is open sourced and teams build on other teams projects.
The pre and post presentation questionnaires were analyzed and it was found that there was a significant increase in the knowledge the students had about synthetic biology and antimicrobial peptides. The questions in the questionnaire were segregated and grouped under 5 areas. Accordingly, a pie chart was made to analyse the knowledge of students before and after the presentation.
