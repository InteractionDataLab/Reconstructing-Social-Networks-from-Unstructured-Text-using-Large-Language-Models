First, we transformed the constructs Psuc2-mOrange-pTUM100 and Panb1-mOrange-pTUM100 in w303. The promoter activity was analysed in fluorescence microscopy and using the plate reader. The activity equals 3.8% of Padh1 activity for Psuc2 and 1.9% of Padh1 activity for Panb1. The maximal activity of these promotors also limits the maximal reporter expression and therefore also the sensitivity of the measurement system. Thus, a higher promoter activity was desirable.
Next, we investigated which other factors influence the promoter activity, especially the intrinsic repressor level. Therefore, we transformed the same constructs in mutant yeast strains with deficient rox1 (YPR065W) or mig1 (systematic gene name: YGL035C), see fig. 7 + 8. The promoter activity was enhanced by a factor of 2.6 for Psuc2 and 13.8 for Panb1. We therefore intend to implement our system in these deficient strains allowing higher reporter expression levels. Furthermore, the function of MIG1 in glucose repression is well described (Santangelo, 2006). We observed an increase in promotor activity upon changing the medium from SC-Ura (2% glucose) to SC-Ura (2% galactose) for wt as well as the Mig deficient strain (fig. 9 + 10). This effect has to be considered if we intend to use Psuc2 together with a GAL-promotoer in further characterization.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time"

Modification of Corynebacteria to Treat Body Odor
Hirus is an achromatic genetic disease which is disturbing. The sweat of Suffer is odorless before been processed by bacterium. It is  reported the chemical that contributes absolutely most to the odor is E-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid，E-3M2H, which combines with apoproteins before secretion. When catalyzed by a specific aminoacylase from Corynebacteria.sp, E-3M2H is free again and volatile. The project is to knock out the gene corresponding to the enzyme by Crispr/cas9 system. The modified bacteria will be transplant in the axilla of suffers. What’s more, we replace the carrier up taking glucose for the carrier up taking fatty acids to increase its competence in the axilla and avoid diffusion.
For there is CRISPR system in Corynebacteria in natural. We plan to introduce sequences from that enzyme as spacers of CRISPR system in Corynebacteria.sp to put an end to the regaining of the gene.

to Release Lactase to Treat Lactose Intolerance
Lactose intolerance is often caused by the lack of lactase in the small intestine mucosa, leading to dyspepsia and malabsorption of lactose. Clinical symptoms include abdominal distention, diarrhea, abdominal pain, etc. Chinese severely lack lactase, and lactose intolerance is relatively common, bringing great suffering to patients’ life.
At present the treatments of lactose intolerance are to reduce the lactose intake, to add lactase long-term, and to give probiotic products, which are not able to achieve sustainable and effective results.
To solve above problems, we propose using genetic engineering technology, transmitting plasmids carrying a lactase gene and a suicide gene into E. coli K12 strains. Patients take genetically modified strains of the bacterium orally. It produces"

Studies have found that HBP and HBPS in 4S pathway have majot inhibition effect on Dsz enzymes. HBP strongly inhibits the activity of enzyme DszA DszB and DszC; HBPS has certain inhibition effect on enzyme DszC, but only in the early stages in the BDS. The reason is that, when the concentration of HBP increases, the inhibition of HBP will become the major one. And some researchers have found that enzyme DszC is inhibited by HBP and HBPS noncompetitively, and the substrate DBT also has certain inhibition effect on enzyme DszC. Due to the limited high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detector resolution, the mechanisms of how the effects are brought by HBP to DszA, DszB are still unable to be determined.
(1) The determination of kinetic parameters:
2.2 Determination of related parameters
1).The catalytic pathway of DszA，DszB，DszD can be described as enzymatic reaction based on traditional Michaelis kinetic theory. The kinetic data can be fitted by Michaelis equation:
In the equation, v is the catalytic rate of enzymes, kcat is conversion number, [E0] is the concentration of enzymes, [S] is the concentration of substrates, Km is Michaelis constant, and Vmax is the maximum catalytic rate of enzymes.
2)Because DszC is inhibited by substrate DBTs, the Michaellis equation is no longer fit. We could only use substrate inhibition equantion to fit the gained data:
In the equation, KSI is substrate inhibition constant.
Using the fitting statistics of MATLAB, we obtain many kinetic parameters of different Dsz-enzymes.
Table 1: The major kinetic parameters of Dsz-enzymes:
(2) The determination of related parameters in four major inhibition reactions:
1).The determination of IC50：
The degree of inhibition can be reflected by the dosage-reaction; the dosage-reaction describes the influence brought by concentration variations of inhibitor to the activity of enzymes:
In the expression, vi is the catalytic rate of enzyme when concentration of inhibitor is [I], and v0 is that without enzymes，IC50 is the inhibitor’s concentration which makes the enzyme’s activity reduce to 50%, comparing to the original one.

Paris_Saclay,2016,Team:Paris Saclay#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," tried to draw with them the future of a responsible use on this technology.
Anticipation
The more we knew about the CRISPR-Cas9 technology, the more we realized we did not know much on this technology and its impacts. The difficult anticipation in the scientific field transferred our questions on the human practice. As a consequence, we try to learn from stakeholders what can be the burning issues on the CRISPR/Cas9 technology and  to make CRISPR known to the public.
We believe anticipation can also be important in order to chose the right legal framework. Choosing an intellectual property scheme instead of another would have an important impact on innovation. So we asked ourselves what would be the right legal framework for fundamental biology according to the principles of Responsible Research and Innovation. As fundamental biology does not follow a specific societal need, a specific application, we could think patent would be a good option, because it would not harm public and stakeholders. On the other hand, if we consider science as a societal need itself an open license would be a better option.
Inclusiveness and Deliberation
We had a strong concern about inclusiveness due to our fundamental project. That is why we met a lot of stakeholders and public and in our case of fundamental research we defined the stakeholders as scientists using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology and Industrial Property Attorneys.
Popular Science: A Key Concern
As we believe popular science is a key concern in synthetic biology and especially for the CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we lead several activities in this field.  During a vox pop, we saw that people were mostly unaware of synthetic biology itself. We thus tried to meet public, to discuss with us about synthetic biology, the CRISPR technology and our project.
We met students during an exposition in the Nanterre University, but also during the Festival Vivant, opened to everyone. What did we learn from this experiments? Most of the people we met trust scientists to be responsible in their use, and does not feel legitimate to bring a critic on a subject they do not master.
Conference: The Societal Issues of CRISPR-Cas9
Because we had a strong concern both on vulgarisation and meeting stakeholders, we hold a conference in our university, in front of students, with two researchers, Jean Denis Faure, a researcher and professor using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology on plants, and Pierre Walrafen a scientific with a cellular biochemistry and patent engineer.

BBa_K2764000
The gene alkL codes for the outer membrane alkane channel protein known as AlkL. Derived from Pseudomonas Oleovarans, the sequence of 693bp has already been codon optimized for an E.coli chassis. The AlkL is able to collect alkanes thanks to an extracellular domain that has a high binding affinity to hydrophobic molecules. Once collected, the alkane makes it way through the hydrophobic core of AlkL before exiting into the periplasm through a small lateral opening in the protein. Hence, the AlkL, which penetrates the lipopolysaccharide outer membrane, may allow alkanes of larger molecular size to enter the cell.
For more details, check out BBa_K2764000
From literature, we know that the AlkL protein is toxic. As such, we used Anderson promoters of different strength to determine which expression level would be optimal. The Anderson promoters selected were J23104, J23107 and J23110 were intended to form an expression level gradient for this purpose.

Start of natural promoter project
The two promoters, Apolipoprotein A-IV (APOAIV) and Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) promoter, were amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA using primers with BBB_standard.
8-19-2009
APOAIV promoter PCR product was digested with NheI and SpeI at 37°C for one hour.
The backbone plasmid (p31; ~5000 bp) was also digested with the same restriction enzymes (at 37°C, 1 hour) and it was subsequent digested with SAP (at 37°C, 1 hour). The insert of this plasmid p31 is the promoter JeT, which will be cut out after this digest.
8-20-2009
CYP1A1 promoter has the internal restriction site, NheI,...waiting for another CYP1A1 reverse primer with the restriction site PstI instead of NheI.
The plasmid (p31) and the insert (APOAIV promotor) were purified and ligated at 22 °C for 3 hours.
The ligated product was transformed into DH5alpha cells.

I conclude that it does, and thus, according to the Utility Principle, the implementation of the biosensor is morally good.

Scandinavian iGEM weekend
Back to top
Team Uppsala University  decided to invite the four other Scandinavian iGEM teams for a weekend where we could come together, learn to know each other and prepare us for the Amsterdam meeting. The iGEM teams of Chalmers University (Gothenburg), Copenhagen University, Southern Denmark University and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology  (Trondheim) were invited. With the first three of those teams attending, 35 happy iGEM:mers met in Uppsala the 1-3 of September.
The schedule for the weekend combined social and scientific activites. The teams got to present and discuss their projects, discuss iGEM issues in workgroups and listen to presentations by Uppsala syntetic biology researchers. During the monday, we had invited Herbert Boyer, the first researcher to express perform a genetic cloning in 1973 and express a synthesized gene in 1977. He also held an open seminar, with about 100 attendees from the university faculty, about the history and development of genetic engineering.

Fatty Acid Sensing Mechanism
BBa_J176171
BBa_J176171 was planned to be used as a mammalian vector backbone for the promoters. After running PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) to amplify the FABP1 promoter and ligated it with GFP and the backbone, we did mutagenesis for the vector. Based on the gel photo, we concluded that the vector was easy to get degraded. Finally we figured out that BBa_J176171 was heat unstable and changed our plan.
Result
Figure 1: Degradation of BBa_176171 plasmid at temperature above 50°C after denaturation step of polymerase chain reaction. BBa_176171 and pEGFP-N1 were placed in ddH2O and ran polymerase chain reaction denaturation step at 98°C for 30 seconds and placed in a range of temperature from 50°C to 59°C for 30minutes. For controls, BBa_176171 and pEGFP-N1 were stored in room temperature (24°C) and 4°C for 30minutes respectively. The plasmids were ran on Gel Red pre-stained 0.8% agarose gel using 140V for 25minutes. 0.5uL of GeneRuler 1kb ladder was used.
Liver Fatty Acid Binding Protein 1 (FABP1) Promoter
This promoter was cloned from human genomic DNA (gDNA) (see gDNA extraction and PCR protocols ) with engineered RFC10 prefix and suffix for BioBrick submission. The promoter was then ligated with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) from pEGFP-N1 (Addgene), and cloned into BBa_J176171 mammalian backbone. The promoter and EGFP were successfully cloned into BBa_J176171 by digestion and ligation.

Leicester,2016,Team:Leicester#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," after we explained to them how genetic engineering works and helps the public. We’re hoping that after talking to the public, public opinion will have improved in regards to GMO’s and synthetic biology.
Adventure
On the 15th of July, the toughest of our keen iGEM team, embarked upon a testing 28 mile trek through the East Midlands pastures, starting from our University to a town outside of Leicester, known as Market Harborough. This walk was not for the faint-hearted, but armed with our backpacks of snacks and hearts full of loyalty to our sponsors, whose monetary donations towards our project were deeply appreciated, we arrived at our destination in the evening of that very same day!"
SCUT-China,2015,Team:SCUT-China#criticalThinking_-_-_TEXT.html," Sun yat-set University choose the embryo with 21-trisomy.
Let’s think about another condition and question. Image the couple find that their baby dooms to have small eyes after gene detecting and they regard small eyes ugly. So they choose to modify the embryo’s gene to ensure their baby with big beautiful eyes. When the baby grows up to be a male adult and he thinks his eyes are ugly and starts to complain about his parents editing his gene without his “permission”. And finally, the male adult chooses to prosecute his parents. Well, if you are the judge, what would you do?
In this hypothesis, you may have the same question as me whether what the parents do is to protect or to infringe the unborn baby’s human right if we can edit human gene? Although it seems senseless to discuss such an unrealistic issue now, but sooner or later, with the development of synthetic biology and gene therapy, we must think about how to manage such a controversial issue and help to advance technology instead of being too strict to prevent the research that will make breakthrough in solving the underlying problem of unsolvable human disease such as cancer and genetic disease.
It’s the social development that decide the answer to these question whether its moral or fair to use gene editing and therapy, but not different hypotheses that decide the development of technology. We should remember that technique itself is innocent, whether it is an evil or a virtue depends on the users. [Quote from：Gene therapy: Regulations, ethics and its practicalities in liver disease]
Gene Discrimination and law making
In 2009 Foshan, Guangdong, three examinees were rejected to be admitted as civil servant for the reason that they are the carrier of thalassemia gene, which is a fairly common gene in south China provinces like Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan where the carriers can reach ten percent and above. After that, the three examinees prosecute Foshan human resources and social security bureau, and a verdict from Foshan Chancheng People’s Court declared the three people lose. And during the appeal, Foshan Intermediate People’s Court affirmed the orignal judgment. This case was regarded as the first gene discrimination case in China and raised some questions about genetic privacy and legislative gaps in gene.
According to this case, we can easily find something related to each of us ranging from employment to commerial insurance and from marriage to dignity. For example, if the insurance company get your gene information without your permission and detect that you may suffer from severe breast cancer in the future, and they choose to reject your insurance purchasing, and after"

Fluorimetric analysis was conducted at Columbia University on a BioTek Synergy H1 Hybrid Reader (and the Genspace iGEM team gratefully acknowledges the generous help of the Columbia University iGEM team in this regard).  The excitation and emission wavelengths for the fluorescent analysis were 503nm and 607nm, respectively (see   http://link.springer.com/article/10.3103%2FS0096392508030036#page-1 ).  The eight samples were transferred in triplicate to a 96 well plate in 100uL aliquots per well.  A 100uL aliquot of PBS served as the blank reference against which OD600 and fluorescent measurements were comparatively made (i.e.,                         by subtracting the OD600 and fluorescent readings of the blank from each aliquot under study).  The comparative fluorescent reading of each aliquot was divided by the comparative OD600 reading of the same aliquot in order to obtain                         a measure of “per cell” fluorescence.  The triplet samples were then averaged and the standard deviation calculated to obtain the results shown below for the overnights:
Figure 1:  Fluorescence Measurements (Overnight results)
The average values of the fluorescence measurements shown above by the blue bars demonstrate the intended effect.  As expected, the control system exhibits increased levels of fluorescence as the IPTG is increased from 0mM (“IPTG-“) to 1mM (“IPTG+”). Conversely, the Lsr-based system (“LSR”) exhibits reduced levels of fluorescence as the IPTG is increased.   The error bars denote the range of +/- one standard deviation and is largely consistent across all samples, except for the Lsr-based system with 0mM IPTG (where each of the three fluorescent readings were similar according to the plate reader).
While the absence of overlap in error bars seen above lends credence to the validity of these results, additional steps can be taken in the future to improve the statistical character of this experiment.  These include the use of stronger Ribosome Binding Sites in plasmids p2 and p3 (to increase the degree of fluorescence), re-suspending the spun-down cells with fractional volumes of PBS to increase the effective cell concentration"

Synthetic Biology is largely restricted to well-funded laboratories at major research universities in high income countries. One significant barrier to entry is the capital cost of instruments. The cloning and assembly of BioBricks, for example, includes the transformation of Escherichia coli, which requires the purchase of a refrigerated centrifuge and an ultra-cold freezer. Here we assemble BioBrick-compatible shuttle vectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin). These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges, high schools and even private homes. The resulting plasmid constructs retain their pSB1C3 backbones and will thus remain compatible with the BioBrick standard and capable of replication in the widely used E. coli chassis.

Human Practices: Education and Public Engagement Special Prize
Innovative educational tools and public engagement activities have the ability to discuss the science behind synthetic biology, spark new scientific curiosity and establish a public dialogue about synthetic biology from voices and views outside the lab.
On this page, your team should document your Education and Public Engagement work and activities. Describe your team’s efforts to include more people in shaping synthetic biology (such as creating or building upon innovative educational tools and/or public engagement activities to establish two-way dialogue with new communities, and/or engaging new groups in discussions about synthetic biology and public values). Describe your approach, why you chose it, and what was learned by everyone involved (including yourselves!).
This work may relate to or overlap with the work you document on your Human Practices page. Whereas Integrated Human Practices relates to the process of refining your project purpose and design, this page may highlight significant efforts that go beyond your particular project focus and/or address a significant broader concern in iGEM.
For more information, please see the Human Practices Hub . There you will find:
an introduction to Human Practices at iGEM
tips on how to succeed including explanations of judging criteria and advice about how to conduct and document your Human Practices work
descriptions of exemplary work to inspire you

NJU-China,2016,Team:NJU-China#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," still strive for an ideal treatment no matter how expensive it might be, as long as it can guarantee efficiency. ‘Side effects’ accounted for the second, as cancer patients suffered a great trauma both physically and mentally. If side effects can be minimized, patients will received an utmost degree of relief.
Good curative effect and little side effect for the gene mutational patients are consistent with the advantages of our molecular target drugs, which is very practical and meets the real demands of patients. The biggest problem of our targeted drugs, currently, is actually about the price, since they cannot be covered in the medical insurance system and there is no policy support. In this way, for some ordinary wage-earning-class families, the medical expenses would be a big problem for them. The cost of the new therapies can be prohibitive, thus the patients shrink back at the sight of the price.
Molecular targeted drugs of our team have little side effects, can be taken orally, and are of good therapeutic effect for specific gene mutational patients. Would you be willing to try it if it was put into clinical practice?
Figure 11.
The reasons would be shown at the next question.
Your main concern with the new drug is …?
Figure 12.
Survey results on attitude towards the new drug showed that, only 14.52% holds absolute negative attitude to new drugs, and most of the patients and their families think it as acceptable, although 43.55% said they will make decisions in specific circumstances, and the cost, the curative effect, genetic testing are all the factors that need to be taken into account.
Consistent with the question 5, we could easily find that, with more than half respondents expressing this concern, the largest concern of patients and their families was that new drugs lack longstanding clinical cases. High charge was also one of the main concerns of patients. This showed that there is still much room for improvement and perfection of medical insurance system in China.
Besides, some patients still had doubts about the specific efficacy of new drugs, worrying they cannot receive fine curative effect even after paying high fee. However, 41.94% patients said they were very willing to try, and believed that the new technology should be well developed and progressed to better fight against cancer--even if the price is expensive, it is still worthy to try.
Summary
Our findings are compatible with our initial assumptions. In addition, after interviewing with the patients face to face, we also learned more of the current status of clinical cancer treatment and patients' actual thoughts and real needs, enabling us more aware of the importance and urgency of developing new drug"

Modelling The Treatment And Finding New Parts
Mathematical modelling provides a powerful tool for scientists of all disciplines, allowing inspection and manipulation of a system in ways which are unachievable in the lab. In the context of biology, we can use mathematical models to study the behaviour of a single cell or an entire ecosystem. In fact, inspecting a mathematical model is very much like a laboratory experiment – the main difference being that in modelling, the environment is artificial.

Model Overview
Mathematical modelling provides a powerful tool for scientists of all disciplines, allowing inspection and manipulation of a system in ways which are unachievable in the lab. In the context of biology, we can use mathematical models to study the behaviour of a single cell or an entire ecosystem. In fact, inspecting a mathematical model is very much like a laboratory experiment – the main difference being that in modelling, the environment is artificial.
Simulation Results
For all the complex calculations and mechanisms behind a model, it is without much worth if it cannot produce useful results. In general, 'useful results' are defined as successful predictions about the effects of modifying some parameter - if we can use a model to determine the effect of each variable upon the outcome, we can better design our system in the real world.
Westminster collaboration
Since Westminster's iGEM team had not produced a model of their own, and their project has several similarities to ours, we have constructed an additional model, also in C#, and sent this to Westminster's team for them to use. The model simulates bed bugs moving randomly in a cubic room. One of their proposed ""blood traps"" is integrated into the simulation, which visually demonstrates bed bugs being attracted and then subsequently killed by the device.
Bioinformatics
Using bioinformatics we can identify key genes whose dysfunction drives disease states. In so doing, we are should be able to come up with new parts that target these dysfunctional genes to increase the efficacy of synthetic biological constructs.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," the difference in OD600 between a negative control which is E. coli transformed with Lac-promoter + RBS on pSB1C3 (green) and E.coli transformed with cep94A which encodes the cellobiose phosphorylase(yellow) after respectively 48 and 72 hours without aeration. The Lacl promoters was induced with IPTG.
As we intend to break down cellulose to energy, we need to combine the BioBricks, meaning a strain containing cep94A on the pSB3K3 backbone and the￼ secretion system with the endo- and exoglucanase on pSB1C3. This led us to repeating the first growth experiment with a slow aeration (40 rpm), just to make sure the media was mixed. The results are shown in Figure 25, which shows that E. coli is able to grow on cellobiose when transformed with the cep94A/cellobiose phosphorylase on the high copy backbone pSB1C3 and unable to grow when transformed with bglX or with cep94A on the medium copy backbone pSB3K3. Due to no growth on cep94A on the medium copy backbone pSB3K3, in the strain living on cellulose did not grow either. After 72 hours it was visually displayed that only cep94A transformed E. coli grew, which is illustrated in Figure 26.
Figure 25. The four figures all have time in hours on the x-axis and OD600 on a logarithmic y-axis with standard deviation. All the experiments were conducted at once in the same water bath at 37°C and the data shown is an average of technical triplicates, taken every eight hours. Measurements was performed on E. coli MG1655 with inserted cep94A encoding cellobiose phosphorylase on pSB1C3 backbone and PenI promoter, cep94A encoding cellobiose phophorylase on pSB3K3 backbone and PenI promoter, bglX encoding beta-glucosidase with a Lacl promoter and a negative control with LacI promoter+RBS. Measurements was done on all strains growing on cellobiose+casamino acids referred as Cellobiose and just casamino acids referred as none. An addition parallel growth experiment was done on E. coli MG1655 with transformation of secretion system and cellulases on pSB1C3 backbone and cep94A encoding cellobiose phosphorylase on a pSB3K3 backbone, these measurements"

Approaching Our Project From Another Perspective
During the development of our technology it became clear that a variety of hurdles would have to be overcome for our product to reach market.  These included areas surrounding safety of our technology to the public, perception of our technology by key decision makers and end-users, and the protection of the platform from competitors who would be interested in expanding into our market space.
A Composite Approach To ""Human Practices"" From a Company
What is Human Practices? More importantly, what relevance does it have to the formation of a company? How can we develop our ideas in an ethical, safe, and environmentally conscious ways to better the world?  Our human practice initiatives aimed at providing answers to these questions within the context of our companies target market: the oil and gas industry.
To achieve these aims we worked closely with our end-users and networked extensively with groups to gain important insight into the development of our product.  We worked to analyze and predict the appropriate safety and containment solutions that would be required to not only provide a safe environment to our end-users, but also to prevent our end-user or other competitors from developing our ideas. Finally, we aimed to share our experiences and learning with new iGEM groups.
Networking Events
We attended a variety of events over the last year to create contacts within the business and synthetic biology communities. Through this we have met individuals involved in a vast number of different industries with a wide array of backgrounds. These meetings are summarized in the table below.

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Labjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," immobilized conditions. So now we are cooperating with Team Immobilization. We have thought about many ways how to immobilize the laccase and decided to give Silica Beads the first try. Check the Immobilization Team´s protocol for further information. Our main problem was how to measure the samples with all those beads in it. Tecan will probably be confused and give us some false values due to the beads that are disturbing its laser. So we need a way to get the beads out (and thus also stop the reaction) at a very precise point of time. Centrifugation wasn´t an option because it would simply take too long and not stop the reaction exactly in the second we want. While checking the internet for solutions we found Multi-Well Membrane-Bottom Filter Plates. Those are supposed to work in a similar way then our regular plates which we used for the Tecan but furthermore those plates contain a membrane that sieve the liquids through the filter when centrifugated. Thus the beads are separated and the ABTS-Buffer solution can me analyzed at 420 nm for oxidized ABTS. The plates will need a while before they arrive here at the CeBiTec, so we decided to first find out what the optimal amount of beads is and whether the beads might also bind ABTS (see lab journal Team Immobilization).
Team Immobilization:
So after a lot of reading and discussion, we decided to try immobilization using beads. Since silica beads were already available in our lab (from last year’s team), we decided to give them a try. The first challenge was to find out a convenient ratio of beads/laccase. According to the protocol of last year’s team, the ratio 1:1000 was used (1000mg beads/ 1 mg protein). Therefore we decided to try the ratios 1:500, 1:1000 and 1:1500. We prepared different buffers: HBSS buffer , Recrystallization buffer both of which were used with silica beads; in addition to Britton-Robinson Buffer , which was mentioned in publications as the best buffer for laccase immobilization. Laccases from TVEL0 were incubated with silica beads and different buffers at room temperature for 4hours on a rotator. After that, we collected the supernatants and delivered them to the team “Activity test” and waited for the good news.

IG201 + IG006 tail + lambda N gene = 140 + 26 + 402 = 568 base pairs.
Construction of BioBrick K374007
This construct contains the lambda nutR site (BBa_K374005) and the downstream terminator BBa_B0015 (composed of two terminator parts, namely BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012). The 3A assembly was used in the construction of this part. The nutR site has been digested with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and SpeI. The terminator part BBa_B0015 was, however, digested with Xbal and Pstl. NutR and BBa_B0015 were then ligated into the linearized plasmid pSB1C3 that had been restricted with EcoRl and Pstl. The size of K374007 has been verified by PCR with primers IG201 and IG202 (VR reverse primer) to be the following:
IG201 + IG202 + nutR = 140 + 176 + 255 = 571 base pairs.

Construction of BioBrick K374013
This part contains lambda N-gene (K374007) with its natural RBS. 3A assembly was used to construct this part. The lambda N-gene was excised with the restriction enzymes EcoRl and Spel. BBa_I13507 (containing RBS and RFP) was cut with Xbal and Pstl. Both parts were then ligated into pSB1C3 that had been restricted with EcoRl and Pstl. Aftertransformation and selection of the transformed colonies, verification PCR with primers IG201 and IG006 was carried out. The estimated size of this part:
IG201 + IG006 tail + N-gene with RBS =140 + 26 + 420 = 586 base pairs.

7) SynBio Advertising - 73.3 k people reached
We organised some public interventions in Belo Horizonte, which were used to apply surveys and also to help increase SynBio awareness and to do scientific advertising. Ideas, issues and problems that could be solved using SynBio that the general public may offer were collected.
The team used social medias as tool for the advertising not only of the interventions, but also news in the scientific development, scientific events etc.
(7.1) Idea Incubator
The first action taken to disclose SynBio was the creation of a course called “Ideas Incubator”, open to the entire University community. It was realized that, even among college students, Synthetic Biology, its implications and potential use are not familiar topics. In this course, the basis of SynBio, Molecular Biology and general Biochemistry are studied and SynBio application issues are discussed.
The team wishes to offer the course once a year. The purpose of this course is to provide basic training in Synthetic Biology for later students can take advantage of its concepts to propose solutions to problems of today's society in different areas (Health, Environment, Energy, Food, Industry and Innovation).
Lectures on the main issues in each area will be given and, as a group, students will propose solutions using Synthetic Biology systems. In the near time, the most interesting ideas will be chosen by students to be deepened, constituting a concrete project, which can be applied. Also, to stimulate students criativity and interaction, practical exercises such as the Marshmallow challenge and Egg Drop Project were proposed.
(7.2 ) Lectures, Courses and Workshops
(7.2.1) Summer Course (0.8 k people reached)
The I Summer Course of Biological Machines Engeneering (ICVEMB) was born from the desire to spread the Synthetic Biology in our academic community, in an attempt not only to arouse interest in this area that fascinates us, but also to find and empower students interested in joining us in the coming years.
When we designed the course, we had no idea how many people would enroll. We had a limit of vacancies because our infrastructure could not support more than a few dozen candidates, but we did not imagine that they would come to be completed. We start to report the ICVEMB in mid-December, resulting in nearly thirty applications before the end of 2014.

Stage 1
The initial stage of the collaboration focused on determining what goals we would aim to achieve over the course of the summer. A key component of this meeting was a discussion regarding transferring the BostonU team’s biological protocol onto a chip. If possible, we wanted to automate their entire testing procedure on a single chip and have five samples prepared for plate reading simultaneously. The second objective of the collaboration was to have this design incorporated into the MARS Repository and be accessible for iterations or adaptation even after the collaboration ended. With this in mind, we moved on to the design and test stage.
Stage 2
Before beginning the design stage, we wanted to ensure that our microfluidic chips could be read within a plate reader. Following a consultation with the synthetic biologists working in the BDC, there were no obvious detriments to using polycarbonate inside a plate reader. In order to test this, we milled a mini chip with the same well spacing and depths as a 94 well plate. This was inserted into a 3D printed skirt and placed inside the plate reader. GFP was filled inside the milled wells of the chips in various patterns and the plate reader’s results analyzed for any discrepancies. The results indicated that the chip could be read accurately toward the center of the chip with increasing inaccuracies at the periphery. This was incorporated in the future designs.
The initial designs for this chips focused on a few key features:
Using shared inputs to decrease the chip’s complexity
Utilizing valves in order to create a complete seal between chambers
Determining how to measure volume of liquid dispensed
Avoiding leaks to prevent contamination
After a number of iterations, another meeting was held with the BostonU Wetlab team in order to discuss progress on the design. It was concluded that performing all five tests on a single chip would not be feasible given the time constraints. As a result, their biological protocol was adapted to suit the limits of our chip design abilities. This included cutting down the samples run to a single test.
The final design integrated a chamber designed to fit the dimensions and depth of a well from a 96-plate reader. It also utilized our new metering primitive in order to ensure accurate ratio volumes of liquid would be dispensed while running the protocol. In order to make the design easier to use for the BostonU team, the control layer’s inputs were shared as much as possible.

Background
Historical Background
For centuries, humans have fascinated over silk. The earliest known production of the material dates back to the Yangshao period as early as 3000 B.C. Over the years, the process of sericulture, the growth of silkworms to rear silk, has evolved time and time again.  Silk as a material was at its height during the famed Silk Road period, where the lucrative Chinese silk trade dominated much of transcontinental trade. Long after, however, the idea behind silk processing still remains the same: growing silkworms, from which silk is extracted, cleaned and further processed.   For our project, we intend to take this a few steps further: instead of growing silkworms in factories, we want bacteria to be our microbial factories, producing silk proteins as it would any other.
Biochemistry of Silk
The mechanical properties of spider silk are a result of its primary amino acid sequence. Although the   amino acid sequences for various types of spider silk are well documented, it is still relatively unknown   how these amino acids aggregate and contribute to the strength and stability of silk. Silk proteins are   composed of repeats of short amino acid sequences (approximately 33 amino acids). These repeats can   be referred to as monomers. Each monomer consists of a glycine rich stretch, followed by an alanine   rich stretch. It is hypothesized that these hydrophobic alanines form beta sheet crystals with other silk   proteins, and contribute to the strength of the silk fibers. The glycine stretches are thought to form   alpha helices and contribute to the flexibility of the protein. This monomer sequence is repeated many   times in one protein, and allow for strong interactions with other silk proteins. These simple motifs   repeated over and over are the key to the formation of one of the strongest materials known to man.
Applications
Silk is a naturally strong and flexible material, and so it is a unique fiber that can be used in applications that require the"

You can find the band at lanes which are added IPTG just beneath the band of 68kDa.
2,Growth curves
We measured the turbidities of the transformants every 2 hour and made the growth curves. We transferred the transformant prepared to 100 mL flasks and add 660uL IPTG and 108uL isoamyl alcohol to them after 2 hours of the start. We measured the turbidities every 2 hour. The measurements were carried out for 12 hours.
LB 100mL
ampicillin 150uL
sample 50uL
IPTG 660uL
isoamyl alcohol 108uL
37°C, 125/min
In addition, we measured the turbidities of the transformants without adding IPTG and isoamyl alcohol too. We measured 4 samples; ATF2-pET-15b, ATF2-pET-15b + IPTG, empty pET-15b, empty pET-15b + IPTG.
As the result, ATF2-pET-15b transformants grow well relative to control(transformants having empty pET-15b vector). We propose the folllowing hypothesis. Isoamyl acetate indicates a stimulatory effect of growth on E.coli cells when compared to isoamyl alcohol so that transformants having ATF2-pET-15b grow well relative to control.
And ATF2-pET-15b without IPTG grow well relative to ATF2-pET-15b add IPTG. It is explained by the following hypothesis. When we add IPTG to the transformant having ATF2-pET-15b, ATF2 protein (AATase) is expessed in bulk in the transformant. A massive amount of AATase has a potential to surpress the growth.

Next, to confirm the activity of AATase, we added isoamyl alcohol after IPTG induction and cultivated for about 2 hours. We used E. coli cells carrying the empty vector"

Explanations
In the safety page, we have seriously considered Lab safety, Biobrick safety, Project Related Material Safety, and Experimental Safety. For better application, we made our device. ( see: safety ) Considering its possible social impacts, we made the safety tree for further discussion.
In the consequence tree, we consider that Avermectin has been successfully overexpressed by Streptomyces avermitilis and Toxins manufactured in E.coli have been successfully capsulated in CNC, and thus can be digested by termites fatally. Another vital certain assumption is that all bacteria are killed through suicide design. Then we imagine what TERMITE TERMINATOR may become and where it may go after their action in termites' guts. Additionally, we consider possible consequence of the device application. In sum, the safety tree discusses possible impacts from mainly four aspects: safety of streptomyces avermitilis; safety of toxins E.Coli; safety of CNC carrier and safety of Device.
-Streptomyces avermitilis should be safe to be used in environment because if it is eaten, it's either absorbed by termites (which is exactly the consequence we'd love to see) or passed out with ter"

Because most of our results were inconclusive, we wanted to focus on our discoveries with pyruvate metabolism, and how we can promote the production of reduced flavodoxin by redistributing flux through reactions involving pyruvate. We also included brief summaries of our recent work on metabolite exchange reactions and gene/reaction knockouts.

Laura and I finalized the first draft of our wiki page, after reworking it to include more visuals and minimal text. Even though computational modeling is extensive, we tried to summarize key points in flow charts and supplement them with brief descriptions. Laura also collected all of the outputs for the double gene knockout code. Even though our outputs were finally starting to match up, we found, unfortunately, that any knockout coupled with flavodoxin outputted an infeasible model.

Laura and I sat down together and reviewed the completed first draft of our modeling summary. Considering Laura had to leave early, I finalized any remaining edits, such as redesigning our section on genome­scale modeling. We wanted to break up any big chunks of texts. Before Laura left, her and I also wrote up our section on computational modeling for the abstract. Given the length constraint, we focused primarily on what our goal was in using computational modeling to promote nitrogenase activity.

The issues investigated led to think about designing a practical way to implement PLA. We decided to design a DIY bioreactor that would demonstrate PLA production to be not expensive and would, at the same time, optimize it. Besides, we conceived and did a MOOC as consequence of awareness study. Check on the wiki!

Integrated Human Practices
After conducting a survey on our project, it appeared that people would prefer resorting to bioplastics in their daily life rather than petroleum-based equivalents. Yet the consumption of bioplastics remains lower. Therefore, we decided to focus on solutions to tackle this paradox. The first step was to carry out a pedagogic communicative approach to arise interest on synthetic biology, and then on PLA. That is why we decided to focus on MOOCs as an effective tool to spread knowledge on this topic. Besides, we noted that globally, public policies tend to gradually ban plastic consumptions and that could be related to restrictive legislations directed at petroleum-based plastics. Thus, we worked on describing an efficient DIY bioreactor that would push PLA scale-up in a cheap manner. Additionally, facing the controversy on PLA degradation, we have highlighted the role of skepticism on science and performed a simple experiment of plastics degradations.
Education and Public Engagement
Producing a bioplastic involved a broad range of topics from microbiology to genetic engineering and we asked ourselves how we could efficiently present them to a wide audience. At first, we met different kinds of publics from high schools to universities, through presentations and fairs. Discussions were interesting, but the impact was relative. Secondly, we looked for a tool enabling interactions with a large number of people on a given topic, on a short period of time. The MOOC concept seemed to fill those criteria. As we agreed on appraisals made on MOOCs, we decided to focus on its disadvantages to counterbalance our initial biaised opinion. That’s why, we experimented MOOCs format with high school and"

NCTU_Formosa,2013,Team:NCTU Formosa#project_-_-_TEXT.html," shoots. It can decrease apical dominance which will make the main stem grow better compared with other stems. In this way, all the stems are able to become stronger. Cytokinin can also signal lateral bud growth, which will make the plant bushier.
Under red light and 25 °C, Auxin will be produced. Auxin can coordinate development from cellular, organs to the whole plant. Auxin molecules in cells may cause direct responses by stimulating or inhibiting certain gene expressions. In the cellular level, Auxin is important for cell growth. It induces axial elongation in roots and also lateral expansion which can make roots swell. In the whole plant level, it affects the shape of the plants. Because of the different functions, each organ has uneven Auxin concentration and causes specific shapes.
Under dark and 25 °C, Gibberellin will be produced. Gibberellin is important in the elongation of cells. It causes the extension of stems by inducing cell divisions and elongations. A special characteristic of it is that it can produce more mass when the plant is exposed to cold temperature.
Under dark and 37 °C, Florigen will be produced. Florigen is the key hormone to trigger plant blossoming. We use a promoter that can promote transcription of the FT gene, which then translate into FT proteins. FT proteins will then be transported via the phloem to the shoot apical meristem, where it will interact with the FD protein (transcription factor) to activate floral identity, thus inducing flowering.
The next BIG thing
On the other hand, we tend to optimize our system to achieve subtle control of the four gene expressions. We might be able to do this by taking the values between the limits we have set. Instead of 25 °C and 37 °C , we tend to take the values between, so we can create more conditions under which different level of expressions can be achieved. We can also vary the intensity of red light to control the level of expression. For instance, we can gain different pigment outputs by tuning the temperature and varying the intensity of red light. The ultimate goal is to precisely control the level expression of each gene.
So, we designed and built a device which is able to control the intensity of light. This device is used in the incubator and created for the purpose of covering all the light source outside. So the only light source is the red light LED we put in. In our first design, the device has a cuboid body and a thread top. This thread top is capable to change the light intensity, simply by changing"

All work was performed with WADA-certified reference material for EPO gene doping within a range of 1 to 4000 copies of reference material spikes and EPO gene-doping-positive samples. However, in view of the absence of interlaboratory tests among the laboratories accredited by WADA, the analysis was not performed on the Olympic samples; it was only performed on samples selected exclusively for research. ( Pereira, et al. 2017 )
2018: ADOPE
Our enthusiastic team set out to tackle gene doping to promote responsible use of synthetic biology. Read more about our project here .
We assessed the topic further through train debates and public surveys complemented by athlete interviews and contact with the Dutch Doping Authority as well as sports organizations as NOC*NSF, the Dutch National Sports Organization, and a sports psychologist . We found that up to 55% of the general public would like to use gene doping for performance enhancement without necessarily ascertaining its safety. These high figures amongst the general public together with the enormous pressure that is put on athletes give an indication of the need for detection.
“Given the huge amounts of money going on in doping development, gene doping will already be happening for sure!”
Sports Coach Stirling
Figure 2. Statistics on the willingness of the general public to use gene doping for performance enhancement in The Netherlands and The People’s Republic of China based on 181 and 126 respondents respectively. More on the surveys in The Netherlands and China can be found on the Education and Public Outreach Page .
1.2 Future Gene Doping Challenges
After we evaluated the relevance of gene doping detection, we focussed on the challenges of gene doping in the broadest context. We grouped the challenges involved in gene doping in the following categories: health (both private and public, global and intergenerational), responsibility and social inequality. As became apparent during the expert discussion in Stirling , exactly these topics make gene doping different from conventional types of doping.
Health
Gene doping may be harmful to the athlete, especially when it comes to unregulated and barely tested methods. Risks of using gene doping include mutagenesis, uncontrolled gene expression levels and thereby disrupted feedback systems. For EPO, the risks include strokes and myocardial infarctions too. Gene doping might also cause acute humoral and cellular immune responses that may even invoke death. On top of this, there may be many additional unforeseen (long term) consequences.
“We can never say gene doping is safe. There may be many unforeseen consequences. ”

We decided to locate TEV Protease gene sequence into pET45-b because our essential want to control protein is TEV Protease. And we decided clonning DAMP-Pexiganan gene sequence into pColA vector.  For clonning DAMP-Pexiganan protein sequence into pColA vector we toke out our gene with NotI enzyme from PSB1C3-DAMP-Pexiganan plasmid. We did ligation with pET45-b vector which digested the same enzyme. Following ligation, the resulting plasmids were transformed into BL21 competent bacteria.
We did colony PCR in order to check the accuracy of cloning with using pColA forward and pColA reverse primers. If the clonning resulted negative expecting band would be 192 bp. On the other hand if we succesfully clonned these part, expected band would be 908 bp.
After colony PCR consequences we have put the positive resulted clonnings 16 hours liquid culture  after that we isolated plasmid DNA with miniprep plasmid izolation method. We make cutcheck to our attained plasmid DNAs for put a second control step. Our restriction enzymes those we used are XbaI and SpeI.

After we clonning DAMP-Pexiganan gene sequence into pColA plasmid and TEV Protease gene sequence into pET45-b for transformate these both two plasmids into same BL21 bacteria we did cotransformation. After cotransformation process we put bacterias at 37C for 16 hours incubation. End of 16 hours as a result we did not see any bacteria colony over agar plate.
We retried several times this cotransformation process but with these tryings we havent seen any bacteria colony on our agar plates.

After the negative results obtained from cotransformation experiements we designed a new experimental apparatus to demonstrate TEV Protease's breaking or separator effect to DAMP-Pexiganan molecules linker site. We  firstly make broth culture secondly put incubation at 37C for 13 hours bacterias which contain pET45-DAMP-Pexiganan and pET45-TEV Protease plasmids.

EPF_Lausanne,2014,Team:EPF Lausanne#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," centrifuged the cells for ten minutes and replaced the medium with PBS to be able to get a shutdown of the signal.
We successfully showed that increasing concentrations of KCl led to stronger signals up to a saturation concentration of about 80 mM KCl. Moreover we were able to drastically shut down the signal. These results prove the reversibility of the split IFP1.4 and suggest that real-time temporal dynamics analysis is possible for our system.

Visualization of the the CpxR split IFP1.4 activation by KCl stress
Having shown that we were able to monitor the temporal dynamics of CpxR activation, we wanted to see if we could analyze CpxR’s spatial dynamics by microscopy. 10μl of our cells, previously stressed with 80 mM KCl were spread on a glass slide and imaged with a x100 objective and a APC (Cy5.5) filter.
We noticed various characteristics of the cells from the picture below. First, IFP signal was much more present in stressed bacteria rather than in non-stressed bacteria. Secondly, we distinguished two specific phenotypes within bacteria: elongated and normal cells. We noticed that this difference was due to CpxR overexpression as we saw this phenomenon also in non-stressed conditions.
In elongated cells, we were able to distinguish several bright bands of IFP signal that seem fairly uniformly distributed. In the normal phenotype we distinguished a single band in the centre of the bacteria. These observations led us to believe that CpxR might be involved in the division process of E. coli as it seems coherent for cells to slow down division upon stress.
After looking into the literature, similar bands were visualizable in E. coli for factors related to septum formation such as ftsZ or pbpB. Nevertheless when comparing our patterns to the ftsZ and pbpB patterns, we noticed that CpxR might be localized in opposition to these factors. Further experiments comparing the sub-localization of CpxR and ftsZ could help the scientific community better understand how E. coli monitor division under various environments.

Introduction
The arrival of our newly synthesized BioBricks
In the last lab session the Metal Sensing Team had shown that the version of the BBa_J33206 BioBrick submitted by Chris French (contained within the pSB1A2 plasmid) was indeed the correct one. However any further work on this BioBrick should now be put on temporary hold because of the arrival of our newly synthesized BioBricks. These synthesized BioBricks need to be transformed in E. coli bacteria as well as other processing measures.
Today's task is to tranform DH5-alpha E.coli bacteria with our newly synthesized BioBricks - one set of cells should be tranformed with the cotC-GFP-smtA BioBrick and the other group of cells should be transformed with the kinA BioBrick
Procedure
To carry out the transformations of the two sets of DH5-alpha E.coli cells with our two BioBricks, we adhered to Dr. Aldridge's transformation by heat shock protocol . The only differences to the protocol were these:
Step 2 - the period in which the DH5-alpha cells were left on ice was 15 minutes instead of the indicated 30 minutes.
Step 4 - the amount of DNA added to the DH5-alpha cells (whether it was cotC-GFP-smtA BioBrick DNA or kinA BioBrick DNA) was 10ul.
Step 5 - the cells were left on ice for 15 minutes instead of the suggested 3 minutes.

Overview
We thought safe application was a very important aspect of our project because we thought that in the future our project will probably be directly applied on humans. We tried to incorporate a foreign inducible metabolism into human liver cells; therefore we had to consider safe application to eliminate possible complication that our project could cause. We have approached this aspect by meeting two prominent scientists in Hong Kong society who are currently actively participating in scientific and medical research. They helped us to realistically view our project in their point of view and to think about the possible concerns that can arise if we try to transform our project into a product. With the experts, we have discussed mainly three matters: application of our project, biosafety & bio-ethical issues concerning our project, synthetic biology in Hong Kong and in Asia in general.
Synbio Map
SynBio Map identifies and locates companies, universities, research institutions, laboratories and other centers across the globe that are active in the synthetic biology research (""Synthetic biology project:,"" ). It is a good tool to compare the trend of synthetic biology all round the world. This map was created by the Synthetic Biology Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.   In this map, 5 entries are located in Hong Kong. Two of them are in the University of Hong Kong and two are in the Chinese University of Hong Kong, while the remaining one is a private company.
Participation in the iGEM Competition
The concept of synthetic biology is not prevalent in Hong Kong and in Asia. We thought it was imperative to provide information to the public. We tried to achieve this by making short informative yet interesting videos and an interactive blog that introduce synthetic biology and our project. We have included Cantonese to our work so that the public in Hong Kong can easily digest the information.  While we were gathering information about synthetic biology. We observed inadequacy in the amount of information of synthetic biology in Asia. To amend this problem, we have researched information about synthetic biology in different languages such as English, Korean, Cantonese, Mandarin"

It would be great if such point of contact could provide counseling and help to examine the issue on all relevant aspects. The decision would still stay with the team and ultimately with every individual researcher. Therefore, any advice shall not get judgmental or take over the decision by giving specific recommendations.""

""Different perspectives within iGEM, such as legal and ethical, not only help to ground scientific research within the current legal and ethical framework, they can even help drive the progression and evolution of the framework itself. Bielefeld-CeBiTec’s report on dual use research is a manifestation of such a collaboration as it provides the building blocks for a responsible approach to a field that is advancing at an ever-increasing pace.""
Additional interviews
Prof. Gerd Bohner
To analyse the current situation at our university, we further contacted and interviewed Prof. Bohner, head of the ethics commission of our university. He is professor in the department of psychology and provided us valuable insights on the current status and possible further implementation of council for researchers at our university. The analysis of applicable laws and responsibilities of the german legislation are complemented by an interview with the German Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety, Department 4: Genetic Engineering.

Main - Preface - Methods - Introduction
Preface : Why wonder about ethics in a biological engineering competition?
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is an undergraduate competition begun at the MIT in 2004. In four years the competition grew up exponentially from 5 teams in 2004 to 110 teams in 2009. Within the context of its participation in IGEM 09 competition, the Paris team (iGEM Paris) proposes a reflexion about ethical stakes in synthetic biology, in order to exercise our critical reflexion. Our “disciplinary” motivations to lead that ethical reflexion will be developed in a more formal introduction. We propose to wonder, in that preface, about the several “causes” of the necessity of that reflexion, mainly by wondering about the way interdisciplinarity encourages reflexivity. We wish to establish the fact that ethical reflexion is necessarily linked to a critical perspective, a point will be enlighten in the introduction.
Synthetic biology can be read as an encouragement to interdisciplinarity, as a disciplinary challenge by bringing together, in a unique life science, perspectives from engineering and practices from molecular biology. That interdisciplinarity stimulates researchers the necessity to change from their initial “disciplinary standpoint” in order to come up to synthetic biology specifications, requiring them to change position, to become alternatively insider and outsider towards their own science formation. That change sometimes permits the development of a critical perception, or, at least, makes it more attainable. That critical perspective permitted by reflexivity is"

We believe we have provided the Texas Tech team with mentorship throughout the course of the summer and fall that should help them be competitive in their first iGEM jamboree. Texas Tech in turn helped our team by testing our team's protocol for creating gellan gum plates with S. paucimobilis.
Texas iGEM Meet Up
Texas Tech, Rice, and UT Austin iGEM team members at the Texas iGEM Meetup.
As scientists, synthetic biologists rely on collaboration to develop their ideas. Recognizing the value of feedback from our peer iGEM teams, we reached out to teams from Texas Tech Lubbock, Rice, and Monterrey to see whether they would be interested in organizing a meeting before the jamboree. On Saturday, September 24th, 2016, at the University of Texas Fall Undergraduate Research Symposium, iGEM teams from Rice University, Texas Tech University, and the University of Texas met to discuss their projects and exchange feedback and advice for the competition. As a part of the Natural Science Undergraduate Research Symposium, each team first formally presented a part of their project to an audience of professors, graduate students, as well as undergraduate students. Following this formal presentation was an informal meeting of the teams to strictly focus on each of our iGEM projects. During this collaborative discussion, the teams critiqued each other’s projects. Multiple members of each team organized the meetup via email, phone, and Facebook. Teams enjoyed an early opportunity to discuss their projects with other students enthusiastic about synthetic biology.
Monterrey Collaboration
A skype call between UT Austin and Monterrey in which UT Austin helped the Monterrey team with their conjugation protocol.
The iGEM team from Monterrey, Mexico also reached out to our team as we are their closest iGEM neighbor. UT Austin helped the Monterrey team troubleshoot their conjugation protocol.  The Monterrey team also discussed trying to attend the Texas iGEM meetup, but were unable to make the September meetup.  The teams also discussed helping each other out experimentally, but given the international border, there were some uncertainties on how best to send biological organisms and other materials.  Unfortunately, nothing was sent."

To affirm the results obtained by fluorescence spectroscopy used the Bradford assay and screened for different protein concentrations in transparent polystyrene plates. The calibration lines necessary for calculation of protein concentration can be found here .

Picture 1: % of tagged (red) or untagged (blue) GFP remaining in the well after washing compared to previous washing step / original concentration
After the first measurement of the basic fluorescence intensity we transferred the samples onto another well, refilled the exhausted well with PBS and measured both eluate and remaining protein. In a second washing step the liquid was taken out of the first well again and given to another well. This washing was performed a third time, resulting in three eluates and a triply washed well with more or less protein remaining on the walls.
As shown in picture 1, both pbd-tagged and untagged GFP fluorescence decreases after the first washing step. Only 0- 4% of the original concentrations of the untagged GFP and 2-7% of the pbd-tagged GFP remained in the well.
Picture 2: % of pbd-tagged GFP that can be eluted in the first washing step. The curve decreases with the amount of the start concentration. If the GFP-pbd solution is not oversaturated a lower amount of this protein can be washed away.
After a second washing step there were differences observable between the tagged and the untagged GFP.  While the percentage of the remaining “normal” GFP was scattered around zero, an average of 60% of the pbd-tagged GFP remained in the well. In a third washing step, this observation was confirmed. While, like before, the main part of the pbd-GFP remained in its original well, nearly all of the untagged GFP was washed off.
Taking a look at the pbd-bound GFP, it is striking that after the solution has already been diluted by one washing step, the percentage of protein that can be washed away diminishes. It comes to mind that the massive loss of pbd-tagged GFP after the first washing step might be due to an oversaturation of pbd-GFP in the solution.  In this case there would be too much pbd-GFP for the available plastic surface, so that most of the protein could be eluated.
As shown in picture 2 the percentage of eluted GFP diminishes when the used start concentration is lower.
Picture 3: if the start concentration is not oversaturated pbd-coupled is much more resistant"
Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," show how a reaching a stable, albeit different ratio could look.
Fig 1. The ratio between Synechocystis and Y. lipolytica stabilises over time.
Even if the ratio our model returned is not to be taken too seriously, it is not unrealistic that the cyanobacterium should outnumber the production organism, given the premises of the model. The production organism needs quite a lot of acetate to grow, and its only source is through the production of Synechocystis. The amount of acetate exported by the cyanobacterium is not very high. Therefore, after a predictive model is reached, the problem of getting Synechocystis to produce enough acetate for a production organism in co-culture will almost certainly remain a difficult challenge, and one that has to be surmounted when going forward with this project.

Based on the EET pathway theory, we suggest that by maximizing the amount of flavins, we may significantly enhance the EET efficiency and achieve a relatively high power generation.
We found a part BBa_K1172303 in Part Registry constructed by 2013 Team Bielefeld-Germany which was also aimed at producing riboflavins. However, the gene cluster showed a maximum output of 6 mg/L even with a strong promoter, which was insufficient to maintain a high and constant efficiency of EET pathway in our co-culture system.  So we decided to optimize the part BBa_K1172303 to enhance the production of riboflavins.
Figure 11. Two different parts we designed to produce flavins.
As we learn from metabolic flux (figure 2), it reveals the relevant pathways of riboflavin production and engineering strategies for riboflavin production. In their previous research(Tao, et al) [7] ,they construct a high-yield E.coli strain with a yield of 229.1 mg/L. Based on their study, we constructed a flavin producing part (ribABDEC cluster) named EC10.(as shown in figure 11a). The part( BBa_K1696011 ) we designed, compared with BBa_K117230, has been well optimized and the yield of that reached 17 mg/L.( as shown in figure 13). We can see from the results, the functionality of their parts has successfully improved.
Figure 12. The production of EC10 in tubes.
In the meanwhile, based on co-factor model, EET pathway points out that FMN plays a critical role in electron transfer. Through the study by Dr. Tao Chen, they have weakened the RBS upstream of ribC to divert more of the material flux to RF production.[7] Based on their viewpoint, we got further to design a strong RBS sequence upstream of the ribC and we rename the new part as EC10*( BBa_K1696010 ). The yield of EC10* reached 90 mg/L(as shown in figure 11b).  The strong RBS before ribC sequence can lead to the FMN accumulation while riboflavin consumes a bit, which may in turn, result in increasing both for riboflavin and FMN as a whole.

Al ser compuestos químicos, estos mensajeros se ven limitados al alcanze de dicho sistema, por ejemplo: Aun mensajeros de largo alzanze, como las hormonas, estan ligadas al sistema quimico (cuerpo humano).
En este proyecto, nuestra meta es hacer que la barrera química  de la comunicación celular se vuelva obsoleta.Esto se traduce al uso de mensajeros no químicos, en este caso, los fotones. Nuestro canal entonces es la luz hecha apartir de paquetes de fotones o cuantas de energía, que transportaran información de los remitentes a los receptores, cruzando asi murallas quimicas. En consecuencia, nuestro sistema de comunicación ya no es contenida dentro de un sistema químico, pero dentro de uno físico, es decir: debe de existir un canal fisico por el cual los fotones puedan ser transportados. Este canal físico puede variar desde algo tan sofisticado como un sistema de enlaces basado en microcontroladores electrónicos, hasta algo tan simple como el aire (o el vacio!!). Sin embargo, esta capa física debe ser impermeable a la señalización de los componentes químicos. Por tanto, el sistema de señalización química no se vería afectada por el canal físico, y viceversa. En consecuencia, el intercambio de información a través de medios físicos es suficientemente independiente de la información codificada en las vías del sistema químico endógeno. En otras palabras, es extraordinariamente no invasivo. Como bono adicional, nuestras entidades receptoras son fácilmente transformadas en entidades emisoras. Así, usando nuestras células como chasis de procesamiento de información, podemos ampliar la capade comunicaciones. Nosotros podemos hacer nuestro sistema"

Penn,2012,Team:Penn#Perceptions_-_-_TEXT.html," bacterial therapeutics. Scientists developing these treatments must be held to high standards, and should provide extensive research demonstrating not only that their microbe works, but that it doesn't react in unexpected ways or produce unwanted byproducts in various conditions.
Additional regulation must be enacted to ensure accountability and transparency among synthetic biologists. There should be accountability among labs. This may be difficult with the advent of the DIY ""biohacker"" cloning genes in their own private labs, but safety is of the utmost importance. Transparency and accountability helps prevent accidental leakage of microorganisms into the environment as well as careless or reckless science by unqualified people.
The Presidential Commission on the Study of Bioethical Issues outlined 18 recommendations that they believe the government and synthetic biologists should take as the science moves forward [6]. All of the recommendations apply to engineered bacterial therapeutics. To see the success of these microorganisms and to allow synthetic biology to reach its full potential, scientists and engineers will have to work hand in hand with businessmen and policy makers to support innovation, evaluate risks, and promote a regulated and transparent industry to a well educated public.
Hurdles in Public Perceptions of Bacterial Therapeutics
Even if an engineered bacterial therapeutic is developed, shown to be efficacious and safe, approved by relevant regulatory agencies, and launched, it will face hurdles in public and governmental perception. There is a reason why food products supplemented with bacterial cultures have been branded ""probiotics""; there are clear negative associations with ingesting foreign bacteria. Unfortunately for projects like ours, there are also further negative associations with genetic engineering and synthetic biology.
Negative public opinion or low awareness can greatly hinder the progress of new technologies. Most notably, progress in stem cell research has been slowed by its initial negative public perception, which resulted in laws which outlawed or severely restricted this research in several countries. Although public opinion has recovered and 58% of the US population now approves of embryonic stem cell research [8], there is a long lag between changes in public opinion and changes in legislation, and progress has remained slow. To prevent synthetic bacterial therapeutics from following the same path, we must consider the potential public perception hurdles specific to synthetic biology and take action to minimize their impact.
Public acceptance of synthetic bacterial therapeutics is closely tied to public perception of synthetic biology in general. Since synthetic biology is still an emerging field, awareness is generally low but is increasing rapidly. According to a 2009 study by Hart Research Associates, roughly 48% of adults have never heard anything about synthetic biology, while 28% have heard ""a little"" about it, 22% have heard something about"

Human Practices
The UEA NRP team really went up and beyond this year, carrying out a wide selection of activity's to inform the public of both synthetic biology and iGEM, aiming to raise awareness of this branch of science. We used many methods of communication in order to cater for a range of audiences, including a radio show, newspaper articles, pubic events and talks as well as collaborating with all the other UK teams, in order to organize the UK team meet up and steam it live on the internet.
