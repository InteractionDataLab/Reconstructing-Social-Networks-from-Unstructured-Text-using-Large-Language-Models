science comics
SKLMT-China realized the importance of science education while conducting scientific research. During the collaboration, we learned that China Ocean University was conducting a publicity campaign on popular science comic books. After contacting them, we cooperated and exchanged views.In cooperation, we are responsible for publicizing OUC-China's popular science comics to promote synthetic biology.On September 8th, SKLMT-China team set up the booth in the orientation area of Qingdao campus of Shandong University, carried out the cooperation project of popularization of science with OUC-China and achieved remarkable results.
Other team’s questionnaire
We participated in the cooperation of Team Nottingham, Team IIT-Madras, Team RHIT, Team IIT Kanpur and Team Harvard. Team CPU-China and Team ICT-Mumbai participated in the cooperation project we initiated. We participated in the ""Proof Reading Help"" event sponsored by Team Nottingham to help check for syntax errors in non-English speaking country pages. We have sent the email to Team Nottingham and received a reply-both of two teams were happy to cooperate with each other. We have applied to join the “Language Project” project initiated by Team ITT-Madras and the “League of Superheroes” campaign initiated by Team RHIT. We filled out the Survey To Fight Water Pollution released by Team IIT Kanpur. We sent a submission email to Team Harvard to participate in the “Fighting Stigma Against Synthetic Biology!” project. The main content of the email was based on the project of our team，and show the importance of microbial technology to improve the public's impression of synthetic biology. At the same time, we also posted our survey on the website - ""survey on Chassis and Nicotine"", Team CPU-China and Team ICT-Mumbai carefully fill out and participate in cooperation.
Promoter strength verification
This year we construct a promoter library characterized by firefly luciferase to improve pseudomonas

In order to test the efficiency of those chromoproteins in a different chassis (because Uppsala used them in bacteria and Cambridge-JIC used it on Marchantia), we’ve got two version of this construction: one with bacteria codon optimized CDS and other with N. benthamiana codon optimized, so we can compare the efficiency of both sequences in our chassis.
eForRed optimized chromoprotein: this chromoprotein naturally exhibits red/pink color when expressed (BBa_K592012). It was optimized for Nicotiana benthamiana since reporters in plants are highly demanded.
AmilCP optimized chromoprotein: this chromoprotein exhibits strong blue color when expressed (BBa_K592009). It was optimized for Nicotiana benthamiana to increase the number of available reporters in plants.
eforRed chromoprotein: Chromoprotein that exhibits red/pink color when expressed. It was reported by Upsala Team and we summit this part in Phytobricks standard. This part has been domesticated using GoldenBraid System Assembly.
AmajLime chromoprotein: chromoprotein that exhibits yellow-green strong color when expressed (BBa_K1033916). It is cloned in Phytobricks standard in order to increase Phytobricks repository of parts. This part has been domesticated using GoldenBraid System Assembly.

Multiagent System based modeling
Spatial simulation of a bacteria
We have also developed a spatial simulation of the basic bi-stable by considering the interaction between the different components in the interior of a bacterium using NetLogo. This way we provide a friendly program that allows the researcher to study the influence of several parameters in the global behavior of the system. Moreover, it is possible to analyze parameters not considered in the simulation based on differential equations like the spatial (volumetric) concentrations of the.
About NETLOGO
NetLogo is a programmable modeling environment for simulating natural and social phenomena. It was authored by Uri Wilensky in 1999 and has been in continuous development ever since at the Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling.
NetLogo is particularly well suited for modeling complex systems developing over time. Modelers can give instructions to hundreds or thousands of ""agents"" all operating independently. This makes it possible to explore the connection between the micro-level behavior of individuals and the macro-level patterns that emerge from the interaction of many individuals.
NetLogo web
Simulating the bistable
The program can be launched in two different ways. You can open the file biestable-simulation.nlogo download here )
If you want to do it in the first way, you also have to download the NetLogo environment from his web page

Finally, a comb was inserted to create pockets while solidification. The gel was put into the running buffer (0.5x TAE buffer) before the DNA mixture with loading buffer was loaded into the pockets and separated by electrophoresis. As ethidium bromide intercalates with the DNA (GC nucleotides) the resulting DNA-EtBr-complexes are visible under UV irradiation at 265 nm. As standard ladder for fragment sizes, 1kb+ ruler, 2-log ladder or 50 bp ladder were used.
Gibson assembly

Restriction digests
For enzymatic digests, the following formula was used if bovine serum albumin (BSA) was not part of the buffer, which was the case for NEB buffer 3.0:
... µl DNA (~500 ng)
5 µl BSA
5 µl buffer (for example NEBuffer 2)
2 x 1.5 µl enzymes (for example EcoRI-HF & PstI)
... µl water
=> 50 µl in total
The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1h or up to 1:30h and analyzed by gel electrophoresis.
In case BSA was already part of the buffer, the following recipe was used:
... µl DNA (~500 ng)
2 µl buffer (e.g. NEB CutSmart buffer)
1 µl restriction enzymes
water ad 20 µl
The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1h or up to 1:30h and analyzed by gel electrophoresis.
Extraction of DNA fragments from an agarose gel
After gel electrophoresis, the gel parts containing the desired DNA fragement size were excised from the agarose gel with a clean and sharp scalpel. For DNA extraction the QIAquick® Gel Extraction Kit was used. Following the instrucion manual all necessary solutions have been prepared. The slices were weighted and accordingly Buffer QG added to the gel (for 1 slice 600 μ"

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," stock solution (40 mg/ml):
0.2 g X-gal is dissolved in 5 ml DMSO and stored at -20 °C in the dark. It is useful to aliquot the stock solution in 1.5-ml reaction tubes. Transformed S2060 E. coli strain (ID:47):
S2060 E. coli possess the lacZ gene under control of a PSP promoter. For the Blue Plaque Assay a transformed S2060 strain like E. coli strain ID:47 containing the AP of the S1059 strain (gene III under a PSP promoter) are used. (This protocol can be modified to investigate if the evolving phage can resist stronger selection pressure. Therefore S2060 strain has to be transformed with the associated AP and the antibiotics has to be adapted)
3. Procedure
Day 1: S2060 AP_PSP_gIII cells (ID:47) or the appropriate cell type are used to inoculate 4 mL of 2xYT medium containing 25 mM glucose and carbenicillin or the necessary antibiotic for that cell type.
The culture is placed in the 37°C shaker in the morning and are grown until an  OD600 of 0.6-0.8. In the meantime, 10 to 102-fold serial dilutions of the phage suspension are prepared with LB medium. 1 ml final volumes are convenient. To prevent cross-contamination filter tips must be used. The phage samples can be stored at 4 °C for a long time and still be able to infect E. coli cells. Shortly before the E. coli culture reaches the appropriate OD600 top agar (3 ml per plate) is transferred to a 50-ml falcon and placed in a preheated water bath at 50 °C. Top agar is then supplemented with the necessary antibiotic and the x-gal stock solution (40 mg/ml). For 10 ml top agar:
10 µl antibiotic (1000x)
100 µl X-gal stock solution (100x)
As soon as the E. coli culture reach an OD600 of 0.6-0.8, cell suspension is gently mixed by resuspension with a pipette and 50 µl are transferred to a 1.5-ml reaction tube for each condition. The following steps has to be performed quickly and separate for each condition. Phage suspension is shortly vortexed and 1 µl is pipetted to the E. coli culture. 700 µl of the top agar is thorough mixed"

Diary note regarding collaboration
We had a lot of fun with these three teams. The meet up is set in Hangzhou where two of the teams are located, and we spent our time together from July 26 to July 30. We arrived in Hangzhou at 2:00pm on July 26 and then went to a meeting with the representatives of the other three teams to plan the presentation and activities on July28 and July 30. The representatives came up with the idea of doing simple experiments in order to attract the kids. We spent some time at the meeting room thinking about the possible experiments we can do. We thought about different types of activity that can introduce our project and synthetic biology to the younger kids. However, we didn’t pass any of the plans due to feasibility problem or safety-related concerns.
On July 27, we visited the lab that ASTWS-China and Worldshaper-Nanjing are using. We went to see the facilities and were told about the functioning of the equipment there. Another meet up is held as well. We continued our discussion about the presentation and activities, and finally we decided doing science-related experiments would be fine as the condition in the museum wouldn’t allow the kids to sit down and"

CU-Boulder,2013,Team:CU-Boulder#Project#Kit#RestrictionEnzymes_-_-_TEXT.html," and AgeI. All three DNA sequences were extracted and purified with an extraction kit.
We then ligated EcoRI into the pSB1C3 backbone and EcoRI methylase into the pSB1C3 backbone at 16C for 12 hours. The ligation products were then transformed into DH10B cells and selected for on Chloramphenicol plates. We received over 200 colonies for EcoRI and about 150 colonies for EcoRI methylase.
The samples with the correct band size on the gel were sequenced. Both EcoRI and EcoRI methylase were sequence confirmed; however, we found a nonsense mutation in the methylase, which rendered it non-functional. At this point, we successfully produced and submitted a Freiburg 1C3 backbone with an EcoRI coding gene.
In order to fix the deletion in our methylase gene, we performed Site Directed Mutagenesis (SDM) using primers that flanked the deletion. One of these primers had an extra guanine on its tail in order to add back the missing nucleotide. This product was then transformed into chemically competent cells and selected for on Ampicillin. To test our new methylase in vivo, we grew two overnights: one of the non-functional methylase cells and one of the new methylase cells. The DNA was isolated through mini-prep. The plasmids were then digested with PstI and XbaI as a control to determine the expected bands when the plasmid was cut twice. To test the methylase’s ability to methylate the EcoRI site we also digested with PstI and EcoRI. The results can be seen below.
As can be seen by the two bands in lane 2, the non-functional methylase does not protect the DNA from EcoRI. However, in lane 4, there is a single band of about 4000bp indicating that the DNA was cut only once. The now functional methylase protected the EcoRI cut site showing that it is functional in vivo.
Next we tested our methylase for activity in vitro. We grew a fresh 250ml over night culture then lysed the cells using a French press. 25ul of the lysate were loaded into a 1%, no EtBr gel and ran for 5 minutes at 120V. 25ul were then removed from the gel.  We hypothesized that because enzymes moved slower through agarose gels than DNA, much of the DNA would enter the gel during this short time, leaving most of our methylase. This is referred to as"

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#NeuTest2_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM competition started in 2003 as a course for students of the MIT only. 2011, already 165 universities from all over the world competed against each other. This year, it is the first participation of the University of Goettingen, Germany. The iGEM competition is a great opportunity for students to gain and improve a multitude of skills that are necessary during a carrier as a molecular biologist. Such skills would be planning and organizing a project, including fund raising and team recruitment, coordination of lab work, designing experiments and working together as a team. Next to intensive lab work during the summer, also literature search and well-structured documentation of the experiments is crucial. Moreover, safety for humans and environment is key.
Homing Coli
Escherichia coli is a commonly used bacterial model organism. It has lots of beneficial traits, e.g. a short generation time and it can be easily manipulated. Most E. coli strains that are used in laboratories do not exhibit high motility. The crucial element for motility is the flagellum, which is rotated by a molecular motor within the cell wall. Consequently, these are reduced in cultivated E. coli strains.
Our goal is to create an E. coli strain with increased swimming motility on special  agar plates. Therefore, we will overexpress regulators and parts of the E. coli flagellum in cultivated strains in order to enhance bacterial swimming ability. The fastest E. coli strains will be selected and  further improved. At the same time we will then be able to create an effective motility-selection   method.
Now, you are probably wondering what the advantage of a fast E. coli might be. The beneficial fast phenotype can be combined with the ability of this bacterium to sense specific compounds in their environments. Chemo-receptors enable it to move towards or along gradients of such substances. We will use PCR-based site directed mutagenesis on the E. coli Tar receptor. The combination of speed and chemotaxis allows us to identify E. coli strains, which can sense interesting compounds. Thereby, an easy method for the detection of pollutants, toxins or even tumors could be provided.

They presented and discussed the current progress, the content of experiments and human practice of the two projects. Although the task of the two teams are quite different — their team focuses on “biological compass” for the information processing part and our team aims at degradation of pesticides for part of the environment — we had a wonderful communication. Different ideas and considerations offered us more interesting experiences.
At 19:30 pm, the two teams held a joint campus presentation on their own project in the lecture hall of library in Anhui University of Technology. 200 students participated in the joint presentation. Different perspectives, different themes, and different understandings had made more students concerned about synthetic biology and iGEM competition.
High School
Time：October 13, 2016
Location： Nanjing NO.1 Middle School
In order to make iGEM competition more widely known, our team members went to Nanjing NO.1 Middle School and introduced our project to students there. We presented former projects of NAU_CHINA iGEM team, general introduction to our 2016 project and the process of iGEM competition by using panels and interactive games. We are happy to find more potential igemers to join us.
Different people have different background. The ideas they shared impressed us and the words we said helped them.The interaction between the campus shaped our own self and the concept. Put ourselves in others' shoes made the moment engrave on mind, especially when we shared the information to the high school. Making them understand the concepts was different from the way used among the colleges. Ideas worth spreading!"

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

Project Description
Self-awareness of alcohol consumption and intoxication levels is surprisingly difficult to achieve. Our alcohol awareness tool, AlcoPatch, provides a cheap , bio-based, sustainable and robust solution to help increasing self-awareness. The AlcoPatch would provide users with a visible colour signal indicating their blood alcohol concentration in real time. Throughout the project, we have worked closely with the police, health care providers, charities and potential users to design a product that would meet the real needs of communities around the world. Having a rapid and reliable indicator to show visually when one has had enough could help reduce the undesired consequences of being too drunk. This helps people who do not want to get drunk, but would also have positive knock-on effects to the people around them, from reducing public disturbance to avoiding drink-driving.
Self-awareness of alcohol consumption and intoxication levels can be difficult for anyone to master. Through the exploration of trying to find a niche within our society that our project could be beneficial to, our project’s targeted audience has changed dramatically since the initial idea of the AlcoPatch. We have found that our AlcoPatch would have many applications to the people within our society whose aim is to not actually get drunk! Our patch would provide these people with a visible colour change according to their blood alcohol concentration thus giving them the ability to monitor their personal intoxication levels. Having an indicator to show how"

We can see that only  3.73% people understand synthetic biology very well; synthetic biology has got  great achievements in pharmaceutical, bio-energy, medical and many other fields.  Faced with safety issues of synthetic biology, 40.37% people indicate that they  would follow scientific principles to support the development of synthetic  biology. While 55.28% people support precautionary principle, emphasizing the  necessity to improve the supervision mechanism. 4.35% showed an attitude that  they do not care the safety problem, they will use as long as they can be  applied to life.
78.88%  people think people should be involved in the supervision and management of  biotechnology. 21.12% people disagree; they hold that people are so lack of  relevant biological knowledge that they cannot have a comprehensive  understanding of science.
If you have the opportunity to learn  synthetic biology-related courses and take part in IGEM, would you like to have  a try? 57.14% people answered yes, they expressed an willingness to have a try,  but do not attempt to spend too much time or energy. However, 24.84% people are  very glad to join IGEM. There are also 18.01% people that are not very  interested in it. If people have taken part in an IGEM team, 36.02% of them want  to study the environment and energy direction. 50.31% people are interested in  medical and pharmaceutical direction. 9.94% people suggest to study  agriculture, and green manufacturing direction.

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

Coming back to school, We discussed these proposals in depth, had a better understand of             the prospect of our project. We feel more encouraging to complete our tasks with great confidence!
Humanistic care
College Entrance Examination is a fateful moment for Chinese students, which will affect their future life to a certain extent. Our team participated in the college entrance examination volunteer activities and went to Tianjin Tanggu District High School for psychological counseling and stationery help services. We watched children nervously enter and relax out with a sense of helpful joy. At the same time, we hope that our love can pass on to them the spirit of             biological people, the purpose of igem, can affect their future interest in learning biology, to add talent to the world of biology.

Our HP activities do not want to be just a scientific porter, but also want to be a warm communicator. Our team has been volunteering in the Sunshine Garden after school. Recently, we carried our designed dolls around to the Sunshine Garden with us. We took these “older children” to play games, paint, build blocks and other intellectual development games with us. It can bring them joy.             Of course, we're going to stick with it and not stop making friends with them at the end of the iGEM game.

TUST's iGEMer paid close attention to the health of these freshmen , so we followed them into the physical examination center and closely followed their health reports. In chatting with stomatologists, we found that people's oral problems are very serious nowadays: people in their 40s and 50s have tetracycline teeth problems, young people have oral problems caused by smoking, betel nut chewing, and teenagers have insect teeth problems. Doctors say tetracycline teeth are decreasing, but they are still very grim. Therefore, we also hope that through our HP activities we can call             attention to oral health, attention to antibiotic use, from the root cause of the formation of tetracycline teeth.

Project design
The number of biotechnological applications has skyrocketed and have evolved to be one of the most ubiquitous aspects in our daily life in the past years. From uses in food industry to dietary supplements and science, white biotechnology is everywhere.
That’s why we try to recreate a widespread natural phenomenon called metabolic channelling synthetically to increase the yield of biochemical reactions. Metabolic channelling occurs when the enzymes responsible for a specific reaction are in close proximity to each other and thereby decrease the diffusion time of the substrates.
dCas9 approach:
In our first method, we utilize the DNA-binding function of deadCas9 (dCas9) to bind two enzymes of the Indoleacetic acid (IAA) pathway, IAA tryptophan monooxygenase (IAAM) and indoleacetamide hydrolase (IaaH) on a DNA-scaffold which we introduce into E.coli. By binding the enzymes on DNA, we decrease the distance the substrates have to travel in the cytoplasm and hope to achieve a higher output of Indoleacetic acid.
Scaffolds for inducing metabolic channelling with nucleic acids has been tried in several different ways already. For example, by the iGEM ZJU China team of 2012, where RNA cloverleaf structures were used to bind IAA enzymes to RNA[4]. They fused the enzymes to RNA-binding proteins from viral coat proteins (MS2 and PP7). These bound to the RNA and thus put the IAA enzymes close to each other (see picture below). With this concept, they were able to record a 1.4-fold increase in IAA output.

Stacking is done very carefully ensuring that there is not a single bubble present. Placed the transfer apparatus with black side facing black into the tank filled with transfer buffer. Set the machine at 0.35A for 1 hr. (The voltage noticed very carefully as it should not be lower than 80A or upper than 200A). Put the tank into ice box and check frequently short interval.
3. Antibody staining
3.1 Blocking After finishing the run, collected the PVDF paper. If the marker band were clearly which meant the protein transferred well and completely from gel to PVDF. Block the PVDF membrane for 1hr at room temperature in 50ml of 5% non-fat dry milk, in a 150mm culture dish on a shaker.
3.2 Primary antibody incubation Incubated with Anti-His antibody (mouse) diluted in 1xTBS+ 5% nonfat milk + 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4ºC. The primary antibody mix can be re-used (store at 4ºC.)

3.4 Primary antibody incubation Incubated with anti-mouse antibody for 2 hrs at RT in 1xTBS + 5% nonfat milk + 0.1% Tween 20.
3.5 Washing Washed the membrane 3 time 10 minutes each in TBST, at RT in a 150mm culture dish on a shaker. Removed excess reagent and covered the membrane in transparent plastic wrap.
4. Detection
Detected the protein with kit (2 ml/ membrane). Take two chemiluminescent reagents (peroxidase enzyme and radish horse peroxide) in separate Eppendorf tubes. Then aliquot solutions onto membrane in a 1:1 ratio and wait for 1 minute. Drain the solution and expose to FluorChem M System (Santa Clara, CA USA) to see the band.
PCR
Primer Design
Several principles should be followed in primer designing
1. The length of primers should be limited between 20~60bp. For overlapping PCR, the overlapping domain should contains at least 15bp. 2. GC% should be at around 40%~60%. 3. Before synthesis, blast the primer using"

Lac Inducible Expression Cassette for Hfq
The first step.
To study Hfq, we must first express and purify it. We did this by inserting the gene for Staphylococcus aureus Hfq into a lac inducible expression cassette previously constructed by iGEM Washington in 2010 (BBa_K314103).
The components of the expression cassette include:
f1 origin
lacI
lacI regulated lambda pL hybrid promoter
Elowitz (1999) strong RBS
The expression machinery has been optimized for use in E. coli.

via ""watch""; op elke wiki pagina heb je vanboven enkele links staan: page,discussion,edit,history,... op de pagina(s) die jouw interesseren klik je op ""watch"" (juist zoals je op de pagina die je wilt wijzigen op ""edit"" klikt); - Antoine
indien je dan geïnteresseerd bent in de laatste wijzigingen ga je naar Watchlist , zorg wel dat je ingelogd bent op jouw account, alle pages waar je op ""watch"" hebt gedrukt tonen er hun laatste wijzigingen met de naam wie de wijziging heeft aangebracht -- je kan ook simpleweg op een aparte pagina in je browserscherm ""Special:Watchlist"" typen ( https://2008.igem.org/Special:Watchlist ); - Antoine
interessant: scroll naar beneden op deze pagina (of eender welke wiki pagina), daar zie nog meerdere links, één ervan is ""My preferences"" --> klik erop en dan krijg je aan de linkerkant een tablijst --> klik op de ""Watchlist"" tab en daar kan je enkele opties selecteren, de nuttigste zijn: ""Add pages I create to my watchlist"" en ""Add pages I edit to my watchlist"", de verklaringen zijn duidelijk; - Antoine
vraagje: gebruikt iedereen hier Internet Explorer, of zijn er Firefox gebruikers bij (of enig andere browser)? Beschik namelijk over een stijlvolle dropdown ( Zandbak link ) zodat we een overzicht behouden in een zee van wiki pagina's, en aanpassen is eveneens zeer makkelijk. Bij Firefox treden er namelijk problemen op, omdat ze weer zo zelfvoldaan zijn wat betreft CSS en dan besluiten om de CSS niet te laten"

Part Registry
Die sogenannte [[Main_Page|Registry of Standardized Parts] (Eintragung der standardizierten Genbausteine) ist eine online Plattform, die für alle teilnehmenden iGEM-Teams frei zugänglich ist. Jedes Team fügt im Rahmen des Wettbewerbs neue ""Parts"" in die Datenbank ein und sendet die passenden Genbausteine per Post nach Bosten ins iGEM Hauptquartier. Im Gegenzug wird eine ausgewählte Zusammenstellung, das sogenannte ""Distribution Kit"", von bereits vorhandenen ""Parts"" an die teilnehmenden Teams versendet. ""Parts"", die nicht in der Zusammenstellung enthalten sind, können zusätzlich bei iGEM bestellt werden. Da die Anzahl der teilnehmenden Universitäten am iGEM Wettbewerb jährlich ansteigt, wächst auch die Menge an ""Parts"" in der Datenbank rapide an. Um die Datenbank übersichtlich und verständlich für neue Teams zu gestalten, wird die Plattform kontinuierlich überarbeitet. So sind umfangreiche Hilfsseiten und Beschreibungen zur Pflege und Eintragung neuer ""Parts"" zu finden.

Cambridge,2011,Team:Cambridge#Society#Questionnaire#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," moving away from the field afterwards. It must also be considered that our sample could be quite biased, since iGEM alumni who enjoyed participating in iGEM may have been more likely to find out about and complete our survey. Nevertheless, the effect of participating in iGEM for these alumni is significant, and may be considered by the organisers of iGEM as a big success.
In order to shed more light on what particular aspects of participating in iGEM caused these effects, we also looked at where the individual students made their principle contribution to their projects.
The vast majority of respondents contributed principally to biological experimentation (or ‘wet-work’, as it is commonly termed) in their iGEM project - which is perhaps unsurprising given the practical nature of the competition. Almost all biologists focused on this side of the project, while students who focused on the other aspects of the project were all non-biologists, with the exception of a single biologist who worked on software design. However, approximately half of the non-biologists also named their largest contribution to the project to be biological experimentation. This suggests that, at least in some teams, new students have been introduced to biology through the iGEM programme. This has certainly been the case in our personal experience, as more than half of the Cambridge 2011 iGEM team were non-biologists, yet we all participated eagerly in wet-work. Engineers became specialists in making electrophoresis gels and Gibson assembly, while a physicist became heavily involved in protein extraction. As a consequence, several members of our team are now keen to participate in research with a strong biological bent in the future.
Several other teams, however, seem to restrict students to focus on aspects of the project that play only to their strengths, so biology students would devote all their time to the wet-work while computer scientists (for example) would only work on modelling and software development. From our research, this restriction does not seem to have affected the influence that iGEM has on the students. For example, we have spoken to an engineering student who worked solely on modelling in her iGEM project, but subsequently (after some networking at the jamboree) took up a PhD in synthetic biology at another iGEM lab. We possess little more than anecdotal evidence, however, so more data needs to be gathered in order to draw any confident conclusions.
Is iGEM Self-Sustaining?
In order for an organisation to be sustainable over an extended period of time, it is crucial that there exists a continuing influx of people willing to participate in running it. We"

1) Prepare 6 x 50ml falcon tubes and 1x eppendorf tube.
Tube 1: M9 + 0.5% glucose (control)
Tube 2: M9 + 0.5% arabinose + 0.05% glucose
Tube 3: M9 + 0.5%  xylose + 0.05% glucose
Tube 4: M9 + 0.5% rhamnose + 0.05% glucose
Tube 5: M9 + 0.5% galactose + 0.05% glucose
Tube 6: M9 + 0.5% maltose + 0.05% glucose
Eppendorf tube: blank of secondary carbon sources.  (M9 + any sugar.  Sugars do not affect OD much)
2) To each 50ml tube, pipette in 40ml of M9 media
3) To each 50ml tube, add in the carbon source stock solutions to make up 0.5% secondary carbon source. Mix well.
4) Add 1ml of starter culture Top-10 cells to each 50ml tube (1:40 dilution).  Mix well
5) Pipette out 1ml from each 50ml tube into a cuvette.  These will be read using the spectrometer, with the eppendorf contents serving as a blank.  The blank can be reused.
6) Place in 28°C incubator with shaking.
7) Take similar spectrometer readings hourly.  From the 5th or 6th hour. the graph should start to plateau off.  Take half hour readings from 5th hour to more accurately determine shape of graph.
8) During the 5th hour ,pipette out 200uL from each 50ml tube  and put it in well A1 to A6 of the 96 well plate. A7 is the blank well. Perform 2 replicates for each tube
Now, wells A1-C6 will be filled with samples
9) Set up the plate reader to take OD readings at 600nm at specified intervals. (Using script IGEM Abs). Obtain readings overnight. Note: readings after 8 hours might not longer be accurate due to evaporation.
10) Determine background absorbance by measuring control well. This should be subtracted from subsequent absorbance readings.

If we had more time we could fiddle around with the enzyme rates, rate constants and other parameters in order to find a better prediction, and maybe get some more relevant data like for example how many bacteria are necessary for sufficient inulin generation or how much dietary sucrose we could remove from the host. What we have shown is that the system works as an inulin generator with inulin of DP=5 which is the main purpose after all.

NEPTUNE Collaborative Findings
Given that Neptune was built to provide an accessible, affordable, and convenient solution for designing, manufacturing, and operating microfluidic systems, it was only natural that we would test our toolchain by designing microfluidics for other iGEM wetlab teams. We were able to collaborate with both the MIT iGEM team and the Northeastern iGEM team. Through these exchanges, we were able to test the Neptune workflow while providing a wetlab team with microfluidics to test their biological systems.
Designing Automated Mammalian Cell Culture Devices
SEPT - OCT 2016 | A collaboration with the MIT 2016 iGEM Wetlab Team
Our collaboration with the MIT iGEM team involved designing, creating, and controlling microfluidic devices to culture mammalian cells on chip. The end goal of these experiments was to lay the groundwork for testing endometrial cell lines and their response to various levels of estrogen in an automated microfluidic setting.
PART 1
In our first on-site visit, we designed and fabricated a microfluidic device with specific parameters fit to trapping the MIT team's mammalian HEK293 cells. Our first iteration of chip included an input, cell traps surrounded by two valves, and an output, as shown. We automated the control of the valves using our servo-syringe combination pumps. To prepare the chip for the cells, first, we opened our valves to flow 1.2mL of ethanol solution inside the chip for sterilization. Next, we pulled 1mL of PBS (buffer solution) to clean out the ethanol solution for the benefit of the cells. Finally, we pulled 1ml of cell solution with a concentration of 1 x 10^6 cells/ml through the microfluidic chip. The two valves were then closed (trapping the cells and culture media inside) and the chip removed from the control infrastructure. From there"

Dalhousie_Halifax_NS,2016,Team:Dalhousie Halifax NS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," produce proteins encoded by the foreign genetic material. Vectors usually contain a selectable marker which can confer antibiotic resistance. The incorporation of the vector into a model organism provides that organism with selectable growth advantage, which can help to identify organisms containing the vector.
Introduction of vector (and foreign environmental DNA) into a model organism. The vector is often introduced into the model organism, Escherichia coli, through a process called transformation. Transformation can occur in a few ways such as chemical, electrical, or biological methods. This allows for the insertion of DNA into the cell followed by its maintenance and the stable production of plasmid-encoded proteins. The transformed cells are then grown on selective medium and only cells that contain the vector will survive and form colonies (because of the antibiotic resistance segment in the vector). Each colony that grows can be used to study a specific fragment of DNA from the environmental sample.
Examination of the DNA in the metagenomic library. The DNA inserted into the model organism will contain genes which will code for enzymes. We can design assay's that will test for particular enzyme function within the library and find cells that contain the DNA of interest. Using these assays, we are able to identify and characterize enzymes we are interested in.
Chemical Analysis
The chemical analysis part of our project allowed us to ensure that using E. coli in the softwood lumber industry would be feasible. It may not be feasible because trees make many antimicrobial compounds that could inhibit E. coli's ability to grow in these conditions. Our chemical analysis section allowed us to look into this and ensure we won't have any more problems down the road.
Why do this?
Bacteria have already established their role in industry, and their applicability in the industrial sector has been growing rapidly. Our work is definitely inspired with this in mind, but if we want to generate a strain that operates anywhere near pine tree resin, there is a caveat which must first be investigated.
Pine tree resin contains (amongst many other things) a mixture of terpenes. Terpenes are a class of compounds which are biosynthesized out of isoprene units. The terpenes often found in pine tree resin are known to exhibit anti-microbial properties -- this could be an issue if we try to utilize bacteria to break down softwood lumber, for example.
We opted to first investigate this issue by simply growing our bacteria (E. coli) in the presence of tree resin. We did not see any inhibition, but we didn't think we were safe quite yet. We used steam distillation (and conventional distillation too) to isolate terpenes from pine"

1.Nitric oxide sensor
We constructed our NO sensor in the pCDFDuet-1 plasmid (Figure 1)
According to the results of the ShanghaiTechChina_B 2016 team, 100μM SNP aqueous solution can                 continuously release NO, and the NO concentration is stable at about 5.5μM. This concentration is the                 concentration of NO in patients with IBD. Therefore, in the subsequent test of the NO sensor, the final                 concentration of the SNP aqueous solution we added was 100 μM.
We transformed the constructed NO sensor plasmid into DH5α, and cultured at 37 ℃ overnight to dilute to                 OD = 0.2. After 1.5 h of growth at 37 ℃, the inducer IPTG and SNP aqueous solution were added. After 6                 h at 37 ℃, 1 mL of the bacterial solution was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 1 min (Figure 2).
From left to right: control, 0.5mM IPTG without SNP, 1mM IPTG without SNP, 0.5mM IPTG with 100μM SNP,                 1mM IPTG with 100μM SNP.

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

When looking at the original transformation plates it can also be seen that the colonies have different sizes indicating accumulation of mutations. This could be because the RFP or the antirepressor are toxic to e.coli, or because of something else. Anyways, we decided to transform the ligation mixture again, and this time plating on LB+Kan so that we don't induce RFP and antirepressor.
RFP and GFP PCR products were purified, digested, purified again and run on a gel. They are ready for a ligation tomorrow.
We also restreaked our pIGR01 and pIGR02 constructs to see whether the very green colonies will stay green meaning that in some way they are stable, or whether they will become white meaning that there is a pressure for accumulations of mutations in order to get rid of GFP.
11-10-2010 Anastasiya and Patrick Anti-terminator group
Started off the day by running digestions made yesterday (pAT09, pAT10, pAT11) on a gel, these were then pcr cleaned up, and then ran on a gel again. On the gel we could see that the products were half digested (half were digested, other half not), thus we repeated the digestions of pAT09, pAT10 and pAT11.
Using the digestions that were purified, we started the new ligation series of pAT12, pAT13, pAT14, pAT15 and pAT16, which are the 2nd final constructs before adding the SPL's.
These were then tranformed and plated.
Digestions were also made of SPL (E+S) and GFP+RBS (X+P) which will be ligated into pSB4A5 (E+P).
Note: pcr clean ups of pAT09, pAT10 and pAT11 were all used up, if more needed of these products, new pcr's should be initiated.

I made O/N cultures of the restreaks from 09-10-10. The restreaks are from the transformations made 06-10-10. There are no O/N of constructs containing pBADz1/pBADz2 as these grow much slower and were therefore not ready.

At this point, we would like to thank our supervisors who have been accompanying us throughout the entire project. They provided us with invaluable feedback at the weekly meetings, gave us new ideas and promoted our research. We are glad for their engagement for this student-driven research project and that they have been helping us not only scientifically but also administratively to get insurance and a laboratory facility in which we could perform our research.
Advisor
Roger Draheim, University of Portsmouth, is our primary advisor.
He has been formerly working at the Stockholm University and is an expert in the field of Osmoregulation via EnvZ-OmpR pathways. He has been independently conducting similar experiments as we have and we could thus compare our data to his results. Among these experiments, you can find the prediction of EnvZ (extracellular domain) and the characterization of the EnvZ gene in his expression vector from which we derived our EnvZ biobrick (BBa_1766008). In both given examples, we got to similar results and can therefore give a confident conclusion to these results presented. He has provided us with the MDG147 and EPB30 strains which have a genetically integrated YFP/CFP reporter system depending on the phosphorylation status of OmpR. We would like to thank Roger for his advice, feedback and constructive suggestions throughout the entire project.
Others
Gunnar von Heijne, Stockholm University, has provided us with many good contacts (among which we find Roger Draheim) and has helped us to get the answers we needed from experts in the field. His kind and immediate reactions to questions related to our project has been very much acknowledged.
Martin Högbom, Stockholm University, is a structural biologist and has been supporting our project as we were creating our own chimeric constructs. He gave us an insight in the possibilities of protein folding and the strengths and weaknesses for structure predictions.
Jan Willem De Gier, Stockholm University, supported our project by giving us strong advice in questions related to surface protein expression. We furthermore could discuss with him the possibility of using spheroplasts for testing gene expression after our system. He kindly provided us with a protocol for spheroplasting E.Coli strains.
Tae Hyun Kang, The University of Texas Austin, is a PhD who has been supporting our project by sending us a protocol for the production of spheroplasts from E.Coli. We are very glad about our correspondance with him and for all the answers to our several questions.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi."

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html,"egrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant"

Inevitably, we felt our bacteria solved the issue of reducing carbon footprint by reducing the demand for fertilisers – but we still needed to find a way in which it could be used to feed the increasing urban populations, and increase accessibility to fresh produce.

Step 3: Implementation of Stakeholder Feedback
Once we had consulted the relevant stakeholders and felt we had gathered sufficient information we began to feed this in to the design and execution of the project.
Nafferton Farm Visit
Newcastle University have two farms where they conduct agricultural studies (Nafferton & Cockle Park Farm). . We thought visiting Nafferton farm would be an excellent opportunity for us to understand more about the context our bacteria may be used in. Touring the farm, we were shown different research sites on both conventional and organic farm land. We were given feedback on our project idea from a growers & farmers perspective, they were quick to raised concerns about releasing genetically modified organisms into their soil and insisted upon contained growth environments.
All in all, everyone at the farm was excited about the prospect of our project, especially as it has to potential to reduce the costs and environmental impact associated with conventional fertilisers.

Tuesday
For obtaining the PhyA, PhyB, and PIF3 genes, we have a number of methods we are pursuing.  1. Obtain cDNAs from another lab
a. Tuesday—The Mathews lab is willing to give us PhyA, but does not have PhyB or PIF3. They can help us with the construction of the PhyB and PIF3. We should ask them if they have a protocol they follow….
b. Wednesday--I have emailed the Mathews lab back, and will hopefully be meeting with Sarah Mathews later this week.
2. Obtain cDNAs from Biobricks registry
a. Tuesday--Pulled PhyB and PIF3 from the registry, as well as the PCB synthesis genes. The PCB synthesis genes look good according to registry sequence, but PhyB and PIF3 cite sequencing irregularities, so I am not hopeful.
b. Wednesday—Oliver compared the sequences from NCBI to the sequences given in the BioBricks registry for the PhyB and PIF3 and it does not look like they are correct, so that is not promising. We will continue with growing up the PCB biosynthetic enzymes though.
3. Obtain cDNAs from a cDNA library
a. Tuesday—No one seems to have a sample of the cDNA library we can have. Asked in the lab plant kid from 261r was in, he’s checking for us but is not hopeful. Purchase of a cDNA library is too expensive, $1200)

TAS_Taipei,2016,Team:TAS Taipei#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," Blackbox Approach. Model 2 is a complex system. We vary the input, GSR concentration, to get the outputs, crystallin damage over 50 years. We then connect the result to Model 1.
Crystallin Damage vs. GSR Level
According to literature data and our model, the naturally occurring GSR concentration is 10 uM (Fraunfelder 2008). All curves show crystallin damage decreasing as GSR levels are increased, which supports both research and experimental data, and suggests that this prototype is effective in preventing crystallin damage. However, GSR levels need to be raised significantly, up to 40+ uM from the natural 10 uM of GSR in order to show long-term protection.
Figure 4.3 shows the amount of GSR we need to maintain for 50 years in order to prevent a LOCS cataract of a certain severity. The row of interest is LOCS 2.5, the threshold for surgery. Notice that we say “maintain” the level of GSR. This level needs to be constant at all times for 50 years for full prevention. The delivery of GSR to maintain this level is discussed in Model 3.
Figure 4.3: Crystallin Damage vs. GSR. The graphed results from Model 2 allows us to find the GSR concentration for the LOCS 2.5 threshold. The yellow area above 2.5 indicates surgery is needed, while blue means it is not needed.
Conclusion
We need to maintain (NOT add) 43.5 uM of GSR in the lens so that the crystallin damage recorded over 50 years is below the LOCS 2.5 threshold.

Introduction
We have already found the threshold for crystallin damage, in a unit that is related to hydrogen peroxide concentration. Now, we find how much GSR would limit hydrogen peroxide enough so crystallin damage falls below the threshold.
Because of our definition of crystallin damage, by integrating a hydrogen peroxide vs. time graph, we effectively calculate crystallin damage. We build our model, with the goal of finding the hydrogen peroxide over a period of 50 years.
We chose 50 years, because we assume prevention would start at an early age, such as the 30s to 40s, when catar"

Super optimized modified yeast – light-emitting cell display
The aim of the project of the iGEM team of Eindhoven University of Technology in 2012 is to design and produce a new multi-colored display in which genetically engineered cells function as pixels, analogous to how a flat panel display works. The challenges are in reaching a high refresh rate of the screen, but also in creating a multi-colored prototype. There are three components to the display: genetically engineered cells that emit fluorescent light in response to an electrical stimulus (the 'pixels'), a device to provide stimuli to each pixel (the 'control grid'), and a computational model that predicts how cells will react to the stimuli from the device. The basic biological parts used in this project are yeast cells, fluorescent calcium sensors and voltage-gated calcium channels. The laboratory work will focus on integrating these parts and establishing the desired reactions to electrical stimuli in order to create the 'pixels' of the display. The project is based on the research of iGEM Valencia 2009 who built a display on a 96-wells plate from yeast cells with Aequorin, but a higher refresh rate and multiple colors are aspired in our project. Computational modeling will provide insight into the electrophysiology of yeast cells, the role of calcium channels and the most sensitive parameters in calcium homeostasis in order to optimize the biological system. We will build an electronic device that is compatible with biological material to provide control over the pixels. The custom build hardware of the device is complemented with software written in LabView to generate images on the screen.

This class of modelling approach simplifies the analysis, which is capable of capturing most of the properties of our system accurately. Nonetheless, the formulation approach, that considers diffusion processes as negligible may give rise to the loss of certain amount of information, which associated with molecular diffusion, can be critical to some special dynamic of the system.
To tackle this, NUS helped us in developing a diffusion framework by applying their RIOT modelling system. Grounded on our original chemical-kinetics-based ODE model, NUS modeler incorporated modules, which describe the diffusion of the repressors, fluorescent proteins, and both intracellular and extracellular inducers.
Thanks to their work, we have a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of our system on molecular level.
Construct Characterisation
In order to assist NUS to verify their characterisation data, we were characterising four of their constructs with different strengths processing a lactate responsive promoter and a sfGFP reporter gene on our end. Assay method was provided by NUS.
But it seemed to us that the bacteria culture did not grow well after transformation, and the blank solution also showed very high fluorescence signals, which were not compatible with the data obtained in NUS, making the results incomparable.

In AMB-1, Dr. Long-Fei Wu used pBBR111, a pBBR1MCS derivative harboring strong, inducible promoter Ptac, to construct an expression vector [ 15 ], achieving transformation by conjugation between Escherchia coli WM3064 and AMB-1 (a method developed by Arash Komeili, et al.)[ 16 ].
Those great examples truly set lights on successfully establishing a new chassis for magnetism in Parts Registry.
BUT WE AIM EVEN HIGHER!
Works from Matsunaga's lab revealed that transformation of AMB-1 by electroporation is feasible [ 17 ]. They enable a door to faster expression platform, avoiding drawbacks with conjugation, such as but not limited to: time consumption, mob gene and oriT restriction, requirement of specific E. coli strain, etc...
Furthermore, compared with the relatively adventurous adaptation of Ptac as promoter for exogenous gene expression, endogenous promoters identified from genomic DNA of magnetotactic strains provide more reliable and efficient ways. Recently identified endogenous promoters from MSR-1 [ 18 ] still lack thorough verification. Yet another endogeneous promoters system in AMB-1 [ 19 ] has been well characterized [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ]. See Chassis for elaborations.
Equipped with these knowledge bases, we are now confident in saying that ""the world is ready for a new chassis""!

Wells 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 contain reactive astrocytes co-transfected with pGL3 without a promoter (empty vector) and Renilla. These wells serve as a negative controls for this experiment. We expect to see negligible levels of luminescence from the firefly luciferase when compared to the luminescence in wells 1-6, as this pGL3 plasmid does not contain a promoter. The luminometer values of these wells serve as the reference for the background\noise of the experiment and will be used for calculating the relative activity for the tested promoters. 
Wells 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 contain reactive astrocyte cells which did not undergo transfection. These wells act as a luminescence baseline for each transfected cells and to validate that our experiment is not contaminated with plasmids. We expect to see low levels of luminescence both for Renilla and firefly luciferase in these wells.
In order to increase the transfection efficiency, we preformed this experiment twice with and without trypsin. The use of trypsin should enlarge the cell surface area, therefore improving the transfection efficiency. Therefore, we used both options in order to test the promoter activity.
Results:
We found that pF4/80  can drive luciferase expression in about 3 fold compare to the empty vector control samples, which indicate that this promoter could drive expression of gene/s.
Figure 10: The activity of F4/80 promoter in reactive astrocyte cell line (C8D30). Luciferase reporter assay demonstrating transcriptional activation mediated by promoters of F4/80 in C8D30 cells. The results show cells that got no treatment before transfection and cells were treated with trypsin before the transfection. The F4/80 promoter showed 3.05-fold increased activity without trypsin and 2.56- fold increased activity with trypsin, as compared to the control (empty vector). Relative luciferase expression results are presented after normalization to Renilla activity and represent the means ± standard deviation of three independent experiments.
Discussion:
As we found that the pF4/80 promoter is active in our reactive astrocytes cell line, it suggests that this promoter can be active both in reactive astrocytes and microglia cells.  Another explanation for the activity of this promoter could be that"

In order to enhance the specificities towards inducers, improvements were made based on the Brown’s Tristable Switch model in 2006. This year, three well-characterized repressible promoters are used: phlFp, tetp, and lacp. The whole construct is divided into three parts, and each contains one functional system with two protein coding sequences (CDS), creating an interconnected Tristable Switch. Moreover, mathematical modelling is applied to predict and verify the consistency of the experimental results. At present, it is by far possible and practical to apply the switch in biosensing which could be achieved by developing a combinatorial circuit of promoters and CDS. With its advantageous characteristics, it is foreseeable that the switch could be applied in a wider spectrum of fields in the near future, for example, biocomputational system and diseases diagnostic.
Overview
The Tristable Switch is built upon three repressible promoters, each driving the expression of the repressors regulating the other two promoters. A interconnected feedback system is formed to achieve the stable states of the system. State changing is realised by the addition of a specific inducer which negates the effect of one of the three repressors present. Below is a GIF animation demonstrating the the mechanism of the switch:

The regulation of the bacteriocin expression is a subject for external induction factors (IF). The regulating system is composed of three components; an inducing peptide - either IF or pheromone-activating factors, a transmembrane histidine kinase or a pheromone receptor and a response regulator Balciunas, E. M., Castillo Martinez, F. A., Todorov, S. D., Gombossy De Melo Franco, B. D., Converti, A., & Pinheiro De Souza Oliveira, R. (2013). Novel biotechnological applications of bacteriocins: A review. Food Control, 32, 134–142. . IF are small peptides that are ribosomally synthesized at low levels as a pre-peptide and are cleaved before secretion. IF factors are either secreted by the bacteriocin producer-strain itself or concurrent of the bacteriocin producing strain Balciunas, E. M., Castillo Martinez, F. A., Todorov, S. D., Gombossy De Melo Franco, B. D., Converti, A., & Pinheiro De Souza Oliveira, R. (2013). Novel biotechnological applications of bacteriocins: A review. Food Control, 32, 134–142. . The possibility of the production of IF factors by other strains makes, the regulatory and controllable aspect of bacteriocin production of a specific strain, a target for quorum sensing. IF binds to the correspondent histidine protein kinase and thus activate it to phosphorylate a response regulator, which then stimulates the transcription of target genes by binding to specific repeats that are present in many bacteriocin operons. The bacteriocin production is thereby autoregulated by the inducer peptide (IF), making it possible for the respective strain to possess positive or negative feedback or to be regulated, or even to regulate, related or competing strains. The production of IF are dependent of environmental conditions such as temperature and pH.

KULeuven,2008,Team:KULeuven_-_-_TEXT.html," is a synthetic biology competition for multidisciplinary teams of undergraduate students. It was first organized in 2004 by Drew Endy, Randy Rettberg and Tom Knight of MIT with two goals in mind: to yield new ideas in synthetic biology and to form the future researchers in this new scientific community. Whereas 5 US teams competed in 2004, the 2007 edition already had 750 students and advisors grouped in 54 teams from 19 countries. This year, the competition already counts 83 teams!
The core of the iGEM competition is to design and build a “new genetic machine” with BioBricks . BioBricks are standardized, off the shelf biological parts that are used by genetic network designers. All BioBricks that were made during previous iGEM competitions are registered and documented in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Each iGEM competition thus starts from the efforts of the previous years.

CHARACTERIZATION OF RED/FAR RED GENETIC SWITCH
In order to test the red-light switch, a GoldenBraid multipartite assembly reaction was performed to create a genetic construct composed by the transcriptional factor, PIF6, fused to a DNA-binding domain (E) and the photoreceptor (PhyB) fused to the activator domain (VP64) together with a nuclear location sequence (NLS). When PhyB (which carry a VP64 activator domain fused to it) is irradiated with 660nm light, its conformation changes and it interacts with PIF6 at the promoter site sparking off the signalling pathway (Fig. 1). A luciferase gene regulated by a minCMV promoter containing an Etr8 operator site was used as a reporter gene in order to characterize the behaviour of this optogenetic circuit.
Following the experimental design , our data shows differential expression rates between the ON state (red light) and the OFF state (dark conditions). As Figure 1C and 1D shows, plants irradiated with red light showed an increasing luciferase activity after 23 hours from red-light activation, plants kept in dark conditions exhibited lower expression rates (corresponding with the basal expression) and plants irradiated with white light showed a varying behaviour response. Constitutive expression controls under strong (35s promoter) and weak (pNOS promoter) promoters were treated in white light and dark conditions.
Note that in the graphs below same error bars have negative values. This is due to the assumption of symetrical standard error when Matlab is computing error bars. In this case, since there is a small sample size (n) and the standard deviation (s) has values close to the mean, the standard error (s/ sqrt(n)) is nearly the standard deviation, and consequently it is also close to the mean value. The positive value of the standard error is calculated, and because of the mentioned simetry assumption, the same absolute value is assumed for the negative standard error. Since Matlab does not have any non-negativity restriction imposed on this estimation, it is possible that the estimated standard error is higher than the mean value of the samples, obtaining negative results when the standard error is substracted to the mean.

New Results
Before going to Boston, we improved our protocol to characterize TUDelft BioBricks and showed the reproducibility of the results.
New protocol:
Both TUDelft plasmids are transformed into the E.coli NEB Turbo strain:
First plasmid: High copy plasmid with encoded generator to express I-SceI meganuclease, BBa_K175041 :
Resistance: Chloramphenicol
Second plasmid: High copy plasmid with encoded I-SceI restriction site, K175027 :
Resistance: Ampicillin and Kanamycin
Start a liquid culture with Amp and Cm to select bacteria which have both plasmids.
Incubate at 37°C  overnight.
Pellet and wash cells to remove Amp and Cm.
Re-dilute them in the LB to have OD = 0.05.
From the tube, start two liquid cultures:
The first culture with Cm.
The second culture with Cm and IPTG.
Incubate bacteria until OD = 0.5
Plate colonies from each tube on two different plates:
Select with Cm and Amp.
Select with Cm.
The advantage of the new version of our protocol is that we add IPTG at the very low OD, so we expect to have better induction of the meganuclease.
Experimental results:
In much the same way as with our previous experiment, we counted and compared the number of colonies on four plates corresponding to 4 conditions:
First, we compared the number of CFUs formed by the cells where we induced the I-SceI expression, plated with a single antibiotic or with both antibiotics. We expected that there would be fewer colonies on the double antibiotic plates, because the Ampicillin carrying plasmid would be lost not only due to the absence of selection during growth and basal expression level of I-SceI (as"
