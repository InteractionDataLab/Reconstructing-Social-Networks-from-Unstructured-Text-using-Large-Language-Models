Here we are ---- the one and the only CIEI-BJ (China International Education Institute - Beijing), building up with fourteen creative youthful beings and advisers. We gathered together with abundant passion and superhero-like sense of mission in heart. As high schoolers, we know of our disadvantage in knowledge clearly, and we convert into the motivation of forging ahead and the ability of constantly jumping out of the box. In another word, we are the green hands with limitless minds. Fortunate like us, we’ve always gotten our wonderful advisors beside us. 2017, CIEI-BJ is ready for the journey, joy and sorrow, awaiting in front.
It's 2017, we are trying our best for this competition as our estimable experience, best wishes to us and other teams and great thanks to our teachers.

Why am I here?
Once, I participated a debate competition which was about animal testing. I searched a lot of articles which were about the gene and experiments. The materials attracted me deeply and I was fascinated into it. Because of this reason, I began studying Biology. I participated the iGEM to improve my knowledges and experiences.

1 TCP Biodegradation achieved

3 P2A being an excellent linker in chimeric protein
4 Polycistronic co-expression system constructed
TCP Biodegradation achieved
Growth of E.coli strain MC1061 transformed DhaA+P2A+HheC and DhaA gene in LB medium with inducer and 5mM TCP respectively, as the substrate was monitored in batch culture. The concentration of the products were confirmed using GC column(AC5). Growth resulted in disappearance of the substrate and simultaneous formation of biomass, 2,3-DCP,  epichlorohydrin, chloropropanol, and glycerin. The result was screened by GC analysis. Above the degradation of TCP and the intermediate product 2,3-DCP indicate that multistep biodegradation are working. (Fig.1 and Fig.2). And cultivating  in medium with 2,3-DCP, the concentration of epichlorohydrin can be detected(Fig.2). It means HheC degrade 2,3-DCP to epichlorohydrin. The degradation followed the desired path, TCP will be degraded to glycerol finally. The deficiency of our project is chloropropanol and glycerin couldn’t be detected by the columns. In the future, new columns and new methods will be used.
Fig.1. E.coli MC1061 carried DhaA+P2A+HheC gene incubated in LB medium with TCP(5mM) at 30℃. The concentration of TCP and it mediate product 2,3-DCP  were measured by GC. 2,3-DCP was degraded at the same time.
Fig.2. E.coli MC1061 carried DhaA incubated in LB medium with TCP(5mM) at 30℃. The concentration of TCP and its mediate product 2,3-DCP were measured by GC. 2,3-DCP couldn’t be degraded.

Ligation of insert and pTUM104
Investigator: Martin y Aloís
Aim: Ligate the extracted plasmids of the experiment before
Due to the small yield we only were able to run 4 ligations:
1: pSB1C3 and P343   I: pSB1C3 and P343 OVER NIGHT at 16 °C   4: pYes and P343  IV: pYes and P344 OVER NIGHT at 16 °C
1 and 4 were directly transformed in E. Coli - to be picked the next day.
Transformation of over-weekend ligation of caffeine synthesis genes in pSB1C3 and pTUM104
Investigator: Saskia
Aim: Transformation of the ligation
Operational Sequence
The transformation procedure was carried out as previously described, whereas the entire ligation batch was used for transformation in XL1 blue chemo competent e.coli-cells. The 30 minutes on ice incubation was followed by the heat shock at 37°C for 5 minutes and an incubation at 180 rpm at 37°C for about 45 minutes. Afterwords, the suspension was plated on appropriate plates (pSB1C3 transformants with chloramphenicol, pTUM104 transformants with ampicillin) and incubated at 37°C over night. Besides, the pellet was also plated out (resuspension in about ca. 100 µl LB medium).
Note: This transformation was performed without knowing, that a transformation with 5 µl of every ligation batch was already done on saturday. Furthermore, clone picking and preparing of over night liquid cultures was made, too (on sunday).

Company 5 – left a voicemail and she emailed me back stating that due to the economic downfall, they were unable to help us this year. I sent a thank you letter and asked for contacts.
Company 6  the manager of Fundraising & sponsorship still hasn’t contacted me. However, the receptionist said that if they can’t get a hold of him for me or if he’s out of town they’ll give it to the Regional Manager to handle it. Follow up with them July 22
Company 7  sent sponsorship pkg on thrusday but no one got back to me so I called today and the person who deals with this told me that she thought we wanted money for travel so I told her that “it’s solely for lab purposes- and we’re seeking sponsorship to fund our project”. Then she asked me to resend it to her directly, so I resent it. Follow up with her July 22
Company 8 Couldn’t get  hold of the person in charge – so follow up tomorrow
The community relations Associate for Life Tech replied back to my mail and said that they are unable to help us or any other iGEM teams this due to a very small budge and layoffs….and they’ve been receiving emails from a whole bunch of iGEM companies for sponsorship.
I also wrote up the email for Jay Ingram and I’ll have it checked by Jamie, Jeremy and Fahd tomorrow before I send to you guys to double check.
I didn’t call the following b/c I called them on Friday/Thursday and they wanted some time to think about our proposal so this is what I’m going to do: Company 9 – Follow up on July 24 Company 10 – looking over pkg-follow up july 21. Company 11- looking over pkg- follow up july 22. Company 12 – Follow up 22- still looking over pkg

Meeting at Christian's Lab
Today was spent preparing the synthetic kingdom for the meeting at ICT with an educator friend of Sonja's. Mandy and I also showed the high school student that's with us for the week around second life. At the meeting we got quite a bit of insight on how to further improve our island.
For my portion:
Have ""exhibits""
Have a narrative (why do we care?)
Exploration should be more guided
more engineered cells
Tell people about what they are seeing

On this day, our team was formally established. BIT-China for one green earth is our slogan .And what we want to do is to improve the optimistic temperature from 37℃ to 42℃ in fermentation of E.coli ,then we can contribute to increase the competitive of  fermentative products with many aspects, including reducing the consumption of energy of source, simplifying productive process and improving the efficiency.
3/2/13 3-2
We design two systems to reach our goal. The first system is the customize thermotolerance system. We choose heat shock protein family (HSP) with the control of RNA thermometer. Another system is intelligent quorum regulating system, we use quorum sensing device and programmed cell death(PCD) device to control the cell density ,aiming at maintaining cell in an optimistic cell density to control the release of heat.
3/9/13 3-9
We optimized our design, and choose the red fluorescent protein as the goal products.
4/2/13 4-2
According to our goal, we designed some new genes chosen some known genes. Following figure is a brief gene line.
4/10/13 4-10
Combining the references and experimental verification, we finish the design of whole pathway. The following figure shows the detail information.

Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Project#Workshop_-_-_TEXT.html," familiarize ourselves with all the different projects.
Teams and their projects:
Caption:
Evry: sponges that could purify water
Bettencourt: probiotic deodorant, analysis of good and bad smells
Bordeaux: synthetic silk, “elasicoli”
Lyon: curli to remove nickel from water
Saclay: bioart project on the representation of life via a “lemon”
2. Rejected projects 11:30 am
Evry proposed sharing ideas that were scrapped such as Bettencourt’s idea of “exploding bacteria” or Saclay’s. It was an informal yet interesting way to see how the teams finally chose their projects. The major deterring factors were feasibility and time.
3. Ethics discussions 3:00 pm
Saclay organized this event. This was essentially a workshop to engage iGEMers in discussion. We talked about bioethics and bioart in particular. Details on the round table can be found on our wiki at this address.
4. Social event 8:00 pm
After dinner we held a party. Who knew iGEMers were party animals as well?
Sunday 8/3/2014
The following activities were prepared by Bettencourt, and were conducted in parallel starting from 10 am.
1. Sweat collection
Bettencourt asked us to engage in intense physical activity. Each participant stuck a sweat collecting patch under one of their armpits. This sweat was to be analyzed by Bettencourt.
2. Smell tests
Bettencourt had prepared several samples of sweat from their own members. We were to smell three samples and give our impressions on each one.
3. MOOC video
Each team explained their project in a 3-minute video which was to be uploaded on MOOC for high school students to watch – and hopefully be inspired to participate in iGEM themselves.
We had lunch and said our goodbyes around 3 pm.
Closing remarks
The meetup was quite a success. We were able to communicate with other French teams directly; chatting online and emails still seem to have their limits. That being said, the event was tweeted and posted on our Facebook pages, as well as the main page of iGEM. It was a great opportunity to promote French iGEM teams.
The interactive aspect of the meetup was key. Everyone was able to express their thoughts, and discussion resulted in further reflection on our projects and on synthetic biology in general. It was sort of a mini jamboree between French teams. We exchanged contact information of course"

Hi, my name is Dominik.
Who I am you ask? I’m the guy who is always a little loud, a little bit grumpy, a little bit over the top. The only thing I am not is little. Although my friends call me a little prick sometimes, they know they can always rely on me for help or make them smile after a long day in the lab.
If you want to look me up at any iGEM event, look out for the tall redhead with the cigarette.
Munter!

Jan Gundlach
When I was a child, I always wanted to keep track of everything happening around me and also to keep everything organized. I guess that this hasn’t changed since then, so I “earned” the nickname Sheriff. Even though I try to control these, sometimes annoying, characteristics, they manage to burst out from time to time.
Anyway, if you still want to find me at any iGEM event, you can also look out for a quite tall guy, but in contrast to Dominik I’m not redheaded and I won’t have a cigarette on me.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," cost advantage for production processes. Biolink brings together more than just biofilms; it combines the novel fields of synthetic biology and 3D printing into forming a new competency. By partnering with 3D printing manufacturers, we want to offer a highly-customized and specialized 3D biofilm printing service.
To gain a competitive edge, Biolink will form and preserve close relationships with clients, concentrating on high quality and specialization, rather than mass production. Clients targeted are from both healthcare production               and industrial manufacturing industries (companies selling biofilm removal products). Co-development of our service with our clients is crucial for achieving an optimal solution, tailored to their needs. We can find clients and 3D printer               manufacturers leveraging our professional network gained through iGEM. Discussions already held with various actors from the industrial and academic setting seem encouraging. Moreover, reports of growth in both 3D printing and Synthetic               biology industries reflect a favorable business environment.
The future business will build upon the iGEM team structure. The Biolink team structure will be versatile, so that it can easily adapt to special requirements of clients and speculate emerging technology. We are proud of being               a strong team, with cohesion compensating for lack of experience. By adding team members that fill our expertise gaps, we will be able to competently run a company providing the service we are proposing.
With Biolink, we want to form an image that encourages creativity and sheds light over synthetic biology. Our current 3D printer is made out of a DIY kit that is easy to build. Moreover, we organized social events with students               to see what they think about Synthetic Biology in general and our project in particular.
Company and Project Description
Our mission is to contribute to better and cheaper pharmaceutical and health products. By ambitioning to provide an innovative method of biofilm formation, we want to help increase the efficiency of manufacturing and testing           processes. We deliver a partly automated, replicable and efficient solution by 3D printing biofilms. The method will partially replace some manual steps of current biofilm formation processes.
Back to Top
Healthcare systems are developing all over the world, increasing the demand for pharmaceutical and healthcare products yearly. In order to increase supply, while maintaining or even lowering prices, the production process needs to be more efficient. Our vision is to partly automate biofilm processes for producing medicine and health care products, and removing detrimental biofilms that affect industrial equipment.
Back to Top
In realising our mission, we are guided by our core values:
Integrity:
to be self-critical, to respect regulations and never knowingly act in the detriment of any"

Well, there is not much to say: I did my Bachelor studies in Biology in Göttingen, my Bachelor thesis was in Genetics. After a single Master semester in Biochemistry in Düsseldorf, I went “ruefully” back to Göttingen. Now, I’m studying “Microbiology & Biochemistry”. My scientific interests range from everything to nothing in particular: All types of eukaryotes or prokaryotes. Their evolution, ecology, physiology and molecular biology. Even non-living stuff like Physics and Chemistry is fine. The reason why I’m participating in our iGEM team? - Sounds like fun.

Genetic Engineering
In this section of our protocol pages you can read more about our methods for cloning and BioBrick assembly.
Genetic engineering is a basic tool of synthetic biology. With the help of standardized DNA building blocks (BioBricks) it is fairly easy to create new and modify existing natural systems. The methods we have used in our project to create BioBricks and to modify, mutate, transform and analyse DNA are presented in this section.
Whole Genome Isolation
For the isolation we used a Plasmid Miniprep Kit .
Standard Protocol:
Centrifuge 10 mL of over-night liquid culture
Resuspend pellet in 800 µL of resuspension solution
Ribolyse three times for 60 s with 6500 rpm (30 s break between every run, 400 mg beads)
Centrifuge 3 min at 10,000 rpm
Transfer 500 µL of supernatant into new 2 mL tube
Add 500 µL of lysis buffer, invert 4 - 6 times
Add 700 µL of neutralisation buffer, invert 4 - 6 times
Centrifuge 10 min at 12,000 rpm
Transfer 2 x 600 µL of supernatant into spin column (centrifuge down each time for 30 s at 12,000 rpm)

Toronto,2017,Team:Toronto#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"For amplicons between 3–6kb, use 2.5–5 units/50µl reaction
Templates
Use of high quality, purified DNA templates greatly enhances the success of PCR. Recommended amounts of DNA template for a 50µl reaction are as follows:
Genomic DNA: 1ng-1µg
Plasmid or viral DNA: 1 pg–1 ng
Equipment
Thermocycler
PCR tubes
Procedure
Reaction Setup:
Due to the presence of the inhibitor, reactions can be assembled on the bench at room temperature and transferred to a thermocycler. No separate activation step is required to release the inhibitor from the enzyme.
Preheat a thermocycler to the denaturation temperature (94°C)
Mix and centrifuge all components prior to use.
Assemble all reaction components. Gently mix the reaction, collecting all liquid to the bottom of the tube by a quick spin if necessary.
Note: Overlay the sample with mineral oil if using a PCR machine without a heated lid.
Quickly transfer PCR tubes from ice to PCR machine previously preheated to 98°C and begin thermocycling.

Q5 (High Fidelity) PCR (PCR)
Introduction
General Guidelines
Primers: Oligonucleotide primers are generally 20–40 nucleotides in length and ideally have a GC content of 40–60%. Computer programs such as Primer3 can be used to design or analyze primers. The best results are typically seen when using each primer at a final concentration of 0.5 µM in the reaction.
Mg2+ and additives: Mg2+ concentration of 2.0mM is optimal for most PCR products generated with Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase. When used at a final concentration of 1X, the Q5 Reaction Buffer provides the"

Such low prices in combination with the DIY concept opens a grand new customer market and lets our device compete with commercially available products. Especially in developing counties our WatsOn could help improve health infrastructure since high cost are eliminated as an obstacle. The low material costs and the high technical flexibility turn WatsOn into an adequate device for developing countries, community labs and the biohacking scene. Particularly for developing countries, such a low-budget device poses a good alternative to regular devices for detecting pathogens and other bacteria. With our device, we create access to modern technology and working methods for everybody.
WatsOn's self-made concept makes it available for low budged institutions
For WatsOn, we offer both the construction manual and the image processing software Measurarty. Since we do not offer everything in one kit, it is possible for the user to modify the device and software according to personal needs such as adjusting the range od detectable microorganisms. By engineering the Cellocks detection of other pathogens is theoretically possible. However, please always mind the respective safety aspects when dealing with GMOs and human pathogens. Moverover, it is possible to detect not just the fluorescence of GFP and iLOV. Just by changing the filters and/or LEDs, the device can be modified such that the fluorescence other regularly used reporter proteins like YFP, CFP or RFP can be detected.

<partinfo>BBa_B0031</partinfo> (negative control, a non-fluorescent culture)
Cultures were grown ON at 37°C, 220 rpm.
The following day cultures were diluted 1:100 and let grow again for about five hours at 37°C, 220 rpm.
The optical density (O.D.) of each culture was than measured with TECAN Infinte F200. Samples were diluted in order to obtain the same O.D. equal to 0.02.
Then we performed a 21-hour experiment with measurements of absorbance and green fluorescence every five minutes with TECAN Infinite F200; cultures were shaken for 15 seconds every five minutes. Acquired data were blanked by subtracting the media absorbance (for absorbance measurements) and the <partinfo>BBa_B0031</partinfo> fluorescence (for fluorescence measurements). Then, the relative GFP synthesis rate per cell was evaluated by computing (1/O.D.600)*dGFP/dt, where O.D.600 is the blanked absorbance of the culture of interest and GFP is its blanked fluorescence. Each value shown below is the mean of three measurements in exponential phase and error bars represent the 95% confidence interval of the mean.

IMPROVED PART
Cup 1
Original Part: BBa_K586000
Submitted Part: GreenfieldINUSA 2011
Designed by: Chris Thompson
Rationale behind improvement: We have improved this part by introducing a hexahistidine tag to it, this has proven to be the optimal length for purification. Adding the histidine tag creates the opportunity to use a simpler method of purification, as well as increase selectivity for the desired protein."

Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#proves4_-_-_TEXT.html," moment, when I added a small amount of seawater to the solution and saw that its light became explosively strong. The experiment showed that some component of seawater activates the luminescence. Because the composition of seawater is known, I quickly discovered that the activator is Ca2+. The discovery of Ca2+ as the activator in turn suggested that EDTA should serve as a better inhibitor of luminescence than acidification during the extraction of the lightemitting principle. On the basis of these data, we devised a method of extracting the light-emitting principle.
With a workable procedure in hand for extracting the luminescent principle, our next task was to catch and process as many jellyfish as possible. We would collect jellyfish from 6 to 8 AM, then after a quick breakfast, we would cut rings from the jellyfish until noon. We devoted all afternoon to the extraction. After dinner, we again collected jellyfish from 6:30 to 8:30 PM, and the catch was kept in an aquarium to be processed next day together with the catch of the next morning. We soon found that the bottleneck of the operation was the step of cutting rings with scissors, which is a delicate and very slow process. Even after considerable practice, it took more than 1 minute to cut one jellyfish ring, and 3 hours of work by four persons could not produce more than 500 rings. To increase productivity, we hired several high school girls, trained them, and paid them 2 cents for each ring they cut. We also decided to buy jellyfish from the kids of scientists living on the campus, paying a penny for each jellyfish. This job provided dual benefits, the fun of catching jellyfish and of earning money. I remember a 6- or 7- year-old girl who grossed more than 10 dollars in 2 days (probably with parental help). Unfortunately, just when our operation was in full swing, the jellyfish suddenly vanished from the area. Thus, we extracted and processed only about 10,000 specimens of Aequorea that summer.
We returned to Princeton with the jellyfish extract packed in dry ice, and then began to purify the lightemitting principle from the extract by repeated chromatography on various kinds of large columns. It was a long process, and the utmost care was required to prevent the luminescence activity from being lost, which could be brought about by many causes. We completed the purification in early 1962, obtaining about 5 mg of the lightemitting principle. The substance was found to be a"

In the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, the first row and first column are subject to the gap penalty. Also, in the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, the scores can be negative. Lastly, the traceback always starts at the lower right corner of the matrix and ends at the upper left corner.
Combination of Scoring
We use the Smith-Waterman algorithm ( Smith et al., 1981 ) and the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm ( Needleman et al., 1970 ) to compute the local and global alignment of the input sequence with respect to our custom database. Additionally, we use a hybrid form, semi-global alignment that has been implemented in the BioStrings package in R ( Pages et al., 2018 ). We then study the effect of each alignment algorithm on the gene doping classification. We add all alignment scores for a sequence to give a final total alignment score. We varied the weights of the different alignment scores to identify their influence on the characterisation of gene doping and found varying outcomes, as can be seen in the results section.
Machine Learning
We use the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to classify the input sequence as natural EPO, artificial EPO or other DNA. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm is a non-parametric pattern recognition method that can classify elements based on their value compared to direct nearest neighbors. In this instance, we chose to classify based on the four nearest neighbours. If no distinction can be made based on the four neighbors, the algorithm as has been implemented in R ( Torgo, 2010 ) will tell. The classification is carried out in two steps. First, the input sequence is aligned to natural EPO DNA. In a second step, the input DNA is aligned to gene doping DNA, resulting in the distinction between gene doping DNA and any other non-EPO DNA.
Input Parameters
The k-NN algorithm ( Torgo, 2010 ) takes a training and testing set as input, where the training set is the database. The most important input parameters are:
$Cl1$ is a vector with classification labels, in which the number of elements match the number of classes in the training data set. This means that this vector contains elements corresponding to the amount of classes and the amount of corresponding elements to be classified in these classes for the training data set. In this case $cl1$ is a vector of factors that are ‘false’ for the first $45$ elements of the normalized_score matrix, meaning classified as gene doping, and ‘true’"

Questionnaire in our survey
We conducted a wide survey targeted at the general public, with respondents ranging from high school students to working citizens, in collaboration with the Kyoto Institute of Technology ( KIT-Kyoto ) and Ehime University ( Ehime-Japan ). The survey had two objectives. The first was to find how Japanese people feel or think about synthetic biology and its associated issues such as bioethics and safety. The second was to capture the public perception of radiation in Japan. We surveyed people who came not only from biological backgrounds but also from various other fields of study. We also obtained feedback from visitors to our universities' open campus events. In addition, we made an online version of our questionnaire to survey even more people from various walks of life.

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

But the continued optimization is limited and the data integrity is getting worse. The results of the linear regression model require further optimization and improvement.So a multivariate nonlinear quadratic regression has been tried.
Multiple quadratic regression model
Establishment and solution of multiple quadratic regression models
A multivariate quadratic regression equation is established using rstool(x, y, 'model', alpha). The 'model' option refers to selecting one of the following four models (input with a string, which default is a linear model):
The function output includes regression parameters, residual standard deviation, and residuals. You can determine which is best by comparing the standard deviation of multiple models by modifying the value of model.
This problem ends with a completely quadratic method for multivariate nonlinear quadratic regression.That is by using the model (IX)
(Model (IX) where y represents the concentration,x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 representing the B, G, R, H, S)
Substituting data for multivariate quadratic regression fitting.The specific results are shown in Fig.5,Table2 and model (X).

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html," the response. We found different alternatives in the iGEM Registry but most of them were not properly characterized. We could not find reliable experiences of the use of such light receptors or, when we found them, the receptor protein was not available. Our requirements for the light receptor system were following: 1) it has worked for other iGEM teams 2) it should work in E. coli 3) it is available in the Registry (and preferably in the 2014 distribution) 4) it does not require any cofactors or special strains 5) short response time and sensitivity. In this section, we discuss about the different alternatives we found and what made us choose the YF1 protein. We also introduce the mechanism how the light signal is conveyed in our system.
Phytochrome interacting factors (PIF's) were used by some previous iGEM teams, including Freiburg 2013 and TU Munich 2012. The actual red light sensing protein is called Phytochrome B and in the active form it binds to the PIF ( BBa_K1150005 or BBa_K365000 ). Thus, the cell also needs to express Phytochrome B. However, these PIFs were derived from Arabidopsis thaliana, which is an eukaryotic organism. Moreover, the response mechanism would require fusing the two proteins to the actual DNA binding domain and transcription factor. Unfortunately, Freiburg team only succeeded in 1.3-fold induction of gene expression after 48 hours of incubation in red light and TU Munich did not manage to implement the light sensing part in their kill switch.
The Peking 2012 team designed an ultra-sensitive light sensor for luminescence. They combined a LOV domain, a dimerizing domain and a DNA-binding LexA domain. Such protein becomes active when the cells are illuminated with 440 - 480 nm light. In active form, the dimerizing domains facilitate formation of LexA dimer which is able to bind DNA and repress transcription in only such form. Whereas their light sensing system seemed to work very well there were three issues with it. Firstly, their light sensing system was not available and secondly, it might have been too sensitive; controlling the light at very low intensities could be rather challenging. Furthermore, LexA is a part of SOS system which is integral part of the E. coli genome so it might interfere with indigenous E. coli genes. However, according to Peking 2012, mutated version of LexA could solve this problem.

And β-galactosidase can make colonies blue with chromogenic substrate X-gal and inducer IPTG. Inside the sequence there is a MCS. If the target sequence inserts successfully into the MCS, and is long enough to destroy the ORF of lacZ, the colonies will remain white. Therefore, we can easily distinguish the colonies which do not get the right plasmid transformed.  Certainly, there are several situations that may lead to false positive or wrong judgement. For example, non-target sequence may insert into the vector, or, X-gal may not color enough after 12 hours’ cultivation.
Protocol:
1. Spread 40μl 20mg/ml X-gal (final concentration 2%) and 7μl 200mg/ml IPTG (final concentration 20%) on the plate. 2. Spread the bacterial liquid after X-gal and IPTG dry fully. 3. Culture the plate for 12h under 37℃ 4. If the colonies do not color obviously, put the plate into the 4℃ refrigerator for several hours. 5. Pick the white colony and inoculate.
Inoculation:
1. Prepare 15ml test tube, add 5ml LB medium and 5μl Amp (final concentration 50μg/ml) into the tube. The volume of the medium should not exceed 1/3 volume of the tube, or else the bacteria may be deprived of oxygen.
2. Pick the selected colony by the tip and leave the tip directly into the tube. Be careful that the selected colony should be white and round, without many satellite colonies around. Make sure that the picked colony is a single colony.
3. Shake overnight. With temperature of 37℃ and rate of 220rpm.
Transformation Examination

UT-Tokyo,2014,Team:UT-Tokyo#Counter#Project#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," used chemical Langevin equation (CLE), the linear noise approximation (LNA), and the two-moment approximation (2MA).
The traditional Langevin approach is based on the assumption that the time-rate of abundance (copy number or concentration) or the flux of a component can be decomposed into a deterministic flux and  a Langevin noise term, which is a Gaussian (white noise) process with zero mean and amplitude determined by the system dynamics. This separation of noise from system dynamics may be a reasonable assumption for external noise that arises from the interaction of the system with the other systems (such as the environment), but cannot be assumed for the internal noise that arises from within the system. Internal noise is not something that can be isolated from the system, because it results from the discrete nature of the underlying molecular events. Any noise term in the model must be derived from the system dynamics and cannot be presupposed in an ad hoc manner. However, the CLE does not suffer from above criticism because Gillespie derived it from the CME description. The CLE allows much faster simulations compared to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and its variants. The CLE is a stochastic different equation (dealing directly with random variables rather than moments) and has no direct way of representing the mean and (co)variance and the coupling between the two. That does not imply the CLE, like the LNA, which has the same mean as the solution of deterministic model, ignores the coupling.
Markov processes form the basis of the vast majority of stochastic models of dynamical systems. At the center of a stochastic analysis is the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation (CKE), which describes the evolution of a Markov process over time. From the CKE stem three equations of practical importance: the master equation for jump Markov processes, the Fokker-Planck equation for continuous Markov processes, and the differential Chapman-Kolmogorov equation (dCKE) for processes made up both the continuous and jump parts.
Stochastic Formulation and Markov Process
Since the occurrence of reactions involves discrete and random events at the microscopic level, it is impossible to deterministically predict the progress of reactions in terms of the macroscopic variables (observables).
Our goal is to determine how the process N(t) of copy numbers evolves in time. Starting at time t=0 from some initial state N(0), every sample path of the process remains in state N(0) for a random amount of time W1 until the occurrence of a reaction takes process to a new state N(W1); it"

""Lange Nacht der Forschung""
On April 29 we were able to present the iGEM-competition, synthetic biology, as well as, the general idea of our project at “Lange Nacht der Forschung”. This is an event organized by the Austrian broadcast to show the general public what we are doing in research including chances and visions.  Together with the institute of molecular biotechnology and ACIB we facilitated the visitors to get a first glance at microbiology, enzymes, and the field of genetic engineering, as well as, synthetic biology. For example we did an isolation of DNA from strawberries with ordinary consumables. Especially the DNA isolation was our task, together with the Austrian part of the last year’s iGEM Team “Manchester-Graz”. All over the event we extracted DNA together with hundreds of visitors, while a few of us gave an introduction to DNA and the general construction of a cell. Furthermore, we created a poster about our project and answered different questions about it and about the topic in general. The range of asked questions was enormous. There were some easy ones like:
Q: What is the difference between DNA and DNS?
A: DNS is the German expression for DNA. The A stands for acid. In German it would is S for “Säure”. In the course of time DNS was replaced by DNA also here in Austria.
Q: Why do we need genetic engineering? We did not need it for decades! Why now?
A: Our modern world would not work without genetic engineering anymore. Many things in our daily life are made by microorganisms; E.g. citric acid and insulin, just to name 2 very popular examples.  The next thing is that it is true that we had no need for genetic engineering in the past. But what we can see is that the mankind wants to spend less and less money for food and other commodities. Without plants and genetic engineering it would not be possible to provide 1kg of pork meat for less than €2,-  Even our forefathers did kind of genetic engineering. For sure they did not use our methods, but they always cultivated"

Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM this year. I first learned about it from Engineering Student Newsletter as a fellow Engineering Physics student gave his account of being in iGEM. At this point I was already aiming to specialize in engineering with medical or a biological application making iGEM the perfect way to extend my experience into biology. Furthermore iGEM was a rare chance to broaden my scope and meet non-engineers.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to gain experience in wet lab and gain a better understanding of what it means to engineer organisms.
What inspires you:
Technology and science is like magic when you don't understand it. But like all good magic, once you know the trick to it, it becomes your's to use.
Desired Impact on the World:
Contributing to the medical field.
Hobbies:
Cycling and photography.

Jeffrey Pea
Major and Year:
Microbiology and Immunology (2nd Year)
Why iGEM:
Having just joined this year, I heard about iGEM throughout my first year but was not exactly sure what it was. However, after going to several introductory meetings I was immediately hooked by passionate and knowledgeable everyone was on the team. The realm of synthetic biology seemed truly fascinating, for it was a field I wasn't very familiar with and yet very curious about. Soon, I began to realize that iGEM provided an outlet for me to be exploratory and innovative in research, using the fundamental knowledge I learned previously and implementing them in novel experiments. The combination of being able to apply my learning in a laboratory setting, being able to learn more advanced techniques related my background, and being able to immerse myself in an exponentially growing field that is synthetic biology is the main reasoning for joining the iGEM team.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
By being a part of iGEM, I hope to become a more well-rounded scientist and researcher. My goal is to become more knowledgeable in the field of synthetic biology, whether that is through reading background content or applying"

When a sequence between two recombination sites has been switched, the sites are modified such that a second recombination event is impossible.
AND gates
The E.calculus full adder uses two different AND gates.
The first AND gate is composed of one promoter followed by two transcription terminators. Each terminator is surrounded by two recombination sites, each pair beeing recognized by two different recombinases: Bxb1 integrase and TP 901.1 integrase.
The two terminators are then followed by the downstream gene (with its own rbs and terminator).
If there is one input, the corresponding recombinase will be produced (the red one or the blue one), so one or the other terminator will be switched off and can then let the polymerase go.
It needs both recombinases production to transcript the downstream gene.
Move the mouse over the figure to see how it works!
For the design of the other AND gate, it is the ouput gene that has been put between the two pairs of recombination sites.
At the resting state (no gate activation), both the promoter and the gene (with its own rbs and terminator) are in the wrong direction and are therefore not fonctionnal. Both are surrounded by recombination sites recognized by two different recombinases (Phic31 integrase and FimE)
If there is one input, the corresponding recombinase will be produced (either the purple one or the green one), so either one of the promoter or the gene will be switched to the right direction. The transcription of the output gene will occur only in the presence of both recombinases, when the promoter and the gene are in the right direction.
Move the mouse over the figure to see how it works!
XOR gates
The E.calculus full adder uses two different XOR gates.
The first one has the same design than the first AND gate. It is composed of one terminator surrounded by two different recombination sites (Bxb1 and TP901.1, same as for the first AND gate).
If there is one input, the corresponding recombinase will be produced (the red one or the blue one), so the terminator will be switched off and the downstream output gene can be transcribed.  When both recombinases are present, the terminator is switched twice: transcription is terminated. This system is designed to be activated (transcription of the output gene) only in the presence of one or the other recombinase, but not the two together.

The Game
We thought that one of the most important groups to inform about Synthetic Biology was children and teenagers, since they will grow to be the scientists of tomorrow. We thought that a really good way to reach them was through a video-game.
The idea was to create a RPG game where you need to gather knowledge and information of Synthetic Biology in order to win.  We made the game in Spanish and English to spread our message even further and the statistics up to this date says that 450 people have played our game.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2016,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," to be approximately:
Now that we know the approximate PAL production over time, we can make the model reflect that in order to make it more accurate. We created a new model incorporating the PAL production equation to produce the following graphs for possible concentrations for PheP within cell.
A more comprehencable graph is shown below, taking out the TCA concentration corresponding to each different concentrations of PheP.
From experimental data (see below), we showed that TCA concentration after 4 hours is about 20 umol/g DW, which corresponds to:
Experiment results:
Reaction took place in 20 ml of substrate medium with 25mM of L-phenylalanine for 20 min at 30⁰C. AvPAL was expressed for 4 hours before the experiment to reach a steady state concentration within the cells.
Discussion
Comparing the model and experimental data indicates that the concentration of PheP in cell is in the order of 10^1 uM. This value is promissing in that it is a realistic concentration for a transporter protein on the cell membrane. However, we have shown in the previous model that we require over 10^2 uM PheP  expression in order to have a significant decrease in Phenylalanine concentration outside the cell.
There are two indications:
1. The current design may be insufficient to mop phenylalanine so that it may have to be readjusted to suit practical application.
2. The method we used to model passive diffusion may have been underestimating the intake of phenylalanine into the cell, in which case convertion into TCA will happen in a shorter period than is indicated in the model.

Environmental Safety
Steps were taken to limit the spread of potentially harmful genes should our biological system be leaked into the environment.
Both  bacterial cell strains used (E. coli DH10B and B. subtilis 168)  possess an amino acid metabolism deficiency that reduce their competitiveness in the wild. DH10B exhibits leucine deficiency while 168 exhibits tryptophan deficiency. Such phenotypes reduce the chance these bacterial strains have when surviving beyond the lab.
E.  coli DH10B was used exclusively when building our constructs. All DH10B cells are classified F- and thus do not possess the Fertility factor. The risk of these cells acting as a donor in horizontal gene transfer via conjugation is greatly reduced.
To limit the potential of Bmp2 horizontal gene transfer, the antitoxin component  of our toxin-antitoxin cassette has been designed into an integration plasmid  with antibiotic resistance selectivity for integration. This means that while the genes for BMP2 and toxin expression exist in plasmid form and can potentially be transferred, the recipient cell cannot obtain the antitoxin and thus will be killed.
Prior to disposal, harmful waste (toxic and/or biohazardous) was clearly separated and sterilized, either by application of bleach, or autoclaving.

The 7th grade team of science teachers, eager and hardworking to support their students’ learning in new and different ways, was equally important to the collaborative work we have begun at Farmwell.
Incorporation of Building with Biology activities to supplement a new genetic engineering component of the school curriculum. The expected outcome are; to enhance inquiry into the topic of synthetic biology while learning about its basics, to further explore this topic through conversations about its applications from perspectives of societal and environmental benefits, safety, etc., and to encourage students to think about problems they see and consider solutions that may include genetic engineering.

Already begun, we are supporting the teachers by sharing our research expertise through prepared materials to help guide the research process and by meeting with students. We seek to encourage, motivate, support and foster long-term interest in being thinkers and problem solvers.
Stone Bridge High School
When we reached out to our County’s Science supervisor’s office in early August requesting lab to continue our iGEM work, Mrs. Jennifer Chang promptly put us in touch with Dr. Janet Cascio, an AP Biology teacher and the school’s Independent Science Research teacher. Collaborating with Dr. Cascio to share her lab space at Stone Bridge and use the lab’s equipment has been an essential part of moving our research project forward. Additionally, working with Dr. Cascio has been invaluable; she accommodated our schedules for before-school lab work in September and October and always made herself and the lab available during the school summer holidays in the month of August. Together, we worked through a starch/yeast measurement problem we initially had, and provided us with additional aerators for doing prototype testing with the Armstrong samples. Our collaboration with Stone Bridge was characterized by our common passion for doing research, learning new things, and solving problems.

Only in a sub population of the bacteria, sinI will be expressed at sufficient levels to trigger our system. Whereas sinR will be expressed in all cells.  So with this approach we can say that only a small population of the cells will get the heavy metals. If we want the other way we can switch the roles of SinI and sinR.With the normal conditions only 2% of the population express enough sinI.[2]

Hi! I am Daniel (Xiong Hongliang). I am a 11th grade student from Beijing National Day School. My responsibility in the team is to set up the team wiki page and construct the model of the protein ORAI1 V102A. This competition provided me a great opportunity to extend my ability and expand my view. During the competition, I learned more webpage editing techniques. Also, I met more outstanding people while learning from them, making my interpersonal communication skill improved a lot. Besides my competition, I enjoy playing the piano in my spare time. I also play few kinds of sports as of interests. But mostly I am interested to study in biology or computer science.
Hey guys, this is Yao Yifei (or call me Jason if you wish so), the so called “tech guy” in the team. I’m in charge of building and styling the wiki site that you are looking at right now, and……that’s all. I’m really glad to be a part of this IGEM team because I hold a strong interest in biology. I mean, although I don’t want to major in it in the future, but isn’t it interesting to develop a new kind of bacteria that has special effects like softening water? It’s like playing the role of God. Of course I learned a lot from my teammates as well, like a lot of fundamental knowledge about DNA replication and PCR and things like those. This is a beneficial experience for me, and I really enjoy the time I spent with my teammates.
Hi! This is Eva, Yu Hao, from Beijing National Day School Grade 11. I believe that we should continue learning throughout our lives, and this IGEM experience has brought me into a really exciting world of biology. I saw for real how lives, from bacterias to human, can be so different, and learned lots of things from my teammates, who taught me how to collaborate with others and face both the success and the failures.
Hello there, this is Isaac (Zhang Yuxuan) from Beijing National Day School. As a senior, I have decided what to do when I am in college, I want to be an engineer and the experience in IGEM has helped me a lot. I appreciate all of the teachers and co-workers not only for their effort on this project but also for leading me to a whole new world of genetic engineering. Hopefully, I will take advantage"

Patent “language” is a completely different style of writing and one can only start learning it - be reading more of them.
4. Generally speaking the patent is divided into three main parts: specifications, drawings and patent claims. The most important part of the patent is claims.They point out the aspects of your product or technology that you regard as your invention and define your exclusive rights to it. The rest of the patent is there to support to what is claimed. You will also need specifications (a full and complete description) of your invention which provides the proof of understanding of the claims, and drawings that illustrate certain aspects of the invention so the reader can follow the text more easily.
When filing a patent you want to describe every detail of your invention, as well as its alternative versions. However, you can have the most thorough description of your invention but it will not matter unless you have been granted the claims that cover that description. Also, it is important to note that you can rearrange the patent application, but you cannot add a new material without filling a new patent application.
5. After you submit your application it is all about waiting. It may take up to a few years for patent to get fully accepted. This time is meant for the experts analysis, and also competitor disputes.

This is also helped by the fact that our manufacturing and distribution processes will be identical for second and third generation products, allowing us again to save time and money. This means that although we will incur significant costs during the development of our first generation product, we will hopefully be able to quickly recoup those once our products begin to hit the market in rapid succession.

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics results_-_-_TEXT.html," advances in the research. A majority of 72% believes that the scientific community and the public have to address ethical and religious concerns together, 27% is not sure, and less than 1% does not agree with that.
One of the reasons that this statement is even better supported than the previous one, is that ethical issues might be easier to address to the public. Moreover, the ethical and religious issues might concern the public more than advances in synthetic biology research. They are more directly involved in consequences from general issues in synthetic biology (such as life-related questions, but also bio-security)
Debating ethical issues in synthetic biology together with the general public is perceived to be important. Ways of doing this is by researchers working together with representatives of the general public, most likely governmental institutions to identify, characterize and possibly find solutions to issues emerging from synthetic biology.
Life
When discussing ethical questions concerning the implications of the approaches in synthetic biology, the ultimate questions that always come up are: what is life? and what is natural?. Although these questions are possibly never fully answerable, there are a lot of different definitions going around and people have different opinions on it. The questions before are partially a means to help answer these questions. Can the reductionist approach ever lead to an explanation of life? Even though we tried to focus on a narrow subject in all the ethical issues that are raised by synthetic biology, the questions that involve life are still too massive to handle. Famous philosophers have thought about comparable dilemmas centuries ago. The prospects of synthetic biology re-initiate the discussion, a result of researchers working on the brink of understanding and creating life. How do the people involved in the iGEM competition think about life?

Improvement
At the beginning, our logic circuit of CRISProgrammer was a little bit complex for we wanted to use CRISPR-dCas9 system to regulate the expression of multi genes and make our system have complicated functions. But after we had held the Sichuan University 2018 Architects Competition of Microorganism Application (SCU-ACMA) (a theoretical design competition sponsored by SCU-iGEM) and watched several projects about microbiology and industrial production, we realized that it would be better to simplify the logic circuit just as what other teams had done if we want to use it in industrial production. So, we cut down the genes we used and simplified the system so that it would be more stable.
Later in the communications with students from Shishi High School and the summer camp students of Chengdu University of Information Technology, we are asked some questions which remind us of the details of CRISProgrammer, such as the cost, the environmental effects, the maneuverability, the safety and so on. We took all of them into consideration and polished our project design. For example, we used fluorescent proteins and double antibiotic resistance to select the expected engineered bacteria and observe their gene expression.
Experiments
When we started our experiments, some problems followed. In this period, we got many help from other people based on the human practice. In the China iGEM Southwest Union (iSWU), “UEST-China” and “SiCAU-China” reminded us of the difficulty to clone a coding sequence in a genome. So we decided to clone genes of sgRNA and dCas9 into engineered vectors firstly.
And in the 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC), Dr. Haotian Guo suggested that when we use CRISPR-dCas9 system to regulate the expression of multiple genes, we should consider that so many sgRNAs will occupy dCas9 protein, which directly leads to the decrease of efficiency of targeted gene regulation. With the consideration of his suggestion, we kept our regulatory system containing a small number of sgRNAs.
What’s more, we also interviewed Dr"

    After that, we assumed that there will be x% of bacteria can present the property we need. Then we can get population of expressed bacteria:
        fex(t) = x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Because we need the oxalic acid-time function, we assume the speed of oxalic acid secretion of per unit of bacteria is v. So the total speed should be:
        V(t) = v*x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Since the secretion of oxalic acid should be accumulated, we take the integration of total speed of time. We used WolframAlpha program to find out this integration.
        ∫1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t)) dt=3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C0
        ∫V(t) dt=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C
    Because the function should began at (0,0) point, we can find out constant C in function.
        0=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55*0))+C         C=-3.522*log(19.37)*v*x%         C=-10.438*v*x%         Substitute C=-10.438*v*x%
        Soa(t)=v*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)
    This is oxalic acid-time function.
    We also need to find out lipid-time function. Obviously, it’s more complicated than last function, since the decomposition speed cannot be a constant.
    The fex(t) function should be also available in this part. Starting constructing process, we assumed that initial total lipid is N, lipid that decomposed is n, and the decomposing speed is relate to following factors:
    k: a constant representing efficiency of lipase     (N-n): remain amount of lipid     fex(t): quantity of expressed bacteria
    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed bacteria:

C. OpenLab Activity
In the process of publicity and communication in high school, we learned that they do not have a biological laboratory. But we all understand that ""experiment is the only criterion for testing truth."" In the subsequent inquiries, we found that the students mastered the knowledge in the textbooks very well, but little is known in the actual operation. So we decided to conduct a lab open day event and invited several high school students to come to our lab to study and personally operate an experiment.
Public Engagement
We are eager to get in touch with more people，not merely the student group. Introduce them to the knowledge of synthetic biology and learn their knowledge and expectation of synthetic biology.

Q&A
Q: the competition affect your study? How do you balance your study life and preparations for the competition?
A: We are constantly learning and progressing during the competition. For example, we just learned the principle and operation of the spectrometer, and actually used the knowledge we learned when doing the experiment. As long as you listen carefully in the classroom and do your homework after class, your grades will be good.
2. Q: Can the engineering of bacteria designed by your team only detect the concentration of nickel ions? Is there any absorption?
A: At the moment, it only detects and measures; in the future we hope to design an absorption system based on yeast.
3. Q: How do you recycle the yeast after absorbing nickel ions?
A: Removing the yeast from the water after absorption of Nickel ions would be ideal. We only need to release nickel ions from cells under a certain circumstance，but though we can do this fairly easily in the lab, we don’t yet have a practical solution for large scale field application.  Perhaps this will be next year’s project.
4. Q: With so many people, What difficulties have you encountered? How did you solve it?
A:A team is a big family. They are different people with different personalities. Everyone thinks differently. There are also many different opinions. We mainly seek common ground while reserving differences. Different ideas can lead to a lot of good ideas. Mainly the people of our team are very friendly , so everyone is very close and united like family.

Then we thought that circuit switching is that transmitting all information through a certain line but the packet switching is that dividing the information into pieces and transmitting different pieces through different lines. Both of the two methods have merits and demerits. Then we thought that why we could not combine both of them and then we designed our experiments that transmitting all information through two certain lines respectively in order to reduce the noises and uncertainty. And the experiments confirmed our views in some degree.
So you can see that we had a very successful human practice and we applied what we got from human practice into our experiments successfully. It helped with our project greatly and met the requirement of gold medal undoubtedly."

uOttawa,2013,Team:uOttawa#project_-_-_TEXT.html," sfGFP as our reporter protein (Z). Each part is detectable via a different fluorescent protein. A visual representation of our pathway is shown in Figure 3.
This network design allows for calibration of the network via tunable levels of β-estradiol, allowing for accurate control of the amount of rtTA(X) in the cell. This will allow us to ensure that fold-change detection works as theorized in our network.
Furthermore, activation by rtTA is mediated by varying levels of anhydrotetracycline (ATc), and LacI repression is mediated by varying levels of Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). These methods of mediation allow for high tunability of the system, and we should be able to find a concentration range of ATc and IPTG at which the system will work as desired.
The system will then be characterized extensively. The fluorescent markers tagged to each component of the network will allow for simple temporal analysis using flow cytometry. This will allow for a high-throughput analysis of the activity of our network.
Potential Applications
A Fold-Change Detection System for Toxic Molecules
Once our system is tuned and is working, it can be modified to act as a fold-change detector for toxic molecules. By replacing the pGEV promoter in front of the rtTA gene with a promoter that is inducible by a toxic molecule, the amount of rtTA produced will be directly correlated to the concentration of the toxic molecule in the cellular environment.
This detector system is advantageous in that it detects fold-changes rather than changes in absolute values, which gives meaning to a signal in reference to the background signal level. This allows for the network to respond only to a signal that rises significantly above the background noise.
We have shown....
Linearization of X activity is crucial to the function of the feedforward loop
Negative autoregulation can successfully linearize the dose-response of a downstream promoter
Transcriptional activators can be used as repressors and also act in negative auroregulation
Testing our basic network
In the 2009 Alon paper, fold-change response to a stimulus was theoretically proposed. We set out to test this, by constructing a synthetic incoherent feedforward loop, as follows:
Upon testing this network in a gradient of IPTG and ATc, we discovered that no evident pulse in sfGFP (Z) expression was observable in any range of the molecular cofactors upon stimulus of production of X (rtTA). This was explained by the Alon paper – in conditions of independent"
Tufts,2014,Team:Tufts#ribosponge_-_-_TEXT.html,"Fig 3. Absorbance at 550 nm of cells with and without the merRNA at 30°C. The same procedure was repeated at 30°C. A greater difference in biofilm formation in JM109 cells is observed, but the increase in temperature caused ZK1056 to exhibit equally robust biofilm formation with or without the merRNA.
Fig 4. Absorbance at 550 nm of cells with and without the merRNA at 37°C. The same procedure was repeated at 37°C. Since this is a favorable growing temperature, bacteria do not generally enter a biofilm state. An even greater relative increase of JM109 with merRNA was seen, but the ZK1056 once again registered no significant difference in biofilm formation.
The trials at three different temperatures show that the merRNA most consistently promotes robust biofilm formation at lower temperatures since both JM109 and ZK1056 cells exhibited this trend. An increase in temperature widened the difference in JM109 cells with and without merRNA, but the effect was marginalized to a point of insignificance in ZK1056.
Our Hypothesis
The general observation that constitutive expression of the merRNA increases biofilm formation is contrary to the original expectations. However, since such a marked difference in biofilm formation was observed, it is believed that the merRNA is exhibiting a physiological effect. Since the merRNA is known to contain a c-di-GMP aptamer, the likely mechanism of action involves the sequestration of c-di-GMP such that the available intracellular concentration decreases and downstream signalling pathways are not activated.
In Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, the merRNA causes the transition from a dormant to a motile phase. The same was expected of our E. coli. Instinctively, the observed increase in biofilm formation is incompatible with the expected increase in motility. However, several studies suggest that, in fact, motility is a key factor in enabling the attachment of cells to surfaces and other cells. One study in Pseudomonas aeruginosa reports that flagellar and twitching motility are necessary for biofilm attachment (14). Cells deficient in motility specific genes were unable to attach to surfaces and thus could not enter biofilm states. A paper dealing with E. coli cites the importance of flagella for initial attachment, especially at lower temperatures. The authors write, ""In pathogenic E. coli living within the host or on abiotic surfaces (37 °C), type I fimbriae or the adhesin AG43 are involved in initial attachment, PGA stabilizes permanent attachment"

The aim of our work with Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRIPSR) was to metabolically engineer the increase accumulation of our chlorophyll synthesis precursor, protoporphyrin-IX (PPIX). This was achieved by disrupting the hemH gene, there by decreasing the production of hemH, preventing the diversion of the PPIX towards heme, increasing the accumulation of PPIX. The results of this work can be seen below. Mutant colonies were detected by an increase of PPIX seen using fluorescence spectroscopy. Amongst the mutants generated, we selected the highest accumulating mutant for modelling experiments and device verification of our Mg-Chelatase Plasmid.
Summary of Results
A functional Cas9 RNP complex was demonstrated by specifically cleaving the hemH gene PCR product as expected.
The Cas9 RNP complex was functional in vivo as demonstrated by its effect on E. coli by killing them in a concentration dependent manner, which is expected if excess double stranded breaks are made in a RecA minus strain.
The Cas9 mutagenesis produced a hemH mutant of E.coli which accumulates protoporphyrin IX.
Results
Metabolically Engineering with CRIPSR Results
We have designed primers to amplify the hemH gene using E.coli genomic DNA as a template. The results can be seen in the amplification products of Figure 1(a). Figure 1(b) indicates that the Cas9 RNP complex works in vitro and cleaves the PCR product into the expected sizes as designed by the target guide RNA. The expected sizes of the cleaved products  are approximately 850/150bp. The incomplete cleavage of the PCR product is likely to be due to a insufficient amounts of the  Cas9 guide RNA complex.

Results:
The fermentation was not successful, streptavidin band (unter 15 kDa marker) is just a bit thicker. The reason might be the ampR of the transformed plasmid. Due to the high cell concentration beta lactamase (secreted in periplasma) gets in the medium and hydrolyses amp. As a result cells lose plasmid because there is no selective pressure without an antibiotic in medium.

UC_Berkeley_Tools,2008,Team:UC Berkeley Tools_-_-_TEXT.html," to another, and the way to grab biological part data from one database may require a completely different route than another. The Clotho Data Structure , in essence, can be viewed as the Rosetta stone of Clotho's environment. In a nutshell, it allows any developer to grab relevant information about a part from any given database. This is made possible when a developer ""binds"" fields in a database to specific Clotho Data Structure objects which have a specific semantic associated with them. When a user wants to grab the sequence belonging to a particular Biobrick, for example, the Clotho Data Structure, once ""bound"" to a particular database, will be able to grab the sequence from the database and give it to Clotho. Want to know who owned the vector from jca1021 in database A and send that information to database B? Easy. Bind the data structure with both databases, grab the data from database A, and tell Clotho where in database B to place the data. This binding not only gives unstandardized data meaning, it also provides a common language by which Clotho developers can communicate.
Views/Functions
Each category above merits its own explanation, as each is vitally important to the project. Perhaps a good place to start are the views/functions. Here users are able to see and manipulate data, such as part information or the nucleotide sequence. Examples include the sequence view or the plate manager .
Interfaces
Not all views/functions are self-sufficient, and so another set of components, called interfaces, are involved in assisting these views/functions for functionality. Take for example the sequence view (a view many ApE lovers would recognize). How would the sequence view know how to highlight features or enzymes if Clotho didn't know what features or enzymes to look for? That's where the features library and enzyme library come in. In this particular example, the two interfaces store and manage information that the sequence view will have to frequent in order to perform vital operations. Other interfaces include a parts manager and database manager . These allow the user to view part data and relationships. Not only can the source of parts be viewed but users can maintain personal collections of parts as well.
Algorithm Environment
But what if you want to do more with your data you've manipulated? What if, after gathering all your parts, you want to calculate the optimal assembly scheme for a particular goal composite part? This is where the algorithm environment kicks in. The algorithm environment allows developers to make systems that take both quick one-liner inputs or more complex input from the Clotho Data Structure and spit out one-liner or more sophisticated outputs."

Collaborations
During our project we collaborated with several other iGEM teams.  This helped improve our project a lot. Our collaborations can be divided into human practice and wet-lab collaborations.  They range from podcasts, the Düsselorf postcard collaboration, and our own dear diary, to a wet-lab collaboration with iGEM Lund.  We also collaborated a little with non-iGEMers.  Through our work with human practice we came into contact with the advisory board at Linköping University for Engineers Without Borders Sweden.
Wet-lab Collaborations
Collaboration with iGEM Lund
Since we are both working on protein production in E.coli we started a collaboration with iGEM Lund.  During this collaboration we exchanged biobricks in order to verify them.
Human Practice Collaborations
Podcast - a Collaboration with iGEM Chalmers
Following the Nordic iGEM Conference in Lund we started a collaboration with the team from Chalmers University.  During the summer, a representative from iGEM Chalmers visited us and recorded an episode for our podcast ""Attempting Science"" with us.  In the episode we talked about their project and problems that have been faced during the course of the iGEM competition.  This proved a fun way for us to reach out with our projects, and to meet an discuss them together.  A link to the podcast can be found on our Human Practice page.
Postcard Collaboration with iGEM Team Düsseldorf
We collaborated with iGEM Düsseldorf on their postcard collaboration as a part of our human practice.  This is a worldwide collaboration where different iGEM teams design their own postcards.  These are then distributed to the participating teams with the help of iGEM team Düsseldorf.  Namely, to raise public awareness about the field of Synthetic Biology.  We then distributed the cards we received to students and to the public during events hosted by us.
Dear Diary
In order for us to get a better connection to some of the other iGEM teams we decided to start a diary collaboration.  We asked teams to write texts on what they did in- and outside of the lab during summer, and take pictures.  We then compiled these stories into a document that was published here and on our facebook.  The teams that"
