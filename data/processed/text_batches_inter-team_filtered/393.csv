Perhaps most interesting to us was the question we crafted to determine how participants’ views on GMOs changed when the GMO presented an opportunity to alleviate environmental degradation. When asked the question, “If agricultural waste could be dramatically reduced by converting the waste into natural compounds, like caffeine, through a genetically modified organism, would you oppose that?”, 65% of participants answered “No, I would not oppose that”, and only 5% answered “Yes, I would oppose that”; the other 30% remaining “Unsure.” To provide context to that result, when originally asked the question, “Would you buy genetically modified foods if they were labeled?”, only 35% of the participants answer “Yes”, with 45% stating “No” and 20% “Unsure.” We phrased agricultural waste question as a matter of opposition because we feel that the significant majority of uncertainty and fear around GMOs is caused by the vocal opposition against them. Therefore, we were excited to see our data indicate that perceptions on genetic modification can be reshaped when participants discover the environmental benefits that GMOscould provide.  The full set of survey questions and the data generated by them presents a full suite of interesting information to consider, and we hope that you’ll explore the data sheet below to create inferences of your own as well!
Davis Farmers Market
In conclusion to the What is Natural? storyline, it appears evident that the legislature, technologies, and education being forged today establish a pivotal foundation for our future generations to build upon. Given the current trends of humanity, with falling water supplies, rising carbon levels in the atmosphere, and a swelling global population, humanity has immense challenges standing before it. Technologies such as genetic engineering have an invaluable amount to offer, yet they can only accomplish as much as we allow them. Public perception, regardless of its alignment with scientific findings, shapes the technologies we allow to surface. We hope that by dedicating ourselves not only to scientific pursuits, but by also recognizing the immense importance of educating the public thereof, we can set the groundwork of a better future."

DR TRISTRAM RILEY-SMITH
Dr Riley-Smith is the Director of Research at the University of Cambridge Department of Politics and International Studies and the External Champion to the Research Council Uk Partnership for Conflict, Crime and Security Research (PaCCS). Dr Riley-Smith has studied anthrolopology but currently plays a bridging role between the commercial world and government agencies (such as PaCCS). As such he was able to provide a lot of guidance on how to view or come up with policies related to our project.
In particular, he pointed us in the direction of FRRIICT (Framework for Responsible Research and Innovation in ICT) which we used to make sure our research was safe and responsible. To see our reflections on this, click here .
EDWARD YOU
Edward You is a special agent at the FBI working in the Weapon of Mass Destruction Directorate, Biological Countermeasures Unit. We had the opportunity to skype with him and gauge his impressions of the project. He was pleased with what we told him and was especially happy that we included some measure of encryption into our design. Though our main application is archival data, he pointed out that our technology has the capacity to advance and become more practical in everyday life. In this way, he said that encryption is paramount to this development.
After sharing with him the threat scenarios we had come up with for our encryption system, he raised another topic for consideration; data integrity. To see how we have covered data integrity, read more about our error-correcting mechanisms .
LEE HIBBERD, NATIONAL LIBRARY OF SCOTLAND
After our initial meetings with the Main Library we decided to try and get in contact with the National Library Scotland. We were lucky enough to meet Lee Hibberd, the Digital Preservation Officer at the library. He was very enthusiastic about our project, how much we had achieved and agreed with us that DNA could be a fantastic medium for long term storage.
We learned a lot about archival data at this meeting; for example, Mr Hibberd explained to us that magnetic tape copies of data have to be corrected and rewritten every 6 years- costing the library thousands of pounds in extra electricity, man power and materials. He was glad to hear about our our error-correcting mechanisms and said that the Library also uses check-sums to detect errors in their tapes.
We also learned that"

On Friday, 6-19, I did a colony PCR of RfaI:pBAD35BB from Richard's transformation colonies. I came in on Saturday morning to run a gel and didn't find anymore Loading Dye, so I put the colony PCR product into the freezer. Monday (6-21) I got a 1ml of loading dye from the bottle in Brian's lab and ran a gel of the colony PCR product.
The gel didn't show any bands in the 700 region. The positive control (pBAD35BB [60.1 ng/ul]) had a faint band in the 3kB region and a fuzzy streak at the end (could be primer dimer) didn't not have a band in the 700 region. The negative control was negative of any bands. Since there was no bands in any of the colonies screened, I will not be doing Alkly lysis and digestion.
Peter and Sarah looked at the pBAD35BB sequence from the Biotech center and found that the PstI cut site had a point mutation that prohibited the PstI enzyme to cut. This could be one of the problems that lead to unsuccessful clones with the pBAD35BB vector.

The competition evaluates and awards business plans submitted by entrepreneurs who have taken advantage of the free business training provided by Community Futures across Southern Alberta. Finalists were chosen from 24 groups that submitted business plans for the challenge.
While he has to be a bit cautious about revealing details because of the patent process – an expected six to eight-month timeline -- Ward said their idea will significantly improve the way in which hormones are detected.
“Hormones – and hormone imbalances -- play very important roles in understanding behaviour and mental health, pregnancy as well as development and aging of all populations,” Ward said.
“We are pursuing new technology for the detection of hormones that provides rapid results that are 93 per cent more cost effective than traditional antibody technology.”
The team’s market analysis showed diverse applications and projections for growth, with a two to three-year timeline to produce a marketable device. The first test runs of this device will occur this summer at the Canadian Centre for Behavioural Neuroscience in collaboration with neuroscience researcher Dr. Gerlinde Metz.
Ward said the team came up with the idea to develop the company and the new biomedical device by using the skills they learned through the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) program.
“The internationally competitive program allows undergraduate students to gain hands-on experience in science,” Ward said.
“iGEM is run out of a student-operated lab provided by the department of Chemistry and Biochemistry here at the University of Lethbridge and coordinated by Dr. HJ Wieden. We have been encouraged at every turn by our professors and others to move this idea forward, especially by the people at Alberta Innovates -- Technology Futures (AITF) who promote entrepreneurial engagement from scientific innovation.”
Ward cited advisors Dr. Gerlinde Metz (Department of Neuroscience), Dr. HJ Wieden (Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry), Dr. Roy Golsteyn (Department of Biological Sciences) and Michael Kelly (Erin Kelly’s father and Manager of Real Estate and Land Development, City of Lethbridge) as being particularly helpful as they refined their idea.
At an event held on Wednesday, June 12 in Lethbridge the Community Futures Lethbridge Region hosted an event that acknowledged the Synbiologica group for their win, and announced the additional winners of the Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge.

Get Clotho Now!
With >700 available parts and >2000 defined parts in the MIT Registry of Standard Biological Parts , additional part repositories being developed, and countless more parts local to the lab, synthetic biologists are now faced with the challenge of organizing, sorting, and editing these parts from an ever-growing collection of DNA. Computational tools are becoming increasingly needed to assist biologists to do these jobs, and it is no secret that many tools are being introduced into the community to help serve these needs. It is important that new tool developments in this area remain both firmly rooted in the realities of the present while being forward thinking and flexible.
Clotho is a toolset designed in a platform-based design paradigm to consolidate all these tools into one working, integrated toolbox. Clotho is based on a core-and-hub system which manages multiple connections, each connection performing tasks in some self-sufficient manner while connected to all other connections via the core. Examples of connections include sequence viewers/editors, parts database managers, assembly algorithm GUIs, and much more. Computer-savvy biologists can create new connections which will then be integrated into Clotho. These pieces can be kept locally in ones lab or made public and shared with the community. In this tool-consolidation and customization it is hoped that, in the future, biologists need not look further for a program that provides the answer to their ever growing design needs.

Clotho Overview
Among many possible top-level explanations of Clotho, one of the simplest is the ""Clotho Data Structure""-centric view. In this view, biological part data is passed back and forth between Clotho components and to files and databases outside Clotho. Some of the possible flows of data are represented by the slew of arrows in the diagram above.

Arizona_State,2016,Team:Arizona State#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," Senders, a proof-of-concept test was conducted on the inducers to demonstrate the likely production of the AHL.
The AHL gene lies behind a supposedly Tet promoter as well as an mCherry gene. If mCherry is produced, this will be a likely indicator that the AHL is also being produced. Each inducer was re-transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli and then the liquid culture was plated on a 96-well plate in triplicate. An 8-hour optical density test was conducted on the 96-well plate, measuring at a wavelength of 600nm to demonstrate overall cellular growth and between 580-610nm to measure mCherry fluorescence. The growth curves of all ten systems are shown below:
Figure on left is growth curve over time measured at 600nm. Figure on right is growth curve over time measured at 580-610nm.
The figures above demonstrate that when the AHL synthase gene is grown in E. coli, the AHL is likely produced.  The OD600 measurements affirm that bacterial growth occurred over the 8-hour read. All 10 systems produced mCherry, with 9/10 systems showing a positive growth trend over time. The 10th system, RpaI, had a negative trend in mCherry presence but also had, by far, the highest overall absorbance of mCherry. It is likely that there is a threshold to the mCherry production, which was reached by the Rpa system. Several systems, like Bja and Las, showed an initial dip in mCherry production during the first two hours of growth. This was likely due to the transfer of cells from an aerated, incubated environment to 96-well plate. This corresponds to the slight flatline at the beginning of several of the growth curves in the OD600 measurements. These results provide a proof-of-concept that the Senders are able to produce AHLs in our selected chassis, as mCherry lies downstream of the Sender in our system, so the AHL is likely produced.
Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry
In order to confirm that the AHLs were actually being produced by E. coli, we will run a 30 minute gas chromatography test to characterize any AHLs present. Due to time constraints, we will only test the 5 Senders that we submitted to the registry (Aub, Bja, Bra, Cer and Sin). In addition, these 5 Senders will be tested using mass spectrometry to further measure AHL production. This data will be available on the parts pages"

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," this getting ready for take-off and then actually leaving ground with you in it, is something we will probably never forget.
Because we were so tired, we pretty much fell asleep right after the lights of Dubai under us disappeared in the distance and when a nice stewardess woke us up for breakfast the sun was already rising over the horizon. Two buns with fresh cheese, a marmalade croissants and a warm cup of coffee later we realized that we were almost there. Only a few moments later the captain asked us to fasten our seat belts and get ready for landing. It was a bright day again and because the weather was so nice and sunny we got to get our first good look at the water, land and forest surrounding Singapore.
Arrival
Getting of the plane and through security didn't take much time and even our luggage showed up pretty fast. After all of us changed some money at a booth we decided to take the train rather than a cab to get to university town, where we were supposed to stay for the week. The trip from the airport took us about 45 minutes and we got to get the first real impression of Singapore’s architecture and its people. The first thing we noticed were the air conditioners – Everything was air conditioned. From busses to buildings, everything was close to 17°C, so when you actually got out you had the feeling of getting hit in the face with a 40 degree hammer. On the other hand you got pretty could when you were outside for some time and then entered a building again.
The accommodation at university was quite simple. Every one of us got a plain room of about 6 to 7 square meters, with a bed, a closet and of course an air condition.
The Conference
On our second day in Singapore, the first day of the conference, we really felt the jet-lag. Getting up at 7:00 was like waking up in the middle of the night and we would have struggled pretty hard with staying awake the whole day, if it wasn't for a scientist's best friend — coffee.     The conference was held in the university’s museum and because we got there so early, we didn’t have to queue for entrance and could look around a little. The entrance hall was used for food, booths of companies and light conversation during the breaks, whereas the first floor was reserved for the poster session in the afternoon.
Participants from all over the world could display their research results and answer regarding questions. The talks themselves were given in a big room with a great atmosphere, a little reminiscent of a theater, with very comfortable chairs and a"

By overexpressing either the transcriptional regulator bolA or the cell division inhibitor sulA, the cell morphology can be changed and the and the optical properties of the lens can be optimized. The biological MLA as encapsulation layer will result in more efficient and more environmental friendly solar panels.
Management team & Organizational structure
BioLens is a high tech startup with well-educated people with different backgrounds. We will work with an interdisciplinary team that will form the board of directors. We believe that within the company equality is important and we aim to be an organization with a collaborative structure.
A collaborative structure means that we aim to be a non-hierarchical organization. The organization will be fluid and flat, which gives every individual a great responsibility to make decisions on its own. We will set targets for individuals and teams and then provide the appropriate motivation and support to help them achieve those targets. Traditional management layers will disappear in this way.
Eventually we believe that this type of structure results in a more open and trusted environment. Every individual should feel confident to share his opinion and to criticize the opinions of their colleagues and managers. An environment will be created where openness, sharing and discussion is central to everything that takes place.
This will result in a company with employees that feel much more responsibility and loyalty. Every individual employer will feel taken seriously and therefore will feel a collective sense of ownership and involvement in the process of achieving the goals of the company.
BioLens is a spinoff from the TU Delft. This has as one of the main advantages that they will help us to make our business a success. This could be help or advise, regarding project related aspects, financial aspects, etc. For example, they could help us developing the final prototype. Within the board of directors there is nobody with experience in the field of solar energy and we probably will need help to develop our final prototype. Research groups from the TU Delft could help us with this. Therefore, as can been seen in Figure 1, we consider the TU Delft as part of our organization as well.

TU-Delft,2012,Team:TU-Delft#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," a nice representation and conclusion of our knockout strain –far1, -gpa1 we’ve performed a PCR using genomic DNA of the yeast. Further we have begun cloning yeast Biobrick genes mOrange and Venus YFP to get multiple color outputs. First a PCR reaction with pFX polymerase and the biobrick is performed to add res. Enz. Sites to the gene.
Week 33
We used a technique called TOPO cloning to attach the PCR product (elongated color gene) into a backbone for easier cutting. After ligation these products are transformed. This resulted in colonies for mOrange, but not for YFP. The EGFP-TOPO is cut but very vague bands could be seen when put on gel. Therefore EGFP is amplified again in Top10 cells and isolated.
Week 34
EGFP in Topo is cut with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into two vectors, pRS415II between promoter GPD and terminator CYC1 and in IDT-smartAmp between promoter FUS1 and terminator ADH1. Transformation of the ligation product led to colonies which were checked on inserts using EGFP primers.  Further, yeast cells containing I7-olf10 receptor and one of the banana receptor plasmid where grown and plasmids were isolated (using zymolase) and used for PCR reaction to see whether the receptor gene was still intact. This wasn’t the case, the insert has shortened from 1500 to ~500 nt. With the banana receptors 3 bands could be distinguished (original, somewhat shortened and the ~500 nt band). We have decided to immediately after transformation inoculate a grown colony of yeast and freeze it after a day. From there we only have to use that strain.

Stage 2
WPI’s visit to BostonU had two purposes. First, it would help validate WPI’s assay protocol and results in another lab, Second, it would give our team a better understanding of the protocol we would be moving onto a microfluidic device. Two students from WPI, Catherine and Aylin, met with a member of our team in Boston University lab on July 26th. Before performing the experiment in the lab, the WPI team gave a quick overview of the experiment as well as any specific safety protocols required while working with lead. In the lab, the WPI team members performed their protocol in its entirety; the BostonU Team member observed but did not touch any biological materials.
During this process, the two teams discussed various limitations and difficulties found in performing the assay by hand. A difficulty of note was the importance of adding and mixing reagents at exact times. For example, GSH needed to be added between 15-20 seconds after mixing the Lead and Gold Nanoparticles; however, adding the GSH at a uniform time was extremely difficult. With this information in mind, we decided that reliable timing would be an integral part of the microfluidic chip design.
WPI performing their lead assay in the BostonU lab on July 26th 2017. They performed their entire assay in the lab while the BostonU HW team observed and asked questions.
Stage 3
After meeting with WPI in the lab, our team had a solid plan for what the design of the chip would look like. The chip would perform one portion of their assay with volumes scaled down by a factor of 10. It would consist of 5 main sections:
Lead Metering: 4.15 ul
AuNp Metering: 3.46 ul
Lead and AuNp Timed Mixing: 17.5 Seconds
GSH Metering: 1.0 ul
Final Mixing: 18 seconds
With this workflow in mind, the chip on the right was designed. The animation details how liquid would flow through the device.
We provided WPI with full documentation of the chip including SVG files, a usage protocol, and the animation seen to the right. All of these files can be downloaded below.

Stage 01: Extraction of Useful BioBrick Plasmids from iGEM 2014 Distribution Kit
Protocols   competent cells transformation miniprep digest gel
We began our project by identifying a range of BioBrick parts present in the iGEM 2014 distribution kit which we required as part of our cloning strategy. These parts primarily consisted of both constituitive and inducible promoter systems with ribosome binding sites which we could then use in conjunction with our azo-reductase BioBricks to assemble a functional azo dye degrading gene. We also decided that we would use the Red Florescent Protein expressing BioBrick as a control for any further transformation experiments. As the level of DNA present within each plate of the distribution kit is insufficient to perform digest and ligation reactions on it was necessary to transform each of these plasmids into our NEB5alpha competent cells. After growing our transformed cells overnight we then mini-prepped each of them to obtain BioBrick plasmids at suitable concentrations for future experiments.

Newcastle,2018,Team:Newcastle#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Development
The Legal and social considerations of the project highlighted in Step 1 drove the development of NH-1, a low-cost, small-scale and programmable hydroponic system tailored to overcome experimental limitations faced by many plant scientists, such as high-throughput combined with variations of light within a singular space. The development of this system prompted our visits to GrowModule365 and Growing Underground , as well as our Skype call with GrowUp Urban Farms (all of which grow fresh produce hydroponically). The conversations had with these stakeholders gave crucial insight into how hydroponic systems function with regards to achieving optimum conditions for maximum output. We then returned to the Engineering lab to install these conditions into our own hydroponics.
For example, GrowModule365 told us they use purple light in their hydroponic systems as it is the most cost effective, we then took this information and confirmed this and set this as standard in our hydroponic system.
Building a hydroponic system also prompted the theoretical exploration of future deployment techniques for GM bacteria within contained environments. It is at this point that we began thinking about how our GMOs could be used to enhance sustainable crop productivity at a local and accessible level.
Growing Underground grow fresh produce in unused WWII bunkers under the streets of Clapham, London. We loved the idea of taking neglected spaces within the urban environment that once provided a service and repurposing them. On return from our visit to their facilities, we were made aware by one of our supervisors of a disused tunnel that runs under Newcastle – The Victoria Tunnel. Directly inspired by Growing Underground , we began to envision using our own hydroponic system to grow fresh produce that is locally accessible under the streets of Newcastle. Growing Underground made us aware of the following advantages of growing in contained environments within our cities:
Providing cities with fresh produce all year round.
Reducing the carbon footprint of crop production due to reduced food millage.
No agricultural run-off.
Limited need for pesticides and herbicides.
Safer crops as there is less risk of contamination.
Reduced spoilage due to shorter transportation times and reduced handling.
Wetware Development
Seed coating:
Initially our project involved providing farmers with a preserved culture of the adapter bacteria for roots to be inoculated by wounding (a common method in microbiology) [6]. When presenting our project to GrowUp Urban Farms , the ability and willingness of commercial farmers to use these methods while achieving the desired effect was questioned. Tom Webster highlighted that farmers may consider the time taken to inoculate the plants more costly than applying fertiliser and recommended we consider using our product as a seed"

Since the idea of our project this year (BAT, BiobrickAssist Technology) mainly originated in BASE,                     a biobrick evaluation tool that SJTU-Software programmed in 2015, we have surveyed and tested it in detail and found several shortcomings of its design and performance.                     While with the main function of evaluation for biobricks working quite well, and we’d like to set up an evaluation system like BASE, we decided to improve BASE for our project.                     However, due to its poor scalability, we programmed our web-based application under a new framework with Node.js.
We improved BASE both on database and function.
First of all, we noticed the database we used in 2015 was out of date, and the data stored was not sufficient for our further improvement of evaluation function. Therefore it may contain wrong information for biobricks. Fortunately we had a chance to discuss with USTC-Software about how to filter bad or even wrong data from the very beginning, that is, we collected new data this year from the official site http://parts.igem.org/ and immediately cut off bad data roughly following the advice of our PI and USTC-Software. Besides, some columns in MySQL database may not be so frequently used and influence little on scoring process (with a less weight), so we deleted them and put more weight on other factors such as submission time. Driven by Node.js’s MySQL pool, the database was accessed more easily and quickly.
At least so far our algorithm running on machine is hard to defeat human’s insight and knowledge, therefore we developed BAT Q/A Community. It’s not only a scalable plugin tied to the main evaluation and search function, but also a indispensable part of BAT, in which users can put forward and answer questions about biobricks, synthetic biology and even the work in the lab. This idea came from our project iMAP in 2016. We have surveyed and noticed that the instant messaging function we developed in 2016 could hardly replace existing ones such as QQ/Wechat, LINE and WhatsApp, and additionally not everyone got used to sending instant messages for academic communication, so email, or a platform like Quora was more suitable for knowledge and"

Media
As a team of students from the biological sciences, the value and opportunities offered by synthetic biology were clear to us. So, to demonstrate not only the importance of our own project but also create awareness of this exciting field of science, our team reached out to the general public. We organized and attended events where laymen and experts in the field of biotechnology and pharmaceutical waste met, and were featured in traditional media and trade publications. On this page, you will find an overview of these public engagements.
Events
Netherlands Biotechnology Congress
On Tuesday 22nd May 2018, the Netherlands Biotechnology Association (NBV) organised the Netherlands Biotechnology Congress themed Biotechnology in Harmony. We pitched our iGEM project and discussed technical, ethical and social subjects around our project.
iGEM Biotechnology Conference
In collaboration with iGEM team Aachen, we organised the iGEM Biotechnology Conference on 20th September 2018 for students, scientists and companies. Our main goal was to educate the visitors about biotechnological innovations and how it impacts society. Furthermore, we wanted to introduce the iGEM competition in general and both of our projects. At the end of the day, attendees had the possibility to meet each other and make valuable connections. See More
RIVM Network Day ‘Medicine Residues in the Environment’
The RIVM Network Day is organised for everyone who is involved with medicine residues in the environment. Current events are discussed in order to gain new insights regarding the issue. We were present to contribute to the discussion, follow workshops and implement relevant information from this day into our project.
Weekend of Science
The ‘Weekend van de Wetenschap’ (Weekend of Science) is an annual national event in The Netherlands for science and technology. During this event, several companies, research institutes, universities and musea open their doors to present their work. As part of this event, we, iGEM Team Utrecht 2018, got the chance to show our project to all interested parties. For this we invented a short game in which children aged from 8-12 years old and their families can experience how it is to perform experiments in a laboratory setting. Furthermore, we taught the children what bacteria are, what they like to eat, and how they grow in a petri dish.
Media
We wrote or contributed to articles for multiple journals and newspapers in order to inform people and create awareness around biotechnology, the iGEM competition and our project.

DAPI-staining and mounting
DAPI was used for visualizing the nucleus. Therefore, cells were dipped into a DAPI solution (1:10,000) for 5 seconds - right before mounting on microscope slides. Next, the cells were washed for 5 seconds in distilled water, had to be dabbed of with a tissue and were then placed upside down on a drop (8.5 μl) of mowiol. The cover slips stayed for an overnight drying at room temperature.
SEAP Assay
200 µl of cell supernatant was transferred from a 24-well plate into one 96-well plate (round bottom), followed by a heat incubation at 65°C for 30 min. Centrifugation was done for 1 min at 1250xg. 100 µl of 2x SEAP buffer (20 mM homoarginine, 1 mM MgCl2, 21 %(v/v) diethanolamine, pH 9.8) were filled in the wells of a 96 well plate (flat bottom). Addition of 80 µl supernatant from the round bottom plate to each well with SEAP buffer. Addition of 20 µl pNPP (120 mM para-nitrophenyl phosphate in H2O) and bubbles carefully removed. Immediately after this, the 96-well plate was placed into a plate reader. Spectroscopic measurement was taken every minute for 120 times (2h) at a wavelength of 405 nm.
VEGF ELISA
The VEGF ELISA was performed with the VEGF ELISA Development Kit #900-K10 (PeproTech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 96-well ELISA plates were used (Corning #3590 or Greiner #). HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates, transfected with desired constructs and then cultured for 36h sealed by an oxygen diffusible filter. 12h post transfection the medium was exchanged to set VEGF levels to zero. 24h after medium change the supernatant was collected and directly used for ELISA or frozen at -20°C until further use. To normalize VEGF results a constitutive SEAP reporter was always co-transfected so that a SEAP assay could be performed in parallel. ABTS solution was prepared from ABTS aliquot by mixing"

Introduction
We constructed our outreach activities so that they worked together to meet an overall goal, which was to help local middle school and high school students learn more about synthetic biology and to increase their future opportunities to be a part of this emerging field. To reach this goal we had two linked objectives. The first objective was to co-design strategies and educational materials to effectively reach this target audience. The second, more important objective was that the program was sustainable so that it can have a continuing impact on our community even beyond the end of our 2017 iGEM project. We started our outreach co-design process by consulting our community about their needs and what they would like to gain from a potential collaboration, as well as consulting education experts about the best way to get involved with teachers and students.
To meet the second objective, we found that we needed to expand our intended target audience to include educators. Including educators meant that we could have a longer and larger impact through our local school system. But it also meant that we needed to adapt our educational materials to fit the context and incentives of the school system.
Next, we did a wide array of outreach activities that helped address the goals of our community and our own goals. Many of these activities fit into broad strategies that we called Consult the Community , Building Connections , and Sustainable Impact . Some other activities were direct outreach to our target audience of middle and high school students, as well as direct outreach to the scientific community within and outside of William & Mary:
After consulting the School Education, we improved our Synthetic Biology Activities Booklets to make them more accessible to teachers. We then publicized them to educators in our teacher focus group and online. The booklets exist in a permanent form on our wiki and will be accessible to everyone for years to come.
We are working with educators to strengthen the network between W&M and the teachers in the school district, train them, and get feedback on the activities booklets, including how to make them fit into their overall STEM curriculum. Additionally, based on teacher feedback, we are in the process of forming"

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," protein that would be specific of our target cell.
Thus, he established that the protein c-kit is solely found on the membrane of our target cell. He then identified the target protein of this receptor and designed its BioBrick . One of the proteins of our phage is now adorned with this BioBrick, enabling him to target our interest cells.
He then determined the most common mutations in the cancerous cells so as to decide which genes to add to our therapeutic plasmid .
He thus studied then chose the genes containing the mutations before conducting thorough studies on them in a laboratory.
Once the target molecule and its mutations were defined, we had to build our cell vector .
To begin, David CHARROY, a 5th year student specialized in R&D in biotechnologies, and Cyprien VERSEUX, 1st year student in biotechnologies, prepared a résumé of the current situation of phages so as to understand its operating system.
They then decided to “BioBrick” it entirely so as to render it adjustable.
Knowing the phage thoroughly, they chose the optimal location for the target protein identified by Damien. Yet, a problem remained: can the naturally non-infectious cell vector for eukaryote cells manage to enter the target cell?
David then had the idea of adding a second target protein on our vector: a protein from an adenovirus to help escape the endosome. He then turned it into a “BioBrick” and added it to our vector .
For our studies in a laboratory , the phage was studied by David, Nassrine LABLACK and Aurélie NEGREL, both 5th year students specialized in R&D in biotechnologies. All three of them have hands on experience in various laboratories. David and Aurélie both followed a technical training before joining Sup’Biotech. Nassrine, in addition to her curriculum at Sup’Biotech, works in a biology laboratory.
A protein to be modified, a cellular vector; we just had to find our tissue vector .
Thierry LECLERC, a 4th year student specialized in R&D in biotechnologies, prepared a résumé on the current situation of Mycobacterium, our candidate for the tissue vector . He had two principle objectives: the capacity of resisting the immune system and the lung tropism. Once he had gathered sufficient information about the bacteria, he validated the theoretical concept, proving that Mycobacterium would perfectly fill in its role, by using scientific literature.
In the aim of a technical validation, he elaborated a follow-up study"

Returning to topic, the Federal Government has also responded to concerns about bioterrorism.  In 2011, the NSABB identified dual use material getting into the wrong hands as the most probable  source of a bio-terrorist attack. Dual use materials can be used for both constructive and nefarious  purposes1 and are ubiquitous in biological research. Everything from influenza strains to drug delivery  devices has dual use potential. The board recommended engaging the DIY community on this issue by  educating it about the hazards that dual use materials might pose to the nation’s biosecurity. Consensus  between the government and the scientific community has established education and communication as  the best way to avoid accidental exposure. Other agencies like the FBI, NSA, CIA, and DOD bolster  this collaborative atmosphere by aggressively policing and monitoring biochemical weapons. This dual  front solution seems like the most reasonable balance between maintaining national security and  promoting innovation.
In some ways, concerns about bioterrorism are analogous to copyright owners’ objections to  computer copying and distribution technologies. Both DIY critics and copyright owners publicize  dooms day scenarios in which new technology used in the wrong way by the wrong people causes vast  social and economic damage. So far copyright owners have found other ways to successfully monetize  their copyrights as tightening regulation of online copyright infringement is chilled by political  unpopularity. New technology is always disruptive, but rarely are such disruptions catastrophic. As  more and more labs responsibly enter and thrive in the DIY synthetic biology space, those more fearful  and less supportive of this technology may soon have to find a different tune as well.
At the federal level, there are a number of administrative agencies and guidelines relevant to the community laboratory that hopes to practice synthetic biology. Although many of these are aimed at the traditional lab setting, the aspiring community laboratory should abide by all pertinent regulations for the number of reasons stated above. Most importantly, the community laboratory should follow relevant guidelines to ensure the safety of lab its members. Additionally, the lab should strive to ensure they do not adversely affect the environment around them.10
For example, the National Institute of Health (NIH) has compiled a set of guidelines for the regulation of research involving recombinant and synthetic nucleic molecules.13 The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has cited the NIH Guidelines as the key reference in assessing risk and establishing an appropriate biosafety level for work involving recombinant DNA molecules.14 Any group that seeks funding from the NIH must comply by these guidelines. Often, other funding sources  require compliance with these guidelines. Generally"

CP29-RBS-aeBlue-RBS-STM1128-TT/pSB1C3 (BBa_K2230028)
A facilitated sodium/glucose cotransporter encoded by STM1128 was cloned out from Salmonella typhimurium LT2. The expression of the transporter gene was driven by promoter CP29, which is a strong and constitutive promoter working in both E. coli and Lactobacillus spp. The device is able to facilitate the bacterial glucose absorption and also displays blue color to track the engineered bacteria.

CIEI-BJ,2017,Team:CIEI-BJ#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," went to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and consulted  with the experts on July the 28th. The staff showed us the specimens of various kinds of mosquitoes and the mosquito capturing devices. From the conversation, we realized that the mainstream way of mosquito treatment is still toxic chemical or low dose of pesticides. The disadvantage is quite obvious: despite the mosquitoes could grow endurance through time, the chemicals would cause a devastation of the ecosystem while killing other species other than mosquito. Furthermore, the substances get metabolized in human body in most of the cases, especially for young children and the pregnant women, the harm of toxic like DEET could increase exponentially due to their special body condition. What’s more, there are several kinds of diseases spread by the mosquitoes, such as Malaria, Zika Virus and Yellow Fever. This experience gave us a different horizon to look at our problem. Other than information that are directly related to our product, we learnt much about the side knowledge about mosquitoes. To prevent the fatal mosquito-borne diseases from people’s life and keep people healthy, it is really important to produce a kind of mosquito repellent which is toxic free and effective.
Concluding from the questionnaire and our field trip to CDC, we knew that it is critical for a successful mosquito repellents to be nontoxic and effective. After elaborated research, we decided to design a genetic circuit to produce citronellol, which has totally zero toxin and can repel mosquito effectively.
CGEM Summit
We, CIEI-BJ, together with our sister team CIEI-China, set up CGEM Summit and invited another iGEM teams (HFLS-H2Z-HangZhou,RDFZ-China, BIT-China), predecessors iGEMers from Qinghua university , and four professors to our forum, aiming to share our research.
In the beginning, the four iGEM team shared their own research one by one and elaborated their idea and experiments. Then our instructor Mrs. Wang expressed her congratulations and expectations to our new generation who are highly possible to make great contributions to synthetic biology in the future. After this, Professor Chengqi from HangZhou ZC Bio-Sci/Tech Co. LTD shared his own experience when doing research as a biosynthesis scientist. In addition, Professor Lichun from Beijing Institute of Technology made a speech explaining the great significance to study synthetic biology and use it to solve global problems like famine.

SUIS_Shanghai,2018,Team:SUIS Shanghai#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," an earlier publication by the creators of BioBuilder, what were their educational philosophy surrounding it, and what was their motivation for its development. Kuldell & Dixon (2013), described the positive impact the BioBuilder curriculum had on educators, and their approach, who sampled the BioBuilder training and curriculum. There was a marked increase in educators who indicated they would likely teach engineering and design in biology lessons after the training (figure 1), compared to their current classroom practice (before undertaking the training).  We wanted to explore this phenomenon further and also wondered about would there be similar results in international schools such as ours, or indeed did the type of curriculum a school adopts have an impact on this pedagogical approach. We are lucky to be part of a larger educational community in Shanghai as our parent organization operates several different campuses, each with its own unique curriculum and approach to teaching and learning. We decided to design a survey to conduct a study aimed at international schools, with various curricula, in order to investigate our proposed questions and utilize our local resources to help us test and refine our ideas.
Figure 1 - Positive effect of BioBuilder professional development on biodesign and engineering concepts in secondary school biology instruction. Blue bars indicate the percentage of teacher respondents who said they “often” or “frequently” used each concept when teaching their biology classes prior to BioBuilder training. The red bars represent the same teachers who said they would “definatley” incorportae each concept into their teaching in the future.
This survey also aimed to find any relationship between individual educators knowledge and understanding of the field of synthetic biology and their implementation of engineering and biodesign in their classrooms.
We also reached out to Dr. Natalie Kuldell, a professor at the Department of Biological Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who is also the founder and executive director of BioBuilder and a co author of the aforementioned study. We were honored that Dr. Kuldell was willing to speak to us via video link to discuss approaches to engineering and biodesign curriculum development. The meeting, which took place in April, also allowed us to take the opportunity to learn about potential barriers that may face educators which can both directly and indirectly affected the implementation and advancement of synthetic biology skill development in schools. (see Human practices page for more info about this meeting).
Survey Design
After three months of literature review, conversations with our own school administrators, and our in-depth interview with Dr. Kuldell we began to develop our survey. The first draft of the survey was completed and tested on 10 members of our own school faculty. Very"

Our Design
Overview
We decided to develop a probiotic strain of E. coli as a novel, self-tuning therapeutic for IBD. Our core design consists of the following:
NO-dependent IL-10 secretion system
Membrane-anchored nucleoside hydrolase
Riboswitch-ribozyme-sRNA construct
Inducible kill switch
This provides a framework that can be used in a huge range of new projects by future iGEM teams, including biosensors and therapeutics.
Due to the size and impermeability of regulatory interleukin proteins to the bacterial cell membrane, we used adenosine and nitric oxide (NO) as metabolic markers of Treg and Th-17 function respectively. An imbalance in the levels correlates with the autoimmune response. We aim to restore these to healthy proportions by secreting Interleukin 10 (IL-10) - a signal protein which stimulates cell differentiation into T-reg cells.
IL-10 expression is stimulated by the endogenous E. coli SoxR transcription factor, activated by free radicals and oxidative stress, while expression is inhibited in response to adenosine by means of an adenine transcriptional riboswitch linked to sRNA synthesis which will selectively inhibit translation of IL-10 mRNA. The localised action of IL-10 secreted from the engineered bacteria makes our therapeutic best suited to gastrointestinal-based autoimmune diseases. Thus, we decided to focus specifically on IBD.
A single stimulus can result in false positives and excessive suppression, leading to immunodeficiency. Incorporation of a negative feedback loop signaling high Treg populations avoids oversuppression of the immune system. The defining aspect of our design is the integration of two signals in order to increase the specificity and accuracy of our system in equilibrating the populations of Treg and Th-17 cells.
NO-dependent IL-10 secretion system
In our circuit, IL-10 is secreted in the presence of NO and absence of elevated extracellular adenosine. We decided to"

Helen Keller, the established and highly respected American author and political activist, once said “alone we can do so little, together we can do so much”.
Her words have proven to be true time and time again. Our teamwork and collaborations  with other ambitious teams have helped us gain great progress and accomplishments, success we could not have achieved alone.
Thank you so much to everyone who has helped our team, it has been a joy learning from and collaborating with other teams as well!
65 Roses Campaign
Our team hosted the first ever 65 Roses Campaign in Israel. The goal of the campaign was to raise awareness and funds for research in the field of medical care for Cystic Fibrosis patients and CF treatments. We launched our campaign with 65 celebrities in various fields including politics, music, sports, and art to name a few. Each participant took pictures of themselves holding a red rose and posted them to their social media channels to help spread the word. We realized this promotional strategy was both creative and effective, therefore, we decided to try to use the campaign as a potential platform for collaborations with other schools. iGEM teams from all over the world generously participated in our 65 Roses Campaign. The iGEM teams that participated in our campaign are the following: BGU, Danzinger,Technion,Tec Monterrey-Mexico, Guanajuato-Mexico, Bordeux, Groningen, University of Manchester, Stockholm, Harvard, XMU China, Saclay-Paris,Graz,Bangalore, LMU & TU Munich and Sheinfel, Manchester-UK and NTNU-Trondheim-Norway.
Mini Jamboree
The iGEM team Technion hosted us together with the other Israel iGEMs' teams at a wonderful event, the ""Mini Jamboree"", simulating the iGEM competition itself, with judges, presentations, speeches and more.This was a very educational and unique day that helped us direct our preparations for the contest and practice speaking in front of a large crowd. We also had the chance to meet all of other iGEM 2016 participants representing Israel this year.

Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#JoannaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Heather and I are working on is concerned with making synthetic biology accessible to nonscientists, we have a lot of new information to work with and incorporate into our thinking!
Friday, 5/31: After our wet lab experience at MIT yesterday, today was spent back at the HCI lab where we continued our research for our projects. In the morning, Heather and I continued our work with the sifteo cubes and started altering the code as well, seeing if we could rewrite parts of the code to get it to do what we wanted. In the afternoon, we shifted gears once again and started brainstorming actual ideas that we could implement for our project. We came up with three: extending synflo, replicating the glowing tree experiment, and creating a game.
Week 2: June 3 - June 7
A more detailed introduction to synthetic biology.
Monday, 6/3: Today the HCI lab met with the BU igem team! In the morning we were given a more detailed overview of synthetic biology that went beyond the core big ideas of standardization, abstraction, and synthesis. Then, after a group lunch, we completed the Eugene Tutorial, where Eugene is a new language readable by both machines and humans meant to speed up and innovate the design of novel biological devices. To me, it was incredibly exhilarating to see how similar it was to the Java programming language. After the tutorial, I worked with Diana and Pooja to write a program that would return the result dictated in an image that was sent to us. It was great practice and afterwards I felt like I had a very solid foundation in this language.
Tuesday, 6/4: Another day was spent with the BU igem team as we each went over the projects that we were working on. In the morning, BU presented their projects, and after lunch the Wellesley team did their presentations. More time was then spent learning Eugene as we tried to modify and add rules to improve the program we had worked on yesterday. Then, we went on a tour of the BU team’s wet lab, and concluded the day with some bonding over bowling at Jillian’s!
Wednesday, 6/5: Today was spent back at the HCI lab. Heather and I continued our research in the morning, seeing if we could draw up even more ideas that we could add to our current three. Then, in the afternoon, we started fleshing out some sketches in an attempt to solidify some of those ideas. We ran into some trouble here and there, but I made sure to take down lots of notes, which we will definitely discuss during"

We used the biobrock BBa_M30011 (ompR controlled mRFP) to test the Taz construct (BBa_K1343016). Since the page in the parts registry had no record of any experience with the part, we decided to test it.
Two isogenic strains of E. coli K12, BW25113 (parent strain from the Keio collection) and JW3367-3 (with ΔEnvZ mutation) were transformed with pSB1C3 carrying the BBa_M30011 reporter.  The bacteria were cultured in growth media containing varying concentrations of NaCl.  After two hours of growth the relative RFP fluorescence of the cultures was determined (fluorescence/OD).
As a positive control we used E. coli Top10 transformed with biobrick BBa_J04450 (RFP under Plac).
OD was measured at 600nm.
Fluorescence excitation wavelength: 560nm
Fluorescence emission wavelength: 612nm
Figure 1: Relative fluorescence dependent on NaCl concentration (mM)
We expected that the mutant strain (ΔEnvZ) would show a constant level of relative fluorescence which is lower than that of the parent strain.  This is because histidine kinase protein which detects osmolarity changes in the cells environment (EnvZ) is not present in the mutant. The EnvZ does not phosphorylate the ompR.  The low level of fluorescence could be due to another mechanism (such as an acetyl phosphate dependent mechanism) which phosphorylates the ompR, leading to activation of the PompC promoter.  In Figure 1 we see that the mutant showed the expected constant low level of relative fluorescence.
Since the parent strain (+EnvZ) is sensitive to osmolarity changes in the cell’s environment, we expected that an increase in NaCl concentration would cause an increase in relative fluorescence.  This is because at high osmolarity, more ompR is phosphorylated, leading to increased activation of the PompC promoter.  However, the parent strain also showed a constant (but high) level of expression (see Figure 1).  We repeated the experiment three times with different ranges and dilutions of NaCl concentration but all showed a similar result.

The RHIT Team wanted to recognize all the SUPER things iGEM teams are doing so they put out a call to assemble a league of iGEM superheroes.  We created our own superhero and his trusty sidekick to represent our project. The RHIT Team designed trading cards for all the superheroes.

Tec CEM is a team we have gotten along with for multiple years. Their submission is as fun to look at as they are as fun to talk to.

(C) Streaked again after 6 days growth in SRF. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Conclusion: MG1655 E. coli are viable and grow on mixed waste alone. Therefore we have established that our chassis could survive in a mixed waste bio-reactor context, which is validation of our concept to industrially implement our system.
Waste conditioned media
These assays were designed to test whether our chassis, E. coli (MG1655) could grow with waste conditioned media (WCM) over a period of 24-48 hours.  Waste conditioned media is a filter sterilised version of the waste media and was designed for several reasons; Firstly we were unsure whether mixed waste would be toxic to Ecoli and hence a less concentrated version may be more suitable and secondly large chunks of waste would prevent accurate OD600 measurements and therefore we decided to filter out the largest chunks.

Fig 1A - Shows the GFP production under the control of the PgadA and Fig 2B shows the GFP production under the control of the Pasr promoter both in varying pH conditions.
We then compared the results from the western blots to their respective coomassie-stained protein gels. Fig 3 shows the amount of total protein produced by the cells at the respective pH values. The low levels of general protein expression at pH5 (Fig 3A), emphasise the GFP expression observed in Fig 3B at pH5. Likewise, the high general protein expression observed in cells over pH 6 and 7 in Fig 3B lessen the value of the GFP expression observed at this respective pH in Fig 2B.
Figure 3: Coomassie stained protein gels for each pH sensitive promoter-GFP construct.  SDS-PAGE gels were loaded with the same samples as shown in Fig 2, and stained with coomassie dye. Fig 3A shows total protein expression in cells containing PgadA-gfp on a pSB1C3 plasmid. Fig 3B shows total protein expression within cells containing the Pasr-gfp construct on a pSB1C3 plasmid. Level of background protein expression gives a clearer overview of the protein expression observed in Fig2A and 2B.
The data gathered from SDS PAGE experiments gave us an overview of the pH sensitive promoter’s optimal pH range, we now wanted to be able to use a more quantitative approach to assign optimal promoter function conditions. To do this we used a 96 well plate reader to monitor GFP fluorescence and cell growth over the space of 20 hours. This experiment took obtained GFP fluorescence (excitation wavelength = 395nm and excitation wavelength = 509nm) and OD600nm values every 20 minutes yielding a large volume of data and more quantitative values for promoter function over 20 hours. To normalise flouresence measurements we used the following formula:
GFP / OD600nm = Fluorescence per  unit absorbance
The data was then plotted to observe the trend over time as well as taking a snap shot at 16h which is the length of time that overnight samples were left before running SDS PAGE experiments as seen in Fig 2 and 3. The data collected from the plate reader experiments showed a slight difference in optimal pH for the pH sensitive promoter asr. As can be seen in Fig 4A"
Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," work for the collaboration started with the transformation of the single BioBricks. Afterwards, we cloned GFP and the Tar receptor as the first two parts of our expression system together by cutting BBa_K777000 (tar receptor) with SpeI and BBa_E0040 (GFP) with XbaI to form a scar between them and both with PstI to have them in one backbone. Then we integrated promoter and RBS via BBa_J04500 and accordingly BBa_B0015 (terminator) to our emerging expression system in the same way. We confirmed the successful integration of the composite expression system in pSB1C3 by performing a test digestion and gel-electrophoresis. On our agarose gel, we compared plasmids purified from 16 different colonies. We compared them with the control where the expression system was completely integrated and just the terminator was missing. In figure 4, colonies 2, 5, 7 and 15 showed bands with the right size. So we continued to work with these colonies to check for a fluorescence signal.
Figure 4: Gel of the finished expression system (different clones after ligation and transformation) cut with EcoRI and PstI; size of ~2800 bp for the expression system itself and ~2070 bp for the backbone pSB1C3 were expected. Clones 2, 5, 7 and 15 show a band with the right size on the agarose gel.
In conclusion, we checked the expression, the localization and the amount of the Tar-GFP Protein, produced by the created expression system. Therefore, we used the Tecan Plate Reader as device for measuring the GFP signal as you can see in figure 5 to 7. In these experiments we compared the background fluorescence signal of our wild type E. coli BL21 and the used LB medium with the positive colonies from the agarose gel. The evaluation shows that there is a huge difference of the fluorescence values between the wild type colonies (A) and the colonies of the produced expression system (2, 5, 7 and 15). This result indicated that our expression system works and GFP is successfully expressed through our expression system. We fulfilled the measurement with the device of the Tecan Plate Reader twice to verify our results of a fluorescence signal and expression of the Tar receptor-GFP fusion protein in our colonies. In the second measurement the incubation time of the cells was extended.

And then put them in 25°C shaker culture for 5 hours. Then, we took 1mL bacterial liquid to centrifugalize. We picked the precipitation and added 100 μL DDW and 20 μL SDS loading buffer. After that, we heated and boiled it for 15 minutes. And then, it was separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue for 40 minutes. Ultimately, we decolorized it and observed the results.
We find the CAHS is surely expressed in the E.coli BL21 after adding IPTG. Here is the result.
Figure 9. the CAHS protein express in SDS-PAGE. (1, 2, 3 is all with BBa_K2623014. 1 is BL21 with IPTG and pre-heat, 2 is BL21 with IPTG, 3 is BL21 without IPTG, 4 is BL21 without the BBa_K2623014.)
The picture of SDS-PAGE shows the CAHS protein is surely expressed in B+ group (the E.coli BL21 with BBa_K2623014 with IPTG). And CAHS protein isn't expressed in the B- group (the E.coli BL21 with BBa_K2623014 without IPTG) and B0 group (the E.coli BL21 without BBa_K2623014).
We also did experiments with E.coli DH5а, but the SDS-PAGE showed there was no CAHS protein. Because the E.coli BL21 is a kind of strain which can knock out proteases while the E.coli DH5а not. We guess the CAHS protein in E.coli DH5а is degraded. So we chose the BL21 to verify the function of CAHS.
Verify the role of CAHS protein in preserving biological activity
The SDS-PAGE showed the CAHS protein was really expressed in BL21. We cultured the E.coli BL21 bacteria which contained the plasmid BBa_K2623014. We picked the E.coli BL21 bacterial liquid for freeze-drying. First of all, we picked 1mL bacterial liquid to centrifugalize, added 100 μL protective agent (LB+5% Sucrose), and put them in -20°C refrigerator for 2 hours.

By adding a reporter following either of the repressors, we can retrieve the information whether the inducer has ever existed. When using this device, both inducers are allowed to be customized to detect and memorize various events, such as DNA damage and quorum sensing7.
Figure 1 | A representative memory device using toggle switch.
Another type of transcriptional-level-based memory device was designed later in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which involves positive-feedback loops8, 9(Fig.2). This system is bistable as well. In one condition, Inducer 1 does not exist. As a result, Reporter 1 and Activator 2 cannot be transcribed by Promoter 1, making the positive-feedback loop untriggered. In another condition, Inducer 1 induces the sensor and transcribes Activator 2. Activator 2 then binds to Promoter 2, triggering the positive-feedback loop. After the trigger, Reporter 2 will be expressed sustainedly in the absence of Inducer 1. The information is thus stored. Similar to toggle switches, Inducer 1 can be customized. For example, positive-feedback loop was designed to memorize the existence of high pheromone levels in budding-yeast10.
Figure 2 | A representative memory device using positive-feedback loop.
Memory devices based on DNA level
Memory devices based on transcriptional level have two obvious disadvantages that information stored transmitting between two generations is not easy and that information will be lost after cell death. As a result, memory devices based on DNA level was developed, giving memory devices the ability to store information directly on DNA of chasis organisms. There are many types of devices in this category, respectively based on integrases(also known as recombinases) and CRISPR.
Memory devices using integrases was described in 20083(Fig.3). Integrases recombination systems can catalyze reactions including inversion(Fig.3 a), deletion(Fig.3 b) and integration(Fig.3 c) of DNA sequence at specific sites. When two recognition sites(attB/P for serine integrases) are in opposite direction, integrases inverses the DNA sequence between two sites, functioning like a switch. To make it become a true memory device, one inducer controls the expression of the integrase. After the transient induction, integrase is expressed and completes the inversion. We can acquire the stored information in multiple ways, such as PCR or sequencing."

The lab hosted Peter Oladipupo, a Mandela Washington Fellow, answering questions regarding the project as it relates to the generation of energy. It was enjoyable to hear his perspective and show him the progress being made. The day also brought continued research into the development of a model to both inform experimental decisions and make future predictions.

During the week, the team found out that IDT was unable to synthesize another nanowire gene, cancelling the order and decisively tabling the wet lab work for the nanowire side of the project for this competition cycle. So, full steam ahead with phosphorus. Nanowires will be revisited during the school year–strong side project potential!
Week 10
MONDAY, JULY 25
Preliminary trials of testing for phosphorus using the lachat and the ICP-OES at the USDA National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory began. Both machines operate via spectrophotometry, comparing measured values to standard curves. The lachat measures orthophosphate, or soluble reactive phosphorus, while the ICP measures total phosphorus, the entirety of phosphorus contained in a sample. Corresponding with this endeavor, many bottles of Tris-HCl buffer, the media in which phosphorus-eating E. coli will be suspended, were created and autoclaved for future use.
TUESDAY, JULY 26
The week continued by learning to make methanol-free bioencapsulation beads using the sol-gel method. A graduate student in the lab worked with team members to describe and demonstrate the protocol. After practice forming the beads, the team switched to a different method that could be more easily controlled and manipulated. E. coli were added to the beads to determine whether or not they would be able to survive within the structure.
WEDNESDAY, JULY 27
Based on results from the lachat and ICP and the discovery that E. coli would not grow in the originally proposed Tris-HCl buffered solution, the measurement of phosphorus uptake protocol was modified after a productive meeting with advising scientists. Modified microbes will now be suspended in a minimal media solution whose components can be processed by both the sensitive lachat and ICP instruments. Prototype modeling progressed, with team member Barrett composing a 3D model to better-depict uptake system hardware. In the afternoon, a few team members also visited the West Lafayette Wastewater Treatment facility, where they learned about the local area’s methods for phosphorus removal featuring their newly-implemented chemical system.

With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

BIOBRICKS
Aim
In order to assess whether our BioBricks would function in our model organism Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 we attempted to transform and express two BioBricks into S. oneidensis MR-1; J04450 containing a gene for the red fluorescent protein (RFP) and K584001 which contains a gene for the green fluorescent protein (GFP). These BioBricks were chosen as they contain reporter genes and successfully transformed colonies could be easily identified under UV light.
Methods
As S. oneidensis MR-1 are not able to undergo heat shock transformation we used a tri-parental conjugation approach (see protocol). Parent Escherichia coli strains contained J04450 and K584001 respectively using a heat shock approach according to protocol. For step 9 in the tri-parental conjugation protocol chloramphenicol was used instead of kanamycin as BioBricks contain chloramphenicol resistance as a selective marker instead of kanamycin.
Results
After serial dilutions for all attempted conjugations no individual S. oneidensis MR-1 colonies survived, and therefore the cells failed to display chloramphenicol resistance. E.coli parent and helper strains survived, so carbenicillin resistance could have been transferred from S. oneidensis MR-1 to E. coli. Also possible however is that E. coli developed spontaneous carbenicillin resistance as they can easily gain mutations in the carbenicillin target protein, inferring resistance.
S. oneidensis MR-1 failed to display chloramphenicol resistance. As the promoters for the antibiotic resistance genes are constitutive the genes should have been transcribed if present. The origin of replication of these plasmids however, pMB1, has not been used in S. oneidensis MR-1 by past iGEM teams. The Harvard 2008 iGEM team did not list pMB1 as an effective origin of replication for plasmids in S. oneidensis MR-1. Additionally NTU Singapore in 2015 used the pHG101 plasmid which has a different origin of replication to allow for expression of their BioBrick part in S. oneidensis MR-1. Similarly"

End-users
They are the final customers, the ones that will use our product. The absolute necessity is that Cerberus improve their well-being, either because it is an improvement of a technology they used before, either because it brings brand-new possibilities. On the downside, we have a lack of hindsight on putative toxicity of the product. This will have to be thoroughly tested before Cerberus and its associated functions reach the market. A less critical point is the fact that people could be afraid that our technology is issued from GMOs. However, they will not be in contact with GMOs but with a product issued from GMOs, which should make the acceptation easier. The use of unnatural amino acid in Cerberus could also raise suspicions in a public avid of natural compound. On the other hand, such perception is difficult to anticipate since it requires a good molecular biology knowledge to understand how something produced biologically could be unnatural...
Manufacturer
This is the producer of goods with the Cerberus technology. The same concern about toxicity than for the end-users could be addressed for the manufacturer. Beside the end-user benefits, manufacturer could find interest of their own in using Cerberus, for example, to replace dangerous chemicals in their processes. It will be important that Cerberus brought them some competitiveness regarding the price of their products which means that the cost of this new technology should be competitive regarding the one it"

Meeting with Local Farmers
ICT Mumbai interviewed two wheat farmers in India concerning wheat rust, and sent us their responses. Both farmers commonly saw wheat rust in their fields, but were unaware of the Ug99 race group. Wheat rust infections had greatly impacted each of their yields; one reported a 50% yield loss, and the other reported a 25-40% yield loss, and both detected the rust visually. Both farmers controlled fungal infections with fungicide spray and were unaware of what resistance genes their crops had and showed interest in our device. They believed it would be useful by shortening the time required for wheat rust detection."

Among many outlier detection methods, LOF method is a typical density-based high-precision outlier detection method. In the LOF method, each data point is assigned an outlier factor LOF which depends on the density of neighborhood to determine whether the data point is outlier.             If LOF is much larger than 1, the data point is outlier; if LOF is close to 1, the data point is positive constant.
The k distance is defined as the point at the fifth distance from point O (as shown above), represented by D (o) 5 or D (o, 5).             The following conditions are satisfied: there are at least k points P', so that D (O, P') is less than (O, P'), and at most k-1 points in the set, so that D (O, P') is less than (O, P').
Thek-distance field is defined as the set of all points within the k-distance, represented by N (o) 5, and each point satisfies:D (O, P') < D (O, P) .
The definition of point O to point P's K reachable distance isd (O, P) k = max{d (O, K), OP} .
Define the local reachable density: the average reachable distance from all points in the K neighborhood of point O to o, even if the number of points on the K neighborhood boundary is greater than 1, the number of points in the range will be counted as K. If O and its neighbors are in the same cluster, the smaller the reachable distance is, the smaller the sum of the reachable distances is, and the greater the local reachable density is. If O is farther away from the neighboring point, then the reachable distance may take a larger value D (O, P), resulting in the larger the sum of reachable distances, the smaller the local reachable density.
Define a local outlier: The average of the ratio of the local reachable density of other points in the neighborhood of point O to the local reachable density of point O. If the ratio is closer to 1, it means that O has the same neighborhood density and O may belong to the same cluster as the neighborhood; if the ratio is less than 1, it means that O is denser than its neighborhood density and O is dense; if the ratio is greater than 1, it means that O is less dense than its neighborhood density, and O may be an outlier.

Overview
It started with an idea.
A frequency-based band pass filter.
This year, we have taken on a project like none we have done before. Oscillate aims to break through existing biotechnologies through our foundational advance in frequency rather than amplitude sensitive biological systems. Our multifaceted approach to tackling this project spanned research, interacting with experts, and exploring applications. We started with the basics and went to the foundations of synthetic biology. We spoke with professors in fields ranging from electrical and computer engineering to biomedical engineering and gauged the feasibility of our ideas. We listened to their feedback and ideas and incorporated them into our wet lab practices and modeling. After implementing their considerations into our design, we also tested our project with expert feedback and advice in mind. Finally, we went to various fields to discuss the applications and implications of our project, doing all this while considering the ethical and entrepreneurial implications of our project. For our in-depth analysis of the various societal dimensions of our project, refer to our policies page!
We present our work as it relates to four themes: Project Conception, Evaluation Biological Components, Optimization and Modeling, Testing. For each of these themes, we recognized our project’s limitations, explored different aspects of our questions through interviews, and implemented our findings into our project.
We integrated what we learned through our human practices and delved into the vast possibilities of applications.

As we took off with our idea of a frequency-sensitive genetic circuit, we knew that implementing this abstract concept could not be done solely by ourselves. We drew inspiration from a whole host of experts in fields such as chemical engineering, bioengineering, biophysics, and computational biology. Throughout every stage of our project, we asked critical questions, for example, on the assumptions we held about our project, always seeking to involve the academic"

With all three reactions being reversible, MATLABs dsolve function was not able to solve our differential equations. We tried them by hand but were not able to solve them analytically. We had to solve numerically and chose the Euler method. This involves iterating with short time intervals (here we used dt ≈ 1s) between each calculation using a loop to keep a record of how the substances changed over time. We then graphed these values as follows:
k1
k-1
k2
k-2
We’ve recreated this model so it’s actually running in the browser - try dragging the sliders above the graph to modify the rate constants.
Mass action kinetics model with transcription and translation
The first simple model neglected transcription and translation completely, which meant it was an excessive simplification and consequently was not that useful. To address these shortcomings, we created a second model, derived from parts of Tobias Stögbauer’s PhD, with many more species. [5]
This model was very slow to run (so slow we’re not going to try run it in the browser), as there were many species and thus more calculations needed to be done per loop. However, it primarily was slow as we needed a small dt value to keep the model accurate so there were more loops in total.
We had to use a very small dt value or errors could easily add up with so many species. It ended up taking about a minute to run each simulation which wasn’t acceptable for us, as we wanted to be able to quickly change parameters and ideally test a range of parameters. Speeding up the model would make it more useful to the wetlab team. They then could vary each of our parameters and see how they affected GFP output, for example seeing the effects of different switch designs and experimental setups.
Having lots of species also made it harder to find accurate rate constants for all the steps in the reaction. Tobias Stögbauer’s PhD was very useful for this, although many of his values weren’t that applicable to us as we used a different cell-free system leading to inaccuracies -  which were amplified when dt was increased.
It was also difficult to get useful data from the model as there were so many parameters that changing just one was unlikely to have a significant effect on the final result. This made it harder to draw conclusions from the model. For similar reasons it would also have made it hard to adjust the parameters to fit to our lab data when we had it. More parameters also increased the total uncertainty, decreasing the precision of our model.

Microfluidic Agent-Based Model
Motivation and Aim
Digital microfluidics is an area of study intersecting biology, computer science, electronics and several different engineering disciplines. The technology has seen a number of advances and improvements over recent years, with the dream of a “lab on a chip” inching ever closer. Digital microfluidic devices satisfy the requirements of our project very well as they allow the process of switching modular components to be automated.       The aim of creating this model is to create software to be used alongside microfluidic devices to continue the theme of automation of production of modular components in the project.
Why Digital Microfluidics?
The motivation behind working on a project creating software for digital microfluidics over other microfluidic techniques stems from the numerous advantages that it confers over a more traditional setting involving continuous flow microfluidics. The most basic of these advantages is very simple in that it allows for a reduction in consumed reagents and samples. A natural bonus of this is the expenses saved in using lower quantities of reagents. This also offers another less obvious advantage in that as other microfluidic techniques have shown, a lower reagent volume causes a faster overall result (Whitesides, 2006). The comparatively larger surface to volume ratio which can be achieved with the droplets also aids the speed with which reactions can occur. (Haeberle and Zengerle, 2007). As such, when dealing with single droplets of reagents, as is always the case in a digital microfluidic setting, digital microfluidic technologies are therefore able to achieve results faster than is otherwise possible. Alongside the innate benefits derived from the physics of using single droplets as described above, the much greater degree of automation conferred from use of a digital microfluidics system is also significant in speeding up laboratory processes. Even when introducing sensing systems and feedback control a very high degree of precision in the generation of droplet volumes (Liu, Banerjee and Papautsky, 2014) and also the control of mixing processes (Gong and Kim, 2008) is attainable. Combining this with the ability to then parallelise multiple versions of the same functions on the same chip all at one time, providing simultaneous output of multiple reactions, allows for a vast decrease in the time-scale required for comparatively larger amounts of reagents in reactions. This provides a very valid use case for the automation of modular variants in our project. When creating the programs both for the system to"
HBUT-China,2018,Team:HBUT-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"General demographic situation
Age structure
A total of 957 competed questionnaires were collected in this investigation. Most of the population was among the 18-25 and 41-50 year old age groups, respectively accounting for 66.04% and 11.18% of the total. The age of the sample was thus somewhat different from the national population. This is perhaps expected for online surveys, which generally tend to skew towards younger and better-educated respondents.
Occupation
In the survey population, most of them are students，accounting for 64.37% of all respondents.
Awareness of water，heavy metal pollution
About half (53.61%) of the respondents felt that the water pollution situation was normal. 27.06% people felt that the pollution was serious. For everyone's usual drinking water, few people (23.3%) is relieved. most people think that the source of water pollution is industrial pollution (85.79%) and domestic wastewater and garbage (84.74%). Most people are more worried about water pollution to the human body (69.17%) and aquatic animals ( 63.95%).At the same time, most people (83.49%) believe that the problem of improving water quality is mainly the responsibility of the polluting enterprises themselves. Although more people (68.03%) understand the environmental pollution and harm to humans caused by heavy metal ions, only 16.61% of the methods for treating nickel pollution with microorganisms have no worries, and only about half of them (52.25%) completely willing to use the microbiologically treated aquatic products that our team plans to develop. This shows that most people still have some understanding of water pollution and heavy metal pollution. However, there is still a certain psychological burden for using biological methods to deal with water pollution. Therefore, our follow-up publicity and public education are very necessary.
Awareness of synthetic biology
Among the 957 respondents, most of them heard (46.08%), understood (11.7%) or learned (8.46%) about synthetic biology. Only 2.93% people’s attitude towards synthetic biology is objected. However, 42.01% people expressed concern. I think most people may be worried about the ethical issues of synthetic biology.
Analysis chart
Conclusion
According to this survey, we learned that with the development of science and technology, it has also brought more and more environmental pollution problems. Most people say that there is a certain amount of pollution in life, and everyone is also concerned about pollution, and express the eager hope and concern for solving the pollution problem.

Now that we were thinking about using Cas13a in combination with paper microfluidics, we wanted a method to make it easier for us to dry the protein on the paper. Additionally, we wanted to do this in such a way that the final product would be cell-free. Inspiration for the solution came from other iGEM teams, who had previously tried to produce vesicles and transport green fluorescent protein in these vesicles. Vesiculation would indeed be a solution to our problem, so it was added as an integral part of our project.

Importance of stakeholder mapping

Validating project with stakeholders
Towards a value sensitive design
Summary
We started this course by mapping all factors relevant for our design. We included every possible factor that could in some way be influenced by our technology. The next step was to identify the most important stakeholders and their values. We came up with many values, some were colliding. During this course we had to analyse potential stakeholders and we came up with a value sensitive design. However, we found out that we still had a broad range of stakeholders, leading to many values that had to be integrated. After this course, we really started steering our project towards a more relevant application. We decided that we needed to narrow our scope in order to integrate values into our design. We interacted with many more stakeholders and set up a new value sensitive design. This course was good practice and a good starting point after which the real stakeholder interactions began.

Kindstar Globalgene (Beijing) Technology, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “Kindstar Global”) is the first and biggest leading-edge medical esoteric testing service group in China. This company provide a series of clinical tests, including tumor disease tests, genetic diseases teasts, hematologic dematologic disease tests.
About tumor disease tests, there are several common tumor detection , such as lung cancer ,breast cancer, and Colorectal Cancer etc  .cancer. However, we realized that there is a lack of resource on the diagnose of kidney cancer.
In order to identify our research direction and feasibility, we planned to seek professional advice in local authoritative hospital. Fortunately, we got Dr.Guo’s contact information with advisor’s assistance. Afterward, we made an appointment with Dr.Guo and prepared for our interview draft and some equipment for interviewing.
Dr. Guo told us that kidney cancer is not easy to detect, if detected in time, through surgical treatment, may not have bad impact on the life span of patients. However, as mentioned above, After visiting the biological company, we found that the technology that can diagnose kidney cancer does not exist. Moreover, Dr, Guo told us that the current treatment methods for kidney cancer  are very limited, so many patients once found have this cancer already in the last stage , at this stage, The possibility of successful cure rates will be very low, These findings give a clearer direction to our experimental design. We assume that if our project can help advance the early diagnosis of kidney cancer or in the development of cancer drugs. That would be very encouraging.
See How We Affect The World
In order to better promote our future research. We prepared two questionnaires to investigate the public's understanding of kidney cancer and synthetic biology in the project we investigated. These Questionnaire results have conduct us to promote public awareness of kidney cancer and synthetic biology.
Our survey shows that most people are scared of cancer, 67% of them know cancer around them. About kidney cancer, there are 63% people have heard about it, we speculate that cancer is a systemic disease, so people will consider any organ is at risk of cancer, But only 9% know much about kidney cancer. What's more, 28% of them have never heard of it.

Realizing Flower Fairy in real world
Have you ever seen flower fairies? Probably the answer is ""NO"", (though some of you might have come across them in your childhood,) because they are imaginary creatures which exist only in fairy tales. Don’t you think it would be wonderful if you could live with flower fairies? In addition, their lovely power to make flowers bloom would be profitable for us in many ways, such as application to agriculture. This is"

Fungicide test: anti-fungal activities
CAUTION : all the lab equipment must be desinfected before and after the manipulations with the fungi.
Three different fungus strains were used : Aspergillus brasiliensis, Aspergillus nidulans and Trichoderma reesei
- The conidia can be taken by adding one drop of Tween 80 on the fungus plate.
- Then the drop is mixed with 1mL of sterile water in an Eppedorf.
- A microscopy count can be performed thanks to Thoma cell to determine the conidia concentration.
NB : The conidia solutions are then diluted and spread on sap medium to get 10,000 conidia/plate.
- After 72 hours of liquid culture of the different clones of B. subtilis with the fungicides module, the culture can be centrifugated.
- 130µL of the supernatant is used to soak a pad placed on the conidia plate. The bacterial pellet is resuspended in 130µL of LB medium and also put on a pad.
- The plates containing 10,000 conidia and the soaked pads are then put at room temperature for a few days according to the growth speed of the fungi. Controls are also realized with wild type strains or copper sulfate at 10 and "

Environmental Water Samples
We collaborated with seven other iGEM teams to test the quality of environmental water across the United States. RHIT, IvyTech, Northwestern, BYU, UCSC, UCSF-UCB, and Yale iGEM teams were kind enough to send us 50 mL water samples from creeks, rivers, and lakes in their local areas. We tested these samples for heavy metal contaminants to gauge the extent of heavy metal pollution across the United States. We also provided each of our collaborating teams a water quality report to inform them of the quality of their local water and, if warranted, to guide future remediation efforts. A compilation of these water quality reports can be found here .  Of the 9 total samples that we tested for heavy metals, 4 contained a measurable amount of nickel, four contained a measurable amount of lead, and three contained a measurable amount of mercury. These metals tended to be present together, as three samples contained all three contaminants and one sample contained two. While these concentrations were not incredibly high, measured concentrations of mercury and lead both exceeded the maximum allowable levels for drinking water. What this data suggests is that even in the United States where strict regulations are put on drinking water quality and waste disposal, heavy metal pollution is still a widespread problem that needs to be addressed.

Biological Toolkit for copper detection
The world's production (supply) and consumption (demand) of copper have increased dramatically in the past 25 years. Massive mining and extensive using of copper results in serious contamination to environment, and then copper contamination threaten the balance of the whole ecosystem. We design a circuit that can better detect the amount of copper ions than before. We improve a previous Part by placing  self-cleaving RNA ribozyme RioJ between the promoter of CopA and RBS, and  replacing reporter of GFP by sf GFP. PcopA is regulated by Cue R protein. We design a new part that is made up of L-arabinose inducing pBAD, RBS and Cue R coding sequence. Furthermore we connect the improved part and the new part together, which is the circuit of our project. It is found that Cue R protein of different concentration affects the response of pCop A to Copper ions."

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," with current diagnostic methods were also identified by doctors who completed our survey. Many patients have to undergo these tests - as there is no other way to rule out NSCLC. Although biopsy and CT scan would still be required to stage a tumor, our sensor could rule out cancer in many patients. Below are some of the problems with current diagnostic methods, and how our sensor be beneficial.
In our survey, all doctors agreed that new diagnostic methods were needed and that liquid biopsies could be more effective than current methods. We carried out research into current methods based off their concerns:
Attribution: NithinRao, in public domain
CT scanning is the best way of making an initial diagnosis of NSCLC. [9] It is more accurate than an X-ray and sputum cytology (examining coughed up mucus) - these have been shown to provide no benefit in screening and can increase false positive rates. [5] Sputum cytology is rarely used in the UK as it has low sensitivity with inconsistent results (although there is promise for the future [10] ). Further tests, such as ultrasound may be used to confirm the results of a CT, and repeat CT scanning is used to assess the growth of a tumor. PET-CT, ultrasound, MRI, bronchoscopy (with possible biopsy) and X-ray are performed for specific cases. [9]
However, CT scanning has its limitations as the initial diagnostic method. It is cumbersome as it requires specialist centers with immobile equipment. [8] The results of a CT scan are difficult to interpret; they are so sensitive that benign lesions are frequently picked up as CT scanning also cannot distinguish between benign nodules and those that will progress to be cancerous. [10] Repeat scans are then required to observe whether the lesion grows (and is therefore malignant) or is benign.
When low dose CT was trialed as a lung cancer screening program it caused high rates of false positives (see the screening section ). [2] . False positive CT scans then lead to unnecessary invasive procedures - like bronchoscopy or even surgery. [5] Furthermore, it takes up to two weeks to schedule a CT and the results from current tests scans can take a further week to come back in the UK. [11] CT scans for NSCLC are usually done with contrast - which needs to be injected - meaning the procedure is somewhat invasive. Furthermore, CT scans result in exposure to radiation which may increase the risk of cancer in the future [12] .
As a result, there is still a need for away to accurately screen high risk population groups "
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the reaction system you choose.
Validating the Reaction
Use agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA to validate the reaction.
If the result of agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA is primarily positive, send the sample for DNA sequence to confirm the result if necessary.
If the sequence is confirmed, reproduce and preserve the target bacteria strain for further use.
Express and harvest cells. Resuspend cells in 10mM phosphate buffer (pH=7) in 15mL centrifuge tubes.
Freeze thawing the cells with liquid nitrogen.
Unfreeze the cells in 37°C water bath.
Use Ultrasonication Extraction to get cell lysis solution. Transfer cell lysis solution into 1.5mL centrifuge tubes.
Put the tubes into 60°C drying oven.
After 1 hour, centrifuge the tubes in 1.5mL centrifuge for 10min with 13000r/min at 4°C.
Collect the supernatant and transfer 700μL to each 1.5mL centrifuge tube.
Add 700μL saturated (NH4)2SO4
After a few minutes, centrifuge for 5min with 10000r/min.
Collect the supernatant and add 10μL 1M phosphate buffer (pH=7).
