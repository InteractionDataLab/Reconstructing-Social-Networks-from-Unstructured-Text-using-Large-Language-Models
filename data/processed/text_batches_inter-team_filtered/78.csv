The complexation between Oxalic acid bis-(cyclohexylidene hydrazide) (BCO) and Cu2+ will be triggered when the pH reaches to 7~9 and generates a kind of blue clathrate, of which the absorbance at 600nm is linearly correlated with the concentration of Cu2+. It's a generally used method for the determination of trace amount of Cu2+ in polluted water. We chose pH 8.8 for reaction.
Figure5.2 standard curve of certain Cu2+ concentration shows the stability of BCO test. While the time-absorbance curve of BCO test of pET-28a-oprF-GS(linker)-CBP culture shows the successful immobilization of Cu2+
Growth curves
6. Growth curves test
To ensure the survival of our E. worker in industrial sewage, we grew E. coli carrying parts in medium containing corresponding pollutant, and measured the OD600 of the culture to draw the growth curve. We cloned the part responsible for the removal of each kind of pollutant, specifically copper, cyanide and fluoride, into vector pET28a respectively. The part is under the regulation of T7 promoter. After transformed into E. coli BL21 strain, IPTG was added to induce expression. E. coli carrying pET28a backbone was used as negative control. The number of bacteria in medium is judged by OD600. The higher the OD600, the more bacteria the medium contains. So we take the OD600 value as the bacteria growth.

Synthetic biology is one of the most developing and emerging     technologies to date. [1] The field of synthetic biology is     continuously developing. As in iGEM, real-world applications are     constantly shifting ideas, more research becomes available. There     is only a pressing concern, especially with the microbial systems.     Genetically modified bacteria may produce undesired consequences if     they are released into the environment
In order to provide an idea of the risks possible of releasing     GMO in the environment, risk should be assessed. In this special     case of our project, we should not only assess the safety risks but     also the security risks

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," experiment, varying microcystin concentrations did not significantly affect any of our promoters, which we concluded to be due to the inability of the transporter to import the toxin into the cell.
Figure 4. Results of flow cytometry analysis. Effect of microcystin on yellow fluorescence production under different stress promoters in SS328-leu with and without (w/o) QDR2 transporter from VL3.
Discussion
We managed to prove that the transporter replacement had changed the phenotype of host cells through studying its catalase. This would support correct integration of the new transporters. Despite the phenotype change, the transporter did not seem to be functional based on flow cytometry experiments of microcystin induction. Therefore, it must be that the transporter affects catalase activity in some other way than through increasing microcystin transport.
The specific functions of VL3’s QDR2 transporter besides the capability to transport microcystin aren’t known, but it is possible that it does not have a similar hydrogen peroxide antiporter function as the corresponding transporter in our lab strain (SGD ID: S000001383). In this case it could be that replacing the transporter allows more hydrogen peroxide to accumulate inside the cell, which results in a higher catalase response. This might be the case if the VL3 transporter doesn’t perform similar functions in hydrogen peroxide transport. This response doesn’t require the new transporter to be functional, only that the original transporter in SS328-leu is not present anymore. The increased catalase activity in the presence of hydrogen peroxide in samples without microcystin also supports this theory. Integrating the transporter into a different locus in the genome or expressing it in a plasmid while leaving the original transporter intact would confirm this theory. In general, this might be a better option, as the removal of the original transporter creates an extra variable that makes the functional verification of the new transporter more difficult.
As we only had time to properly test the strep-tagged transporter variant, it is possible that the other variants would produce better results; the strep tag might interfere with transporter functionality or correct localization. A verification of the correct localization of transporter should be performed to confirm this, as we had planned to do by overexpressing the transporter under the GAL1 promoter.
In addition, it is also possible that the true, functional VL3 transporter has a leucine instead of an isoleucine as the single uncertain amino acid in its sequence. Although this is a small difference, it could nevertheless potentially prevent the transporter from functioning entirely as intended. If experiments could be continued, the other"

These three graphs show the amount of papers published each year containing certain search queries, as well as the number of times these papers were cited. All graphs show positive tendencies: the competition is becoming more wide-spread and more iGEM-related papers are being published and recognized. The search queries were chosen to show which part of iGEM is usually cited: the iGEM competition, the Registry of Standard Parts, or both. The data shows that only around half of papers will cite both elements.  It should be noted that some outlying data points were ignored as they are obvious mis-searches.

It was was clear that as well as the Red and White Biotechnology has precedence the furthest in the development. New technologies such as Systems Biology and particularly Synthetic Biology were observed more critically. Here the iGEM teams were aware that it applies to the next scientific generation to discuss topics like synthetic biology in an open and honest way and especially integrate the people. For this reason the German iGEM teams have pronounced an event day on 25th of August. All German teams in common should try to inform the people about their projects and also synthetic biology. It is up to the young scientists to inform about new technologies and to reflect them so that they can be explored and used in Germany.

This we are also continuing to work with Maya on biology animation. We went over the whole biological process taking place in the device to get a better understanding of the details so we can model it.
Week 16: August 18th - August 22nd
.
This week we got the results from the plate reader experiment and generated the graphs to visualize the data. First, cell count vs time was graphs for E. coli with RFP, E. coli with LacZ and B. Subtilis with RFP. E. coli with RFP grew more rapidly and reached the flat region after about 7-8 hours, while E. coli with RFP and B. subtilis with RFP did not reach the flat region in the 20 hours period, but steady growth can be observed. Our second graph represents fluorescence of RFP vs time. E. coli with LacZ was expected to be a zero. However, one of the controls for LacZ (blank media) was not zero which suggests it was contaminated with RFP. The graph for E. coli with RFP is really clean and follows the expected trend. The graph for B. subtilis with RFP is less clear, but still follows the general trend. The second graph shows fluorescence of LacZ vs time. The graph does not quite meet the expectations, so we are going to repeat the experiment using our colour sensor. This week we also continued working on the 3D animation of our device and prepared the draft animation that includes the animation of the biological processes taking place in the device. We talked to members of the biology sub-team to see what can be improved in the animation. Cesar will also be taking a look at the animation to make suggestions on how we can improve.

Fig.2 FET3 and FTR1 proteins assemble into a complex in a cellular compartment early in the secretory pathway, most likely in the ER. The complex progresses to a post-Golgi compartment, where the CCC2 protein mediates copper delivery to FET3 protein. Finally, the copper-loaded F ET3 protein, presumably still complexed to FTR1 protein, is delivered to the plasma membrane and becomes competent for iron transport.
2.IRE-IRP1
Saccharomyces cerevisiae post-translationally regulates the expression of the plasma membrane high affinity iron transport system, consisting FET3 protein and FTR1 protein, in response to iron need. Incubation of cells in high iron leads to the internalization and degradation of both FET3 protein and FTR1 protein. Since we are looking for a way to accumulate iron within the cell, the cell should promote the absorption with the presence of iron. We thus cast our eyes to other mammalian iron regulation system.
In human cell, the cellular levels of ferritin and transferrin receptor (TfR) are also primarily regulated at translational level upon changes in iron availability, through interactions between iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) and iron responsive elements (IRE) in the 5’ UTR of H- and L-ferritin mRNA and the 3’ UTR of TfR mRNA. When intracellular iron levels rise, IRP1 can’t bind IRE, IRP2 is degraded and ferritin mRNA is efficiently translated. [fig.3] When iron level is high, IRP1 exists as a cytosolic aconitase. When iron is low, it assumes an open configuration associated with the loss of iron atoms in the iron-sulfur cluster, and can bind the IRE stem loop.[fig.4]
Fig.3 Decreased iron supply activates binding of IRPs to IRE resulting in translational inhibition of the mRNAs encoding ferritin and stabilization of the Tf R mRNA. During high iron conditions, IRPs lose their affinity for IREs, increasing translation of ferritin mRNAs and degradation of the Tf R mRNA.

We ran a gel involving the restriction digest of the two TAL repressors. The bands appeared to be of the right size, which indicates that we do have the correct plasmid. We’ve decided to run another set of PCR reactions with additional template DNA and decided to extend the elongation time. We ran a gel of the PCR reactions to check to see if the correct product sizes were amplified. At the end of the day, we looked at our gel and noticed two different fragments in most lanes at the 600 and 800 base pair sizes. After talking to our adviser, we’ve decided to switch out our polymerase for an enzyme that can better handle a template with high G/C content. Both of our TAL repressors have approximately 67% G/C content, and we realized that this may be why we are only getting partially amplified product. We also realized that we were running low on DNA for additional PCR reactions, so we did another transformation with our two TAL repressors. We decided to grow the culture and do a miniprep over the weekend. The culture of the mutated pSB3K3 was miniprepped and sent out for sequencing. The cultures containing BBa_K750000 and BBa_K598010 were also grown up in LB until they reach an OD of 0.5. Then, the cultures were aliquoted into a 96-well plate for Tecan measurements. The part for Imperial College was also prepared to be sent overseas soon.

Marburg,2014,Team:Marburg:Project:NRPS_-_-_TEXT.html," the testing of our prediction, we synthesized the fusion protein with these five different linker lengths.
Figure 4: Design and functional analysis of different RiboSURF constructs. (A) Computational molecular model of Arc1p-C-PheA fusion proteins with  different linker lengths, and (B) their activities in aminoacylating tRNA. (C) Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE of purified RiboSURF catalysts proteins employed in this project.  Proteinmarker: Broad Range (New England Biolabs). (D) Workflow for the detection of aminoacylation levels.
The 8x linker was constructed from a synthesized template and integrated into pET28a by Gibson assembly. The other lengths were created by round-the-horn site directed  mutagenesis using phosphorylated primers and a ligation after the PCR. All the proteins (Figure 4C) were produced as His6 tagged fusion proteins. For testing the catalytic  activity of each mutant we used an LC-MS based assay. Since the phosphate backbone leads to a multiple negative charge the direct analysis by mass spectrometry probably  would lead to a too poor sensitivity to discriminate loaded and unloaded tRNAs (Figure 4D). Thus we decided to make an indirect measurement based on an established method.  After the reaction mixture was incubated we separated the tRNA from all the other components by size-exclusion chromatography. The obtained mixture of loaded and unloaded  tRNAs was split and one half kept on ice while the other was treated with a base to cleave the oxoester bond. Afterwards the amount of released amino acid in the base  treated sample was detected by LC-MS using the untreated sample as a negative control.
Measurements showed that all fusion constructs were able to load L- as well as D-phenylalanine onto tRNAPhe. As the computational molecular model already  suggested the varying linker length showed a clear influence on the yield levels with the 2x-GSSG linker showing the highest catalytic activity yielding 11% loaded  tRNA after 30 min while the 8x-construct reached only a maximum of 3% loaded tRNA as well as the linker-less version. The remaining constructs showed intermediate  results in good correspondence with the computational model (Figure 4B).

Furthermore the linking of the two domains leading to the increase in reactant concentration and the correct spatial arrangement is indeed important for the catalytic  effect to occur since a mixture of the unlinked"
HKU-HKBU,2009,Team:HKU-HKBU#Human Practice Interview_-_-_TEXT.html," are committees out there closely monitoring and regulating our genetic research activities , making sure our practices have its risk being kept to minimal. We could not just stop research when people say it is dangerous or it is unethical. Instead, we need to find compromise between one and other because we understand how this scientific field can revolutionize the world , especially in the human health.
HKU-HKBU: To be honest, many people regard scientists/researchers as some crazy people doing things that no one can understand. In your view, is there really a gap between the science and the public? What can be done to improve this situation?
DR.H: I would say there really is a gap between the scientists and the public in Hong Kong, especially Hong Kong being a world-renown financial city. I think the most effective way to close this gap is by communicating with the public via public lectures, TV and online videos. Additionally, I also suggest our young undergraduates to tark with your parents and friends, this not only allow the public to know more about science but also as a way to develop your communication skills.
DR.W: I remember the time when I was in America as a postgraduate student, I was so amazed with all those stunning collections in the Science Museums at the States, they are all free and you can hang around in there for whole day without being bored. I hope the government can devote more resources into the education of science, not only to the current students but to the general public, allowing them to know Science is not that mysterious.
After some nice fore-and-back Q & A session, we also discussed briefly on the future of Science development in Hong Kong. They both think that one of the main obstacles ahead of the Science development in Hong Kong is the lack of support from the government. They pointed out that only a mere 0.79% of GDP was used in research activities in Hong Kong in 2008, comparing to ~ 2.5% in many other developed countries/regions. This figure is extremely low comparing to Japan 3.53%, United States 2.62% and Taiwan 2.58%. That's why many outstanding undergraduates at Hong Kong choose to perform research activities in other countries and thus further retard the Science development in Hong Kong. However, we all believed that Science will be more frequently under the spotlight in the coming decades as more health problems, climate problems and energy crisis emerges out. They also advised us to keep our faith and passion for Science because this is where success and breakthroughs come.

On the boundary of large circle:
In the space between the two circles:
After simulating for 4000s, we can find the concentration of AHL on the site of radius 0.3cm is 5.3×10-2μM.
Then with results from reference [27], we can conclude that there is a red ring among the place of radius 0.3cm.
So, when the concentrate of ligand is 0.01mol/L, after 4000s, there will be a red belt around the center with radius of about 0.3cm.
As the concentration of ligand increase, the speed of AHL production and degradation will increase.             It is reasonable to assume that the amount of AHL going out to diffusion is always the same.             In result, there will be more AHL going out as ligand increase, and the red belt will go             further out after same amount of time. Besides, if the ligand concentration decreases, the red belt will go in after same amount of time.
The boundary conditions of the inner circle will change, as the ligand concentration decrease.
We may consider another situation.On the boundary of small circle:
All the other conditions are the same as the pervious situation. After 40000s, the result will be as follows.             There is a red belt of radius about 0.3cm after 40000s. It is easy to conclude that if we control the time,             the radius of belt will move out as the concentration of ligand increase.

Transfer to Arduino: 115,200 bits/second, 14,400 bytes/second         Transfer to motor controller: standard mode of I2C: 100,000 bits/second, 12,500 bytes/second         Bytes required for one command: 12
Therefore the maximum theoretical number of commands that can be sent at once is 12,500/12 = 1040. Including a safety margin of over 5x to ensure that all servo/syringe combinations can move 5x per second to ensure smooth motion all at once, Neptune’s set maximum is 200 servo/syringe combinations.
Neptune transforms the build area of a desktop CNC mill into that of an entire machine shop, and beyond. By milling square, modular components with pre-drilled holes for easy mounting Neptune can span a build area of one 4.2”x 4.2” square to hundreds of feet in any direction. This modularity, in addition to enabling huge build areas, allows for custom baseboard configurations to fix each project’s individual needs. The pre-drilled holes ensure proper component alignment and spacing, further adding to Neptune’s ease-of-use.

Future Plans for Neptune
EXPERIMENT SCHEDULING & AUTOMATION THROUGH NEPTUNE
Neptune has the ability to guide a user through designing, building, and controlling a microfluidic system. Further development on this functionality will incorporate the automation of controlling an experiment in a microfluidic chip through Neptune. We plan to design a scheduling language which Neptune will use to schedule events such as opening or closing a valve or dispensing a certain amount of liquid at specific times. The user will be able to utilize this functionality in a graphical, intuitive way. This will enable a scientist to run a completely automated experiment through Neptune’s tool chain.
INTEGRATION OF SENSORS INTO SYSTEM
In order to allow a more precise control over a microfluidic system through Neptune, we plan to incorporate sensor data collection into the GUI. When running an experiment, automated monitoring of factors such as fluorescence, temperature, and pH can allow for a more intelligent experiment scheduling. For example, if cells in a cell trap need to reach a certain level of fluorescence before a nutrient is washed over them, our future plans for Neptune provide an interface where a biologist can monitor this fluorescence using sensors (such as those manufactured by Atlas"

Funding
Funding was a vital factor in sustaining our project; there was many restraints that our team had as high school students. Among various human practices that we progressed throughout several months, funding was one of the most important gains that we had. One of the most obvious means to engage the public in the project was funding: a mean for the public to directly support us. Our team searched for few websites that could provide us an opportunity to let public know of our project, and fund us if they were interested in it. Tumblbug provided us a chance to present our project to the public. For this, we appealed to the public by stressing what good deeds we are doing to the environment, by creating a better system of plastic degrading through bioengineering. The result of the funding surely indicated that many people were engaged in our project, and wanted to be a part of it; the first day we launched our funding, over $1,000 was funded which was over our final goal. Our funding project was shared over Facebook and twitter for about 200 times. There were also comments that gave supporting messages. Not only did our team engage in funding, but we also gained support from companies who were interested in our project. OCI, one of the leading companies in promoting green energy and chemical technologies, lend a hand to be our sponsor in funding, and also providing a laboratory in Sungnam-Si whenever we need a place to conduct an experiment.
SNS
Team KoreaSonyeodul has a Facebook page where we put informations of our project such as campaigns. We thought Facebook might be a useful tool to reach public directly and fastly.
Twitter also was another tool used to engage with another IGEM teams and to reach the public."

This summer I mainly work on the conduction of the Measurement tract and the construction of standard parts.
Working on iGEM has allowed me to think of life science through a complete different way'to design a life purposely, to test the possibilities. The construction of standardizing parts is filled with weird and constant error results that had nearly driven me crazy, but they are the key moments for creativity and analysis. It's cool to cooperate with diverse people and have brain storms from time to time. It's a wonderful experience of my life.

Standardization
Standardization of MoDeL
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. Knowing the importance, USTC_Software puts a lot of effort on the standardization of MoDeL. We have requested BBF RFC55 for MoDeL, and constructed a beta version of XML schema to describe the XML structure of MoDeL.
BBF RFC55
BBF RFC55: Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language (MoDeL) mainly describes the detailed language specifications of MoDeL with concrete examples, which provides enough information for serious database constructors to build up a database on his own. As a highlight of MoDeL, the concept and the syntax of Chain-Node Model are described in detail. The content of document is currently arranged as follows:
Figure 1: Draft document of RFC55 - Table of Contents
The document of RFC55 has already been submitted. You can find it on the webpage of The BioBricks Foundation:RFC . Following are some more previews at the draft document.
Figure 2: Preview at draft document of RFC55
Figure 3: Preview at draft document of RFC55
XML Schema
XML Schemas express shared vocabularies and allow machines to carry out rules made by people. They provide a means for defining the structure, content and semantics of XML documents. Being written in XML fashion, a Schema is perfect for MoDeL to allow software to perform check on syntax. Following is the preview of the beta version of XML Schema for MoDeL. The Schema can be downloaded at iGaME project page on SourceForge.

Future work
To promote MoDeL for wide use as a standard, we need to refine the structure of MoDeL definition and extend its content to enable descriptions of more biological process. In the future, the new version of MoDeL will be proposed and new functions of iGame will be added.
Next version of MoDeL
MoDeL is young, to be exact, just born. There must be a long way before he can stand up and run by himself. At this stage, we have to take extra care of him. Knowing the drawbacks of MoDeL, we have already"

DNA Electrophoresis:
For detailed information on how to prepare and run agarose gel see following protocol .
Figure 3. DNA electrophoresis with samples from restriction     digestion.
Figure 4. DNA electrophoresis with samples from restriction     digestion.
Conclusion:
RD of the PCR product of sfGFP(Sp), integration plasmid pDR111 and    pDR111+message was successful. RD of pDR111 and pDR111+message was    verified by DNA electrophoresis. Correct sizes of bands could    be seen and that was 6479 bp and 7034 bp, respectively.
Procedure after gel validation:
The upper band was cut out from the gel and DNA was extracted by Gel    extraction kit (NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up) .
Ligation
Experiment:
10/08/16: Restriction digestion was followed by ligation at    room temperature for 45 min. Vector (integration plasmid pDR111 and    pDR111+message) and insert (sfGFP(Sp)) was ligated in 1:5 molar ratio.
Ligation mixture:
20 μl ligation assay was performed according to the following protocol .
Transformation
Experiment:
10/08/16: Ligation was followed by transformation into E. coli Top10.    Selection was made on 100 μg/ml ampicillin LB agar plates.    Transformation protocol used can be found here .
11/08/16: Next day we could assume that our transformation was    successful -> colonies were obtained on the plates of E. coli Top10    strain. To verify correct transformants we grew some of the colonies    overnight in 3 ml LB with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (see cell culture protocol ). On the next day plasmid    purification and restriction digestion control was done.
Conclusion:
Transformation of pDR111+sfGFP(Sp) and pDR111+message+sfGFP(Sp) into E. coli Top10 was assumed to be successful. To see if we obtained    correct clones we did a restriction digestion control with EcoRI    restriction enzyme.
Validation
Experiment:
12/08/16: Next day plasmid purification was done according to this protocol and restriction digestion control with EcoRI    restriction enzyme was done to see if correct clones were obtained.    This enzyme has 2 recognition sites in our construct. Therefore two    bands (1535 bp and 6081 bp from pDR111+sfGFP(Sp) and 2090 bp and 608"

The Microguards: Overview
Actualmente, existen numerosos procesos que utilizan microorganismos, como Escherichia coli e Saccharomyces cerevisiae, para producir compuestos de interés, como insulina, etanol y diversas enzimas. El éxito de estos procesos depende de un estricto control de contaminación por otros microorganismos en el medio de cultura. La presencia de contaminantes en un proceso fermentativo reduce el rendimiento de producción debido a la competición entre el contaminante y el organismo fermentativo, causando pérdidas de 5% a 10% de la producción total. Para tratar resolver este problema, el objetivo de nuestro proyecto es modificar cepas de E. coli y de S. cerevisiae para que sean capaces de reconocer y destruir contaminantes durante el proceso industrial.
The Coliguard: Nuestro modelo
Nosotros queremos modificar E. coli para que sea capaz de reconocer y destruir contaminantes en el medio de cultura.  Para que nuestra bacteria tenga eficiencia máxima durante un proceso industrial,  decidimos crear dos diferentes linajes celulares de E. coli: Las “células trabajadoras”, que serán  las responsables por ejecutar el proceso industrial, y “las células asesinas” responsables por la detección y eliminación  de eventuales contaminantes. Ambos tipos celulares existirán simultáneamente en el medio de cultura pero su proporción variará dependiendo de la presencia o ausencia de contaminantes. En ausencia de microorganismos contaminantes, el número de “células trabajadoras” será mucho mayor que el numero “células asesinas” asegurando de esta manera que el proceso se desarrolle con máxima eficiencia. En contraparte, en presencia de microorganismos contaminantes, “las células asesinas” inducirán a las “células trabajadoras"

Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus improve future entries. With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more important. Also it would raise awareness to the topic of the legal status of parts, leading to a debate which could further promote the idea of open source. At the same time we hope that examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of restrictive legal protections.

Brasil-SP,2014,Team:Brasil-SP_-_-_TEXT.html,"ualmente, a DRC é diagnosticada através da quantificação de creatinina no sangue, que por sua vez é alterada a proporções detectáveis somente nos estágios mais avançados da disfunção renal, como também é sensível a fatores como: dieta, gênero, etnia, idade e massa muscular. Reportamos aqui o desenvolvimento de um biossensor que pode diagnosticar DRC em seus estágios iniciais, identificando um biomarcador chamado Cistatina C. Usando a membrana celular como detector e um sistema de quorum sensing como mecanismo de transdução e de resposta, desenvolvemos um circuito gênico que estabelece uma barreira e diferencia faixas de concentração de Cistatina C. Nós o idealizamos como uma ferramenta rápida, simples e confiável para o diagnóstico de DRC. (Translated by Brasil-SP Team )

     L’insuffisance rénale chronique (CDK) est caractérisée par une altération de la fonction et de la structure du rein. Elle atteint des millions de personnes  à travers le monde mais un grand nombre d’entre elles ignorent qu’elles en sont atteintes. L’absence de symptômes au cours des stades précoces retarde le diagnostique et les patients ont d’ores et déjà besoin de dialyse ou même d’une transplantation. Actuellement, le diagnostique repose sur le dosage sanguin de la créatinine qui n'est détectable qu'au stade de dysfonction rénale et est influencé par différents facteurs tels que le jeûne, le genre, l’origine ethnique, l’âge et la masse musculaire. Nous avons développé un biosenseur capable de détecter cette maladie à des stades précoces grâce à l’identification d’un biomarqueur appelé Cystatin C.  En ajoutant un biosenseur à la surface des cellules comme détecteur et un système de quorum-sensing comme mécanisme de transduction et de réponse, nous avons développé un circuit génétique à seuil permettant la détection de différentes gammes de concentrations en Cystatin C. Nous pensons que cet outil permet un dépistage et un diagnostique de l’insuffis"

BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Proof#test4_-_-_TEXT.html," different kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.
We assembled these corresponding circuits together for the final testing.
We assumed that, more arabinose added, more inhibitor will be expressed and the downstream in-promoter will be repressed. That’s what we are going to prove.
But when arabinose was added, RFP intensity increased contradicting with the expected results.                                 Maybe the terminator can’t completely isolate the two devices. Thought of it this way, we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits. The circuits are shown in the Fig.9.                                 So we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits.
After the pre-experiment, we chose a series of appropriate arabinose concentrations, and they are listed in table.1. The negative control is the strain containing the empty vector pSB1C3 and the positive control is the strain containing the (序号) with no arabinose added.
The improvement of device construction was that we added a terminator and changed the promoter direction. In this way, we could observe the decrease of RFP intensity when the arabinose concentration increases. It indicates that the change of arabinose concentration will affect inhibitor’s concentration, and the inhibitor can influence the expression of downstream gene. We chose the CI-pR circuit to do this experiment and got the diagram of the relationship of the time and RFP intensity under different concentration of arabinose.
From this diagram we can see, when the arabinose’s concentration reaches to 0.0030％-0.0040％, the RFP can hardly express. The result proved that the inhibitor can almost completely repress the killer gene at the turning point. Also,                                 we could say inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene.
Summary:
Above all, we proved that plasmid numbers will influence the concentration of inhibitor proteins, and the inhibitor concentration will regulate the expression of killer gene which is indicated by RFP measurement results.
After connecting with kill gene, the plasmids losing on different levels will influence the expression of killer gene, which means we can sense the plasmid numbers and accordingly decide whether or not to turn on the switch of killer gene. From all these, we can achieve the goal of controlling the number of plasmids as we need.

NAWI-Graz,2016,Team:NAWI-Graz#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the toxin in Blue_ccdB induced was produced. Additionally we can see that our cells in the not induced culture grew better than the induced culture. Red_mazF didn´t show the same result. Red_mazF induced was growing better than Red_mazF not induced. After 60 minutes Red_mazF induced grew slower than Red_mazF not induced but figure 4 doesn’t show the expected result. Maybe that’s because our cells didn’t express the toxin. This could be mostly the reason, because we used a red colony for this experiment that came from the plate with re-streaked transformants from week 10. The colonies on this plate only showed the right plasmid-size in the beginning but not later on.   Next day we counted the colonies on the LB-amp plates and got following results (table 1):
Table 1: Number of colonies. Over 3 hours samples were taken every 30 minutes from our main cultures Blue_ccdB induced, Blue_ccdB not induced, Red_mazF induced and Red_mazF not induced. 100 µl of the cultures were plated on LB-Agar plates (50 µg/ml Amp; 1:100 dilution).

Looking at the numbers from table 1, we can see that Blue_ccdB and Red_mazF not induced got a lot more colonies than Blue_ccdB and Red_mazF induced. Hence the induced cultures were able to produce the protein and were growing slower because of that, while the not induced cultures continued growing. But the results of our red cultures were not comparable with the results we got in figure 4.  We decided to repeat the same experiment with our red cultures.
We started a new protein expression experiment in culture media, with Red_mazF that showed the right plasmid-size on the gel. We prepared ONC´s and the next day we made two main cultures out of the ONC. In this experiment the main culture was already at the beginning induced with IPTG (1mM). Over several hours the OD600 was measured.

Data Analysis of Co-culture of CB008 Const+rtTA+GFP+mfa+pAGA+mCherry Run
After running the data on FlowJo and Matlab, we compared the data to the original pAga1+mCherry pTEF1, M7, and M10 data.
The comparison showed slight variation and unexpected results.
Maybe due to the larger cells being too stressed from producing so many proteins, and the overall population producing less as a result of this.
After comparing the data, it was decided that the best option would be to rerun this experiment but with pTEF1, M7, and M10 separately put on the plate as a comparison.
Started growing cultures of pTEF1, M7, and M10 in the incubator.

Background
For delivering the magnetotactic bacteria into the human brain and inducing an optogenetic response being our general concept, we, the NYMU-Taipei 2011 team, have tried hard focusing on eliminating the immune responses in brain at the same time.
Brain Inflammation
The brain is considered an immune privileged organ in that (i) it is separated from the rest of the body by a blood-brain-barrier, (ii) the relative absence of MHC class I and II expression on central nervous system (CNS) cells, and (iii) lack of abundant antigen presenting cells which are required for the generation of an adaptive immune response.
Hence, we suppose that the brain provides a pleasant, nurturing environment for parasites (bacteria in our case) due to structures that prevent many of the immunocytes from entering.
However, in spite of these facts, activated immunocytes such as T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and complement proteins readily accumulate in our brain once it is infected or injuried.  Microglial cell, tissue macrophages of brain, express most common macrophage markers provides the first line of defense in response to pathogens and neuronal injury. As such they can produce a wide variety of cytokines, proteases, etc….
Cytokines - the key immune regulatory factors -, regulate communication between immune cells. There are cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12,etc... Among these cytokines, our team has performed ELISA to detect the concentration of IL-6 (Fig.1), cytokine secreted"
Lambert_GA,2018,Team:Lambert GA#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," the same constraints as their commercial versions.
Since the conception of electroporation, numerous systems and machines have been developed to carry out successful and efficient electroporation, in recognition of the various parameters that must be optimized [23-25], including field strength, voltage, pulse length, number of pulses, temperature, pH, ion concentration, phase of growth for harvested cells, cell density, etc. [26-27]. With respect to bacteria, the most common method involves capacitance discharge in the form of an exponentially decaying wave for electrotransformations [28-29]. The prevalence of this model is due to the simplicity of its design, with the simplest circuits including a high-voltage power supply (V), switch (S), a capacitor (C) , and often a resistor (R) for modulation of voltage outputs. It functions in two phases: a charge phase and a discharge phase, in which the former includes the power supply charging the capacitor with the switch in one position, and the latter with the switch in a different position allowing the capacitor to discharge through the load (solution) connected as an output in the circuit. The other common method utilized for electroporation includes the generation of square wave pulses, consisting of significantly shorter fall times than the exponential decay model. Square wave pulses are primarily used for electroporation of eukaryotic cells, although they have been demonstrated to successfully (and optimally) electrotransform [30]. Within the ElectroPen, the piezoelectric element described below generates exponentially decaying pulses with voltage outputs and time constants similar to the 1800V/5ms values optimized for E. coli, however, the generated pulse does not involve any of the previously described circuitry, using a piezoelectric mechanism for generation and release of the voltage rather than a traditional power supply, allowing for no necessity for access to electricity to operate the device.
Figure 2: Exponentially decaying model of the ElectroPen. Waveform illustrates the pulse delivered by the ElectroPen, achieving a signal aligned peak of 1.834kV and 5.16ms time constant.
The crystal found within the ElectroPen is composed of lead zirconate titanate (PZT), a particularly sensitive material known to produce high voltages even with a slight deformation of the crystal [31]. Using an oscilloscope, the voltage outputs and time constants for several different strikes of the PZT crystal from the lighter were quantified and demonstrated to have significant consistency, with the average peak output at 1997.8378 V (S.D. 278.2399 V)."

In the course                                 of this work, he benefited directly from the then ongoing efforts of the Human Genome Project,                                 which made him realize the importance of systematic approaches both as a complement to and                                 a resource for reductionist approaches. After receiving his doctoral degree, he joined Marc                                 Vidal’s lab at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Harvard Medical School (Boston, MA) for post-doctoral                                 training. In the Vidal lab, he developed the technological tools and strategies needed for                                 the systematic mapping of in vivo promoter activity in C. elegans. In September 2007, Denis                                 Dupuy joined the European Institute of Chemistry and Biology in Bordeaux, France as a group                                 leader to pursue the characterization of C. elegans gene regulation programs.

Axel did his PhD in structural biology at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of Prof. Tom Blundell (1998-2002).                                 He then joined the group of Dr. R. Sowdhamini at the National Centre for Biological Sciences                                 in Bangalore as a visiting fellow (2002-2004), where he developed a computational method                                 for identifying functionally important sites in proteins. Following his time in India, Axel                                 joined the laboratory of Prof. Thomas Steitz at Yale University (2004-2012). There, he chose                                 to tackle what was, at the time, a little-known form of translational control: the regulation                                 of ribosomal protein synthesis by the nascent polypeptide. He joined IECB as a group leader                                 in January 2013, was awarded the 2017 Coups d’Elan Prize for French Research from the Bettencourt-Schueller                                 Foundation and was selected as a 2017 EMBO Young Investigator. We interviewed him because                                 he took a particular interest in our project during our experimentation phase at the IECB.

From a pedagogical point of view iGEM makes some very important contributions:
It is an authentic research experience, meaning it is based on a real question, students design and perform their own experiments,                             they interpret their results, they draw conclusions, it is open ended (they do not work for a                             defined outcome), and importantly, their findings may have some societal impact. These features                             drive students towards a mastery orientation, a goal orientation associated with deep learning                             (a,d,f).
As a consequence, the project is motivating because it offers students a sense of autonomy, meaning that they have a high                             level of control of"
Valencia_Biocampus,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," the heat pulse had finished.
The first practical problem we encountered was the lack of enough heating coats. To try to solve it we took the culture and we split the experiments in two batches. FI and OD were measured at t1=60 min, and t2=120 min for batch number 1, while for batch number 2 the heat shock was delayed 40 min with respect to the first batch. Therefore, measurements for batch no.2 were taken at t1=100 min, and t2=160 min respectively.
During the 40 min delay, the microorganism was growing. Therefore, the heat shock in batch no. 2 was applied to a larger population than in the case of batch no.1. Consequently, the measurements of FI and DO gave much higher values. This fact affects the ratio FI/DO, were the two batches can be clearly distinguished (see figure 4).
Figure 4.
Raw data from the heat shock experiment.
Our first modeling work was aimed to obtain data reconciliation. To this point,  we assumed that, during this 40 min delay, the only thing that happened was that cells grew. Growth was approximately linear in the range analyzed, as seen in figure 1 (blue data). We fitted a simple model DO=p1+p2*t. The result can be seen in figure 5, were:  p1 = 0.161573  p2 = 0.000866314 Therefore, the above ratio FI/DO can be compensated by multiplying data by the fractions (p1+p2*t100)/(p1+p2*t), and (p1+p2*t160)/(p1+p2*t). Actually, what we did was to compensate all measurements to the same time base. The reconciled results can be seen in figure 6.
Figure 5.
Model fitting for OD w.r.t. time.
Figure 6.
Recoinciled data for t=60min and t=120min.
Once we had all data reconciled, we fitted them to a static model relating the ratio between fluorescence intensity (FI) and the culture optical density (OD) with the temperature applied during the heat shock.
Since the model is nonlinear with respect to parameters K1 and n, we applied a global optimization algorithm based on stochastic search. Actually we applied it to fit the data at t=60 min, and t=120 min independently. The estimated parameters were:
The results can be seen in figures 7 (t60), and 8 (t120) respectively.

Collaboration: imagining the future together
In the world of iGEM, teams from different universities usually work on distinct projects tackling separate issues. Sometimes, however, the combination of two projects can give rise to novel solutions that could not be achieved by either project alone. As it turns out, the iGEM projects of team Amsterdam and team TU Delft give rise to such combination. In this essay we wrote together, we explore how our projects could be combined and describe a potential application of combining Amsterdam’s synthetic consortium with Delft’s nanowires and 3D-biofilm printer.

iGEM Amsterdam & Synenergene
Delft
The TU Delft iGEM team designed constructs that give bacteria the ability to form nanowires between each other, creating an extracellular matrix which forms a structure, and form a biofilm. In the project of Amsterdam, the E.coli and cyanobacteria will form the biofilms. The E.coli bacteria are producing the nanowires. The cyanobacteria will be trapped by these nanowires in such a way that specific structures of both E.coli and cyanobacteria are formed. These specific structures can increase the production rate as the  ratio of cyanobacteria to E.coli can be engineered to ideally match the steady state conversion rates, while at the same time reducing diffusion limitations between both partners.

Phycocyanobilin (PCB) is necessary for the final testing and characterization of our strain of Rhodobacter sphaeroides and is most easily obtained by purifying it from spirulina, a cyanobacteria.  There are two potentially harmful chemicals used in this process: methanol and Mercury (II) Chloride (HgCl2).  Methanol is highly flammable and poisonous if ingested.  Methanol can cause blindness if swallowed in even small quantities.  HgCl2 is a highly toxic form of Mercury because it is in a soluble form and can accumulate in fatty tissues.  All steps in PCB extraction must be performed on a designated lab bench in much the same way as gel electrophoresis (although separate from EtBr contamination).  A fume hood should also be used with nitrile gloves to prevent human contact.  Special decontamination vessels are needed that are large enough to hold all waste products given that there are several washings which produce a large volume of toxins.  Mercury requires special disposal procedures that may vary depending on lab protocol.
The general public is at little to no risk from our experimentation since it is not intended for use outside of a bioreactor or for human trials in any way.  Our labspace was shared with several classes so it was important that we clean up our lab when finished and that we properly label all chemicals and contamination areas.  Environmental procedures were also followed with the disposal of all chemicals, glassware, and sharps.  None of our live cultures were released into the environment and therefore would not affect natural populations of bacteria.
All research conducted at Washington University (medical school and main campus) is under the supervision of the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research (OVCR).  This office is responsible for all concerns pertaining to research and publications produced by the university.  Among other things, our lab must comply with the Environmental Health and Safety Policy and Procedures laid out by the OVCR.  To view the full list of Environmental Health and Safety Policies and Prcedures, please click here .  Furthermore, every team member has completed an Annual Regulatory and Safety Review for Laboratory Personnel offered by the Environmental Health and Safety committee at Washington University.

SF_Bay_Area_DIYBio,2015,Team:SF Bay Area DIYBio#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,", both UVB and UVA can damage the skin. Unfortunately, the chemistry of sunscreen, in most cases, does not enable the blocking of UVA as effectively, if at all, as they do UVB.
Note that the germicidal UV lights we use in the laboratory (e.g. built into the biosafety cabinet) emit the even short wavelength and even higher energy UV-C light (wavelengths 100–280nm). These wavelengths do not actually occur in natural sunlight, because they are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.
Mycosporine-like amino acids
Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are small secondary metabolites produced by organisms that live in environments with high volumes of sunlight, usually marine environments. The structures of over 30 Mycosporine-like amino acids have been resolved and all contain a central cyclohexenone or cyclohexenimine ring and a wide variety of substitutions. The ring structure is thought to absorb UV light and accommodate free radicals. All MAAs absorb ultraviolet light, typically between 310 and 340 nm. It is this light absorbing property that allows MAAs to protect cells from harmful UV radiation. They are commonly described as “microbial sunscreen” but their function is not limited to sun protection.
Though most MAA research is done on their photo-protective capabilities, they are also multifunctional secondary metabolites that have many cellular functions. MAAs are effective antioxidant molecules and are able to stabilize free radicals within their ring structure. In addition to protecting cells from mutation via UV radiation and free radicals, MAAs are able to boost cellular tolerance to desiccation, salt stress, and heat stress.
Anabaena variabilis shinorine gene cluster
Baskus and Walsh (2010) identified a gene cluster in A. variabilis that produced shinorine, a well-studied MAA.
The U. Minnesota 2012 iGEM team successfully transformed the entire gene cluster, but did not observe the production of shinorine, the final metabolite in the pathway - suggesting that the final enzyme of the pathway was not active. Unfortunately, they did not submit any parts to the iGEM Registry.
Alternative Mycosporine enzymes
The Minnesota 2012 team was not able to get the final step in the pathway, so we also searched for alternative enzymes in other cyanobacteria

Problem: What does this BioBalloon Do?
To be a useful tool, the bioballoon must be made of something (membranes), it must inflate (float), and it must do something (sensors). After reaching out to the University of Pittsburgh , University of Michigan , and Heidelberg iGEM teams, we were convinced that we too wanted to make an impact in biosensing. In our sensors sub-project, we considered various ""things"" we would want to detect in space or on Earth. We talked about detecting pressure extremes via conformational changes in proteins, magnetic fields via the iron-sulfur cluster cryptochrome system in homing pigeons, and wind patterns via long-term solar exposure. But eventually, we focused our aims on creating biological means of sensing small molecules and temperature as a way of adding useful functionality to the balloon.   To sense temperature we systematically measured the thermodynamic stability of a wide suite of chromoproteins and determined that many of them reliably loose color at particular temperatures. We also discovered that the effect is sometimes reversible, and some proteins also exhibit reproducible color switching properties at particular temperatures. To read more about that work, see the chromoproteins sub-project page.
One application of our sensors is to determine the range of temperatures that our balloon comes into contact with.
To sense small molecules we pursued two distinct approaches: IRES and FQ sensing . Both utilize aptamers, small nucleic acids with extremely high specificity and affinity towards"

TEDx SJSU Presentation
In early September, our team came across a TEDx talk in San Jose looking for presenters. The TEDx SJSU theme was ""breaking ground"", and our team felt that our iGEM idea was perfectly on theme. A few of our teammates wrote a sample itinerary for the TEDx talk and sent that to the coordinators as our application. We were accepted as one of the presenters only a week later. We chose Laura, a teammate with a strong public speaking background, to write a speech detailing our project, human practices work, and how our project ""breaks ground"". She gave a 15-minute presentation to audience members of various backgrounds: Harvard professors, high school students, SJSU staff and professors, and college students. She also participated in a brief Q&A after the presentation where the public asked her more questions about our iGEM project. We are so thankful for the opportunity to share our scientific ventures with the surrounding community. We are so proud of Laura!"

Motivation and brain storming =
Since 2008, we have been participating in iGEM as METU( Middle East Technical University) wet-lab team, and each year we have noticed the increasing number of teams participating, along with an increase in biobricks entries at partsregistry.org. While having more choices of biobricks to choose from is incredible, searching for and choosing the appropriate parts is becoming a challenge. This year during the construction process of iGEM biobrick parts for our new project, we felt the need for an application to find interacting parts based on an input/output model to design the genetic constructs. Using a specialized software for searching the parts registry to find possible biobricks to include into our construct would be much easy, fast and accurate than manual. We have shared our need with a group of friends who are software engineers, and initiated  the METU_Turkey_SOFTWARE team where we worked together over this summer to build the BIOGUIDE software.

Tsinghua-A,2011,Team:Tsinghua-A#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the plasmid doesn¡¯t work.Then,we tell the message to Doctor Chen and begin to find another plasmid to replace I0500.
2nd, Aug
Everyone works hard to find the new plasmid. Where there's a will, there's a way. We successfully outcrop a new plasmid named I13453 which proves to be a workable plasmid. Then we quickly complete the transformation of it.
3rd, Aug
We succeed in doing the transformation of I13453.And then we pick the right colonies from the medium (including K081009,E0430 and I13453), and put the tubes into shaker.
4th, Aug
Today, our task is to finish the plasmid extraction of K081009, E0430 and I13453. After the practice we have done before, we find that it is not too difficult to make it. We only spend one hour extracting the plasmid.
8th, Aug
Ms. Yang teaches us the protocol of agarose gel electrophoresis. Compared with plasmid extraction, electrophoresis is easier. But we need to make the gel and grasp the method to use microwave oven.
9th, Aug
Today, we do the agarose gel electrophoresis of B0034, C0079, B0015, R0079, J23116 and J37034. Unfortunately, we find that our plasmid extraction of C0079, R0079 and J23116 fails. It proves that our chosen colonies are not target bacteria colonies. Therefore, we take out our medium and repick the other colonies and put the tubes into shaker.
10th, Aug
We complete the plasmid extraction of C0079, R0079, J23116.
11th, Aug
The plasmid extraction is successful. We observe the plasmid in the agarose gel (including C0079, R0079, J23116). And then we do the agarose gel electrophoresis of K145270, R0062, P0440 and E0420. We find that we have to redo the plasmid extraction of K145270, R0062. Therefore, we take out our medium and repick the other colonies and put the tubes into shaker.

We complete the plasmid extraction of K145270 and R0062.

UCAS,2016,Team:UCAS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," is really low compared to degradation rate, and no protein molecule exists at time 0, then 0=P(0)=E+D. Equation (20) can be further simplified as:
P(t) = {P_0}\left( {\exp \int_0^t {\mu (s)ds}  - \exp  - {\gamma _P}t} \right)\quad(21)
Equation (20) and (21) are called Protein Expression Formula (PEF).
Induced Protein Expression
In this section, we compare Protein Expression Formula with experimental data, and discuss how parameter ${P_0}$ verifies with the concentration of tetracycline.
From table 7 and equation (21), ${P_0}$ can be solve as:
{P_0} = \frac{{PoPS \cdot RiPS \cdot {k_m} \cdot {n_0}}}{{({\gamma _M} + {\mu _0})({\gamma _P} + {\mu _0})({\gamma _P} + {k_m} + {\mu _0})}}\quad(22)
The fluorescence of GFP is in linear relation with P(t). Parameter ${n_0}$, the total number of plasmids, is in proportion with the number of cells and hence in proportion with OD600. The remaining terms in equation (22) is a function of concentration. Due to the limited accuracy of instruments, derivative of growth rate $\frac{{d\mu }}{{ds}}$ cannot be calculated. Consequently, the experimental equation of formula (20) can be expressed as:
\frac{{F(t)}}{{O{D_0}}} = B(c)\exp \int\limits_0^t {\mu (s)ds}  - a\exp ( - {\gamma _P}t) + b\quad(23)
B(c) in equation (23) is as follows:
B(c) = \frac{{PoPS(c) \cdot RiPS(c) \cdot {k_m}}}{{({\gamma _M} + {\mu _0})({\gamma _P} + {\mu _0})({\gamma _P} + {k_m} + {\mu _0})}}\quad(24)
Coefficient a and b are decided by the initial state and is unimportant in our discussion. For any given ${\gamma _P}$ , equation (23) can be fitted by multiple linear regression. Then we assign ${\gamma _P}$ point by point with a step of 0."

3/20/13
-KK We were thrilled to get out plate of cholera today! Then we happened upon about 5 iGEM projects from previous years that involve quorum sensing and/or cholera. We were on the verge of beginning our lab work but our paradigm was suddenly shifted a few steps backward: we needed (and still need) to decide if we should continue working on our cholera project. Calgary’s 2008 iGEM team successfully cloned the quorum-sensing circuit into E.Coli and used it to detect and destroy E.Coli that was expressing AHL - whose homologs appears to be autoinducers of V. Harveyi and V.Fischeri. St. Andrew’s iGEM team faced off against cholera specifically, attempted to render it avirulent through generating high levels of cholera’s autoinducer CAI-1, but they did not tame cholera. They only managed to get the CAI-1 autoinducer to work in E.Coli. We got our cholera from Annette, Dr. Robison’s lab manager. She plated it on Columbia media, and it had been sitting at 37 degrees C for 24 hours when she gave it to us. We don’t know the exact assay for growing biofilm in cholera, but"

DTU-Denmark-2,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," invented as a ligation-independent cloning technique that could substitute the conventional cloning methods, which mades use of restriction enzymes and ligase. In 2003 New England Biolabs (NEB) introduced the USER Friendly Cloning Kit. Although NEBs USER kit was simple and efficient, it was not compatible with proofreading polymerases that stalled when encountering a uracil base in the DNA template (4). This made the USER Friendly Kit unattractive, although the concept was brilliant. In recent years, proofreading polymerases have been developed that are compatible with the concept of USER cloning, since they can read through uracil (5).
The USER method applies long complementary overhangs on the PCR product(s) as well as on the destination vector. The overhangs on the PCR product are custom made, between 7-15 nucleotides long and deoxy uridine nucleotides substitute selected deoxy thymidine nucleotides. The PCR products containing the customized overhangs are treated with the USER enzyme, which is a mix of DNA glycosidase and DNA glycosylase-lyase endo VIII. This treatment results in release of the DNA sequence upstream of the deoxy uridine nucleotide and the resulting exposed overhangs can anneal to each other to form a stable hybridization product. This product can now be transformed directly into E.coli without prior ligation (4,5,6). In order to avoid template carry-over after PCR, the PCR product is usually treated with the restriction enzyme DpnI. DpnI cleaves only when its recognition site is methylated. Unmethylated PCR-derived DNA will be left intact (5).
Outline of the Plug 'n' Play with DNA concept
We introduce a standardized assembly system based on the principle of USER cloning and the USER fusion Assembly standard introduced by the 2009 DTU iGEM team. The new assembly standard called Plug 'n' Play with DNA ( BBF RFC 80 ) offers easier cloning and is a combined standard and assembly system.
The time required to construct devices and plasmids can be significantly reduced with the use of Plug 'n' Play. This is essential to be able to move beyond what we theoretically can create with synthetic biology and conducting it in practice.
The mission of Plug 'n' Play with DNA
We introduce the standardized and versatile system called ""Plug ‘n’ Play with DNA"", where categories of biological parts can be gathered. We imagine that BioBricks in the form of pre-produced PCR-products, can be directly mixed with a backbone vector. This will"

Zizheng Zhang
I am Zizheng Zhang, a junior of Nankai university. From the very beginning, painting and drawing are my hobbits. As I know more about the nature we human live in, life science becomes my favorite subject. Synthesizing a being that has never existed is one of the ultimate aims in biology and also the essential project of iGEM. Hence, I become an iGEMer and participate in art designing to contribution to our team and dedicate a little effort I can make to synthetic biology.
Zikun Zhu
I’m Zikun Zhu, a senior undergraduate student in Boling Class of Nankai university. In my daily life, I like sports such as swimming and soccer. Besides, doing experiments really interests me and occupies most of my free time. As a consequence, I joined our NKU team to participate in iGEM without hesitation. My work in our team is mainly about molecular cloning and seeking for collaborations. Hope we can get a good result!

In 2017 May, our team, CIEI-China, teamed up with the CIEI-BJ team to collect trash samples. The members of our team and the CIEI-China players first arrived at the local residential quarter. Then the members of CIEI-BJ and CIEI-china went from door to door to ask local residents for their kitchen waste. Members of our two teams also collected samples from trash cans in the local communities. After a lot of inquiry and collection, our two teams successfully collected enough trash samples for us to test and analyze the salt concentration in food waste.
Model Idea Exchange
As the Giant Jamboree approached, our team’s preparation work was also coming to its end. For the last part of our preparation, we needed to build a model for the project. After searching for relevant papers on the Internet, we came up with an excellent idea about designing a mathematics model of the salt influence on the production of VFAs, the change of VS/TS, and the percentage of SCOD during anaerobic composting.
At the same time, since we had decided the topic of our model, we hoped to communicate with other teams in order to receive some comments or suggestions of improvement from them. Luckily, we successfully got in contact with Team Shenzhen_SFLS from Shenzhen, China on Wechat. Their project was about changing B-Raf V500E gene through CRISPR-Cas9 and thus curing melanoma, so they decided to build models of the contagion efficiency of melanoma as well as medication spread efficiency.
Our team and Shenzhen_SFLS briefly exchanged our model ideas. During the communication, we discovered that their team mostly based their model on graphs, which enlightened us to draw three graphs of VFAs, VS/TS, and SCOD vs time respectively, in an attempt enrich our model and also more straightforwardly support our argument about the hyperosmosis influence on anaer"

From this meeting, we set out to investigate the export requirements of honey, which is the main product exported by beekeepers, and how our genetically modified yeasts would affect or play a role in these requirements.
One issue we were asked to review was whether the hexane extract of A.satureioides oxidized because if so, it loses its qualities. Currently, a treatment that they use to fight diseases in bees is the oregano essential oil which they have already found to be oxidized. After further investigation, we verified that certainly, the extract that we wanted to add is oxidized by exposure to air. Another treatment that beekeepers use to fight diseases, is the sodium bicarbonate which, when it is spread in the hive, causes the bees to begin a cleaning protocol with which they take that bicarbonate out of their hive taking away the dirt present.
Thanks to this meeting, we set out to investigate the export requirements of honey, which is the main product exported by beekeepers, and how our genetically modified yeasts would affect or play a role in these requirements. They mentioned that they do not usually have much time to try different combinations of treatments and find out the optimal combination. They said there is not much research in the beekeeping sector, so it seems excellent that we intend to carry out scientific research in this field and try different combinations of peptides thus ensuring the best combination.
They also told us about other bee pathogens, Nosema apis and Varroa destructor. They commented that, if effective, our product is excellent, however, they also mentioned that in general there are many good products and at a reasonable price, however, they are challenging to work with, occasional applications are less complicated than regular ones. They look for a practical alternative, cheap and that doesn't consume time. Concerning the final product being a dilution, they commented that this was difficult to apply since, if our product was to be applied frequently, it would be laborious to have to spray every three days, for example, 2,000 boxes of bees.
Subsequently, they mentioned that, in their city, the foulbrood that represents a problem is the European, which occurs when bees have little accessibility to pollen because of the little flowering throughout the year. Previously we had read about this disease; however, it was from this meeting that we investigated more about it and after validating the theoretical efficacy of our antimicrobial peptides of interest against"

It is obvious to see that the computer game and the interesting video conveyed the idea of synthetic biology do work in the process of public engagement. And it is better to set up our showcase at places that people would like to go at weekends, which allow us to attract more people’s attention, and make them feel that science can be part of their life.     The improvement of public engagement still have a long way to go, and we believe that our mode can be helpful. The gap between labs and public is not so difficult to bridge, since we find most people are more than willing to engage in it, which is really encouraging.
 
Safety
 
Our Doubt
    During the summer vacation, due to G20 Summit in Hangzhou, our team had to carry some of our experimental materials away from our own lab, and shared the lab with other teams in China. In the train station, we passed the safety inspection successfully without any inquiry or check.
    One thing should be clarified first, at here the biological products mean the products we use for our biological experiment in the lab. And we carried them in tightly closed containers, with no chance flowing into the outside environment. The transportation was rather safe.
    Here are what we carried during the two journeys.
 
 
    Obviously, there was not any disease producing bacteria. And everything we carried was harmless. However, the detection for biological products arose our interest. Since synthetic biology is playing a more and more important role in the world, we do hope that everything it brought is advantageous. However, the transportation safety of biological products should be paid equal attention, in case of they become the new danger one day. We wonder if there is any measure in China to supervise the transportation of biological products now.
 
Our Investigation in five aspects
 
State’s laws and regulations
    We searched on a website called “PKU Law”, which is a famous database in China to search keywords in laws and regulations. In “Rules for the Implementation of Frontier Health and Quarantine Law of the People's Republic of China”, it has mentioned “biological materials” in two articles:
 
    Article 11 Special articles which enter or leave the country such as microzoaria, human tissue, biological, blood and hemoproducts shall be subject to health and quarantine inspection. The carrier, the shipper or the parcel sender of the above mentioned articles is required to declare at the health and quarantine organ for inspection. Without permission by the health and quarantine organ, there shall be no entry or exit of such articles"

iGEM - Sund & Hed
Local News feature - TV2 Fyn
NyViden - Article (p. 18-20)
To reach as many people as possible, we have contacted a lot of different media in Denmark. Therefore we have been in touch with both newspapers, magazines and television, locally and nationally. We have also been contacted by a former worker of a Danish broadcast station called TV2, which would like to make a short documentary. The documentary should tell the audience about the iGEM idea, and about a young team of scientists who create a new organism. The documentary is meant for the layman. To see the documentary please go to the documentary page
We are very pleased with the outcome. We reach out to a broad range of both scientific and non scientific audience of common people as well as both the new and the experienced students of SDU. Because of the article in NyViden (SDU magazine) we also reach the Humanitarian and the students who study social science. We consider it to have great importance that the iGEM teams consist of interdisciplinarity. This is also something our Human Practice group work intensively on.
Furthermore a student that studies Business and Law came to us, and would like to write a article about us in SIJ - Students & Innovation Journal
The magazine for faculty of Health, Sund & Hed, wrote a large article about the iGEM competition in general.
We would like to tell the society first and foremost, that studying science is fun! We would like to inform of the many possibilities there are when you go to the University and how many great opportunities students have to do something extra if they want to. It is also essential to tell about synthetic science because many people are unaware of the potential and maybe even looks at it with fear. To communicate that part we have established a special “media ethics” group.
We have discovered that the media is of great value when it comes to especially funding. It is important for the sponsors that they get some credit and that they support something that is popular these days. The university has also expressed that they are quite pleased with the media coverage of the project in the light of that they are our main sponsor. A news paper has been writing about us and our financial situation. The article brought"
