UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Story_-_-_TEXT.html," E.coli upon remediation but Copper and Chromium salts in addition.
From the knowledge we set out plans to test the toxicity of different concentrations of copper and chromium salts on E.coli.  If the salts proved toxic to E.coli we planned to use an overexpression construct for the Copper resistance proteins CusA and CusB as the first step towards solving this problem.  We also planned to compare the survivability of our recombinant E.coli strain in textile industry effluent and assess further modifications that would improve our organisms effectiveness.
Sulphonated azo dyes: In an effort to use less water in the dyeing process, companies are leaning towards the use of sulphonated dyes which cannot be easily broken down by normal factory methods
From this discussion we decided to create a new BioBrick part for the enzyme Lignin Peroxidase which has previously been shown to aid in the breakdown of sulphonated azo dyes

Exploring Thames Water
In order to understand how our device could be used to remove azo dye contamination from within a water system we visited Mogden sewage treatment works. We want the integration of our bioprocess to be as seamless as possible, creating greater incentive for industry to consider our ideas.
Mogden is the second largest sewage treatment facility in the UK, covering an area of over 55 hectares of land. Being given a tour of the facility gave us an overview of the variety of phases waste water is treated at.
The secondary treatment phase proved very exciting for our project. Following the removal of solid waste during primary treatment, the waste water is directed into aeration lanes. These aeration lanes contain a variety of naturally occurring bacteria chosen to degrade the remaining human waste, food waste, soaps and detergents.
Mogden has a single lane with anoxic conditions designed to promote anaerobic reactions. These lanes are also provided with a high nitrogen content to maintain the bacteria. The fluid is then directed into lanes with aerobic conditions where the remainder of the bacterial reactions can occur.
This phase would be an ideal to integrate our device, the separate aerobic and anaerobic phases provide the conditions for our two-step process and would fit seamlessly into an already established process.  The aerobic lanes use membrane diffusers to oxygenate the water, we further investigated the use of these diffusers for system as a different method of oxygen delivery.

uOttawa,2017,Team:uOttawa#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," for his assistance and results). The list of parameters are listed below:
Note that logic gate design involves codifying some of the above parameters into a mathematical software, MATLAB in our case, in order to continue numerical solving of equations and aggregating simulation data for analysis. As mentioned above, oftentimes the steady state assumption is used to simplify the modelling given adequate correlation between wet-lab results and modelling data. This allows for the implementation of a NOR logic gate as a modularized unit in simulation capable of being used independently or chained to create circuits.
Implementation of the program for a single NOR gate unit was initially conducted. A Poisson probability distribution was iterated for a number of trials in order to determine the rate of activation vs. repression. Note, given the two possible outcomes (i.e. activation or repression), a bimodal distribution was the result that supported both journal results and wet-lab results that sgRNA-dCas9 repression was strongly favoured over activation. Over 10000 trials (n = 10000), the number of times repression was indicated was nr = 7824, leaving activation to have occurred na = 2176. Another factor to consider however, is the logic gate model used i.e. the NOR gate, is only expressed should both inputs be inhibited. As such, the theoretical expectation should a 75:25 ratio and these results are similar to journal results obtained in Gander et al., 2017.
Furthermore, a Gillespie algorithm was run in order to detail the repression results as a function of the fluorescence levels. The choice for a Gillespie algorithm comes from a need to represent the sgRNA-dCas9 system binding to the promoter sequences in a stochastic manner, involving nothing more than the system and the promoters as molecules. While the results of the Gillespie algorithm varied greatly from multiple simulations (run up to n=100 trials each for 10 simulation total), the general observable trend was a weak logarithmic association between fluorescence levels over time. However, since there was significant fluctuation between the trends of the simulations, an accurate figure representation could not be portrayed, as parameters needed to be modified in order to attain more consistent results. Due to time constraints though, that was not made possible.
Given that a general structure was modeled on MATLAB, the possibility of chaining gates was also considered. While, we were cognizant that there were obvious disparities between expected results and experimental simulated results, the program was still put through its’ paces in order to determine if the sgRNA-dCas9 complexes were still capable of producing results in line with those of the corresponding logic gates.

Gal tubes that lacked growth included:
pRS305 + pRS306
nullA + ZifA rpt
ZifA + ZifA rpt (both glycerol and colony)
ZifA -tag + ZifA rpt
Note: nullA + ZifA reporter may have been switched.  It is labeled as a dex tube but it might have actually contained galactose.  Be wary for results that would corroborate such a possibility.
The following glycerol stocks were made in duplicate (all duplicates from a single colony):

Took optical density readings using one plate reader and fluorescence measurements using another.  Also compared the optical densities with those taken using the Nanodrop.  However, the file of all Nanodrop ODs was closed before saving it.  What a stupid mistake!
Some notes about planning the colony PCR to verify these transformations:
First, note that the general procedure is to order primers that will give a PCR product of a known size if and only if the desired insert on the shuttle vector has been integrated into the yeast genome, indicative of a successful transformation.  Of course, the entire shuttle vector itself is integrated, so the primers will be designed using the provided sequences for the shuttle vectors.  The PCR product sizes will be predicted using the sequences of the parts in conjunction with those of the shuttle vectors.  Once colony PCR has been run, one then runs the products on a gel to determine if bands appear at the predicted"

3 mL of this solution was pipetted into seven 35x10 mm Petri dishes.
The Petri dishes were then labeled and put into an incubator for 24 hours at 37℃.
After 24 hours, the solution was poured out of each dish into a bleach container. The dishes were then rinsed with distilled water twice.
___ drops of crystal violet were placed around the rim of the Petri dishes. If a biofilm had formed, a ring of crystal violet would be seen.
Testing with home cleaners:
Once we knew that we could grow biofilms, we decided to test out the effectiveness of home cleaning products. The products we tested are Mr. Clean, Fantastik, Truly, Windex, Tilex, Bleach, Lysol, and GreenWorks. The protocol that we used for this is as follows:
Using biofilms made the previous day with protocol 1, the experimenter removed the contents in the dish in the bleach container. Then the experimenter rinsed the Petri dish with distilled water twice. The Petri dishes were laid out on paper towel to let the excess water drip out.
After the Petri dishes were thoroughly dry, 3.2 mL of one of the listed cleaning products was pipetted into a Petri dish. The cleaning product was left in the Petri dish for 30 minutes (If bleach was being used, only for 15 minutes).
The cleaning product was then disposed of in the bleach container. The Petri dish was then rinsed with water once.
To see if a biofilm was still remaining, 100 μL of LB media was pipetted onto the inside edge of the Petri dish.
The LB media was then pipetted back into the LB media tube along with 5 μL of KAN.
This was then put into the shaker for 24 hours at 37 ℃.
Testing Antibiotics:
We also tested antibiotics to see if they could get rid of biofilms as well. We used this protocol:
Biofilms made using protocol 1 were rinsed twice using distilled water.
In twelve 2 mL tubes, 1.65 mL of double distilled water was pipetted into each of them. Into two 2 mL tubes, 3.3 μL of AMP was pipetted into them.
Step 2 was repeated using CAM, TET, and water as a control.

Biofilms: Creating Biofilms
Objective: to create biofilms to continue testing on them with household cleaners brought into the lab.
Procedure: Creating Biofilms
Biofilms were created in 5 35x10 mm Petri dishes and in 4 wells of a 28-well plate by putting 3000 µL of LB media, 3 µL of KAN, and 20 µL of RFP into each dish and well.
These were left in the 37 ˚C incubator for 24 hours in order for the biofilms to grow.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Market#_-_-_TEXT.html," is also available in both a laboratory and portable version, though bacterial survival and respiration is measured by addition of a chemical that is utilized during respiration. This technology, similar to Microtox®, encounters the same reliability concerns.
Currently, the Microtox® technology is available in continuous monitoring, portable, and laboratory based systems. IP for all 3 systems is centralized in a UK based company, Modern Water. The other major biosensor technology, ToxTrak, is owned by Hach. This company is in turn owned by Danaher.
Figure 8: Modern Water corporate structure.  The company has acquired several companies which have produced general toxin sensing and water analysis technologies which are competitors in our market space.
Modern Water acquiring these companies has suggested that the ability to detect general toxins in this and other markets is of high value and profit, particularly due to the amount that these companies were acquired for.  Danaher acquired Hach for $355 million which had produced $137 million in revenue in 2012.  Importantly, this suggests there is a global market for our technology.
Conclusions
From our market analysis we have identified an opportunity for our technology to be developed within the context of the oil and gas environmental monitoring program. With significant increases in mandated monitoring by 2015, there is a distinct need for more rapid and portable toxin sensing technology, which will fit into the suite of existing monitoring methods. Our technology can be applied to over 50% of the regulatory sites of which the government has determined to be key regulatory areas. This market has shown to be very profitable, and is expected to rapidly grow and expand in the next five years. Other competitors exist in this market, primarily under the technology MicroTox® which has been largely acquired by Modern Water, however we provide distinct advantages over these current systems.
Marketing Plan
Customers - How Do We Sell To Them?
An important identification in our marketing plan is who the key individuals would be that would buy our product. As we are addressing a clear need in the monitoring market, our customers are those who would most value and profit from new monitoring methods to detect toxins. This will be within the complex relationship between oil sands companies and their contracted service companies. Large oil sands companies must assess a need for this type of toxin monitoring to encourage service companies to adopt this type of technology. Because of the prevalence of competitive products that already exist in the market, there is a clear push for systems which report the overall toxicity of a sample. Service companies must see clear advantages in using our product over presently utilized competing technology, both financially and analytically."

SCUT-China,2015,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," apart from appearing sharply rising in the beginning and is higher than that with no feedback inhibition, as time goes by, the amount of sGC of feedback inhibition gradually reduces and is lower than that with no feedback inhibition and hold it on. In summary, the function of feedback inhibition of cGMP changes the relationship between cGMP-NO and sGC-NO into a lower state which is consistent with many research results.

figure.10
In order to study the effect of sGC on cGMP, we need to find out the curve of the experimental group. Since the coordinates of the starting point in the coordinate system is (180,11) and the growth rate of cGMP with the increase of sGC concentration is more and more fast, we might as well set up the relationship between y and x as:
y=a+bekx
By using ‘lsqcurvefit’ function in Matlab, we got the value of a=8.3573, b=0.6748, k=0.0093.
figure.11
From the image above, the bigger the concentration of sGC is, the bigger the concentration of cGMP, and the growth rate of cGMP is increasing. However, the concentration of cGMP can't increase without limit in the cell, but it will reach to a certain level of stability. This data is only from the experimental group's exploratory experiments which only reflects the change of cGMP in a certain range with the sGC. In order to draw a more accurate conclusion, more sophisticated experiments should be done.
5.Transfection and gene combinations of Lentivirus in HEK293 cells
iGEM experimental group used Lentivirus in the experiment. Lentivirus is gene therapy vectors which are developed on the basis of HIV-1,but so far, scientists have not researched the details of the HIV infection, integration, replication and so on clearly, it also means that lentivirus mechanism is not very clear. But the macro and micro mechanism of the exploration of Lentivirus is indeed attracting lots of people interested involved in the study.

- For the control, label two petri dish with LB agar (AMP) and plate 20µL of the transformation onto the dishes, and spread it
- Incubate the plates at 37°C for 12-14h , making sure the agar silde of the plate is up (if incubate for too long the antibiotics start to break down and un-transformated cells will begin to grow because the resistance enzyme is excreted by the bacteria, and inactivates the antibiotic outside of the bacteria
- Pick a single colony, make a glycerol stock, grow up a cell culture and do a miniprep
- Count the colony on the 20µL control plate and calculate your competent Escherichia coli cell efficiency
5. Miniprep protocol (All protocol steps should be carried out at room temperature)
Here at iGEM we use Qiagen Spin Miniprep Kits for doing small batches of minipreps. If you have never done this protocol before, read the the background information in the handbook; It contains useful information. The following has been reproduced from the handbook and annotated based on experience with the kit. This protocol is designed for purification of up to 20 μg of high-copy plasmid DNA from 1–5 ml overnight cultures of E. coli in LB (Luria-Bertani) medium. For purification of low-copy plasmids and cosmids, large plasmids (>10 kb), and DNA prepared using other methods, refer to the recommendations on page 37.
- Prepare the materials below:
- Qiagen Miniprep Kit
- Cell Culture
- 1.6mL Microcentrifuge tubes (2 per a miniprep)
- TE (1:10)
- Spin the cell culture in a centrifuge to pellet the cells, empty the supernatant (media) into a waste collection container
- Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250 µl Buffer P1 (kept at 4 °C) and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube. No cell clumps should be visible after resuspension of the pellet. Important: Ensure that RNase A has been added to Buffer P1.
- Add 250 μl Buffer P2 and gently invert the tube 4–6 times to mix. Do not"

4. UCCKE Sharing Session: How to start an iGEM project
From the previous activities, our theme circumvents about synthetic biology and biosafety. This time was a bit different, we were invited to share our iGEM experience and general approach on how to design an iGEM project to high school students. We got feedback that only a few high school students plan to join the iGEM in future.
We introduced a “Top-down Design” which is a common and easy method for high school students to brainstorm a project idea. We used the example of planning our summer vacation as a parallel comparison with the “Top-down Design” topic - building a system at hierarchical level (from large to small). We also mentioned some important issues that they should pay attention to. For example, biosafety and fundamental knowledges of synthetic biology.
5. Synthetic Biology 1 Translation
Throughout our interaction with general public in Hong Kong, one obstacles we spot when communicating with them is the medium of instruction. While Hong Kong is a place where English is the secondary language, students especially from public high school are taught in Chinese. Interesting sources for learning synthetic biology with Chinese as a medium of instruction is also limited.
At the same time, we encountered Mr. Ariel Lindner who introduced us Synthetic Biology 1 page and invited us to collaborate in Chinese translation with Mr. Edwin Wintermute. We translated subtitles and voice-over for four videos shared by Synthetic Biology 1. Each video has both Cantonese and Mandarin versions. Our translated videos have been uploaded on bilibili website: https://space.bilibili.com/178821464/#!/ which is also accessible in China.

BGU_Israel,2018,Team:BGU Israel#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," cell apoptosis kit was calibrated in Jurkat cells. Since we are working with a different cell line further calibration is required.
Conclusion:
In this experiment we saw that pMLPm can be activated in C8-D30 cells by dCas9-VP64-gRNA complex, since we were able to validate mCherry expression by several methods.
This means that pMLPm promoter activity can be regulated in reactive astrocytes (C8D30) cell line when dCas9-VP64-gRNA comlex is expressed by A1 reactive astrocyte specific promoters (pTimp1 and pSteap4).
In order to prove that the exogenous reverse caspase3 that was chosen in our design can trigger apoptotic death when it is regulated by pMLPm promoter, calibration on APC Annexin V/Dead cell apoptosis kit is nesseccery.
Since co-transfection efficiency is very low, the next step is to infect the cells with lenti:pTimp1-dCAs9-VP64, and create a stable cell-line, and only only then to insert the pSynt plasmid (either by transfection or by AAV2/9 infection).

This groundbreaking project set out to assess the CEA approach’s relevance to synthetic biology, in anticipation of the growing demand for synthetic biology-based solutions to global issues. They arrived at the conclusion that scientists should focus on four major areas of risk assessment: altered physiology, competition and biodiversity, evolutionary prediction, and gene transfer. In the past, using this framework has helped to uncover its limitations and the ways in which we could improve our own approach to environmental risk assessment. Therefore, we have decided to incorporate a more in-depth cost-benefit analysis, information on existing water treatment practices, and public perspectives through our Humans & SynBio project.[2,3,5]
Altered Physiology: Our modified E. coli cells differ from their E. coli BL21-AI and E. coli DH5α predecessors in that our modified strains contain the T7 promoter with a GST-crs5 gene, which codes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae metallothionein, a metal-binding protein. Our E. coli have  three different overexpressed transport proteins that work with the metallothioneins to uptake and sequester lead, mercury, and nickel heavy metal ions. We are using the lead transporter gene CPB4, originally from Nicotiana tabacum, under control by the Anderson promoter. The mercury sequestration system is composed of merT and merP, genes originally found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MerP is a periplasmic mercury ion scavenging protein. MerT is an integrated membrane protein that works to transport mercury ions into the cell’s cytoplasm. Finally, the nickel transporter is the protein product of the nixA gene found in Helicobacter pylori.
In addition to the three aforementioned strains, we constructed a fourth strain of E. coli, the reporter strain. We inserted amilCP behind both a nickel/cobalt activated promoter, Prcn, and a mercury activated promoter, PmerT. This functioned as a sign of when the above mentioned cells were metal saturated. Basically, when metal ions enter the reporter cell, the AmilCP is engaged, turning the cell blue, indicating that the other cells are saturated.
Given these changes, we would expect that there would be a change in cell growth because the production of metallothioneins renders the strain slow-growing. We tested our theory through various growth assays, detailed in Metallothionein Results . We found that the growth rate of our engineered cells was severely impaired, such that over a period of one day, the total cell concentration was roughly half"

In our project, the laboratory strains we used are routine strains, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. In addition, the sweet receptor protein we used is T1R2/T1R3, it’s safe too. We communicate with Dr. Yang about the safety details of the project.
COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER UNIVERSITIES
At the latter phase of our project, we organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University to make a big chat about what we had done so far and held three scientific speeches to introduce the development and the common use of sweeteners in our daily life, which contributed to the popularity of iGEM as well as Synthetic Biology. Ultimately, we collected the critical advice from the audiences in time and accepted one of them, which recommended us to set saccharose as the standard. After that running, the test would be more reasonable.
MEDIA CAMPAIGN
In September, we were interviewed by the Propaganda Department of Beijing Institute of Technology, and we had launched a website campaign on the BIT official website of synthetic biology and iGEM. In the course of the interview, we carried out scientific exchanges on the knowledge of sweet substances.
iGEM MEETING
In the late September, in order to promote synthetic biology and iGEM, we held a preaching meeting about synthetic biology and iGEM for all the students of all majors in BIT. At the meeting, we had a total of three links, the first link was to introduce iGEM and synthetic biology to the students. The second link was brainstorm, so that students can think about our project's innovative point and flash point with our project's background. The third part was a free exchange session. Students can communicate with us any project and team related things. After this meeting, the innovation of our project is further sublimated.
OPEN-ENDED ACTIVITY
At the 85th anniversary of Beijing institute of technology, we were invited to show iGEM and our project to alumni. In our display case, we prepared some small biology games, and we told students what‘s Synthetic biology. And we introduced our former projects to people. They can learn about iGEM through our past competition experiences. Meanwhile, we can improve our project through the suggestions of students. In this open-ended activity, we communicated with more than 3000 people, and got more than 500 suggestions. In the open-ended activity, we select sweet substances as our inducers better.

Photoreceptor mechanism:
Photoreceptor mechanism was used from the the Tokio-Nokogen team of 2009 ( https://2009.igem.org/Team:Tokyo-Nokogen ) This mechanism was modified by adding only the green light receptor instead of the whole mechanism., including also the red light receptor mechanism.
The most important modification of this mechanism was the inclusion of the protein RecA in our construct to make it compatible to the regulation system of lambda phage incorporated in the mechanism of concentration.
Green receptor: Is going to be used to initiate the entire mechanism. It is composed by eight parts, in a sequence of twelve parts.
The constitutive promoter is used for the permanent expression of the gene, it is attached to a ribosome binding site (RBS) that is a sequence on the messenger RNA to which the ribosome can bind and initiate protein translation of ho1 (heme oxigenase 1) that converts heme to biliverdin IXalpha.
The sequence that produce pcy4A (phycocyanobilin ferredoxin oxidoreductase) which allows the catalyzation of biliverdin IXalpha to phycocyanobilin.
Another RBS is used to produce CcaS-EnvZ which is a chimeric protein of ScaS and the EnvZ that acts as the light responsive domain. CcaS-EnvZ is the coding sequence of the green light receptor, it induces the expression of phycobilisome linker protein.
The green light OmpR regulates the production of outer membrane proteins. This  promoter will allow the expression of the 38 kDa RecA protein that activates the expression of the promoters for arabinose concentration by reducing the activity of the lambda repressor.
RecA is a protein used for the cleavage of protein lambda. It has shown that it has a cleavage activity when its binded to lambda repressor."

Both teams were able to gain from this experience. Competing at the collegiate level, UCSD’s team provided us with tips and tricks to make our iGEM team as successful as possible. We, in turn, discussed our projects. They advised us on the transfection of our ecDNA and we informed them on the competition and how to improve their project for presenting. This experience was extremely beneficial to both of us and have future dates set up to discuss our respective projects even further.
Columbia
A couple members from the Columbia University's iGEM Team met with our team in order to discuss our projects and share ideas about putting our projects together. The Columbia iGEM Team mentored us by helping write our abstract, edit our writing, and look over our website. One of the Columbia team members is an alum of the TP-CC San Diego Team before going to Columbia University, so he was able to help move our team forward. Our meeting was very informative for all team members and also helped us get a glimpse into an Undergraduate iGEM Team. This was a part of our Human Practices effort to connect with teams from different places across the country.

DNAzyme
We performed our DNAzyme assays in two ways. We used polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE); however, the gels rarely provided clear, informative results. Thus, we also put the DNAzymes in cell-free reactions with the toehold switch. If the toehold switch was not triggered, the substrate strand of the DNAzyme remained sequestered by the catalytic strand. If the toehold switch was triggered, the substrate strand must have activated the switch, either because cleavage had occurred or because the substrate strand was not properly sequestered.
Substrate Sequestration
Because the substrate strand of the DNAzyme duplex contains the trigger for the toehold switch, it is essential that the strand is annealed to the catalytic strand. The catalytic strand sequesters the substrate strand and prevents it from activating the toehold switch. To look for sequestration, we annealed the substrate and catalytic strands of each DNAzyme together in ratios that ranged from 1:1 to 1:1000. The resulting duplexes were analyzed on a native polyacrylamide gel, which suggested that the substrate strand is never fully sequestered. However, in cell-free reactions, the duplexes did not activate the toehold switch.
Hairpin versus Duplex
To circumvent the presence of unsequestered substrate strand, we synthesized hairpin DNAzymes that connect the two strands into one DNA strand that forms a hairpin loop. Based on experiments in cell-free extract, the hairpin produces minimal activation of the toehold switch in its folded state, and it produces much greater activation of the switch than the duplex when the substrate is cleaved.
Cleavage
To analyze the activity of the DNAzymes, we added metal ion and observed the completed reactions on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The gels do not show cleavage product for either the lead or thallium DNAzymes, but adding metal ion to the cell-free reactions with the DNAzyme and toehold switch results in expression of LacZ, suggesting that cleavage does, in fact, occur.
Concentration Optimization
To determine the concentration of DNAzyme that would produce the most activation of the toehold switch in reaction without inducing background expression of LacZ, we tried a range of concentrations of DNAzyme in the reaction. Preliminary results suggest that"

We took a tour of the Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. We learned about many kinds of new technology and scientific advances.
Summer Camp with High School
This year, we organized a summer camp enrolling 24 students from Qingdao No.2 High School, introducing them to the biolab and motivating their interest in Bioscience. We arranged many fun science activities for them, such as analyzing samples of marine organisms, making their own specimens, and making drinks out of artificial food additives, which left a deep impression on them about food safety. We concentrated on biosafety, hoping to raise their awareness on the subject of experimental safety.
Summer Camp of Life Science and Technology
It’s our third year organizing the Science and Technology Camp, aimed at the new sophomore students. In order to ensure that the camp members have an overall understanding of Life Sciences, we gave then lectures on biochemistry, took them on a field trip to do botany sampling, taught them to do molecular experiments and showed them new realms and advances in science such as bioinformatics, microchip technology, system biology, and of course, synthetic biology.In addition, we organized a mini-Jamboree, because academic Jamboree is a relatively new concept in China, and we would like young undergraduates to know more about it. The members of the summer camp prepared their own projects during the summer holidays. During the event, they gave presentations and explained their posters, while we tried our best to create the right atmosphere for a Jamboree. The poster reception attracted many students around the campus, filling the members with satisfaction from completing their own project.

WatsOn
Our hardware consists of the casing and the electronical components. The casing which can be seen on the left was built from laser cut acrylic glass. A detailed description of the assembly is described in the section Build your own WatsOn .
The connection between the different electronical elements is visualized below.
Interaction of electronical components
Raspberry Pi : The Raspberry Pi is a small single-board computer which runs a Linux operating system from an inserted SD card. The steps which are required to set up a fully working system are described in the DIY section of this page. The main purpose of the Raspberry Pi is to run the software described above, to control the attached camera and to show the GUI on the display. The big advantage of this board is that it is very powerful, cheap and therefore perfectly fit for our needs.
Raspberry Pi camera: The camera is directly connected to the Raspberry Pi board and takes the images of the chips.
Arduino: The Arduino board is also a single-board computer with less computing power than the Raspberry Pi but with a greater focus on controlling electronical components. Therefore, it is used to control the LEDs and the Peltier heater.
Relay: The 2-channel relay works like two light switches which are either turned on or off. They control the 450 nm and 480 nm LEDs. The channels are connected and turned on and off by the Arduino board.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," how beneficial early detection of NSCLC is, but we had not explored the clinical implementation of our sensor before talking to him. He suggested offering the test to high risk individuals for whom the pre-symptomatic diagnosis of their cancer could lead to an increase in the rate of survival: in the case of NSCLC, this could be carried out by offering the test to those with a certain smoking history. To determine which individuals had a sufficiently high risk of developing NSCLC, for our sensor to be cost effective, we have designed a cost model - take a look below.
He also proposed that if the concept of our test were to be proven and a variety of miRNAs could be detected as biomarkers for a range of cancers, then our test could be used as a screening tool for anyone over a certain age, due to the increase in cancer prevalence with age. His comments led us to research the required criteria below for our sensor to be used as a screening tool. His advice on the high sensitivity and specificity required fed into our need to create a second series of switches.
Dr Sujal Desai
We discussed the use of our sensor for high risk population screening with Dr Desai, a consultant chest radiologist. He informed us that lung cancer rarely presents before age 40, and to maximize the test’s value it should be offered to those aged 55 and above, with a smoking history - so that we would not waste money offering the test to too many people who were very unlikely to have cancer.
To integrate their advice, we worked with our our modeling team to work out who would we should screen. Tammegami et al.’s probability score is the probability of an individual getting lung cancer in the next 6 years. [2]
Using our model which combined this with the data for our project and standard NSCLC treatment, we worked out for what probabilities it would be cost effective for us to screen. The model showed that our tool could be cost effective at cost per QALY - saving lives and saving the NHS money. It shows that even if our sensitivity was lower than we expect, our sensor would be extremely cost effective.

Exeter,2015,Team:Exeter#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," this solution is what drove our Human Practices. Whether our test leads the way for social change is not for us as a team to decide due to the highly complex social aspect of our work.
Although each individual party of our Human Practices was unique, our Human Practices naturally overlapped for one main reason. Each party wants a solution to the problem that is bTB. Establishing this common ground and bringing together affected parties will eventually lead to an officially bTB status for the UK. It also allowed us to integrate the most important aspects of each party into the design and implementation of our Toehold test.

After a helpful feedback session, we organized a seminar with Eline Melteig, who taught us more about public outreach for human practises. Overall, this collaboration was a meaningful learning experience teaching us not only how to improve our projects but also how to have fun while doing it. Both teams agreed that it was a great opportunity to practice presentation skills, learn more about what an academic poster should look like and how to reach out to the public with our projects. Thank you iGEM Tübingen for joining us!
8th-10th of June 2018 Nordic iGEM Conference in Lund, Sweden
Team(s) in the collaboration:
DTU-Denmark, UCopenhagen (University of Cophenhagen, Denmark), Uppsala (Sweden), Linkoping Sweden (Sweden), Stockholm Sweden (Sweden), Lund (Sweden), Chalmers-Gothenburg (Sweden), Aalto-Helsinki (Finland)
In June, we participated on the iGEM Nordic meetup. The conference was perfectly organized by team Lund and we had an opportunity to practice and learn many new skills. We had a chance to present our project in front of a larger audience and also a panel of judges, who provided us with constructive feedback. Later on, we also presented our project poster and were questioned on it both by the other teams and the judges, this enabled us to practice answering quickly unexpected questions and also helped us realise the weak points of our project. During the lecture session with the expert on team building, we learned how give each other constructive feedback and learned more about group dynamics and its progression. In our free time, we participated on scavenger hunt around the city and a gala dinner. During the gala dinner, our project was nominated for the Judges Award. Overall, this was very meaningful collaboration, where we provided and also received many useful tips on how to improve our iGEM project. Thank you iGEM Team Lund.

Goettingen,2014,Team:Goettingen#project overview#therapeutics_-_-_TEXT.html,"ector cells (neutrophils and macrophages) of the immune system and thereafter, leads to the death of the target cell. This way, not only can it bind to fungal pathogens but can also “draw attention” towards itself from the immune system. In addition to this, the constant region can also activate the compliment cascade via the ""classical"" pathway. Essentially, this set-up functions as a modified antibody with an added bonus of greater affinity.
Enhancement of immune response in immunodeficient individuals
As for the stimulation of the immune system in case of individuals with immunodeficiencies, the use of adjuvants (immune response enhancers) to augment the response is one strategy. In addition to this, natural immuno-modulatory molecules called cytokines (such as Interleukin-1 and Interferon-gamma) to stimulate the appropriate branches of the immune system can be employed as well.
Homing the anti-fungal drug to the site of infection
Anti-mycotics have such as Amphotericin B are fluconazole have been used extensively to treat fungal infections. While they’ve been effective, they are more toxic to the human body than antibiotics that kill bacteria. This is due to the fact that bacteria are more dissimilar to humans than fungi are. As a result, it’s relatively simpler to find targets for antibiotics than anti-mycotics. Simply put, the more we humans have in common with a pathogen, the greater is the difficulty in coming up with a drug that harms only one (in other words, there is a need for selective toxicity).
Thus, yet another potential application of the novel peptides we developed is that they can act as “guides” to these molecules thereby reducing side-effects due to the drug in question.

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#TERRA Adaptor_-_-_TEXT.html," output nozzle, allowing direct control over when the output is dispensed. The output selector used in the 4-Pressure Regulator chip is identical to those in the finalized branches of a droplet-based TERRA Adapter.
Click here to learn more about our proof-of-concept chip for cell-free expression:
Cell-Free Expression Chip
The TERRA Adapter works for both droplet-based and continuous flow microfluidics. For droplet-based experiments, the TERRA Adapter has two valves and a set of four pressure regulators per output. The pressure regulators serve to minimize the disruption in droplet generation on the experimental chip due to the pressure difference caused by the actuation of the valves in the output selector. In continuous flow experiments, there are two valves for every output, there are no pressure regulators, but there is an extra output that serves as a flush mechanism for cleaning the nozzle between outputs.
Below are some TERRA Adapters that our team has created so far:
Single Output, Continuous Flow
Single Output, Droplet-Based
Three Output, Continuous Flow
Three Output, Droplet-Based
We have open-sourced the designs of the TERRA Adapter and added them to the 2017 iGEM BostonU Hardware team, MARS', repository of microfluidic chip designs.
Here are the SVG files for each design and its corresponding description and fabrication and assembly documentation.
Single Output, Continuous Flow
Single Output, Droplet-Based
Three Output, Continuous Flow
Three Output, Droplet-Based
Scalability
The TERRA Adapter is scalable following radial symmetry about the nozzle output, as seen in the diagram below. The continuous flow TERRA Adapters also follow this symmetry but an extra branch has to be added to each design, except that of a single input, to serve as a flush to clean the nozzle between outputs.
While there is no design limit to the number of branches a TERRA Adapter can have, there exist a fabrication limit as to the number you can feasibly mill on a chip, depending on the method of fabrication and size of chip, the fabrication limit of the TERRA Adapter will differ. Using our current fabrication method and chip size, the largest TERRA Adapter we could manufacture would be one with 5 inputs."
Lund,2017,Team:Lund#Design#Theory_-_-_TEXT.html," upon association with salicylate, as this induces a conformational change in the DNA-NahR complex that relieves DNA-bending at the site and subsequently allows better DNA-RNAP interaction [16]. The conformational change springs from an additional interaction between the NahR and the DNA 35 bp upstream of the RNAP binding site [15].
There lies some uncertainty in the exact configuration of the DNA-NahR association. Some reports suggest that NahR binds as a monomer, while other research indicates multimerization at the binding site. Moreover, it remains unknown whether the binding is cooperative or not [15]. For further elaboration on the issue, see modeling .
Figure 1: Schematic representation of the organization of the upper and lower degradation pathway of naphthalene found in the Nah7 plasmid of Pseudomas. Both pathways are under regulation of the constitutively expressed regulator NahR [17].
Figure 2: 3D structure of the NahR, a transcriptional regulator spanning 306 amino acids. The protein structure is organized as follows; the N-terminal consists of a highly conserved DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif. The DNA association is furthermore dependent on a multimerization site located along the C-terminal. Through iterative mutagenesis, the ligand-binding pocket has been determined to lie close to equidistantly between the termini [18] [47] [48] .
Sensing plasticizers
Plasticizers are very common additives found in most commercial plastic products. They provide the polymers with durability, elasticity and flexibility, offering increased malleability and strength [19]. The plasticizer action on the polymeric material has generally thought to be lubrication between the polymeric chains, but recent thermodynamic simulations have shown that the situation might be more complex [20]. The most predominant class of plasticizers used today is that of low-weight phthalate esters (PEs), in particular DEHP (bis-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) [19]. While PEs offer a cost-effective solution to maintaining flexibility, there is cause for concern as they are not covalently bonded to the plastic and will readily leach into the environment. Multiple sources have reported severe adverse effects in vertebrates; among other things, toxic action on the human endocrine system has been noted [21] [22] [23] [24] [25]. In particular, low-weight PEs have demonstrated some antagonistic affinity for the ligand-binding domain of the human estrogen-alpha receptor (hER-α) [23] [24"

Preparation of the linearized DNA (F234-F260) for the Moss Transformation

A PCR using the outer primer pair should next be done to generate lots of a single linear product containing all three components (the upstream arm + cassette + downstream arm).
Cells should first be transformed with a lambda red plasmid such as pSC101-gbaA (commercially available from GeneBridges http://www.genebridges.com/). This plasmid allows the cell to take up linear pieces of DNA without degrading them.
They can then be transformed with this linear piece of DNA and hopefully some of them will undergo homologous recombination, cutting out the cephalosporinase gene and replacing it with the selection-counterselection cassette. After this step, the cells should be plated onto a kanamycin-containing medium to select for the cells that have taken up the cassette.
The second step involves the replacement of this cassette with the limonene synthase gene – the cells that have grown on the kanamycin plate should be transformed with single stranded DNA containing the appropriate upstream arm + limonene synthase (or any other BioBrick) + downstream arm.  Again, in some of the cells homologous recombination will cause the excision of the cassette and insertion of the limonene synthase gene into the vacated region.
This time, in order to select for the cells that have lost the cassette ( counter-select for the cells that have the cassette), they should be plated out onto media that contain sucrose – cells that can grow on this medium (and are not red) have lost the levansucrase gene, and so the cassette, and are therefore good candidates for having had the cephalosporinase gene replaced by the limonene synthase gene.
Finally, grow the cells at a non-permissive temperature to remove the lambda red plasmid and enjoy your lemon-scented cells!

Paris_Bettencourt,2012,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Human Practice#perception_-_-_TEXT.html," and not in a total altruistic way. On the other hand, we suggest to teach synthetic biology to kids, and for me it's hard to know whether it's really to teach them how to be critical toward this technology, or in fact doing the same as biotech companies, because they're still young and most of them won't see limits, even if they are taught. I think that at least, it should be taught in university for biologist, which is not done so far, unless being in a synthetic biology curriculum.
We started to consider human practices as an important issue since the beginning of the project. Indeed we show that a lot of previous iGEM project and our project first ideas had the goal to be released in nature but none of them had a serious safety device. During human practice I realize that zero risk doesn’t exist and nevertheless we can use genetically engineered organism for specific usage and assets risk for this specific usage as long as we discuss it with a large population. I learn that most of the people would agree that certain projects should be applied in the environment as long as we use safety devices.
I always thought the public opinion on genetically modified organisms was based on fear and ignorance which led to the irrational behaviour and irrational arguments.  This bothered me and still bothers me very much because it is completely opposite to how I deal with problems I encounter. We should try to make as much informed and educated opinion as we can and by doing this try to overcome our fears, often based on our wild imagination triggered by people trying to exploit this basic human emotion. Throughout our intensive work on issues of human practices my opinion about public changed resulting in more understanding and concern from my side. I was glad to hear that the public is willing to accept risks if they see considerable benefits. But my main realization, selfish in a way, was that I as a synthetic biologist won’t be able to change the world if I don’t make public feel safer by doing what I do the best – science. That’s why I accepted to do an iGEM project which deals with biosafety from a scientific point of view.  Synthetic biologists should not contain themselves to only living in the lab, in an ivory tower detached from the public, but rather collaborate with the public to reach the best decisions for community.  In a sense, we should shift from making change only in the lab to making change in the whole world.

Dynamics
Ideal case
Figure 2 The four cases for the whole cell under ideal conditions. On our project overview , you can see  see in action how the circuit responds to different inputs.
Under ideal conditions, there is no leakiness or cross-talk. The Figure 2 shows the production of GFP as a function of four different combinations of inputs in an ideal whole cell. No GFP is produced when there is no LasAHL and LuxAHL or when both are present. GFP is produced only when one of the input AHLs are present, thus emulating an XOR system. In the case with 0.5 nM of LuxAHL and no LasAHL as input, the rate of production of GFP reduces after six hours. This could be attributed to the delayed production of LasAHL from LasI. In the case with only LasAHL as input, there is a positive feedback of LasAHL.
Figure 3 The dynamics of flipping of the terminators when the cell receives 0.5 nM LuxAHL and 0 nM of LasAHL and produces GFP and LasI
In the case above, the cell receives 0.5 nM of LuxAHL and 10 nM LasAHL. This results in production of Bxb1 and ΦC31 respectively. Each terminator is flanked by binding sites for each of these integrases. These integrases flip the terminators by binding to their respective sites. Since, both integrases are present, the terminator is flipped twice thus eventually turning the system OFF. This is summarized in the figure above.Then, they flip the"

Trish Corbett is a clinical nurse specialist who leads the Hospital Elder Life Program, a hospital volunteer program which provides physically and mentally stimulating checkups for patients over 70 years old. She emphasized how no two patients with dementia are alike, and that the harmful stereotype that associates AD with a deprivation of personhood is false. Trish shared with us how families often do not understand dementia well, and how important it is for a family member to access community resources in order to better take care of themselves and their loved one. Above all else, she encouraged those without dementia to advocate strongly for patients so that their voices are not diminished.
Dr. Margaret Fahnestock

Dr. Fahnestock studies neurotrophins- proteins that induce survival, development, and functions of neurons- in pathogenic systems such as AD simulated mice models. Two important neurotrophins she studies are Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF). She explained to us how the scientific community had been preoccupied with explaining AD through looking at the amyloid beta protein, and how limited gains from this endeavor have made many corporations withdraw from research of AD. For this reason, there have been significant reductions in available funding for basic biological research studying AD in Canada. Dr. Fahnestock believes that there should be more communication from researchers to the general public, although the lack of platforms to communicate and translate technical vocabulary into simpler terms remain as obstacles. She expects the field will begin to get more interesting as the scientific community finally is becoming more perceptive to different models of studying AD than just through amyloid beta.

cDNA Conversion
cDNA stands for complementary DNA, and can be described as a double stranded DNA that is made with RNA as a template. Our ultimate goal is to sequence the RNA that we have extracted - and with our sequencing method of choice, we need to turn the RNA back into DNA for it to be read properly. To do this, we use a technique known as reverse transcription to read and copy the RNA contents onto a newly made DNA strand, with no genetic information lost!
Experiment
The aim of this experiment was the conversion of RNA to cDNA through reverse transcription primed by oligo-dT. The process consists of 3 major steps - complementary DNA strand synthesis, RNA digestion and synthesis of second strand [1]. The steps we conducted are described below:
Synthesis of Complementary DNA Strand
Due to previous polyA addition to 3'OH, all RNA molecules have similar sequence at 3' end which only differs in number of added adenine bases. This allows us to use polyT primers (Oxford Nanopore) to anneal to RNA template and reverse transcriptase (SuperScript IV, ThermoFisher) can initiate the transcription.
A second, so-called strand switching primer is added to the reaction. This compensates for under-representations of 5´ends in cDNA by introducing an additional template and therefore protecting the terminal base pairs. Terminal transferase activity of the RT adds a number of deoxycytidine bases. The SSP primer is complementary to these bases and acts as an extended template for the RT, not only protecting the terminal bases, but also allowing to introduce sequence of choice into the newly synthesized first strand.
RNA Template Digestion
RNA template needs to be removed before the second DNA strand can be synthesized. This is done by adding ribonucleases (RNAse Cocktail Enzyme Mix, ThermoFischer) into the reaction and incubating. The enzyme mix consists of RNase A and T1.

Cell Measurement Protocol
The three test devices and the positive and negative control were transformed into competent Escherichia coli DH5Α cells using the provided transformation protocol from iGEM. The transformants were plated on LB with chloramphenicol and incubated at 37℃ overnight.
Next day, two colonies were picked from the plate with the negative control, whereas only one colony was picked from the plates with the test devices and the positive control. The colonies were inoculated in 5 mL Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with chloramphenicol. The cells were incubated at 37℃ and 150 rounds per minute (RPM) until the next day.
The initial OD600 of the overnight cultures was measured and important to the ""Normalization tab"" in the provided Excel sheet. The cultures were diluted to a target OD600 of 0.02 in 10 mL LB media with chloramphenicol in 50 mL falcon tubes. 100 µL samples of each solution was transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and placed on ice, while the rest of the solutions were incubated at 37℃ at 150 RPM. 100 µL samples of the each culture were taken and transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and placed on ice at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours.
At the end, all samples were loaded into a Greiner Bio-One 96 well plate using the same layout as the one suggested by the iGEM plate reader protocol. OD600 and fluorescence were measured for each sample. The excitation filter was set to 395 nm and the emission filter to 509 nm when measuring the fluorescence. The data was imported into the ""Cell measurement tab"" in the provided Excel sheet and sent to measurement@igem.org

Characterisation of the fluorescent reporter iLOV
Introduction
iLOV was introduced to the iGEM database as BBa_K6600004 in 2011 by Glasgow 2011 , but so far has seen no further characterization. iLOV has a range of advantages over the more commonly used GFP and related fluorescent proteins, including:
Half the sequence length of GFP (halving DNA synthesis costs) [2]
Faster maturation of iLOV flurophore than GFP [2]
Stable over a wide pH range [3]
Recovers spontaneously after photo-bleaching  [2]
Ability to work in anoxic conditions [1]
The aim of this study is threefold: the emmission spectra of iLOV will be explored over a range of excitation wavelengths, the response of the iLOV protein to exciting photons will be measured and the recovery rate of GFP and ILOV from photo-bleaching will be compared.
Experimental Method
Excitation and Emission Scanning
The scanning of the excitation and emission spectra would occur in two stages. First a broad range scan, 5nm spacing between emission scans, provides the general topography of florescence from the iLOV protein. Then areas around the peaks from the broad range scan would be explored in more detail with 1nm spaced emission scans.
The scans would be made using a TECAN florescence measuring machine. This machine is capable of"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," SpeI sites could be regenerated and the biobrick prefix and suffix restored. This construct (J23100-deGFP) with the overhangs was submitted to IDT for synthesis as a gBlock.
Figure 1: Top: SBOL Visual schematic of BBa_K2205002 (J23100-deGFP). Bottom: plasmid map for BBa_K2205002 in pSB1C3 plasmid backbone - generated by Benchling.
Implementation
The J23100-deGFP construct described above was Gibson assembled into a pSB1C3 plasmid using the NEB Hi-Fi assembly kit. To do this, pSB1C3 was digested with XbaI and SpeI to create a linearised plasmid backbone . The deGFP gBlock DNA was prepared according to the IDT protocol and assembled into the linear plasmid backbone according to the NEB Hi-Fi Protocol . The assembly mixture was then transformed into commercial DH5α cells and incubated on chloramphenicol plates overnight. Colonies which were green under UV light were picked and grown in 5 mL LB broth overnight before undergoing plasmid extraction . Successful insertion of the J23100-deGFP construct into pSB1C3 was confirmed through a restriction digest with EcoRI and PstI followed by gel electrophoresis . Figure 2 shows that the insert was successfully inserted as the double digest resulted in two linear bands at ~2100 bp (linear plasmid) and ~800 bp (deGFP). The DNA samples were then sent for sequencing to ensure that the construct was correct. Sequencing data can be found on the Parts page .
Figure 2: Restricition digest gel of BBa_K2205002 in pSB1C3. Plasmid DNA was digested with EcoRI and PstI. The digest mixture was then analysed on an agarose gel with NEB 1KB ladder. Fragments were visulaised at ~2100 bp (lineraised pSB1C3), and at ~800 bp (BBa_K2205002 insert).
Characterisation
The expression of deGFP was first tested in E. coli cells using an experimental procedure similar to that used in the Interlab study. Cells transformed with pSB1C3-J23100-deGFP were grown in 10 mL LB broth overnight and OD600 nm was measured. Culture was added to 3 separate falcon tubes and made up to 12 mL with LB with chloramphenicol such that the starting OD600 of"

Hopefully they do it by tonight, so Alberto can set up the C1A_1 plate reader experiment.  Alberto and Siwat set up a new gel + solution plate reader experiment to measure oxidation kinetics of pyocyanin in the presence of sodium sulfite. They are using the plate reader in Ouldridge's Lab, which has a fancy injector that saves us 1 hour of manual work at least and allows us to measure recution of pyocyanin in real time.

Julie and I used Q5 to amplify these genes from the P. aeruginosa genome after putting a colony in 50 μl water and boiling it to release the DNA. The gel of the PCR looked something like this:
The first lane after the ladder is norB, which looks right since it is a 1400 bp gene. Then there were 3 bands that showed up for nosZ in the right lane. Since one of these bands is where it should be, we will continue with the restriction digest though and use the low-melt gel to pick the portion we want if these extra bands show up there too.

Public Engagement
iGEM Peshawar travelled a total of 6112 kilometers and spent almost 62 hours spreading synbio awareness across Pakistan. Our roadshow stopped by schools, colleges and universities, engaging over 5000 students, teachers, parents, and members of the community. We also set up a 'Bio–Machines' lab at Magnifi–Science in Karachi — one of the biggest science fairs in the country. Because we were engaging a diverse audience, consisting of people of all ages and background, our activities were designed to keep everyone involved!

Our Activities in Schools
DIY DNA Extraction!
""DNA is the code of life. It carries all the genetic instructions used in the  growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all living things. And the best part? We can play with it! Learn how and why DNA is extracted and then try out your hands using a Do-it-yourself (DIY) kitchen method to extract DNA from your favourite fruit. Extract and compare your very own DNA samples just like real scientists do!"" This is the kind of activity we engaged our audiance in.
Everyone, especially the children, enjoyed this fun–to–do experiment and took home not just their freshly extracted fruit DNA, but also a very good understanding of how DNA controls our cells and how we can now print our own! Click here to download our activity protocol.

Designing a Kill-Switch
We initially attempted to create engineered bacteria that break down nitrogenous waste effectively in wastewater treatment plant. Since our E. coli can survive in saltwater, creating a kill switch for our engineered bacteria will, in theory, prevent our bacteria from thriving outside wastewater treatment plants.
We decided to vary from previous iGEM team efforts in three important ways:
1) We appended the ssrA degradation tag onto our toxin of choice, MazF. This should lead any MazF expressed due to leaky control of the promoter to be destroyed, and not damage the cell.
2) We introduced, in some of our constructs, a supplmentary copy of the cI repressor gene, in cause the light-controlled copy on pDawn was insufficient to control MazF.
3) For both MazF constructs we created, we had counterparts that contained the alpha fragment of LacZ instead of the toxin. This way, we can monitor expression levels without worrying about the cell death that high levels of MazF might cause.
Control of Gene Expression by pDawn alone
3.1 (K2268003): When light is present, c1 WILL NOT be produced. In theory, the expression of LacZ should be maximal. This is intended to be the non-lethal version of our kill-switch.
4.1 (K2268004): When light is present, c1 WILL NOT be produced. In theory, the expression of MazF should be maximal.
Control of Gene Expression by pDawn and supplementary cI Repressor
3.2(K2268005): When light is present with no ITPG, c1 WILL NOT be produced. In theory, maximal expression of LacZ should be produced. This is a non-lethal version of"

Around 200ng of plasmid template was used, annealing temperature was the lower primer Tm, and no DMSO was used. We will try this PCR again with much less  template (10-50 ng per 50 uL reaction), as per NEB's suggestions, and fewer cycles.

PCR 1: Attempt #2
Experimentor : Grace Yi
Aim : To remove the yeast consensus sequence, TCACA, from the 5' end of 17H, 17J, 17L
Results : PCR 1 was retried for all three parts, with the amount of template reduced to around 30 ng per 50uL reaction. Phusion HF (High Fidelity) buffer was used, in the absence of DMSO. Thermocycling conditions were not changed, except the reduction of number of cycles from 30 to 20. Parts J and L were successfully amplified this time, with bands seen at around 1100-1200 bases on the agarose gel. However, nothing was seen for part H. One option is to try adding DMSO to a final concentration of 3% to hopefully allow amplification of part H.

Aim : To design and order primers to ""stitch"" the caffeine genes together
Results : With Ray, we designed and ordered the ""stitching"" primers that would allow us to assemble our Biobricks easily, by using restriction enzyme cut sites other than the four standard ones. Once digested, two or three genes could be ligated together in a single ligation. This follows the decision to combine the three available (from the kit) caffeine biosynthesis genes and Biobrick them behind a promoter and ribosome-binding site (R"

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html," the use of our system in the intestine. We asked prof. Drenth about current detection methods in the intestines. Also we presented our device and asked his opinion.
Result: Prof. Drenth saw potential in our idea, as he could tell us there are an endless amount of substances to be detected in the intestines. Some of them were mentioned by the other doctors we spoke as well, such as Calprotectine.
When we asked Prof. Drenth about the usefulness of our device, he was most enthusiastic about the idea of using it for real-time monitoring of intestinal cancer. He explained that nowadays check-ups involve the performance of macroscopic tests as colonoscopy, which brings great discomfort to the patient. If we could find a way to perform monitoring that is less invasive, that would bring great advantages.
Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg – Designer, Artist and Writer
Goal: Learn more about the thoughts behind a project where GMOs were proposed to be used inside the intestines. And inform about how Mrs. Ginsberg conveys her controversial design to the audience.
Approach: We contacted Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg about her design, inspired on the iGEM-project of Cambridge 2009. Thereby we asked her mainly about her thoughts on the use of GMOs inside the body. Also we informed what the reactions were to her project in which she and her fellow designer James King hypothetically introduced pigment-excreting bacteria in the intestines to colour egestions (the Scatalog).
Result: Mrs. Ginsberg explained to us that with her project she further wanted to provoke discussion about using GMOs in the body and that she was not necessarily taking a side.
Also she referred us to a similar research, where they modified gut-bacteria to remember signals it received from its environment. Thereby it forms a monitoring system of events occurring in the intestines. She hereby informed us that research, similar to ours, is already taking place and that her idea to use bacteria for diagnosis might not be far out of reach.
Pesticides
The application scenario that might have the biggest economic impact if it were to be realized, is the one where we would use our device for targeted pesticide secretion. This could however also be the scenario with the biggest implications for the environment. People we met at the RIVM-symposium were very enthusiastic about this idea. To further scrutinize the feasibility of this application we  contacted people involved in regulation of the use of GMOs in the environment. Also we contacted one of the main institutes in the Netherlands involved in sustainable development of amongst others agriculture.

Market Overview
Synbiologica’s initial target market will be scientific researchers, particularly those with PhDs who are in control of their own research and equipment. These scientists will be responsible for making the decision to incorporate BEAR into their laboratories. A demographic overview of science and engineering PhDs showed that 9 out of every 10 scientists and engineers worked in a large city in 2001. 1 60% of science and engineering PhDs work in education and at government institutions. 2 In 2001, the average earnings of PhDs working in the public sector surpassed those in the private sector. 3 On average, a scientist or engineer with a PhD employed on a full-time basis earned $70,000. 4
In 2001, the average age of employed science and engineering PhDs was 46, much older than the average age of 39 for employed Canadians. 5
There were 4 times as many men with science and engineering PhDs than women in 2001, but this gap is gradually narrowing. Female PhDs also earned only 77% of what male PhDs earned. 6
BEAR will be valuable to scientific researchers, particularly those of the endocrinology and neuroscience demographic. There are 447 endocrinologists practicing in Canada, 78% of which work in a health science centre and 37% of which work in a university. 7 In the United States, there are 5341 practicing endocrinologists, approximately 1500 of which are involved in research. 8 As scientists learn more about the role of specific hormones in the brain, the more they can contribute to the development of treatments for neurological and mental diseases. The opportunity to publish their research is an interest shared by all scientists. Producing publications allows researchers to continue funding new projects.
In order to produce reliable experimental results, researchers must have a multitude of test subjects or animals"

Science and Technology Week is an on-campus annually celebration of science, technology, and engineering involving different colleges students in USTC conducting various science-based activities. This year, Science and Technology Week attracted over ten thousand citizens to USTC, varying from innocent pupils, high school students and college students in biology-related majors to the public from all walks who may have limited knowledge of Synthetic Biology. Our team cooperated with Team USTC and offered visitors a feast of biological knowledge.
We introduced elementary knowledge of genetics to citizens by poster presentation, then showed them some basic experiment operation, like liquid relief, centrifugation and etc. We used metaphors of LEGO and principle of programming to introduce the concept of biobricks and Synthetic Biology. What’s more, the game Foldit is used to give children a vivid model of protein. In addition, we distributed questionnaires to the visitors to get some feedback to improve the design idea of our software.
Asia-Pacific Conference in Taiwan
We attended International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference held by National Chiao Tung University from July 31st to August 4th 2017. Over 20 iGEM teams attended the conference and 6 members of our team was sent to Taiwan.
During the conference, the iGEMers communicated, changed ideas and learned from one another. The conference is not only a simple warm-up for the upcoming world championship in Boston, but an Asian regional platform for teams from different countries to exchange ideas and explore synthetic biology as well. All the teams made a project presentation and introduced their projects. In this way, we received useful feedbacks and technology-improvement suggestions from students and professors of other teams.
Science and Technology Exhibition
We held a Synthetic Biology exhibition in Hefei science museum, which is the largest off-campus science class. This exhibition attracts thousands of citizens including innocent pupils, high school students and their parents. And our team coordinated with team USTC and provide a flood of synthetic knowledge to the visitors.
We used metaphors of LEGO and principle of programming to introduce the concept of biobricks and Synthetic Biology. In addition, we invited teenagers to play Foldit (an online puzzle video game about protein folding) to give them a sense of computer-aided design. We also prepared several games so that they could learn knowledge while having fun.

Manchester,2013,Team:Manchester#Notebooktest_-_-_TEXT.html," but after a quick shopping trip we ended up with plenty of supplies...ok a LOT of supplies (Not sure if we’re going to get through 3000 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes).
Unfortunately, our first attempt at transformation failed, but to raise our spirits we had our first iGEM social! Divita cooked the team a fantastic curry, and we had a great time. The food adventures continued the next day when Elsa brought in some Icelandic dried fish: certainly something different!
Meanwhile all through the week, the modelling team have been doing a great job making the experimental team look bad. They’ve been learning how to use Copasi (made here in Manchester!) and are cross-referencing the data ready to start simulation.
Week 4
Week 4 started off slowly, but by the end things were really starting to come together. We realised that the pkd46 plasmid we were trying to transform is heat sensitive, so heat-shocking and incubating at 37C really wasn’t the best idea! Instead we tried electroporation, which we managed to do first time, with some successful colonies! Hopefully the rest of the fadD knockout will now run smoothly.
After realising just how expensive biology can be, we’ve started to make a big push on the sponsorship front. So far this has led to some free kits from QIAGEN and a promotion for Ralf, who was addressed as Dr Wenz.
Unfortunately this week we also had to say goodbye to Ali and Johanna, who need to spend time on other projects. Luckily we can say hello to Marco (who will be helping in the lab) and Denis (who’s now in charge of designing our wiki. It’s good to have a computer scientist on the team!).
As you can see it’s been a fairly quiet week, but with our upcoming public outreach events and YSB 1.0, we’ve got a busy fortnight ahead of us!

Week 5
This week has certainly been a mix of ups and downs! On Tuesday and Wednesday the outreach team ran 12 workshops for children aged 11-13 at the university’s Science Stars event. They taught the children about the structure of DNA by getting them to create a DNA molecule from Mario sweets (Mario pairs to Yoshi, Donkey Kong to Diddy Kong) and strawberry pencils. The activity was received amazingly well by the children and teachers alike. We also taught them about what synthetic biology is, and asked them to think what ideas they’d have as well as the ethical implications associated with them. Some of the"

The Vilnius iGEM 2015 Team
Vilnius iGEM is the first International Genetically Engineered Machine competition team from Lithuania and the Baltic states. The team was initiated by Dainius Tautvaišas, who participated in 2013 iGEM competition with Edinburgh University. Along with the first member Ingrida, they recruited the final team. So now there are seven students of genetics, molecular biology and biochemistry.
We are happy to have Prof. Dr. Virginijus Šikšnys as our team instructor and mentor along with Dainius. Also we cannot thank more to Prof. Dr. Šikšnys for the opportunity to realize our project at the Institute of Biotechnology.

Final year Genetics
For me being a member of the Vilnius iGEM team is an opportunity to create something our own, to make a project from scratch. My passion is finding out and trying new things, so this competition is perfect to me. I don’t only work in the laboratory, but also coordinate our team’s social networking, seek sponsorship and make sure the team and our project engages the public.

The Faces of CeBiTec
This is Us!
Our team consists of eleven students from Bielefeld University, was formed in January 2016.
We are supported by our two advisors Julian Droste and Boas Pucker, who are both PhD students in the working groups ""Microbial Genomics and Biotechnology"" and ""Genome Research"" respectively. Together with our two PIs Prof. Dr. Joern Kalinowski and Prof. Dr. Kristian Mueller we represent this years team Bielefeld-CeBiTec. On the following pages we will tell you some things about ourselves , our underappreciated hometown Bielefeld and how you can contact us."

Furthermore, before the end product is tapped from the tank, the entire contents of the cellulose tank is  autoclaved, a process that kill bacteria and other micro-organisms. In that way, no living bacteria will ever  escape out of the tank.
Customer base - who is supposed to buy the product
Charitable organizations are the main customers
The Nutrition Generator is, however, not only useful for undernourished poor people; all people in the world can benefit from the protein and fat rich product of the tank, and therefore also private consumers, public  institutions and many more can be customers.
Key partners - with whom do we work
Our main key partners will be charity organizations, as these have a close connection to trouble spots in developing countries, as well as a good contact to supplier and social helpers.  In addition we will work together with engineers, who can help us design and develop the product.  At least specialized councils can help us solve ethical issues that might emerge.
Consumer - who is supposed to use the product
All people in the entire world are possible consumers of the Nutrition Generator, but as long as people have access to other food sources, we don’t expect that they will consume GMO produced food.  The target group is undernourished people in developing countries who don’t have the money and access  to protein and fat rich food. But also vegans and vegetarians can benefit from this product, as it is a very  good alternative protein and fat source, for those who don't eat animal products.
Demography - where shall our product be used
The target place is where people suffer from undernourishment. As mentioned above Africa, South-East Asia and Latin America are examples of such areas, where many inhabitants are poor and undernourished.  The Nutrition Generator may with advantage also be used in crisis areas, e.g. war zones or areas  affected by natural disasters.  Furthermore, the product is also a great food source for private homes in high-income countries, where  people can use the food product as a supplement to the diet.
Transport - how will our product reach the consumer
To meet the main objective of the Nutrition Generator, to provide a food source for poor and undernourished people in low-income countries, we need the help of charitable organizations that deliver and set up our  product. Charities often send food and other items to developing countries, and as they know how to do so,  they are our perfect partners in this field.  Along with the product, there must also be"

All the three antifungal peptides are dissolved in sterile water. We test the cell viability under the action of a series of different concentrations of antifungal peptide. Among them we can conclude the MtDef4 possess the best antifungal activity while PDC1 possess a inferior antifungal activity. Significant differences versus vehicle were assessed by student’s t test: *=p<0.05, **=p<0.01, ***=p<0.001, ****=<0.0001.
Conclusion
It is undeniable that, the bactericidal activity of Carbendazim largely depends on the cytotoxicity of acetic acid. Besides, due to the use of carbendazim, Fusarium graminearum is prone to produce drug resistance. After Human practice investigation, we acquire the information that every year the government and hundreds of researchers will be force to rennovate new chemicals to prevent wheat scab. you can check out HERE ! .
By contrast, antifungal peptides are prone to have less side effects[1]:
1. The half-life of the polypeptide is shorter, and its decomposition product is nitrogen-containing organic matter, which can be reused by the crop.
2. The above two families of peptides can specifically form pores in the surface of microbial cell membrane, so that the outflow of cell plasma contents cause cell death, this specific sterilization mechanism makes the microbial tough to mutate resistance, and they can also coordinate with other antimicrobial peptides, enzymes or even traditional antibiotics, because the antimicrobial peptide can increase the permeability of the cell membrane, it can play a synergistic effect without cross-resistance
3. They function on multiple targets within the cell. If the pathogen mutate any target within, it eventually will not have a significant impact on antimicrobial peptides sterilization function.
4. Antibacterial peptides inhibitory concentration and sterilization concentration is very close, which makes them ideal fast fungicide.

In addition, we went through the whole process of DNA information storage. We used our software to encode a file and the DNA sequences were synthesized by a specialized company (General Biosystems Company, Anhui, China). After a few weeks’ storage and cultivation, we extracted the DNA samples and they were sequenced by a specialized company (Qingkezixi Biotechnology Company, Chengdu, China). Finally, Bio101 was used to decode the DNA sequences. As a result, we recovered our original file.

WashU,2010,Team:WashU#Splicing_-_-_TEXT.html," site. This causes a larger intron to be excised, and a different protein product. (Bell et. al., 1988) In both of these cases, the different gene products function in sex determination. Furthermore Sxl is an autoregulatory gene, affecting its own pre-mRNA so that only female cells will express the active protein. (Bell et. al., 1988) In the two examples given, default splicing will result in male, and regulated splicing due to Sxl will result in female phenotype/differentiation.
For our project we have chosen to work with the second type of Sxl regulation, alternative 3' splice site selection. To do this we have included the Sxl binding domain, which is (U)8 or A(U)7, in our construct. (Merendino et. al., 1999) This site is recognized by U2AF in S.s cerevisiae whose binding is required prior to U2 snRNP binding and spliceosome assembly (Zamore et. al., 1989). The expected outcome is that by introducing Sxl and the Sxl binding site to yeast we will be able to regulate native splicing mechanisms to regulate alternative splicing of our construct.
Project Goals
The 2010 WashU iGEM team is attempting to create and modulate a synthetic splicing mechanism in S. cerevisiae.  This will add a valuable new tool into the synthetic biologist's tool-belt that can be utilized in many different applications.
Three different genetic constructs are being made and tested by this years iGEM team.  Each one builds upon the previous construct in our effort to develop and showcase alternative splicing as a synthetic biology tool.
Construct 1
Construct 1 seeks to demonstrate that splicing of the designed intron occurs in S. cerevisiae.  To accomplish this it contains two open reading frames, one which codes for CFP and one which codes for YFP. The CFP open reading frame is contained within an intron, causing it to be spliced out. In eukaryotes only the first open reading frame is translated, so in the non-spliced mRNA CFP will be translated and YFP will not be expressed.  However in the spliced transcript CFP will be spliced out and YFP will be expressed.  Observation of YFP will demonstrate that splicing of the designed intron has occurred within the cell.  Observation of CFP will demonstrate that splicing of the designed intron is not 100% effective.
