Weight 0.45 g of agarose in a scale                                     precision.
Measure 45mL of TAE 1X. Add both of                                     them into an Erlenmeyer flask.
Put it in a microwave for 1-3 min                                     (until agarose is dissolved)
Let agarose cool down.
Add 0.45 μL of Ethidium bromide. This                                     step is optional and allows the                                     visualization of the DNA under UV                                     light.

Pour slowly to avoid                                     bubbles due to they could damage the                                     gel.
Let it at room temperature for 20-30                                     minutes.
Running Agarose Gel:
When agarose gel is solidified, put it                                     into electrophoresis unit. It has to be                                     covered by 1X TAE buffer.
Load the molecular weight ladder. It                                     allows to check if our fragment belongs to                                     a specific band checking the size that it                                     has.
Load samples into the remaining wells.                                     It is recommendable to put 5 μL of DNA                                     sample with 1 μL of loading buffer.
Run the gel at 100V (Small gel) or 120V                                     (Big gel). The time varies depending on gel                                     concentration and voltage.

Using Agrobacterium tumefaciens as a                         vehicle to insert the desired devise, it is necessary                         insert it into a leaf of N.benthamiana by a direct                         injection. This method is known as Agroinfiltration.                         The next step is letting infiltrated leafs for two or                         three days depending on how the experiment is                         programmed.
After two days post infiltration, users can get leaf                         disks from N.benthamiana using a hole punch. It is                         recommended to take the maximum agroinfiltrated"

Aim: To test the prepared chemocompetent E.Coli- cells.
Results:
Plate with kanamycin: no colonys (as expected)
Plate with ampicillin: no colonys (as expected)
Plate with tetracyclin: full (as expected, due to natural resistance)
Plate with chloramphenicol: 12 colonies (not expected, should be empty)
The plating on a chloramphenicol containing plate will be repeated, at 37°C over night instead of room temperature over the weekend, because perhaps chloramphenicol is degraded by the bacteria after two days

We have widely disseminated through the Internet media, and received nearly 100 valid questionnaires. We conducted a statistical analysis of the questionnaire results, and we have got a lot of valuable information. The information worth discussing included the following four items:
Firstly, in the investigation of the degree of understanding for the harm of hyperuricemia, nearly fifty percent were not aware of it. Secondly, in the investigation of the degree of paying attention to hyperuricemia in daily life, nearly fifty percent of the participants did not pay attention to it. Integrated the previous two points, we found that the understanding degree and attention degree of the disease in patients with hyperuricemia were very scarce, which is the reason why we have published the Handbook of Hyperuricemia and held the Exhibition in Chengdu Public Library.
Thirdly, in the investigation of how they felt about dietary control in patients with hyperuricemia, over fifty percent of them felt painful, which also reflected dietary control had a great impact on the quality of life of patients, and reducing dietary control will be more appropriate to the needs of patients.
Fourthly, in the investigation of views and opinions on new drugs or new therapies for hyperuricemia patients that they were most concerned about, more than half of the patients believed that efficacy and safety were the most important. We attached great importance to these points, and we integrated the needs of patients into the improvement of our project. We will seriously consider the importance of improving the consuming efficiency of uric acid by engineering bacteria, prolonging the time of colonization, and reducing the adverse reactions such as immune rejection caused by engineering bacteria, so as to strengthen the efficacy and safety of intestinal part of our project.

The bind rune should reveal not only the contents already shown by the four letters, but is supposed to reveal more. In the case of iGEM, it's ""M"", Mannaz, mankind. The rune Mannaz is composed of two Isa, one Gebo, one Ehwaz, and one Uruz, one Dagaz.
Mannaz as the combination of the four contents, who'd have thought! I mean, could it be just an accident? Human kind? What does it ultimately have to do with human kind other than a small branch called ""human practice""? But then again, synthetic biology, especially the iGEM synthetic biologists, do seem to adopt a very humanistic attitude, and synthetic biology is ultimately made by human and made for human.
The new runes, Uruz, ""ox"", and Dagaz, ""day"", respectively symbolises for life force and breakthrough.[13]
So far for the interpretation; I don't want to make any silly prophets by drawing a close-ended conclusion. I have lain the materials, the rest are for the reader to synthesize.
4. A Comprehensive Description of Our Project.
The front pattern of our team uniform is composed of the four letters of iGEM, and by drawing them with a bit of mutation in shape, we get a pattern that also describes our project well.In our project we designed rewirable circuits, it's a system that consists of three parts, the input device, the information processing device, and the output device. In the input device we used the recombinase system, in the processing device the main idea is rewiring the gene regulatory relationship of network motifs, and in the output device we utilised different fluorescence to see if the rewiring is successful.

Input Device, G ""G"" is designed to be the input device, drawn as a recombinase. The right side of the enzyme is a natural shape of Kenaz, symbolise the torch, the creative fire, the catalysis of change, it connects the touching point that is at the center of ""E"" and ""M"".

What’ the feedbacks?
 
 
What do we think and do?
 
    These feedbacks are the epitome of wonder and concern about synthetic biology. The old rejected things that may change their life instinctively, and were very serious about biosafety. The teacher welcomed the new idea of synthetic biology, and want to help the students to expand their horizon. The high school student were curious about what synthetic biology can do, and want to know more about the details. And the kids’ curiosity for synthetic biology was sparked(though they may not know the whole meaning).
 
    We carefully explained the safety problem synthetic biology concerned to the old, and realized it is the first problem that synthetic biology should settled down, in order to apply it to reality. However, some problems of biosafety are easy to settle, while others are hard to make it clear. But what we can do is to improve the safety of our biological machine. And we decided to use less proper nouns while talking to the old and emphasis on the success that synthetic biology have achieved, in order to make them feel freer and easier to accept the idea. And we are very pleased to know that the idea of synthetic biology is valued by most of the public from the dialogue.
 
    What’s more, we found that our methods of attracting attention were useful, but it seemed that we need some other methods to help us to explain the project and synthetic biology. So we designed a software version and a mechanical version (using circuit board) of the biological cipher machine and use it to introduce our project to the public. And a series of postcards with codes that could be deciphered with the software came out, too.
 
    In addition to what we have done to meet the requirements of the silver medal, we attended a national famous skill sharing activity in China, Oneyouth Talk.
    We presented our work and introduced synthetic biology to the public. And after the presentation was over, many people talked to us, and gave some valuable feedbacks. There was also a fair in the location of the Talk for people to sell some interesting made by themselves. We sold our postcards with codes there, using the software to help them to decode the information, which helped a lot to explain our project.

Biological Photography
We exist, live and enjoy life because we love and cherish beauty. Thus, inventors, scientists and artists all attempted to create a surviving photograph to keep the beauty permanently. And back in the history carefully, we will see their extraordinary works that haven't existed in the past. Their innovative ideas and diligent spirits guided us to build something new to please everybody, to let them see the beauty of nature.
Heliography - Earliest Photographing
Fig.1
Heliography, which means 'sun drawing', was developed by a French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce (1765-1833). This was widely regarded as the origin of permanent photographs from nature in history. Firstly, workers need to prepare Bitumen of Judea, a kind of natural asphalt which could become less soluble when it had been left exposed to light dissolved in lavender oil that let hardened areas remained. Then coated it onto metal. After that, let the metal put out in direct sunlight. Finally, using solvent to rinse away the unhardened bitumen so that the picture will kept on the board everlastingly.
Daguerreotype - Earilest Widely Used
Fig.2
Daguerreotype, the first imaging technology to come into widespread use, was named after his father Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre (1787-1851), a painter who introduced the technology in 1839. To photograph a picture contains several procedures:
Manufacture a plate formed on a highly polished silver surface with copper substrate.
Eliminate all contamination and tarnish using a buff with rotten stone or velvet and then swab the surface with nitric acid.
Let the silver surface exposed to halogen fume, normally iodine fume.
Carry the plate to the camera in a light-tight plate holder, then expose to the picture in proper time and finally artist will get latent image.
Develop the latent image by heated mercury fume in a purpose-made developing box.
Fix the plate with a sodium thiosulfate so that the light sensitivity will be"

The protein is formed by the sgsE gene, has a calculated mass of 93.7 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.1. When isolated, SgsE maintains its ability to self-assemble, and in dependence of salt concentration, duration of dialysis to remove the detergent and its amino acid sequence, it builds up five types of self-assembly products. These products are formed like flat sheets and cylinders ( Schäffer et al., 2007 ).
Expression in E. coli
The sgsE gene under the control of a T7 / lac promoter (<partinfo>K525303</partinfo>) was fused to mCitrine ( BBa_J18931 ) using Freiburg BioBrick assembly for characterization experiments.
The SgsE|mCitrine fusion protein was overexpressed in E. coli KRX after induction of T7 polymerase by supplementation of 0.1 % L-rhamnose and 1 mM IPTG using the autoinduction protocol by Promega.
Figure 1: Growth curve of E. coli KRX expressing the fusion protein of SgsE and mCitrine with and without induction, cultivated at 37 °C in autoinduction medium with and without inductor, respectively. A curve depicting KRX wildtype is shown for comparison. After induction at approximately 4 h the OD600 of the induced <partinfo>K525305</partinfo> clearly falls behind when compared to the uninduced culture. Both cultures grow significantly slower than KRX wildtype probably due to a leaky promoter and metabolic stress by the high copy plasmid.
Figure 2: RFU to OD600 ratio of E. coli KRX expressing the fusion protein of SgsE and mCitrine with and without induction. A curve depicting KRX wildtype is shown for comparison. After induction at approximately 4 h the RFU to OD600 ratio starts to rise in the induced culture. Compared to the uninduced culture the ratio is roughly four times higher. The KRX wildtype shows no variation in the RFU to OD600 ratio.

The concept of our idea is to strengthen the bio-pattern formation in augmented reality which means we are trying to make control of the bio-pattern by computer paths and systems. The pattern formation has been a significant research field in synthetic biology over the past 50 years,there were several major breakthroughs on the mechanism of the form of biology. Many scientific research teams are trying to verify and understand these theoretical models with the idea of synthetic loop.   In the meanwhile, we also considered what bio-pattern formation could be applied for and how bio-pattern formation could influence our lives. Moreover, we did other work to help our project. And we also do some outreach activities to raise public understanding of our project.
Education
In order to use the opportunity of working and learning with students to the maximum, we hosted a freshman reception to the college of life, science and technology in Huazhong Agricultural University. In which we give a introduction of the bio-pattern formation and synthetic biology, we gave a invitation for the students to visit the HZAU-China Laboratory in the same time. And introduced them the handbook we wrote this year.
Public Engagement
HZAU-China took part in calculating system biology conference which hosted by the college of science in Huazhong Agricultural University on March,2016. The conference lasted 3 days and talked about the bio-power system and the synthetic biology. We helped the meeting to conduct smoothly and discussed some topics about synthetic biology and questions of our project this year with the expert and professors who participated the conference.
Dialogue
Our team has always been looking for chances to communicate with various student associations and activities. This year, we host the “One-Thousand Question”program together with the student union of the the college of life, science and technology in Huazhong Agricultural University. “One-Thousand Question” program is aimed at the communication between the professors and the undergraduate students and this is the seventh program carried in the college. During which we talked about the learning methods and how to gain a better understanding of the synthetic biology.

Knockout designs in our project
Pex 9
Pex9 is a recently discovered import receptor for PTS1 proteins, which is induced by oleate and is an import receptor for both malate synthase isoenzymes Mls1p and Mls2p. In order to get a completely empty reaction room, a Pex9 knockout was designed to prevent unintended protein import.
Pex 31 & Pex 32
It has been shown that knockouts of Pex31 and Pex32 leads to an increased Peroxisomal size, but additionally the membrane permeability was affected ( Zhou et al. 2016 ). This effect can be used as a tool for engineering membrane permeability by knocking out or overexpress both genes. A knockout would lead to an increased permeability and one could think of an opposite effect in case of overexpression, but this has not been shown yet.
INP1
The INP1 knockout was designed after the skype call of Prof Dueber, who recommended us, decoupling of peroxisomes from cytoskeleton in order to improve the secretion efficiency. INP1 is responsible for the tethering of peroxisome, which would inhibit the secretion of peroxisomes.

CellML
CellML is a language which stores and exchanges computer-based mathematical models. It is an open standard based on the XML markup language, and is being developed by the Auckland Bioengineering Institute at the University of Auckland. To develop models in CellML we used the COR and OpenCell programs.
The Newcastle team used CellML for their Gold award winning project last year, so we have decided to once again use this technology.
JSim
To bridge the gap between agent based models (Java) and cellular models (CellML), the Newcastle team are using a software product called JSim, developed by the University of Washington.
Models developed
The following are models which we have developed using CellML:

ETH_Zurich,2013,Team:ETH Zurich#Human_-_-_TEXT.html,". To win the game there are different strategies. In a first step, the automaton is trained to a certain strategy through addition of input oligonucleotides. Following the training, the automaton is able to pursuit the right strategy and wins. This programmable molecular automaton again illustrated the potential of synthetic biological systems.
These two in vitro examples show that logic games with a mathematical background can be used to benchmark biological systems on different characteristics like modularity, programmability or robustness that will be very important when it comes to concrete applications for synthetic biological circuits. The examples were mainly part of basic proof-of-concept research. Nowadays concrete applications and much more complex systems are in the focus of interest. Nevertheless we think that today’s research results could also be used for game implementations, something we head for with our Colisweeper project.
Games as research tools
The examples we will list here are all part of a rather recent development not only in synthetic biology, but also in other fields of research. Some problems in synthetic biology are still difficult to solve computationally, due to lack of correct algorithms or computing capacity. Dividing such tasks among a large number of people who do not necessarily have to come from a scientific background is an innovative approach referred to as crowdsourcing and distributed computing. There are a lot of examples available using different approaches. Some projects like Rosetta rely on distributing computing capacity only [7]. People can download the necessary programs from the webpage and thus allow the project to make use of the capacity of their computer whenever they are not using it. This is a passive way for people to participate and contribute to science, whereas the following examples require active participation of the people involved. The term gamification of synthetic biology is used, which means that game thinking and game mechanics can be used to engage users and solve problems from a non-game context [8]. A question or a challenge can be packed into an appealing game to motivate people to take part and help solving problems without getting rewarded directly.  We want to present some recent examples where tasks from synthetic biology have been gamified to be able to use not only the computing capacity, but also the creativity and puzzle solving abilities of a large number of people.
Figure 1. The protein folding game Foldit[11]
In 2008 Foldit, an online puzzle game about protein folding was released, initiated by the University of Washington’s Center for Game Science at the department of computer science and engineering together with the Baker group at the department of biochemistry. In the game, players try to predict the structures of proteins according to three basic rules: “pack the protein”,"
Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Extras#Brainstorming_-_-_TEXT.html,"ulose. A recent paper has studied the synergistic properties of cellulases from Reticulitermes flavipes. Three enzymes were studied, two cellulases and a laccase. The cellulases were 1 β-glucosidase and Cell-1 (a GHF9 endoglucanase). The phenol-oxidizing laccase that is involved in lignin degradation is LacA.
Cell-1 and β-glu showed >300-fold and >70-fold increases in glucose production (when degrading pine sawdust and beechwood xylan) when combined.
When Lac-6 was added in the pine saw-dust experiment, glucose production rate decreased. The authors say that this is likely due to the process of end-product inhibition on β-glu.
However, glucose production increased when all three enzymes were used on beechwood xylan. Lac-6 enhances glucose release from hemicellulose by cellulases?
Microcrystalline cellulose results were nearly identical to sawdust.
The idea of this project is to use bacteria to express Lac-6, β-glu and Cell-1 in order to produce monosaccharides from other sources of biomass such as wood. It has recently been discovered that these termite derived cellulases have synergetic properties. Therefore I postulate that future effective biomass conversion will rely on obtaining the most efficient mixtures of enzymes.
Lignin (the material hardest to digest) releases pentoses (like xylose and arabinose). Since sawdust degradation by the three enzymes works best when only Cell-1 and β-glu are used whereas all three enzymes gave the largest production rate when degrading beechwood xylan, I propose the construction of a module that will allow the bacteria to produce the most efficient enzyme mixtures depending on the rate of glucose production. This circuit might make it possible to digest complex mixtures of materials most efficiently. The bacteria used should also ideally only use an alternative carbon source to glucose.

When a steady culture media flows through, a stable shear force field could be formed. By controlling the pumped-inflow rate using syringe pump, we could also directly determine the properties of the force field(e.g. Intensity). Each time we applied a constant pumped inflow, cells in 3 different observation tunnel (0.285mm of width, 0.090mm of height) could receive corresponding force of 3 levels---small, middle, large(1: 9: 81). This is realized with the carful design of sequential channel branching and branching length. By changing the pumped flow rate, we could measure MS channel’s response under a series of forces and 3 levels magnitudes at a time. Another aspect of the design is that the three channels form an observation region match the microscopy parameters for simultaneous measurements of calcium signal dynamics, and. The third consideration is that the observation region are close to the inlet so that all the cells received the fresh culture media.
Fig. 1 Microfludic Channels Concept Map
Mathematical Analysis
During our experiment, when fluid(culture media x flowed through the tunnel, the shear force was applied on a thin layer close to the wall. The culture medium can be treated as a Newtonian flow with a constant viscosity μ,0.012dyn·s/cm2 [7] . The shear stress that medium generated on the wall is proportional to strain rate. As a result, we could relate the magnitude of stress to the velocity gradient along the transversal surface of each tunnel.
Due to the extremely small scale of microfluidic channel (only 0.285mm of width and 0.090mm of height), fluid in it exists as the Laminar flow. Turbulent flow is not possible within the physiological range of flow speed, even at the corners. The head loss of the pumped inflow is also negligible in our experiment. The modeling of flow between 2 parallel plates applies to such stable state, in which the magnitude of shear stress on the bottom is proportional to the maximum velocity (shown as the longitudinal central line in Fig. 2).
As the shear stress is proved proportional to the flow rate in the tunnel, we designed the chip to achieve that each of 3 tunnels in observation area has the same transversal surface but the gradient (81: 9: 1 from up to bottom) flow rate, also the average speed, as shown in Fig. 3

Description
The threat posed by antibiotic resistant bacteria is a pressing issue which must be addressed. It is difficult and expensive to develop new antibiotics, so our project is designed to make currently available antibiotics useful again. Our aim is to create     a toolkit to re-sensitise pathogens to antibiotics using CRISPR and a two-phage system, based on work by Yosef et al. (2015, doi:10.1073/pnas.1500107112). An engineered lysogenic phage will transfer a CRISPR system to its host bacterium,     designed to cleave resistance genes and also confer protection from an engineered lytic phage. When this lytic phage is added to the population, it kills any bacteria that have not been successfully re-sensitised. We chose to target genes found in     the highly-resistant ESKAPE pathogens, and worked with 4 different phages - P1, λ (lambda), T4 and T7. Our system was modelled in silico and tested empirically on a specially designed E. coli testing platform.
Antibiotic Resistance
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose an enormous threat to our current way of life. Antibiotic resistance already causes over 700,000 deaths per year, and this number is expected to rise to a terrifying 10 million per year by 2050 (Figure 1) (O’Neill,     2014). A solution to this problem is urgently needed and we believe that synthetic biology could be the key, which is why we chose to tackle antibiotic resistance with our iGEM project.
Antibiotic resistance can arise in a number of ways, such as spontaneous mutations or horizontal gene transfer. When a population is exposed to antibiotics, susceptible individuals are killed and any resistant bacteria survive to repopulate the niche.     Every time a population is exposed to an antibiotic, a selection pressure is applied and resistant bacteria dominate the population (Levy, 1998).
Two of the major factors contributing to the rise of resistant bacteria are the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Examples of overuse include the prescription of antibiotics in cases where the infection is minor and will clear up"

A guide on presenting an iGEM project
--An interpretation of the Bloom’s Taxonomy from an iGEM perspective
For both integrated human practice and public engagement & education, the first step is to let your audience outside your laboratory—your industry stakeholders or the residents from your neighborhood to understand what your project is about. In that way , the presenting of the iGEM project, serving as the start point of a successful communication, is the basis of a successful human practice.
As an active participant of iGEM conferences, our team this year gained a lot of experience in presenting an iGEM project to a larger audience. So we decided to go further in this part and develop a a theory around it, so that all the teams can benefit from it. During our preparation for presentations and also audience for other teams, we have felt the strong resemblance between presenting an iGEM project and education practice. So, with the hope of finding the perfect model for a typical iGEM presentation, we explored education theories and finally came up with a ‘iGEM presentation taxonomy’ briefly illustrated in the figure bellow.
The iGEM presentation taxonomy is an interpretation of the original version of the Bloom’s taxonomy and also a revised version of the Bloom’s taxonomy by Robert J. Marzano . We carefully dealt with the difference between presenting an project to people from different major background and teaching classes in a classroom by revising the highest level of the taxonomy.  At the same time, we adopted the first several levels from the original cognitive domain, with the belief that these basic principles of how human beings know about the outside world can be applied to any information processing procedure at the onset. We also rewrote the situations defining each levels of the taxonomy, giving it a completely new interpretation aimed specifically at iGEM project presentation.
We hope that these works may lead to a better understanding of"

Diffusion
The deactivation reaction of ampicillin through beta-lactamase is a diffusion-controlled reaction. An equation that considers the rate at which the reactants diffuse is needed (Atkins and De Paula 2010):
Figure 3: Diffusion of two proteins without consideration of an active centrum.
This equation describes the general diffusion of two molecules (figure 3).  But in our case the enzyme beta-lactamase only reacts with ampicillin, if its active centrum is in close proximity to ampicillin (figure 4 B).  When beta-lactamase and ampicillin meet correctly, ampicillin is deactivated as shown in figure 4, section B to D. Section E indicates a wrong encounter of beta-lactamase and ampicillin. That's why we decided to modify the equation according to (Bisswanger 2008):

After some consideration (see above), decided to follow a modification of this protocol.  To the reaction mixture I will add 5 uL 10x buffer, 44.5 uL gel extract and 0.5 uL CIAP.  Note that final concentration of CIAP was 0.01u/uL.
Incubated this reaction for 31 mins at 37 degrees C.  Added another 0.5uL of CIAP and then put into incubator again for ~32 mins.  Put on heating block at 70 degrees C for 10 minutes to denature the enzyme activity.
After this was completed, went straight into the ethanol precipitation.  It was quite evident that this was necessary due to the low concentration of DNA in both tubes (J63001 and J63002).
Need to make 3 M sodium acetate for the ethanol precipitation.
MW of sodium acetate trihydrate = 136.08 g/mol
For 10mL, this translates into 3 M * 0.010 L = 0.030 mol
0.030 mol * 136.08 g/ mol =  4.0824 g sodium acetate trihydrate dissolved in 10 mL water
Weighed out 4.0826g sodium acetate trihydrate and dissolved in 10 mL of solution.
To each tube, which contained roughly 50 uL, added 3 volumes of 100% ethanol (150uL) as well as 20uL of 3M sodium acetate (which was 1/10 the volume of the DNA and the ethanol combined).  Also added 1 uL of Glyco Blue.  Incubated in -80 degree C freezer for 1 hour, then spun in centrifuge that had been placed in the fridge (since a cold centrifuge was specified).  Spun first tube at 13000 rpm, which was possibly too much.  Spun second tube at 8000 rpm.  After centrifuging, removed the supernatant, allowed the tubes to air dry, and then resuspended in 20 uL of distilled water.
After the ethanol precipitation, it was discovered that the new concentrations were as follows:
J63001: 17.6 ng/uL
J63002: 15.5 ng/uL

20th October, 2009
Today we discussed about the results of the delay device and how to interpret them. Domenico made a nice checklist for wiki. Tim Weenink was made responsible for Judging form. Daniel was made responsible for designing the poster and printing it. Tim Vos was made responsible for presentation planning and he is decided to do the introduction during presentation in Jamboree. We also enjoyed a nice apple pie made by Esengul!!!!
9th October, 2009
We had a very short meeting today also. We have planned for only orange colored sweaters. For Tim weenink his sequencing results failed and on analysing his endonuclease gene he found that it has an un-published LVA tag which he think his endonuclease's functionality. Sriram planned his experiments with the control he has constructed and this is the last chance to characterize the Delay Device. The LacI generator he constructed was found to be not correct in sequence. Hence the experiments he did previously were useless. Hence he is going to continue the experiments with the GFP expressing control since to characterize the delay device relative expression will be sufficient.
2nd October, 2009
Today we had a short meeting. Calin joined us through Skype. We unfortunately didn't get sponsorship from Gementee Delft. So Esengul suggested she will try Qiagen, Invitrogen and other kit distributors in Netherlands for sponsorship. All the team members were advised to put their comments for wiki in forum. Daniel was chosen as the person to take responsibility of the poster both in Netherlands and US. Domenico suggested that a new menu link of targets achieved which will be very important for judging.

With gas chomatography the amount of PHB inside the cells can be determined. In order to do this, PHB standards containing 2 mg of pure PHB were created to compare and determine the amount of PHB in the tested cell samples. Cell samples of 20 mg were analysed and quadruplets of both standards and samples were made.
The area under the curve illustrates the amount of analyzed  material at the respective time. The amount of PHB in the figure is significantly lower in the tested cell sample than observed for the standard sample containing 2 mg pure PHB. The observation indicates that there is less than 2 mg PHB in the tested cell sample. When the data was normalized according to the methyl benzoate standard, it showed that there were 0.7 mg PHB in 20 mg cell sample. This corresponds to 3.5% of the cell mass being PHB. With this value we can determine the yield for the methods of extraction (Table 4).

Quantitative proteome analysis of panK expressing cells - iTRAQ analysis ( Top )
In 2015 Stanford Brown increased PHB production 23% by introducing staphylococcal pantothenate kinase II to PHB producing E. coli. The purpose is to increase intracellular levels of acetyl-CoA used as substrate for PHB production. We investigated the proteomic effect of expressing the panK in E. coli cells to characterize the BioBrick. To do so, we used iTRAQ analysis which allowed us to compare the proteomes of E. coli and E. coli expressing panK cells. The iTRAQ labelling was only partial, resulting in compromised data. However, the up- and down regulation of several proteins, was identified in the cells where pantothenate kinase II was expressed. In the MS/MS analysis a total of 2402 proteins was identified in our"
Fudan,2017,Team:Fudan China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," of cellular memory devices
The ideal cellular memory devices are able to record stimulus exposure in the DNA circuits of the cells and express desired gene. This feature gives much potential to the cells.
The cellular memory devices can record transient conditions and embed them in the circuits permanently to express genes. Once activated and stimulated, the cells are capable of storing the information to be accessed later. Some tough environmental detection tasks can be carried out in this way where the subject or target environment is harmful to humans or impracticable to place detecting machines. Also, some biological pathways and feedbacks deserve to be analyzed in vivo to better understand the human body, such as cell differentiation, tissue formation and malfunction of some organs.
In addition, information stored stably in the DNA circuits enable the cells carry out certain functions. In the biotechnical industry, cellular memory significantly reduces the consumption of inducers by a large scale, and maintain producing proteins for a longer time. Moreover, we can use the cells with stable memory to treat some diseases. The cells will be triggered by biomarkers of the disease and produce functional proteins chronologically.
Project overview - Developing the concept of cellular memory
It seems that a new era of highly developed cellular information processing methods is approaching. It is so exciting that existing memory devices are diverse and useful in various conditions, but we find that they can only record the static state at the instant the recording action happens. Therefore, they are unable to monitor the dynamic changing process of one signal.
This year, we want to develop the concept of cellular memory, and to realize the monitoring of one changing signal.Namely, we want to record the different concentrations of one single inducer at different time periods.  So, we designed a unique memory device, MemOrderY , with sequential memory structure using integrases. After measuring the orthogonality and efficiency of our recombinases, we try to engineer our E. coli population to record several static states of the target signals at different time points (Fig.5 a).

This circuit contains three parts: logic gates, sequential memory structures and basic orthogonal memory modules. The logic gates sense two signals. One is the signal we want to"

The cultures were incubated at 37 °C with shaking (225 rpm) until the OD600 reached a value of approximately 1. The plasmids were isolated following the ZR Plasmid MiniprepTM protocol and the quantity and quality of the products were measured by the Nanodrop. The miniprepped products were then diluted to a final concentration of 50 ng/μL for each of the samples. 10 μL diluted mutated dCas9-pSB1C3 plasmid and 10 μL diluted RRvT-pSB1C3 plasmid was plated on the 96-well plate to be shipped to iGEM Headquarters. The samples were left to air dry in the fume hood until the next day.

18th - 22nd June 2012 Exhibition of our project at the ACHEMA
The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) had invited the Hessian iGEM teams to the ACHEMA in Frankfurt. The ACHEMA is the largest exhibition on Chemical Engineering, Environmental Protection and Biotechnology and offered the teams a wide range of interested audience during the presentation of their projects. At the booth of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the teams of Darmstadt, Frankfurt und Marburg were able to present their projects. The Darmstadt team could not only inspire the audience with posters, but also with a presentation as well as many flyers for their project. Laymen, scientists and companies could be convinced by the project ""Next Generation Recycling"" of the Technical University of Darmstadt. The contact to the other iGEM teams from Hessia was of course promoted and it was possible to replace the content and progress of the projects. The project offers in the area of environmental protection many approaches, so it was not surprising that the German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU) was interested in the project. Members of the DBU stayed a long time for intensive discussions at the booth. To conclude, the ACHEMA offered the team an exciting platform on which they could perform a ""reality check"" of their project. The interesting discussions with members of economy and science showed them the deep meaning of their project and point out that the iGEM Team of Darmstadt is on a good path.
28th June 2012 3rd Annual Meeting of Strategic Process Biotechnology 2020+
The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) had invited all German iGEM teams to the 3rd Annual Meeting of Strategic Process Biotechnology 2020+ to participate. The German teams had the opportunity to see each other for the first time. The conference was attended by representatives from academia, industry and other research institutes. The aim of the conference was to generate new interdisciplinary cooperation that give rise to new ways in the field of biotechnology in Germany. The iGEM teams occurred as proponents of new minds and ideas of the future. Representatives of the iGEM team of Darmstadt had to meet economic and scientific questions from the audience about their project. At a panel discussion it became clear that the conscious use of resources and especially the recovery of these in Germany have to play an important role in the future. The Darmstadt iGEM team became clear that their project had met"

Figure 2: The top row shows centrifuge tubes containing the 4-nitrohenol ester reaction mixture for the palmitate (a) and octanoate (b) esters with no cells added. The middle row shows the response for a negative control where DH5⍺ cells without any plasmid were added to reaction mixtures containing 4-nitrophenyl-plamitate (c) or 4-nitrophenyl-octanoate (d). The bottom row shows the response for the BBa_K2694000 circuit transformed into DH5⍺ cells when added to reaction mixtures containing 4-nitrohenyl-plamitate (e) or 4-nitrophenyl-octanoate (f). All reaction mixtures were 1mM of the nitrophenyl ester with 1% v/v Triton X-100 in 0.1M pH 7 phosphate buffer.
From these results, we concluded that our bacteria was indeed cleaving the substrates, resulting in the green color. The clear control remained in the controls, showing that it was our part specifically that was inducing this change.
Quantitative Testing
Once we had shown that our bacteria could cleave the substrates to some extent, we wanted to try to show this more quantitatively. In collaboration with the University of Calgary’s iGEM team, we designed an experiment to test our reaction in a time course, using their spectrophotometer, in order to more accurately determine the color change.

Once we had the answers (more than 20 to be representative), we filled the different tables which compose Kano model to obtain the results. Here you can download the document with the tables and what is most important, the conclusions we extracted from them:
KANO RESULTS
Overall conclusions
Last but not least, a table summarizing why Kano model is important and should be implemented in future iGEM projects.
Table 1. Conclusions of Kano model use in Printeria.
Kano model results conclusions
Kano model is an strong tool to include feedback in your project
Kano model rank needs by customer/user satisfaction
Kano model prevents wasting money and time implementing unnecessary needs
Kano model allows you to combine public engagement and integrated practices
Kano model allows you to explain why something was designed or not
Expert feedback
A very good way to enrich the project through feedback is to do so by consulting experts in the field of study as has been done previously in iGEM. Their opinion is really relevant because of the reputation that precedes them, and that adds value to the product/project.
That is why we have decided to contact renowned artists and sciencists from the world of bioart and biotecnology to present them our project and seek advice. Next section describes who we have reached out and how their opinions have changed Printeria.

WOMEN IN SCIENCE
This year, chance has brought together 8 girls and only girls to create the 2016         IGEM Toulouse team. This peculiar and quite funny situation has somehow triggered our thinking         about the actual position of women in Science, specially taking into account that our principal         supervisors are only men…
Results of a vast survey on the role of women in scientific research conducted by the Boston Consulting Group were published in March 2014 in the European Union, show that only 11% of the highest academic posts are occupied by women in science subjects. The percentage of women heads of scientific institutions varies from one country to another: only 6% in Japan, 27% in the US, 29% in France or 34% in Spain. Clearly, women are underrepresented in scientific professions.
Nevertheless, these percentages are slowly increasing, mainly because women are fighting for to reach the goal that the parity would be respected in all levels of society. Regarding specifically the scientific area, many women have raised the flag of parity such as Caroline Herschel, the first woman recognized as scientist but also the first one to publish a scientific paper in 1786 about the discovery of a comet, or such as Marie Curie who obtained two Nobel prizes in physics and chemistry. However, efforts are still needed for a much fair treatment of women in order to grant full equality in all countries around the world.
In the left: Caroline Herschel , in the right: Marie Curie
Thus today, what is happening is that only 8 young women are involved in the iGEM adventure in Toulouse. Actually the selection to be part of the team was made based on the skill and motivation of the student and not on his gender. At the end of the selection process, it turned out that the most appropriate candidates were all women! Not to say, we are quite proud of the results!
We are of course aware of the statistical study from the 2013 iG"
SDU-CHINA,2018,Team:SDU-CHINA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," applied in industrial fermentation and lab fermentation is of great difference. In labs, we commonly use nutrient-rich culture medium such as LB or other culture medium with glucose as carbon source. This kind of culture medium looks transparent that allows light to go through the liquid and reach the bacteria. So that we can easily operate the light-induced system. However, in a factory, engineered bacteria should be cultured in seed medium before getting into the fermentation medium. Seed medium is used to expand the scale of the seed bacteria so the nutrient inside is rich to accelerate the growth of bacteria. Seed medium sounds like the culture medium we use in our lab. Fermentation medium, although, contains the basic nutrient carbon source; nitrogen source; inorganic salts; water and growth factors, it also needs precursors and promoters. Precursors and promoters are required to promote the production of products. Besides, we need to concern about the efficiency that the bacteria take carbon and nitrogen source into usage. When bacteria take nutrient at a relative low speed, bacteria growth will slow down and energy will be stored for the next fermentation. Moreover, the composition in fermentation medium is not precise in chemicals, the raw materials of fermentation often come from wastes from other industries to low down the cost, and usually the raw materials are commonly insoluble, which means there will be solid particles inside the medium, causing shading inside fermenters. In this case what we need is to optimize fermentation medium. To achieve optimization of culture medium, the ratio between fast-usage carbon/nitrogen source and slow-usage carbon/nitrogen source should be proper considering the balance between growth and production, C/N should also be suitable for fermentation with different types of engineered bacteria, and the source of raw material much be accessible with a low cost.
2. industrialized engineered bacteria
    A type of engineered bacteria born in lab should meet some requirements so it can live in a fermenter and do its duty.
    First of all, high efficiency of production is required for engineered bacteria. Not only the engineered bacteria should be efficient in producing products, but the efficiency of purification is also important. Purification of intracellular products is much more difficult than that of extracellular products, for the reason that cell lysis is the prerequisite of purification and there are lots of other proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, and even if lipids. So engineered bacteria producing extracellular product will increase the profits dramatically.
Secondly, the compatibility between culture medium and chassis should be tested before industrial fermentation. Normally, chassis used for fermentation including E. coli, Bacillus, yeast and fungi must be compatible with the culture medium"

IIT_Kharagpur,2015,Team:IIT Kharagpur#practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". While IISER   Pune wishes to compete in the Health and Medicine track of iGEM, IIT Delhi wishes to compete   in the environment track. IIT Delhi also made a very descriptive presentation of their idea, which   was appreciated by the audience. After each of the team presentations (which typically lasted   about an hour), there were question­answer sessions held, where the clarity and idea of each of   the teams’ projects were scrutinized. Very useful suggestions and points were raised for each of the teams post their  presentations, and all the discussions (both formal and informal) were very productive and   propitious for the teams, in general. We learnt a lot about iGEM through this meetup, got to meet   a lot of people, and are confident that the advice and suggestions given during this meetup would   definitely help us give this first attempt at iGEM our best shot.
NCTU Meetup:July 19­23, 2015
This was the third time NCTU organized its own meetup, and this time, it kept it open for all the   Asian iGEM teams. It was organized on a pretty grand scale with 30 teams (from countries like   Taiwan, China, India, etc) participating in it. The two Indian teams participating in this meetup   were IISER Pune and IIT Kharagpur. The option was given to teams to either go and attend the   meetup in person, or to present their ideas via video conferencing (Skype). Accordingly, our   team went ahead with the second option, and was allocated a video conference slot for the   evening (Taiwan Time) of the third day of the NCTU Meetup (21st July). The main idea behind our team’s participation in this meetup was to get advice and   suggestions from experienced iGEM teams with regard to our project ­ wet lab, policy and   practices (social outreach, meetups, collaborations, lab visits), modelling and so on. The format   of the online conference was 20 minutes for the presentation and 20 minutes for the question and   answer session. Harsheel, one of the senior members of our team gave the presentation of our   project idea, and the questions that followed (which were pitched by the audience gathered at the   seminar room in NCTU, Taiwan) were tackled by some of the senior members of the team, as a   whole. Very valid questions were raised by the audience, and many useful suggestions were   given with regard to how we could improvise our presentation for the Giant J"

OVERVIEW
Figure 1. Our project combined the four elements together: light, sound, odor, color. And the process was divided to three parts: sound to light, light to color, light to odor.
Our project retold the nightingale and the rose [1]using the tool of synthetic biology. In the story, the nightingale song all night under the cold moonlight, stained and scented the flower by its blood. We picked out four elements—sound, light, color and odor from the original story and combined them together. In our project,  E. coli needed light and sound as inputs to produce color and odor as outputs. The process was mainly divided into three parts: sound to light, light to color, and light to odor. The light-color and light-odor conversions were achieved with the RGB system[2] which was based on the phage RNAP system as a resource allocator. As for the sound-light conversion, we developed a software that allowed users to upload their own music to generate their unique dynamic pictures, with which people could color and ‘ensoul’ their own roses.
SOUND TO LIGHT
The sound-light conversion was achieved by our software—Orpheus. First of all, users could choose an image file and an audio file stored in their computer. Then Orpheus would graying the inputted image and carefully decoded the inputted audio into wave shapes. After that a series of spots would be generated with corresponding hue and brightness on the image.   For hue, Orpheus first decoded sound into wave shapes and analyzed its low, medium and high volume"

Measurement
First, we used logarithmic phase (log phase) bacteria to measure their fluorescence by using flow cytometry. Log phase bacteria are in the best phase of growing so that its data outcome would be the most accurate and valuable. After transforming the bacteria into LB medium and incubate overnight (for 8-12 hours) at 37°C, the medium is diluted 196-fold and incubated for 3 hours; then the bacteria is diluted 700-fold with fresh M9+Glycerol medium or sodium thiosulfate to reach log phase, then we use flow cytometry to measure the fluorescent intensity.
Second, in order to examine the effect of mixing the outcome color of our bacteria with human excrement, we used curry to simulate the excrement, with different color depth simulating different kinds of excrements. This is much more safe and friendly because we no longer need to get in touch with excrement.
Under anaerobic condition, GFP is difficult to be maturated. So We measure sfGFP fluorescent after 1h maturation.

DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#background_-_-_TEXT.html," the unique capability to authentically process, fold and modify secreted human proteins (1). The effect of post-translationally modifications are protein stability, proper ligand binding, and reduced risk of immunogenicity (2). Most of the therapeutic proteins approved and currently in development are post-translationally modified (3). However, the genetic tools used for constructing mammalian cells vectors are based on outworn methods, and since 60-70% of all recombinant protein pharmaceuticals are produced in mammalian cells, there is a desperate need for simpler and more efficient cloning techniques (5).
The U-2 OS cell line
The U-2 OS cell line, originally known as the 2T line, is an immortalized human-derived cell line that was established in 1964. The original cells were taken from bone tissue of the tibia of a 15 year old girl suffering from osteosarcoma. An immortalized cell line has acquired the ability to proliferate indefinitely through either random mutation or modifications such as artificial expression of the telomerase gene. Several cell lines are well established as representatives of certain cell types. U-2 OS cells show epithelial adherent morphology, and no viruses have been detected in the cell line. In comparison, the HeLa cell line contains the well known HPV virus. They are also very good-looking in the microscope, and therefore U-2 OS was chosen for the proof of concept of the Plug 'n’ Play assembly standard for mammalian cells.
Transient transfection
Transient expression is the ability to express heterologous DNA during a short period of time, which allows fast production of a desired protein. A high copy number of plasmids are introduced into the cells, and expression may be transitory over a period of time until the DNA is lost from the population. This allows for protein characterization or to verify the integrity, functionality, and the efficiency of different recombinant vectors. Production of a large amount of recombinant protein has been reported for transient expression systems at large scale. A small number of the transfected cells may incorporate the exogenous DNA into their genome by recombination leading to a stable transfection of a gene (6).

Interestingly, accumulated mutations in the hypervariable region of the agrBDCA-operon have led to four different pherotypes of S. aureus, using different AgrC-types, and producing different AIPs (AIPI, AIPII, AIPIII, AIPIV), which cross-inhibit each other and might correlate with certain diseases associated with S. aureus (5) .
For this project we used genomic DNA derived from the strain Staphylococcus aureus N315, which is a MRSA strain, belonging to the AIP-II group.
Streptococcus pneumoniae
Virulence of S. pneumoniae
All over the world, Streptococcus pneumoniae causes the life threating invasive diseases pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis. In early childhood the diplococcus colonizes the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract as a commensal bacterium. Under certain circumstances,  it gets a threat by tissue invasion.  Still up to date, not much is known regarding the mechanism behind the shifting from a colonizer organism to an invader or how S. pneumoniae is able to cross the blood-brain barrier to cause meningitis (6) . To cross the line from an opportunist to a pathogen, S. pneumoniae needs to express specific virulence factors in a coordinated way.  Apart from virulence factors like the polysaccharide capsule, the pore forming toxin pneumolysin or surface proteins like PspA and PspC, also biofilm production plays an important role for persistence in the human nasopharynx and contributes to pneumonia and meningitis (7) .
One aspect of its infectiousness is the ability to perform natural transformation. Thus, it can take up extracellular DNA containing the information for resistance against diverse antibiotics and permanently incorporate the DNA into its genome via recombination.  The main problem of treating S. pneumoniae infections is the increasing spread of ß-lactam resistance. Luckily, the molecular mechanism behind natural transformation in S. pneumoniae is the focus of current research.

Best Education & Public Engagement
We believe public engagement is important for us, iGEM and synthetic biology, so we deliberately devided public into 3 level—public, children and pre-iGEMer. We designed a Bio-Chess with both a board game and an online version. It was designed on the simple basis of genetic engineering. People can collect endonuclease and other substances and they may lose what they’ve already earned. To sitmulate children’s interest, we held ‘Gene Go’ with a series of activities such as cell structure fabrication to allow them to paticipate. Meanwhile, we organized a vivid children stage show ‘Cellulose Go’. For pre-iGEMers, the 1st iGEM Festival was held in UESTC, after games and some introduction, high school students showed strong will to join us. Please see Education & Engagement for more details.
Best Model
We are the best choice of the best model. We spend a lot of time and energy to construct our models, which played an important role in both parts of our project. For database integration, an essential work is to screen the blast results, which influences the reliability of our database directly. The most used thresholding method was proved to be unusable here, hence, we used JS divergence for feature extraction and innovatively employed logistic regression classifier with polynomial features to classify blast results, which performed pretty well. For promoter prediction, we used machine learning method to construct promoter classifier. Then, we constructed multiple classifier system to improve the performance. With large-scale search model, we can identify promoter in a large-scale sequence. With these, we constructed a promoter prediction model that can be used in both of prokaryote and eukaryote, which benefit biologists to find more promoters. Please see Model for more details.
Best Product Design
BioMaster aims at solving problems in iGEM Registry with unclear feature description of biobricks, incomplete information and the lack of biobricks. BioMaster integrates 8 traditional biological research databases. Via this database, not only can iGEMers be inspired by previous project, but they can discover more comprehensive information of biobricks beyond iGEM Registry. To make the database more user-friendly, we specially designed 4 ways to search for biobricks according to synthetic biologists’ different needs. Besides, there is a more beautiful UI surface for user to experience. Except for what mentioned above, we also use machine learning to construct a promoter prediction tool"
UMaryland,2015,Team:UMaryland#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," use these units frequently they are often specialized and tailored made to perform PCR. With this tailoring comes a high price tag that does not suit the DIY market, and so we found a solution in the form of a hairdryer. The fan and heating element of a hairdryer provide a control scheme that enables for cycling of temperature rapidly and accurately and they are relatively inexpensive. We have found that developing a housing for the PCR tubes and enabling even heat distribution is challenging. We often have found that our temperature sensor and the pcr reaction tube are not at the same temperature and degree of difference is a delta of over 10 degrees celsius. We are currently working of milling a block of aluminum with better and more consistent heat transfer properties, and modeling the heat transfer within the can. Our ambition is that this will enable better control of temperature within the device."

European Meetup
The iGEM teams of Munich (LMU & TU Munich) took the initiative to organize the European meetup of 2018. The meet-up was held from the 20th – 22nd of July at LMU Biozentrum, located on the edge of Munich. The event was split in four parts; the symposium, poster presentations, workshops and night events. With around  200 participants, a lot of posters and various lectures with different topics there was put a lot of effort in to running the congress so smoothly. The congress was an excellent opportunity to get a feeling about the different projects of the teams, the state the projects were in and to build bridges with teams for potential collaborations.

Friday
As Thursday.  We also met the iGEM president: Randy Rettberg.
Week 2 - 09/07/18
Monday
Week three has just started. Shiv, Alberto, Josh and Thom are back from the Oxford meetup.  We met Tom Ouldridge in the morning, who returned from holiday. First group problem: Lidia decided to leave the group. Everyone hopes she is coming back. Let's remember that amazing team dynamics are reached with ""Radical Truth and Radical Transparency"".  A wild Prof. Kitney appears around lunchtime: it is the first time we see him officially. We talked about the idea of patterning. He was very chill and supportive. He also proposed to have two separate wikis: a public one with limited info (so that other teams cannot copy us) and a private full one, to be published right before the freeze. He also told us when he went to holiday with his wife in China (?!). Quote of the day: ""you may have heard of me.""  Rodrigo and Tom Ouldridge came into our brainstorming room after lunch and we presented the main idea: ""PixCell: electronic control of biopatterning"". It was a constructive discussion. It's time to think about simple backup plans. What if the agar is not conductive enough and nothing works ? Rodrigo proposed that we could solve this by placing electrodes in solution and control the temporality of gene expression (perhaps of co-cultures in bioreactores to split biosynthetic pathways between different communities and prevent burden)
Tuesday
Presentation of PixCell to the centre. Kitney liked it. He suggested to think about application... think about the ""so what.."". Positive feedbacks from Tom Ellis, start thinking about the big picture: after all we want to control bacteria electronically: cybergenetics? PixCell has officially started. The game is on.  Tom Ouldridge held a brainstorming session and we assigned roles and things to do.   Lidia is back, stronger than ever. She is going to be our amazing group leader, the glue...

WashU_StLouis,2014,Team:WashU StLouis#Project#nif_-_-_TEXT.html," glucose tested, 100mM, may have been too low to aﬀect the growth of E. coli to an observable extent. Eventually, 10mM was determined to be the optimal glucose concentration for the purpose of least interference possible in solution.
NH4Cl as minimal nitrogen source was proven to be not suitable for E. coli growth at any concentration as the OD600 testing results showed that cell density didn’t change throughout the time. It was probably due to the permeability of cell membrane was limited for NH4+ and Cl- ions. Eventually Glutamate at concentration of 10mM supported cell growth the best and thus chosen as part of optimal environment condition.
With CASAmino solution’s buffering utility, the pH was controlled little bit below 7 but close to 7.
To protect the iron core of the nitrogenase, temperature of 30°C and Anaerobic were both determined not for cell growth but for nitrogenase activity testing, which is the next phase.
Phase 3: Measure nitrogen fixation activity under determined optimal conditions in E. coli strains
We used  an Acetylene Reduction Assay to examine the nitrogenase activity for JM109, BL21(DE3), Top10, DH5α at different cell density referred by OD600 values.
Acetylene (C2H2) has an triple bond similar to that of atmospheric nitrogen (N2). Because of this structural similarity, the nitrogenase enzyme can cleave the triple bond in acetylene just as it would cleave the triple bond in N2. Ethylene (C2H4) is produced from this enzymatic activity, so a gas chromatograph can be used to detect the presence of ethylene and, consequently, nitrogenase activity.

Background
Bacteriophytochrome
Phytochromes are light receptor proteins that sense the presence, intensity, duration, and direction of incident light. They are prevalent in plants as well as cyanobacteria and are used to control morphological developments, such as seed germination and flower generation in response to sunlight (Auldridge and Forest, 2011). Phytochromes are able to absorb light in the red (620-750 nm) and far-red (700-800 nm) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (Rockwell et al., 2009).
The aptly named bacteriophytochrome is present in photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic bacteria alike. Bacteriophytochromes from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Deinococcus radiodurans contain the general structure with a N-terminal harvesting domain and C-terminal stimulatory domain. There is also the structural motif: PAS-GAF-PHY-HisKinase (Ulijasz and Vierstra, 2011). Here, the PAS domain contains a chromophore binding site where biliverdin can bind and harness light. The GAF domain allows for attachment of the chromaphore and the PHY domain functions with PAS domain in mediating the correct conformational change of the chromophore (Ulijasz and Vierstra, 2011).
Biliverdin is the product of oxidation of heme B and is catalysed by heme oxygenase. This enzyme is not native to E. coli and so needs to be introduced in the bacteriophytochrome vector. A Cys residue in the bacteriophytochrome binds biliverdin within the protein.
Bacteriophytochromes are able to alternate between the two distinct forms with different activities. The phytochrome naturally exists in the inactive state (Pr) where it can absorb red light, and in this state, the absorbance"

Typical RNA-based regulators employ interaction domains consisting of30 nts, which corresponds to a sequence space of over 1018 potential regulatory elements. Thus, the sheer diversity of possible RNA-based parts suggests that previous devices have not come close to realizing the potential of highly orthogonal regulation.
Figure 5: (A and B) Design schematics of conventional riboregulators (A) and toehold switches (B). Variable sequences are shown in gray, whereas conserved or constrained sequences are represented by different colors.
Much of this discrepancy arises from the significant sequence constraints imposed on riboregulators engineered thus far (Figure1A). Like natural riboregulators, engineered riboregulators of translation have invariably used base pairing to the ribosome binding site (RBS) to prevent ribosome binding, thereby preventing translation (Callura et al., 2012; Isaacs et al., 2004; Mutaliket al., 2012; Rodrigo et al., 2012). Because repression is caused by RBS binding, trigger RNAs that activate translation are engineered to contain an RBS sequence to displace the repressing sequence, which in turn reduces the potential sequence space for the riboregulator.
Previous riboregulators have also relied on U-turn loop structures to drive loop-loop and loop-linear interactions between RNAs (Figure 1A) (Callura et al., 2012; Isaacs et al., 2004; Luckset al., 2011; Takahashi and Lucks, 2013). U-turn loops are common RNA structural motifs formed by tertiary interactions that have been identified in ribozymes, ribosomal RNAs, and transfer RNA anticodon loops (Gutell et al., 2000). Although recent work has begun to show that loops with canonical U-turn sequences are not essential for riboregulators (Mutalik et al., 2012; Rodrigoet al., 2012), the engineered systems reported to date have continued their reliance on the loop-mediated RNA interactions from natural systems. Although these loop interactions have been selected by evolution in nature"

Project Pneumosensor Abstract
Figure 1. Pneumosensor Overview Diagram
Quorem-sensing peptide CSP produced by S. pneumoniae is detected by the Detection Module; the response regulator ComE links the Detection Module to the σx Promoters Module which ultimately drives the expression of GFP.
Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths every year mostly in developing countries where vaccination      is unaffordable (World Health Organization, 2014). Current methods used for diagnosis of pneumococcal diseases include X-ray imaging of chest, PCR assay using blood and Gram stain using sputum (Muench, D. F., 2014). They require sophisticated equipments, help from physicians or laboratory settings, all of which are limited to people in third world countries. To provide an affordable solution to combat pneumococcal diseases, we are engineering an E. coli ""Pneumosensor"", that will      work inside as an in vitro diagnostic device. Such a device should provide diagnosis result in absence of laboratories, medical equipments or doctors, making it more accessible for the people. Through this cheaper and easier diagnosis method, people can prepare themselves better against the      transmission and adversity of S. pneumoniae.
Pneumosensor has a rewired comCDE signal transduction pathway native to S. pneumoniae that detects     autoinducer molecules released specifically by S. pneumoniae. Upon detection of Streptococcus pneumonia, Pneumosensor will produce a fluorescence signal. Apart from that, Pneumosensor is also equipped with a new promoter, Com-Box promoter, for the specific and tight regulation of target gene expression in E. coli.

They use the Finnish Kalottikone Unit for the soil recycling that is later used in construction and repair of roads. The Kalottikone Unit is a thermal desorption equipment that cleans contaminated soil from oil products [6].
We organized a meeting with the executive directors of EMG in Atyrau. We got to introduce them to iGEM and explain our project. After a short presentation, we discussed with them the possibility of applying our project in their processes. They were positive about the project and offered their help for the expansion of the project in real life.  However, they were a little sceptical about the genetically modified organism that would be used to treat the sour crude oil wastewater. We assured them about the safety measures we have thought about, which eased their worries about the risks of the project.
They explained the operations of their company. As their company extracts the oil from the ground, they separate the extraction into oil, gas and water. The sulfur content of the oil meets the minimum requirements and the standards of the legislature of RoK; therefore, they export or sell the oil. The extracted gas is then further produced as commodity gas that is sold for local usage. The water is pumped back into the reservoir to create the proper pressure for the oil to be pumped closer to the well in a process called water flooding [7].
Since our project is concerned about the wastewater, we tried to show that water flooding is not a reliable process even if it can increase the recovery factor and the production rate of oil extraction. We assume that their technologies (LO-CAT and Kalottikone) would not reduce the environmental factors as much as our synthetic biology approach would. Firstly, in our approach, the hydrogen sulfide reduction yields hydrogen gas and elemental sulfur, which are both potential biofuels. Secondly, the wastewater that is pumped back to create pressure can be treated with our cyanobacteria, because our process does not reduce the volume of the wastewater. Therefore, it would be producing the favorable byproducts, while creating the appropriate pressure. This solution was something new for the executive directors, but they were open to new processes.
The meeting with EMG did not only give us beneficial feedback, but they helped to clarify some oil production processes that we could not find online. They are ready to give their wastewater samples to analyze the potential of our genetically modified cyanobacteria. We look forward to collaborating with EMG, as our project can be applied as part of their oil and gas treatment processes.

Creating this system would allow future teams to make much more interesting and complex models since they could start from where previous teams left off and not from scratch. Below we elaborate on both the model of our own system and this modelling database idea with “proof of concept” examples of how the modelling registry could look and function and how a team would upload their modelling “bricks” to the registry.
Modelling of the biosynthesis of OneProt
Figure 1: The biosynthesis of essential and non-essential amino acids - will open in a new tab due to the size. As mentioned above we wanted to model the biosynthesis of the essential and non-essential amino acids in the attempt to find bottlenecks in the system. We wanted to find out which amino acids would slow down the production of our protein based on the pathway using Michaelis-Menten kinetics and the differential equation solver Berkeley Madonna.
The first step of this process was drawing the pathway of the amino acids, including all enzymes and reactions. This was a huge task and we ended up with the pathway seen in figure 1. Second step consisted of finding all the needed constants of the enzyme reactions in the pathway, including around 170 km and Vmax constants found on BRENDA. and in the literature. A document containing all constants used in our model can be found here.
The last step of the process was implementing the differential equations made using the pathway, Michaelis-Menten kinetics and our constants in a differential equation solver. We chose to use Berkeley Madonna since this solver solve systems quickly and provides the ability to work with “sliders”, which allow us to see the impact of small changes in constants and equations on our system. Our model implemented in Berkeley Madonna can be found here.
What did the model tell us?
Figure 2: Production of OneProt at different TCA levels. The complexity of biological systems makes it impossible to model without making assumptions. As is also the case for us, our model could never have been made without making some assumption. All the assumptions we have made have been noted in the model.
One of the first things we observed after having constructed the model was that a model of this extent is very stiff. Furthermore the complexity of the model also makes it very difficult to predict the outcome of changes.
The model is based on the principle of “sources and sinks”, where sources are the flow into the system and sinks are the flow out of the system. The sources in our case are the Citric acid cycle (TCA) and"

Influencing Parliamentary Decision - POSTnote
Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST) is Parliament's in-house source of independent accessible analysis of public policy issues related to science and technology. This provides overviews of research from across the biological, physical and social sciences, and engineering and technology. The best known format for these briefings are ‘POSTnotes’: summaries of public policy issues based on reviews of the research literature and they are peer reviewed by external experts. POSTnotes are often produced proactively, so that parliamentarians have advance knowledge of key issues before they reach the top of the political agenda.
The development of biological systems addressing global issues is breaking ground; this is a critical time to incorporate the presence of synthetic biology within the political framework. Our aim for writing this POSTnote is to get parliament to notice and recognize the impact synthetic biology can have on society.  The document focuses on:
Climate  change  and  the  impact renewable energy can have on this issue
The potential  of  Synthetic  Biology  as  a  renewable  solution  in electronic manufacturing and in energy production.
The isolation between science and politics which is hindering factor in the growth of projects like the one we are proposing.
The reply showed that there is a quota on how many POST notes relating to Synthetic Biology can be published in a period. There is clearly a gap in understanding of Synthetic Biology between scientists and policymakers and the general public. And realizing this, the iGEM team Kent has proactively made effort to write to POST about this hoping that more public dialogues will be stimulated. Therefore, the question as to what is the best way to improve the public dialogue remains elusive and more efforts should still be done in this respect. And lastly, this incident also gives a realistic insight of the position of Synthetic Biology within the political agenda.
Looking at the responses, we can conclude that the question as to how best to engage the society on SynBio still remains elusive. However this gives an insight as to what is the position of SynBio within the political agenda.

Safety
Before proceeding with our feasibility study, it was important to ensure that the study itself would not cause any harm. Happily, iGEM teams are required to answer the following safety questions.
Contents
1 General safety
2 Mitigation of risks and BioBrick safety
3 Oversight
4 Ideas
General safety
Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose:
Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab?
Risks to the safety and health of the general public if released by design or accident?
No to both.
This year's project involves catalysing reactions by using enzymes displayed on bacteriophage and/or on the bacterial cell surface via Ice Nucleation Protein. A simple test system will involve amylase or GFP; a more complex system would incorporate multiple types of cellulase. None of these things are harmful to humans. There is no pathogenicity, infectivity, or toxicity.
The lab does not use ethidium bromide. The work requires only reagents that are normal for a microbiology lab.
Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident?
No. In both the phage and cell display systems, release would cause no harm.
While the full form of Ice Nucleation Protein is apparently used by Pseudomonas syringae to help it attack plants, the version we will use ( BBa_K265008 by UC Davis 2009) lacks the extensive central domains which actually cause ice nucleation; therefore as it stands it has no pathogenicity, and is merely used as a carrier to move fused enzymes to the cell surface.

Processing Silk
Preparation for Silk Materials
Step 1: Degumming
Silk is comprised of two main proteins, fibroin and sericin. Fibroin is the structural protein of the silk and our protein of interest. Sericin serves as the ‘glue’ of the silk.  Degumming separates and removes sericin and is an essential preparation step before dissolving the silk. We found that commercially degummed silk was not properly degummed for our purposes and this step had to be carried out in-lab.
Raw, improperly degummed silk.
Same sample of silk after degumming.
Step 2: Solubilization
Getting significant amounts of silk (>0.25 grams) into solution requires the use of lithium bromide [1] . Protocols with less hazardous chemicals were attempted, yet none were able to reproduce results obtained using lithium bromide. The silk is cut into small pieces and dissolved in a scintillation vial at 60 degrees Celcius for 4 hours.
Silk solubilized in a solution of lithium bromide.
Step 3: Dialysis
Dialysis of the Fibroin-Lithium Bromide solution removes the lithium bromide, and results in an aqueous solution of the fibroin protein [1] . This solution can then be processed further in a variety of ways to achieve various structures and conformations of the silk protein.
Silk solution after dialysis.
Material - Silk Films
Silk films are the simplest way of processing the silk. The silk can be processed directly after dialysis. Dialyzed silk is simply dehydrated and the remaining silk aggregates into a film (protocol link). This simplicity may prove to be an asset as researchers investigate these films for next-generation medicine. The biodegradability of the films allows for technology like conformal electronics to be bio-integrated [2] .

Uppsala,2016,Team:Uppsala#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," individual and social choice” (National Research council, 1989:x).
Building Consensus Through Risk Assessment and Management of Department of Energy's Environmental Remediation Program have more recently been looking at nexus between risk assessment and public participation. The study’s main goal was to investigate the “conduct of a credible risk assessment of all the risks at all sites, with active participation of all the local participants”. This was when the department was making restoration after use in the nuclear weapons program (National Council, 1994b:vii). Meanwhile, Science and Judgement in Risk Assessment presented the general issue of establishing as well as, when needed, changing guidelines for assessing human health risks. This was considered from a point of view where there are uncertainties of inadequate knowledge and a requirement of decision makers (National Research Council, 1994a).
National Research Council, 1983:1 formulated the problem as: “The way the nation handles risk often breaks down at the stage of “risk characterization”, when the information in a risk assessment is translated into a form usable by risk manager, individual decision maker, or the public. Oversimplifying the science or skewing the results through selectivity can lead to the inappropriate use of scientific information in risk management decisions, but providing full information, if it does not address key concerns of the intended audience, can undermine that audience’s trust in the risk analysis” (Stern et al. 1996).
The three Rationales
There are three main rationales that emphasize the importance of a broad participation in risk decisions; normative rationale, substantive rationale and the instrumental rationale. The normative classification describes the citizens’ rights of participation in pertinent public decision-makings and for the public to be properly informed of the background to government decisions. The normative rationales also integrate with the principle of the assent of govern to determine governmental decisions (Stern et al. 1996). The bases of the normative rationales are today incorporated in laws such as the Administrative Procedure Act and the Freedom of Information Act (Houghton, 1998; Kathlene and Martin, 1991; Lynn and Busenberg, 1995).
The substantive rationale includes that relevant knowledge shall not be apart for only specialists within scientific areas and office holders. It implies that participation of a wide range of groups and individuals shall be provided with fundamental information and insights of contexts with potential risks. Non-specialists shall be able to contribute to risk characterization by e.g. emphasizing questions that have not been addressed by scientists and also give hold of relevant knowledge about certain conditions that could obtain more realistic qualifications for risk analyses.

Public Survey
To bridge the gap between the lab and the outside world, we designed a survey that would cover all facets of our project, be it education, IP rights, ethics, project safety as well as implementation and development. In this way, we created dialogue with the general public.
Almost everyone who answered left behind some comments and questions, and we have been answering and communicating with them regarding every concern they have, be it safety or our future plans for other projects. A lot of our responders were of the ages 18–24 and expressed great interest in SynBio and how they could join up for the team! Our survey and responses are here and make for an interesting read!
Because we were the first ever iGEM team from Pakistan and this was the first time synthetic biology was happening in the country, it was a very big deal for us. We knew that it was our responsibility to educate the masses about this cutting-edge science and its potential, as much as we could. Moreover, because we were working on air pollution — which happens to be a major problem for our country — we could create great impact about the potential of SynBIo in tackling this problem.
We left no stone unturned and wrote to and contacted as much media personnel as we could. Our efforts paid off and we got interviewed and featured in 5 national newspapers and 4 national TV news channels.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#PoliciesAndPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," Aspects of the convention such as the poster presentation allowed the four individuals to network and communicate ideas with individuals such as the FBI and other university researchers that were familiar with iGEM and others whom had never heard of the organization and were very interested to learn more.  This level of networking with international professionals was enlightening and interested to gather a range of perspectives on both the synthetic biology industry and our project.  Our representatives got the opportunity to view the discussion of current policy in place - and the process of forming this policy.  Our group was invited meetings at the Canadian mission and took part in discussions that we may never have the opportunity to partake in again.  This was a great opportunity to also expand our own professional development and perspective among the great opportunity to promote iGEM and our 2014 iGEM Calgary research.
This week we received a reply from Health Policy Project . They answered all of our questions in great details and provided useful documents that we can study. The documents included Biosafety Law in Ethiopia, and National Strategic Plan in regards to malaria. They also provided us with detailed information on what is the procedure to getting the device on market. The first step is get registered with Food, Medicine, Health Services Administration and Control Authority by submitting an application with required technical documentation and specifications details of the product. If the product is already registered with the World Health Organization (WHO) then FMHSACA usually registers the device provided all of the required documentation is submitted. Otherwise, FMHSACA might choose to run its’ own safety and quality control tests with the help from Ethiopian Public Health Institute. It is also recommended that the device has Certificate of Good Manufacturing Practice to ensure successful implementation. Upon completion of the registration process, the device might be included in health care workers’ trainings. The device would also have to be listed in National Guidelines in order for health care professionals to use the product. A representative from Health Policy Project also agreed that misdiagnosis of malaria is a problem, so a multidiagnostic device that would improve the diagnosis of malaria and diseases with similar symptoms is needed in developing countries such as Ethiopia. From Health Policy Project we also provided information on the level of government involvement in health care and reflected on the possible mindset of the government in regards to diagnostic tests like ours. Since FIND and WHO are located at Geneva, we also contacted both of these organizations to arrange an in-person meeting while the 4 representatives from the team are in Geneva for the conference.

Questionnaires : Synthetic Biology and Public’s Opinion
Synthetic biology is a quite new thing in Indonesia and the public probably still unfamiliar with it. So,  instead of asking public about our project; how it might affect society and vice versa, our human practice focusing to how much Indonesian (Bandung citizens to be excact) know about synthetic biolohy and how are their opinion on synthetic biology in topic that closely related to them. The surverys done in weekly Car Free Day events in Dago and in sport field where people usually gather every weekend with respondents varies from teenagers to young adults to adults.
Environment
One of topics that easily found in society and related to synthetic biology is environment. We did several suverys based on this topic, and develop it to know how is the public opinion about current environmental issue (focusing in pollution) and how synthetic biology could involve in this issue. Beside that,we also want to see general profile of how much public recognize synthetic biology itself. The respondents involved in this survey are 136 persons.
In your opinion, what kind of pollution that happened most frequent?What are the sources of that pollution?
As we can see in the Figure 1, majority of the respondents answer water is the pollution that happen the most often in society, followed by soil and air pollution. The wordcloud below (generated from: https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/#%2F%2Fwww.jasondavies.com%2Fwordcloud%2Fabout%) display respondent’s opinion with  the size of the letter of a word is equal with its frequency of the word being mentioned during the survey. The most mentioned source of environmental problems are industrial waste, domesticwaste, waste in general, and garbage management If we look back at the respondents’s profile, the result potrays the environmental problem in urban society"

Sydnee Calhoun
Undergraduate
Hi, my name is Sydnee and I am a fourth year biochemistry student at the University of Lethbridge. I will be finishing my B.Sc. in the fall and applying for genetic counselling programs.  This is my third year advising the high school iGEM team. I love the opportunities and experiences that iGEM can give to students while they are still in high school. I have always enjoyed conducting human practices work and I think it is important for our students to understand the implications that their work can have on society. Outside of iGEM, I enjoy coffee, hanging out with my friends, working in the lab, and coffee.
Chris Isaac
Graduate
I joined iGEM in 2012 to take a chance on something new. Since then, I’ve had the pleasure of continuing to participate, mentor, and explore new ideas in synthetic biology. The best part of iGEM is the ability to engage in a meaningful multidisciplinary project and develop solutions to emerging challenges. In the future, I want to be able to bridge the worlds synthetic biology and public policy to make sure that we do the most good possible at the least cost.
Erin Kelly
Graduate
My first High School iGEM experience was actually when I was in grade 12 and participated on the Lethbridge High School iGEM team in 2012. I then went on to be an advisor to the high school team in 2013 when I started my undergraduate program. I am excited to be back instructing HS iGEM again! My favourite part about iGEM is designing genetic constructs because these molecular biology systems are so elegant. I am pursuing my MD and have completed my MSc, and hopefully maintain an emphasis on biomedical research and engineering.

My name is Luke Saville and I am from Calgary, AB. I have just completed my second year as a biochemistry major at the University of Lethbridge. I also do RNA based research at the University of Lethbridge.  I joined iGEM because it seems like a good way to be surrounded by cutting edge science that is constantly growing.

Cornell,2013,Team:Cornell#notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"1_2 and pSB1C3 PCR. We electroporated this Gibson into DH5a cells and plated it on chloramphenicol LB plates. We reran the PCR of pC13AI with primers 45/52 and 48/51, annealing temperature of 61.5C and extended for 30s. We did a double digest of pC13CO with EcoRI-HF & PstI. We ran a 1% TAE gel of pC13AI PCR products for 30 minutes at 100V. The bands for pC13AI with 45/53 were seen at 1.5kb and 1.1kb; bands for pC13AI with 48/51 were seen at 1.5kb and 1kb. We still have a weird banding pattern. We may need to do a gradient PCR to find a better temperature for the primers and to test the PCR without the GC buffer. We purified and dephosphorylated the vectors we digested yesterday--pC13BG, pC13AG and pC13K. We also purified inserts of pC13AF with EcoRI-HF and SpeI, and pC13P with EcoRI-HF and SpeI.
We tried transformation of Cochliobolus again. We ran a PCR to append cut sites to pC13F but no band was shown on a gel. We redid the Gibson of Cht1_2 and pSB1C3. When we ran a PCR fo pC13AI, weird band patterning was observed. We purified the vectors we digested yesterday: pC13BG, pC13AG and pC13K. In addition, we purified inserts of pC13AF and pC13P. We continued recording measurements of G. lucidum’s growth in the presence of antibiotics.

We met for our first run through of our presentation.  The script needs some work, but it’s coming along nicely. It seems that the only part lacking in the presentation is the characterization data and charts. They coming soon!

We used less hygromycin for transformation because Cochliobolus concentrations are less than G. lucidum concentrations. We are recording more and more data with regards with fungal resistance! We found a new contaminant on another plate but we will keep an eye out for it and make sure our measurements"
