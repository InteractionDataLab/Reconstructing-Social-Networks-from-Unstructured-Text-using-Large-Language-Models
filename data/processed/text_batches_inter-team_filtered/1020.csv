Osmotic pressure sensing
Why do we want to sense changes in osmotic pressure?
Patients suffering from respiratory diseases such as CF, asthma and COPD have one thing in common; accumulation of excessively thick mucus. When the mucus is thickened, the cilia covering the lung surface have difficulties removing dirt and pathogens from the airways (Hendersen et al, 2014). This results in more frequent infections and causes breathing difficulties. The thick mucus has a higher mucin content, ie. more mucin molecules, than that of mucus in healthy individuals. More mucin molecules mean that there is a higher total number of solutes in the mucus, resulting in increased osmotic pressure in the mucus.
Therefore, our goal is to trigger the expression of our mucus-degrading enzymes after sensing this increase in osmotic pressure, helping patients in clearing the airways.
How is this possible?
We will take advantage of the already well characterized OmpR/EnvZ two-component system used by many bacteria, including E. coli (figure 1) (Pratt et al. 1996). The system’s function is to keep the osmotic pressure stable inside of the bacteria by responding to changes in osmotic pressure and regulating the in and outflow of molecules with the help of two membrane porins, OmpC and OmpF. The expression of these membrane porins is regulated by the OmpR/EnvZ system. EnvZ is a histidine kinase, able to sense the external osmotic pressure and communicate this information to the OmpR protein, by phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. When the osmotic pressure is"

An agarose gel is prepared.
The PCR-Product is mixed with a dye and inserted into “pockets” of the gel, along with a “ladder” containing DNA fragments of known size
By applying an electrical field, the negatively charged DNA is moved through the gel matrix, separating the DNA fragments by length.
The DNA bands are then compared to the ladder and their size can be calculated. By comparing the observed length to the expected length of the fragment,  the success of the PCR can be evaluated

Description
Toehold Switch Sensor Test – Pipeline
High throughput screening in liquid medium
Goal:High-throughput screening for sensors that react specifically to target RNA
DescriptionIn silico design and PCR allows for assembly of a large number of potential sensor candidates. In order to evaluate which of these sensors reacts to the target RNA in a sensitive and specific manner, the following steps are required:
A master mix of cell free expression system, reporter molecule and certain amount of target RNA or control RNA is prepared and transferred to a special low-volume 384-well plate.
Adding sensor DNA to each well
Measure absorption at 405nm (yellow – starting color) and 560nm (violet – end color) in a GloMax Discover ® plate reader (Promega) for 2-4 hours at 37° C in order to follow the kinetic of the reaction from yellow to violet.
Results files are evaluated using a python script. By automating the process of data evaluation, a empirically sound conclusion can be reached in less than 15 minutes.
Reliable cell free expression on cellulose membranes
Goal:Membranes are known to be efficient microfluidic environments, but due to the charge of nucleic acids and the negative charge of cellulose, optimization is required to make the system storable and the color change easily recognizable.
DescriptionIn silico design and PCR allows for assembly of a large number of potential sensor candidates. In order to evaluate which of these sensors reacts to the target RNA in a sensitive and specific manner, the following steps are required:
Blocking the charge of the cellulose membrane.
Classic approaches of membrane blocking like incubation with 5% BSA or milk powder failed due to negative interaction with the cell free expression system. Hence we used an amphiphilic component, creating a liquid barrier shielding the sensor system from negative charges and successfully creating a stable color reaction"

Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab.
In our project, we have designed a potential product to increase light capturing: biological microlenses and tested them under real-world conditions. The lenses will be beneficial for many different applications, such as microscopy, cameras and solar panels. Especially the application of microlens arrays to improve solar cells is promising. Many innovations have already happened in these fields, however our biological microlenses are more environmentally friendly produced and our microlenses are already ten to hundred times smaller than chemically produced microlenses. Since our biolenses contain a cell, physical properties could be different from other microlenses. To see if our microlenses were able to improve solar panels, we tested the under simulated real-world conditions. Since we could not take our cells outside, we placed our cells on a solar panel and placed it in a solar simulator, a device that simulates the light emitted by the sun. Here we have shown that >99% of the incident light is transmitted through our biolenses. This shows that the biolenses have great potential in the former mentioned applications. To implement the biolenses, further research is needed on how to structurally arrange our biolenses.

E.Coli Pen
Our team, KIT-Kyoto suggests an “E.Coli Pen” as new Art Tool. This brand-new pen uses no ink but medium which E.Coli has been cultured. It is able to express more than one color with single bacterial culture. This is one of the features worthy of mention. E.Coli Pen works with mechanism of oxidative stress reaction. Stressed by receiving H2O2, genetically modified E.Coli expresses fluorescent protein. By using some promoters with different sensitivity, each gene coding fluorescent protein at their downstream has been regulated. Different from previous Bioart in iGEM, “E.Coli Pen” enables us to purely enjoy the Art with feeling affinity to biotechnology.

All constructs contain sfGFP under different promoters/UTRs- as a marker of gene expression and protein synthesis/accumulation.
For more information about these improvements see our Results and our BioBricks' main pages: BBa_K2014003 and BBa_K2014004
We have also tested and slightly improved Ba_K1481003 - biobrick provided to iGEM in 2014 by Poznan_Bioinf team, named ""sfGFP with R4-tag under arabinose promoter"". We have checked if four rare arginine codons (namely AGG and AGA) added to the 3' end of GFP reading frame will influence its translation. Surprisingly we have found that there is no obvious difference in expression comparing to gene without arginine tag.
Thus, we improved the construct and added four rare arginine codons (AGA) under identical promoter (AraC-pBAD) with an identical 5’UTR- BBa_K2014007 .

When our finished product is inspected, we want to obtain the minimum detection time and                         determine the credibility of the test results. Therefore, the relationship between the test                         result and time is made. The reaction \(\gamma\) and the pattern diagram ω3 are as                         follows:
$$R_TA\overset{K_{d1}}{\underset{K_{a1}}{\rightleftharpoons}}A+R_T$$
$$P+R_T\overset{K_{a2}}{\underset{K_{d2}}{\rightleftharpoons}}R_TP \tag{ γ }$$
Figure. ω3 Detection mode diagram
For the detection, we assume that the immobilized antigen is not easily detached outside of the                         reaction, and the amount of free antibody during the reaction is very small and remains                         substantially unchanged. Using this free antibody steady-state and kinetic knowledge, we derive                         the relationship (9):
\begin{equation}\begin{split}                         [R_TA]=&Cexp[-(K_{d2}+K_{a2}[R_T])t]\\&+\frac{K_{d2}(K_{d2}[R_TA_0]+[R_T])-K_{a2}([P_0]-[R_TA_0]+[R_T])[R_T]}{K_{d2}+K_{a2}[R_T]}                         \end{split}\tag{9}\end{equation}
equal meaning between \([R_TA_0]\) and \([R_TA]_0\).
By simplification of relation (9) and combining relation (2) inside the grayscale model content,                         relations (10) and (11) can be obtained:
$$[R_TA]=Cexp[xt]+y\tag{10}$$
$$Grayscale value=\frac{\sigma exp[xt]+Psi}{\beta+Cexp[xt]}\tag{11}$$
According to the relationship, We can obtain a detection curve expressed by the fixed                         antigen-antibody concentration. The relationship between high and low sensitivity detection                         curves can also be obtained (slide detection sensitivity and antigen-antibody positive                         correlation).And we can list Fig. 5 (a)(b)(c):

Latherin works as expected, showing good surfactant properties.  As our multiple cloning site biobrick is currently still in synthesis, demonstration of function is still pending, but the biobrick is expected to arrive fully functional and ready for shipping.
2. Characterize the operation of at least one new BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
We have characterised the activity of iLOV and LOV2, as well as Latherin, and have uploaded all the information onto the Registry pages of our new Biobricks.
Gold:
1. Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year) and enter this information in the Registry (in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry), and don't forget to create a new registry page for the improved part.
We have ligated multiple different promoters to ribosome binding sites of varying strengths, which should significantly simplify their use by other iGEM teams in the future.  These constructs were then used to characterise a series of light-dependent promoters, and the results were entered on the ‘Experience’ pages of the respective biobricks. We have also created multiple constructs of coding devices with RBSs and terminators for better ease-of-use.  Additionally, we worked on improving and characterising the red-light sensing system improved by the Edinburgh iGEM team, (Part BBa_K322127 and BBa_K322128) and created two alternative reporter systems for the constructs, using YFP and RFP.
2. Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
We helped out the St. Andrews team by providing them with more of the submission vector, when they ran out of it. We have also been working on characterising the red-light-responsive systems from Edinburgh, as well as getting them sequenced.  Additionally, we have created a handbook which we will be handing out at the jamboree, that contains all vital information for any iGEM team, such as information about registration, safety, ligations, biobrick ends and scarring, submission etc. This should be invaluable to any future iGEM team, and we propose that it be sent out along with the starter kits next year.

Transformation of Vh3 (attempt #11 to #13) in E. coli TOP10 competent cells using an alternative restriction enzyme :  PstI-HF restriction enzyme is remplaced  by SpeI.
Cloning
We obtained the YFP gene after the GAP promotor and the FUS1 promotor in E. coli.
Experiments with P. pastoris
pGAP-YFP and pFUS-YFP were transformed in P. pastoris.
P. pastoris clones were obtained with pPICZα-Odr10 ; pPICZα-leucrocine and pPICZα-cOT2 but the PCR colony didn’t work. After several trials and controls we concluded that the DNA extraction the way we did it was not enough to do a PCR of the GAP promotor in the pichia genome.
A kinetic study of V. harveyi growth was made using pichia supernatant. → A difference was observed but the experiment needs to be done again.

The UPO-Sevilla team is registered in iGEM 2011. Actually, we were among the first four teams in registering this year .
We have completed the judging form.
We have design a Wiki full of information about our project and our team.
We presented a poster and a talk in the iGEM Jamboree.
We have submitted 31 new BioBricks and BioBrick compatible plasmids. We have sent the physical DNA for 13 new parts and plasmids (our favourite parts). And we have characterized 5 new parts and plasmids, which works as expected. Also, we have characterized by mathematical modeling, multi-agent modeling and quantitative experimental assays a previous existing BioBrick . We have entered this information in the experience section of the part in the Registry.
Silver
We have demonstrated that two new BioBrick compatible plasmids for BioBrick genome integration ( BBa_K510000 , BBa_K510012 ) designed by our team works as expected. The portable insertion site of the Tn7 transposon and its derivatives ( BBa_K510022 ) has been fully characterized and also works as expected. Finally we have characterized the correct funcion or our impreoved flip-flop (made by two modules: BBa_K510019 , BBa_K510019 )
We have characterized the operation of these two plasmids ( BBa_K510000 , BBa_K510012 ) and these three parts ( BBa_K510022 , BBa_K510019 , BBa_K510036 ); and we have entered this information into the “Main Page” and “Experience page” sections of their Registry entry.

UCL,2017,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"see the table below).  All individual cells were classified as single cells, while the clumps of 3 or more cells were classified as aggregated. The number of cells in each aggregate was counted.
Because E-cadherin only functions in presence of calcium ions, we would expect the cells in well B to have the highest percentage of aggregates, which is what we supported by this experiment. As shown in the graph, the percentage of aggregates is notably above 50 % only in well B.
For analysis, we took the ratio between free and aggregate cells per field of view using the ratio as the individual observation. Ratios were averaged and, assuming that our measurements are normally distributed, normalised against the control (well C). The normalised data was analysed using a Student t-test (one-tailed, homoscedastic populations). Analysis suggests that  the E-cadherin plasmid does lead to a change in aggregation (p < 0.05).
Null hypothesis: Plasmid has no impact on aggregation.
p value (comparison between C and A) = 0.012
Because this experiment is the result of a single transfection experiment and the replicates are technical rather than biological replicates, the observations are preliminary but would support that the cadherin plasmid lead to an increase in aggregation.
The addition of Superfect (wells A, B, C and D) significantly reduced total number of all cells and total number of aggregated cells as compared to number of aggregated cells in untreated cells (well E). Based on that, it can be concluded that Superfect acts against aggregation as only the cells treated with plasmid, Superfect and calcium ions reached the levels of aggregated cells comparable to those of untreated cells.
Taken together, these 2 observations are consistent with calcium-dependent effect of E-cadherin to promote cell aggregation. Based on preliminary results obtained, we can conclude that our E-cadherin plasmid is a promising part of our construct that we would function to promote cell adhesion as expected.
The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) has become a common world-wide goal in response to the impacts of climate change and increasing global warming affecting numerous societies, ecosystems and wild-life. Implementation of LED lighting has been attempted to reduce GHG, however it is a very costly approach. We therefore developed the LIT Bulb, an efficient, sustainable, eco-friendly, long-term and cheap solution for public illumination that requires a minimal electricity/nutrient input (see figure 1).

3.5 Degradation
Proteins, mRNA and other metabolites have a turnover rate. They are degraded over time. The degradation rate will be described by a lineair function: $d {\cdot} P$. In this function d is the degradation constant and P the amount of molecules. Not every molecule has the same degradation rate, since some molecules are more stable than others. We can influence the stability of the molecules. For example, in"

Future iGEM Team of the ""Westfälische Hochschule""
Quite at the start of our project, we were contacted by a group of students and their professor from the college from Recklinghausen. They are considering to participate in iGEM 2016 and had a lot of questions on how to build up an iGEM Team and manage an iGEM project. We were glad to welcome them in Aachen and answer all of their questions regarding BioBricks, judging and project organization. We hope that they will become part of iGEM next year and wish them all the best!
The students from Recklinghausen were accompanied by a supporting and potential future instructor Dr. Frank Eiden. Later that year Dr. Eiden was attending the same SynBio Symposium as our team. We took the chance to get some feedback on our project and won him over for an interview on Community Labs . We also met him at the Maker Faire and had an interessting discussion about synthetic biology and our prototype.

University of Oslo - MDH Assays
When the project descriptions came online it became apparent that team UiOslo and we were working with a very similar methanol dehydrogenase. After some initial Skype calls where we discussed our projects, we started to collaborate on Mdh activity assays. Team Oslo did not have access to a microplate reader, but luckily we were able to find the optimal conditions for doing the Nash-Assay for formaldehyde detection. In addition to that, they built upon the methane sensor that"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,". A detailed discussion provided us with useful advices and opinions about our elution technique and purification column.
Prof. Lütkemeyer stated that our technique of the light-induced elution is very interesting and a promising alternative to proteases-cleaving sites. However, we need to validate the system profoundly. Especially interesting are the minimal amounts of light and radiation time needed for reliable back bone cleavage. He also said that our system could be very useful for companies related to the production of biomolecules like Evonik Industries AG and GE Healthcare. Nevertheless, we should improve our purification column prototype design to reduce dead space, increase potential yield and enhance the scalability. Finally, he recommended focusing on the validation of our elution system, since this is a highly innovative and promising aspect.
Meeting with Dr. Benjamin Müller, CEO of Biofidus AG
We met Dr. Benjamin Müller (CEO of Biofidus AG) on the 6th of September at his office (Figure 2). We showed him our peptide purification column and discussed the possibilities and conceivable use cases of our light-induced elution technique. He commented on the advantage of our purification method, namely that the one step reaction is simple and easy to understand and thus attractive for possible users.
He also pointed out some aspects we will have to check if a real use of this elution technique becomes current. He stated that we need to investigate if the light that is used for the elution will not harm the target protein and if there are any restrictions to the light-spectra, intensity, or irradiation time. We should also validate the stability of the amino acid itself, namely if it only reacts after irradiation, or possibly in the storage process. This would lead to a noticeable loss of the target protein. Furthermore, he stated that it would be useful to create a kit for the light-induced elution so that all users can apply this technique to their desired process and make the usage as easy as possible.

Meeting with Prof. Dr. Thomas Noll and Ole Weigelt
To discuss possible marketing and commercialization strategies for our EluX technology, we were invited to a meeting by Prof. Thomas Noll, co-founder of the local biotech Xell AG, and Ole Weigelt, tax consultant and lawyer at Weigelt Miersbach Uhlemeyer Partnerschaftsgesellschaft. The meeting took place on the 7th"
Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"riclone strain.
At first, he mentioned general concerns about V. natriegens. He would be worried about the mutation rate for the genome as well as on introduced plasmids due to the fast growth of the organism. Its size might cause limitations for plasmid transformation, and recombination or deletion on cloned plasmids might prove to be an issue.
Afterwards, he suggested the integration of common genetic tools, such as the ability for blue-white screening, into our strain design. This would shorten the adaption phase in laboratories with an established cloning standard and make switching to V. natriegens more desirable.  The transition towards V. natriegens would then become more accessible for everyone in the future regardless of their preferred cloning method.
After this inspiring discussion, we went back to the sketch board to implement all of his valuable feedback for the updated version of our Vibriclone 2.0 strain. We especially focused on the integration of the lac operon to allow alpha complementation for blue-white screening (for further reading about alpha complementation, click here ). Furthermore, taking all the general concerns about V. natriegens to heart, we integrated more input by testing the mutation rate for the genome and plasmids. We demonstrated that both mutation rates are not increased in comparison to E. coli, although this fear is understandable due to the fast doubling time. We consider it crucial integrate feedback of a large variety of people to succeed in our final goal to fully establish V. natriegens as a cloning chassis and replacing E.coli, Stepping outside of the box and considering various points of views helps us to facilitate an easy adaption of our Vibriclone strain for diverse laboratories with different areas of research.
Industry - Protein Expression with Crystals First
Figure 1: Meeting with Serghei Glinca.
Members of our team sitting together with Sergej Glinca talking about our wonderfull possibilities.
Crystals First is a start-up from Marburg that made it their mission to accelerate and improve the quality of drug design processes. We had the pleasure of featuring the CEO of Crystals First, Serghei Glinca, as one of our speakers for the German iGEM Meetup. There he sensitized us to the importance of protein expression in the context of drug discovery, which lead us to design our protein expression strain. After that, they invited us to present our project to the pharmacy department of the Philipps University Marburg. This resulted in not only valuable feedback but also in the opportunity to test our project with a real-world problem.

Based on the experiment above, we compared these two different ways with simple mix, here’s the result.
Figure 5. We can conclude that pre-incubation does increase the hydrolysis rate, some ways(Plastic  pre-incubated with sJanus) even boost 200%+ react rate comparing with Thc_cutL1* in our conditions!! Another interesting phenomenon is sJanus usually works better than inJanus, and the reason behind it need our further exploration. On the whole, Our Janus works a lot!
Additional experiment
Overview
To test the universality of conclusion above, we used another cutinase FsC we expressed. We tried incubated plastic with Janus and FsC with Janus but data shows differently comparing with our expectation. In the contrary cutinase without incubation performed better. We are still working on the explanation.
Result
After incubation (PET&sJanus, PET& inJanus, FsC&sJanus, FsC&inJanus) for 16h, we added FsC or PET piece into EP tube. A group of tube without incubation were also set as control.
Figure.6 Different columns mean different ways of incubation. Control means incubating PET in the buffer system without Janus before adding  enzyme or incubating FsC in buffer system before adding Plastic.
As the picture shows, after incubation for 16h sJanus performed better than inJanus. That is in accord with conclusion we made above. Unfortunately, the control group had a higher value. The reliability of this result needs our repeat and confirmation and the explanation behind it still need our further exploration. We are working on it.
Further exploration
Overview 
We successfully build a fusion protein which attached cutinase Thc_Cut1 to our Janus (sJanus-m).
The fusion protein has much more better performance than the cutinase before.
Result 
The procedure in this part is likely to the pre-experiment, we use different concentration of fusion protein. And we compare the data to the value we conduct with Thc_Cut1 before, found that fusion protein hydrolysis more, especially in high concentration.

KEGG ( Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ) [8] , [9] , [10] provides a database of biological systems, consisting of several building blocks including for instance genes and proteins (KEGG GENES) or hierarchies and relationships of various biological objects (KEGG BRITE). Here, KEGG PATHWAY which comprises molecular interaction and reaction networks for metabolism, various cellular processes and human diseases was of particular interest. From this collection of molecular wiring maps, we chose all physiologically relevant pathways for our project, thereby ruling out tissue or other highly specific pathways, like olfactory / taste transduction as well as several pathways related to human diseases.

Promotersweep
One of the most challenging problems in bioinformatics remains the computerized localization of TFBS and the transcriptional start sites (TSS) as well as the determination of the core promoter. Many of the available motive discovery tools exhibit the problem of extended false positive predictions. The Promotersweep web-tool improves the accuracy of this analysis by combining a vaste number of different algorithms and methods simultaneously [11] . It integrates information from three homology databases (EnsEMBL Compara [12] , NCBI HomoloGene [13] ,DoOP database [14] ), five promoter databases(EPD [15] , DBTSS [16] ), six sequence motive identification tools (e.g. Gibbs MotifSampler [17] ) and two matrix profile databases (Jaspar Core Library [18] , Transfac ProfessionalLibrary [19] ) to identify and annotate TFBS. The Promotersweep pipeline is started by entering a sequence, chosen between human or mouse as origin. Initially a homology search is performed by using different BLAST algorithms. As a result orthologous promoter regions are deduced from EnsEMBL, Homologene or DoOP, respectively. Subsequently, several motive discovery tools determine shared motives of orthologous or co-regulated sequences. In the last step each TFBS is identified and evaluated with the help of the Transfac - and the Jaspar Core library. Every identified TFBS is classified as weak, conserved or reliable - according to the similarity of the predictions of the different algorithms. In Fig. 2 the result for the Heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (NM_153201) promoter is shown. For this promoter four different binding sites were discovered. Three of them were classified as reliable and one as conserved. For each hit, the output of Promotersweep contains the position of the motive relative to the T"

Proof of Concept
Fluorescent Microscopy
The genetic switch systems that are being characterised make use of two different reporter genes, namely green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP). These will give a visual indication as to the functioning of the parts being tested. The biobricks, BBa_I13521 and BBa_I13522 were transformed into E. coli and serve as positive controls for fluorescent microscopy. These two parts consist of the reporter genes, GFP and RFP respectively and are under the control of a constitutive promoter.
Figure 1. The fluorescent microscopy positive controls GFP (BBa_I13521) and RFP (BBa_I13522).
Cloning of Parts
The parts required for the characterisation of an inverter switch as well as a switch based on excision were synthesised by Integrated DNA technologies as part of their promotion to iGEM teams. These gBlocks were received and blunt end cloned into pUC19 plasmids to create high copy number of our parts. The inserts were then retrieved by restriction digests of the flanking EcoRI and PstI sites for sticky end cloning into the pSB1C. The digests were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel for electrophoresis to separate linear vector from inserts. The bands corresponding to the respective parts being characterised were excised and purified using a Zymo Gel purification kit (Inverter 1, BBa_K1768001; Inverter 2 BBa_K176800; Cre generator, BBa_K1768004).

The purified inserts were ligated into pSB1C for part submission and the Cre generator BBa_K1768004 ligated into pSB1A for experimentation. These vectors were supplied with the 2015 Distribution Kit and were digested with EcoRI and PstI to create complimentary sticky ends to the inserts.

The varying perspectives led to a lively discussion led by the students.  Topics ranged from genetic engineering in research labs, ethics of genetic engineering, biological weapons,  agriculture, bioterrorism and GMO labeling among others.  The public took part in a question and answer session as well.  The attendees were polled prior to and again when leaving about their attitudes towards synthetic biology.  More than 60% stated at the beginning that they were hesitant to approve the science of genetic engineering. After the panel discussion that dropped to just under 19%.  The Discovery Dialogue was such a success that Lambert's team has been asked to partner with the Atlanta Science Festival with a longer event.  Based on the feedback we received from the participants during this coming year, 2016, we are putting together a 1/2 day event that will include sessions: focused on agricultural use of synthetic biology, health and medicinal therapies and panel discussing the safety of synthetic biology.
Around 20 of our iGem members helped make the panel at Atlanta Science Festival go smoothly. The Atlanta Science Festival brings together people spanning multiple generations, from all walks of life. A stereotype exists that the older generation is ignorant to new technologies, but that does not necessarily equate to an unwillingness to learn. One of the more notable attendees of our Discovery Dialogue, an older woman approximately in her mid 60’s, was deeply concerned by the topic brought up regarding genetically modified apples that were altered to avoid browning. She vehemently debated against the modification of fruits because of the perceived notion that the taste of her beloved apples was greatly altered, along with all of the fruits since her childhood. With the panel of experts, as well as the LHS iGEM student’s input, we were able to help her come to the realization that the differences in agricultural production was not only the possible impact of GMOs, but also included modern transportation methods in the industry. This is just one example of how our panel at the Atlanta Science Festival helped to break down the misrepresentation of SynBio in the community.

When these informations are considered, it is clear that production of TIpB protein is IPTG dependent and Western-Blot can be performed because of its His-Tag site.
As shown above,we planned to clone the ordered GadE gene into peT-45 vector by using BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Final construct after this cloning is, respectively T7 promoter-Lac operator(LacO)-HisTag-GadE. Besides, a constitutive promoter called LacI promoter and LacI protein sequence in front of that, found on peT45-b vector’s another part. It is obvious that this part is IPTG-dependent, so Western Blot can be performed easily with the help of His Tag.
Results
GadE-PSB1C3 CLONNING
We cloned IDT G-Blocks GadE gene into PSB1C3 vector in order to make it ready to be submitted and have many copies of it. For this purpose we digested PSB1C3 vector and GadE G-Blocks with ECoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Then we ligated these cut genes into the plasmid by using T4 DNA Ligase . Ocurring products were transformed into BL21 competent cell strain.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was perfomed with Verify Forward and Verify Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly t the band should be 314 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, then bands should be 858 bp long.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check for a second cloning control. We used EcorI and PstI restriction enzymes for cut-check.
GadE-pET45-b CLONNING
We cloned GadE into PSB1C3 vector successfully, then moved on cloning it into the expression vector pET45-b. For cloning into this plasmid, we removed our gene from PSB1C3-GadE plasmid with BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Then we ligated the cut gene with pET45-b which was cut with the same enzymes."

NO gradient in IBD patients, and the SNP releasing NO
Introduction
As the first discovered cellular signaling molecule, Nitric Oxide (NO) plays a vital role in in many physiological and pathological processes. There’s a significant increase of NO concentration within the gut of IBD patients. [1-3] We utilized NO molecule as a “marker” for inflammatory position, and engineered E.coli to detect NO, so as to sense the inflammation.
NO gradient in IBD patients
Previous research showed that there’s a NO gradient within the gut of IBD patients. [1-3] The half-life of NO under physiological condition is only few seconds, so the NO gradient has a short distance but a sharp NO concentration peak at the inflammatory position. These features makes NO molecule a novel inflammation “marker”.
(此处补一张自制NO gradient的图，突出半衰期短，峰尖的特点……)
SNP releasing NO
There are several reagents that can release NO in aqueous solution. One of them is called Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a member of the NO-releasing drugs, which is originally used as a peripheral vasodilator.
In order to understand the kinetics of SNP releasing NO in LB, or say the environment where E.coli is cultured, we detected the concentration of NO in SNP-LB solution by Griess reagent.[4] And plotted the Dynamic curves of different concentrations of SNP releasing NO.
Figure 1. The Dynamic curves of different concentrations of SNP releasing NO. The SNP concentrations are 10 μM, 100 μM, 1 mM, 10 mM and 0 μM (control) in each group. Data are means(SD) (n=3 samples per group).

Results and discussion
Both samples with and without silicic acid added were imaged using HAAFD-TEM and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (figure 2). The cells are fixed at a Quantifoil carbon grid, consisting of carbon film perforated with holes and mounted on a carbon grid. In figure 2A and 2C the white structure is a cell laying on a hole in the grid. In each sample, we measured elemental composition of our sample including the silicon content (figure 2 B,D) the blue spots in these images indicate where silicon is detected. The grid itself already contains silicon but in the holes of the grid no silicon is present (figure 2 B,D). Therefore we only measured the presence of silicon in bacteria laying on a hole on in the grid to make sure we do not have background silicon signal from the grid, which cannot be distinguished from the actual signal.
Figure 2: (A,C) HAAFD image  and (B,D) EDX spectroscopy of silicon. (A,B). Image of the same cell containing OmpA-silicatein without silicic added to the sample (negative control). (C,D) Image of the same cell containing OmpA-Silicatein with silicic acid added to the sample.
For the sample where no silicic acid is added (figure 2 A,B), we can see some silicon present at the position of the cell. However, there is a significant increase in silicon detected for the sample where silicic acid was added to the sample (figure 2D). This shows that silicon co-localizes with the cell which means there is indeed a polysilicate layer formed by the bacteria.

Imaging of silicatein-expressing cells using SEM
Introduction
The Scanning Electron Microscope, or SEM as it is called, is a widely used imaging technique in science. In SEM, a beam of electrons is accelerated by high voltage and it is directed towards the sample. When the beam hits the sample, x-rays, backscattered electrons and secondary electrons are generated (Figure 1 in the TEM section). For imaging, SEM uses the secondary electrons. Those secondary electrons are then collected and their kinetic energy is transformed to an image. (Kwakernaak & Sloof, 2005) SEM is widely used due to its very high spatial resolution and Depth of Focus (DoF). In order to use SEM, samples have to be fixed and dried,"

The most important part of our outreach this year has been the focus on creating a sustainable impact, so for our outreach projects, we devised strategies to extend our direct education and public engagement activities to make our impact on our community long-lasting and sustainable. We grouped these Human Practices projects into the following categories: Consult the Community , Building Connections , Sustainable Impact , and the Outreach Database .
Consult the Community
We talked to experts and leaders in our community to find ways we could integrate our goal of establishing a dialogue about synthetic biology with the goals of members of our community. These activities represent a collaborative “co-design” of strategies and materials that met the needs of all involved, making projects not only more effective in the short term, but more sustainable in the long term.
We consulted the School of Education on how to work with teachers, update our synthetic biology activities booklet, and plan education events for students.
We met with the head of the science department from a nearby high school to talk to her about what kinds of resources she wanted for her students and teachers. After, she helped us organize a teacher focus group to find out how we could address our outreach goals and effectively help local teachers.
We consulted with Virginia State Senator Monty Mason about how to reach educators in our area, and he connected us with the STEM coordinator for a nearby school district that includes about 29,000 students.
We met with the STEM coordinator and she told us how to structure our outreach in a way that helps fulfill state-mandated learning requirements. She also gave us feedback on what resources would be helpful for schools in her district.
Building Connections
Based on our consultation with our community, we implemented various outreach activities to work directly with students. Additionally, we had activities for people from our college and the scientific community to help raise awareness of synthetic biology and start dialogues.
Working with students: we hosted students from a local STEM summer camp in our lab, presented about synthetic biology at a career fair for middle school students, and taught about 75 Girl Scouts about synthetic biology.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#28 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," for the introduction
First, I found a paper that discusses how AHL is limited to gram-negative bacteria (“Interspecies communication in bacteria”). Next, “LuxS quorum sensing: more than just a numbers game” discusses how AI-2 is in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It also includes a nice list of bacteria that have functions regulated by LuxS (complete with references), so I’m going to choose 2 of them and use them as examples to support the versatility of this system and draw potential applications
Whereas AI-I production and detection is unique to V. harveyi and V. parahaemolyticus (according to “Cross-species induction of luminescence in the quorum sensing bacteria Vibrio harveyi”) (note that this is an old paper and new discoveries might have been made since then), AI-II is much more wide-spread and can be used in interspecies communication (from “Multiple signalling systems controlling expression of luminescence in Vibrio harveyi: sequence and function of genes encoding a second sensory pathway”).
Someone did this in 2003, but we could do it now…..run a BLAST search of LuxS in bacterial species whose genomes have been sequence. I’m sure that we’ve discovered more bacteria that use AI-II in nature, and could make a pretty convincing impact when we compare the length of the updated list to that of the AHL list.
MAJOR APPLICATION (why we care about versatility of the system): many biofilms embody numerous species of bacteria. If we’re using quorum sensing to destroy the biofilm, we can’t just appeal to the small gram-negative selection that uses AHL -> we need to broaden our horizons and account for the plethora of other species that may be present. AI-II seems to be the best way to do this, given the (very long and BLASTed) list of bacteria in which that signalling pathway is naturally found.
3. Engineering applications of quorum sensing
This is mostly for the discussion and the sexiness factor of our circuit on the whole. In essence, you can use your mutants to test reporter (and in turn, signalling) circuits that are useful in cool applications.
I tried to find some hard numbers on the cost of biofilm and the impact that an anti-biofilm device could have. Finding a credible source for this is a problem! I tracked down a paper that estimates that 65% of human bacterial infections involve biofilm, and another paper that brings that number up to 80%. The first paper is very old and the second one doesn’t have a formal source"

Random things
She really doesn't understand why the Gibson Assembly for ACEB contruct did not work out. It should at least have the same number of colonies as the negative control, how can it have no colony at all!!! The Gibson Assembly mix certainly  affected the DNA fragments in some way... Is it possible that a gene is toxic to its native strain? Also, for BBa_J176171!! She confirmed that the linear plasmid is stable at 50°C but why can't it assemble with complementary sequences engineered in GFP? Can we really trust the sequence of this part? If this is heat sensitive, how can we confirm its sequence?

Astrid is a sophomore at HKUST, and is studying Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Astrid works in sub-group 2 and mostly does the inoculation, which might be too many times so she got a new nickname, ""Inoculation girl""!

However, presence of dsDNA target with a ssDNAp that can specifically bind to the target dsDNA does not influence the aggregation behavior drastically compared to the aggregation when dsDNA target is absent. Presence of only dsDNA target does decrease the stabilization of the d-AuNPs as they already aggregate at a NaCl added of 250 mM.

d-AuNPs Testing: ssDNAp interaction with EPO target DNA
The prescreening with d-AuNPs is tested with EPO DNA as target. The ssDNAp concentration is decreased to avoid to much stabilization of d-AuNPs by the ssDNAp. Prior, the ssDNAp is heated up to let the ssDNAp anneal to EPO target DNA and create the secondary structure. The ssDNAp, EPO target DNA and hybridization buffer were incubated:
5 minutes at 95 ºC (denature dsDNA target)
1 minute at 57 ºC (anneal ssDNAp to dsDNA target)
10 minutes at 21 ºC
20 µL d-AuNPs, 10 µL target dsDNA, 6 µL hybridization buffer, 4 µL ssDNAp 1 (1nM) and 20 µL of a varying salt concentration (range of 0 mM to 1000 mM) were added to the 96 wells plate. Again, the primer 051 was used as off-target ssDNAp. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.

If we create biologic systems like we assemble “legos”, do not we risk considering living organisms, whose human, like simple assembling of pieces? And in this case, the respect that we consider to have face to them can be altered. Of course, we can consider that our creations are only biologic engines, synthetic distinctive machines of « natural » life forms.
But where is the limit between these ones and the artificial life? The way of one and the other were created change their natures? It is however necessary to qualify the impact what biological synthesis could have on the way we consider life: how reminded François Le Fèvre, when «we synthesized urea, the first organic synthetic molecule, it has an entire debate to know if we created life or not»; and, how emphases Lluis Mir, we could ask same questions at the beginning of chemistry. Two hundred years later, it can make smile.

Control of the evolution of synthetic biology products
Synthetic biology leads to the creation of living organisms which should not have exist without the human intervention and are not the fruit of a natural evolution. Will be able to control it? We are not controlling mechanism of the information storage in the living world, and we are far to be able to predict how will behave a group from its separate elements. We create parts, but will be able to predict emergent properties of their assembling? Furthermore, synthetics organisms, because they are living, evolve; will we be, asked Thierry Magnin, « in measure to control propagation of these lively engines that we construct? » Thanks to their capacity to evolve, do they risk to escape to our control? Willy Rozenbaum observe that the pression responsible of the evolution will exist even for organisms which are not due to this pression; and that « it is more performant and less nocive that will go out of this; because these presion will stay ».

The benefits/risks ratio
To assess the risks and benefits of a science, we have to wonder for what it is intended, and if the risks are taken by beneficiaries. In the case of synthetic biology, risks are taken by the society and it must be the same for benefits. The financial interest of a small community does not have to harm the majority. Currently, the scientific community manages synthetic biology, but some applications, provided to generate significant revenues, might be developed despite the nuisance they cause."

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Pur"

Tsinghua,2011,Team:Tsinghua#modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," a random process, the probability of which is modulated by certain chemicals.
Assuming that movement of E. Coli is independent of each other, we propose that the probability for E. Coli to change its direction is directly proportional to the concentration of the chemoattractant around while the choice of direction is totally random.
With this assumption in mind, we first simulated the situation that all the bacteria start at the same position and move in a concentration gradient. Every time the bacteria choose to swim, they will move a unit length. The following is the scatter plot after 500 steps.
Simulated E. Coli movement. All the points started from (500, 500) and moved according to the model we proposed. The color from red to blue indicates the distance the bacteria migrated from the starting point. The blue eclipse shows the approximate shape of the colony formed.
Then we move onto the pattern formed by bacteria in a gradient in liquid. We assume that bacteria was uniformed in the media before the formation of the gradient and plotted the movement after 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500 steps.
Simulated E. coli movement in liquid. A total of 100,000 cells were uniformly distributed in the liquid at first and the program simulated the migration in a gradient. From x=0 to x=1000, the concentration of the chemoattractant increases, driving bacteria towards the right.
The region for E. coli to move is from x=0, y=0 to x=1000, y=1000. When a bacterium collides with the boundary, it will choose a new direction randomly. A counter was set to count all the bacteria which have crossed x=1000 at least once.
No obvious movement is seen in our simulation, but the counter reported the number of E. Coli that reached the end increases steadily.

When a bacterium reaches the end, it will randomly turn around. As it will rarely change its direction in the media rich in chemoattractant, it will migrate almost to the midpoint until it makes another turn. We can see that although over 70% cells have reached the end at least once in the last simulation, no accumulation of cells can be seen. Rather, only a small increase in the concentration of bacteria on the right seems visible in this simulation.

Ross, who’s almost finished his characterization, can start to support me in      my efforts. It’s kind of relieving, I was struggling to keep up with everything.

I'm starting the characterization of CysE-sfGFP, starting directly with MOPS mediums, i'm using always the same concentrations of arabinose. For the first time, I managed to see some expression also in MOPS with glucose, but it's really low. Still, there is something, and this means that inhibition by glucose levels is not perfect. This is something we can exploit, growth is faster than MOPS with glycerol and there is some expression, of course it's lower, but in our particolar case this levels of expression could be enough. Jason is starting with Ninhidryn tests so probably can tell us something more.      I didn't want to get caught unprepared when the application on statue began, so i started some tests on agar concentration that will allow us to set up a good protocol. I tested MOPS with different agar concentrations (1-6 g/l ) and 6g/l turned out to be quite perfect!      First tests on statues finally! I tried different approach, but the next day gel was dried out. I felt like I was light years away from the proper application, but I was sure that I could find the way to maintain the gel wet for at least 12 hours!      Me and Guzz did some tests on co-cultures, we want to see if there is some significant interference between CysE and CysDes transformed strains. There was. Looks like inducing both genes enhances expression of both genes. We are not so sure of what are we looking at, becouse we have no way to discriminate the contribution of one particular population respect to the other.
I dedicated this week to characterize my constructs K731400 and K731450 as I did for k731480 (without fluorimetric measurements, of course); and I also started AGAIN to construct the cursed BioBrick K731600. I will win this battle!

In addition to scientific research, the team participated in many collaborations with other teams and worked together to develop a human practices project geared towards educating the general public about synthetic biology, with potential expansion to school curricula.
Eleanor Amidei was one of the team leaders for Human Practices. She helped develop the proposal for and execution of our presentation at the Exploratorium. Additionally, Eleanor was in charge of construction of our parts to be sent to the Parts Registry. She has had her hand in almost everything done in the wetlab and has been instrumental in the continuation of final testing before the Jamboree. Eleanor will also represent the team by presenting at the Jamboree.
Sabrina Chu constructed the positive-feedback circuits containing alpha factor-responsive promoters driving rtTA expression (with Jessica Hsueh), which involved many rounds of troubleshooting and optimization. In the second half of the summer, she has lead circuit characterization through flow cytometry. Sabrina (along with Jeffrey Shu) has also been in charge of documentation and has completed the safety forms for the competition.
Shuaixin He worked on incorporating various methods of positive and negative feedback into our communication circuits. She created constructs with alpha-factor responsive promoters driving additional alpha factor production (positive-feedback) and worked on cloning the protease Bar1 as a means of negative feedback.
Jessica Hsueh constructed the positive-feedback circuits containing alpha factor-responsive promoters driving rtTA expression (with Sabrina Chu).  She was also our iGEM Collaboration Captain, managing interactions with 10 teams this summer. Jessica also participated in a workshop learning to program the collective behavior robots, Kilobots, making a simulation of our communication circuits.
Derrick Lee is a returning member from the 2013 iGEM team and helped train and mentor the new students for this year’s team. He constructed many parts over the summer, including alpha factor-responsive promoters in front of GFP and Ste2 (alpha factor receptor). He led promoter characterization on the flow cytometer and assisted in data analysis/presentation. Derrick used the promoter data to characterize our parts in the iGEM Parts Registry.
Jeffrey Shu was primarily in charge of strain construction in S. cerevisiae. With George Yip, he was responsible for building multiple yeast strains containing iterations of our primary circuit (pTEF1 and its mutants driving rtTA, pTET-alpha factor, and alpha factor-responsive promoters with mCherry/BFP).  Jeffrey was also one of our Human Practices captains and worked on establishing contact with the Exploratorium and has developed a curriculum for teaching students about Biotechnology."

Using NUPACK, we checked our switches had no base pairing in the ribosome binding site in both the off and on state and minimal secondary structure around the start codon in the on state. We also modelled the bound state, ensuring the structure around the RBS and start codon was correct in both the off and on state.
Having demonstrated that our design would work, we minimized the |∆GRBS-Linker|  via site directed mutagenesis (varying the sequence at specific sites). Making the |∆GRBS-Linker| as close to zero as possible maximizes the toehold switch output. This is discussed in more depth along with the other important parameters for toehold switch design on the design page .
However, NUPACK struggled to predict the specificity of the second series of switches as they had multi-step reactions. Additionally, we found that NUPACK was unable to match experimental data for molecular beacon specificity in our new form of riboregulators. Despite this, NUPACK  was suitable for accurately designing our first series of switches due to their simpler and more predictable nature.

Then, treating the plasmid distribution process as totally random distribution, the allocation of n plasmids into two son E.coli can be viewed as Bernoulli experiment for n times, from which the probability of i-plasmid parent producing a j-plasmid son is $$\delta_{i,j}=2C_i^j (\frac{1}{2})^j(\frac{1}{2})^{i-j}=\frac{C_i^j}{2^{i-1}}$$. If we mark each row by their intracellular plasmid number, and each column by the plasmid number of their offspring, a distribution possibility table can be listed. However, since the table is too large and lack of readability, we display it more intuitively by using a 3-dimensional plot, in which the x-axis is the plasmid number of parent E.coli, while the y-axis is the number of plasmids possessed by one of its son, the height of each point stands for the possibility of above reproduction.
E.coli growth rate
The growth rate of each E.coli can be controlled by an upper limitation of growth rate $\mu_{max}$, influenced by the number of plasmids $i$ contained, length of target gene incorporated, the culture concentration $S$, as well as the growth promoting effect $\gamma$ brought by the growth-promoter (glucose dehydrogenase). Referring to several well-established models, we form the individual growth rate at a given culture condition as $\mu(i,S) = \mu_{max} \frac{K}{K + i^n} \frac{S}{S+Ks}\gamma(i,S)$.
Equipped with theoretical formula, the change of individual growth rate with respect to several factors can be simulated:
I.Change of E.coli’s Growth Rate v.s. Change of Plasmid Number
II.Change of E.coli’s Growth Rate v.s. Change of Culture Concentration

We visited several other iGEM teams all around China during our short semester and summer vacation, including Peking University, Tianjin University, University of Science & Technology of China, Sun Yat-sen University as well as Hong Kong University of Science & Technology. These are all among the top universities in China, and some of them, such as TJU, PKU & USTC particularly acted as the iGEM pioneers in China. On the contrary, XMU participated in iGEM competition since 2011, which means this year is the second time we enjoy the competition. So the visiting to these schools not only strengthens the connection bonds between us, but also serves as a good chance for us to learn from others and make progress. Largely speaking, the visiting process greatly tightens relationships among these universities, making researchers in synthetic biology field much more harmonious in China.
Meet-up with HKUST iGEMers
Our team member Moson paid a visit to Hong Kong University of Science and Technology during July 23rd to 27th for a chemistry summer camp. For better communication between iGEM teams, Moson prepared to meet up HKUST iGEMers when time was available for both sides. Unfortunately, at that time, a terrible typhoon attacked Hong Kong. Due to the harsh weather, they had to rearrange the meeting time once and again.

Nonetheless, the promise of industrial and democratic modernity to bring welfare remains unchanged as decision-makers continue to exercise their power within the context of government since the regulatory framework originates from it (Beck 1999).
The uncertainty brought forward by the world risk society can therefore be equated with an institutional crisis that feeds into new structural arrangements in non-governmental enterprises. These arrangements are now confronted with new novel ways of constituting the social realm because of the new ‘open industrial politics’. In the process of moving away from the myopic self-referential tradition to perpetuate an existing industrial system, this new approach has gained prominence in its political dimensions. So, notwithstanding the pre-eminence of economic values in industrial entrepreneurship, leadership performance in this business increasingly depends on the amount of public trust in relation to ecological concerns and responsibilities. This becomes even more pertinent when the technology is utilised to engender the aspired economic progress as it is tailored for increased industrial performance, hence understating environmental and social legitimacy (Beck 1999).
Chapter 4: The Playful Professional and Sustainable Governance
iGEM: Counter-intuitive Governance
In this final chapter, the position of scientific authority in the governance of science will be discussed in relation to how iGEM operates. The expectations of both experts and lay people has undergone a shift toward an understanding in which the distinction between the two has blurred. This evolution, and the emergence of iGEM generally, has enabled the global unfolding of synthetic biology. What is characteristic about this, according to Zhang (2012), is the significance of some elements in the governance of synthetic biology that can be considered ‘counter-intuitive’. Firstly, iGEM is said to act as a ‘scientific building block’ that operates as “a transnational body that defines and characterises new materials, metrology and testing methods, and provides the grounds for international standardisation and regulatory convergence” (Zhang 2012: 2). Every year the competition brings as much to the development of synthetic biology as other more traditional scientific organisations and institutions do. The way this has been noticed or observed is through the methods of collection and categorisation of BioBricks, and by the way standards and codes of conduct are evolving. Secondly, a counter-intuitive dimension of science governance can be found in the social and educational role of iGEM. By means of global access to the necessary materials and an open-source model in the sharing of genetic constructions, iGEM has enabled a setting in which the students, as scientists in the making, are embedded"

Pavia (pronounced Pavìa, [paˈviˑa]), the ancient Ticinum, is a town and comune of south-western Lombardy, northern Italy, 35 km south of Milan on the lower Ticino river near its confluence with the Po. It has a population of c. 71,000. The city achieved its greatest political importance between 568 and 774, as the capital of the Kingdom of the Lombards.
Pavia is the capital of a fertile province known for agricultural products including wine, rice, cereals, and dairy products. Some industries located in the suburbs do not disturb the peaceful atmosphere which comes from the preservation of the city's past and the climate of study and meditation associated with its ancient University. The University of Pavia, together with the IUSS (Institute for Advanced Studies of Pavia), the Ghislieri College, the Borromeo College, the Nuovo College, the Santa Caterina College and the EDiSU, belongs to the Pavia Study System. Furthermore, Pavia is the see city of the Roman Catholic diocese of Pavia.

History
Dating back to pre-Roman times, the town of Pavia (then known as Ticinum) was a municipality and an important military site under the Roman Empire.
Here, in 476, Odoacer defeated Flavius Orestes after a long siege. To punish the city for helping the rival, Odoacer destroyed it completely. However, Orestes was able to escape to Piacenza, where Odoacer followed and killed him, deposing his son Romulus Augustus. This was commonly considered the end of the Western Roman Empire.
A late name of the city in Latin was Papia (probably related to the Pope), which evolved to the Italian name Pavia. Sometimes it's been referred to as Ticinum Papia, combining both Latin names.

   Actually, there are many JAK-STAT pathways in human cell. JAK and STAT are important components of many cytokine receptor systems. According to combination of the receptor, JAK and STAT, there exits many pathways which acts different works in eukaryotic cell. Among these pathways, we choose IL-6α, JAK1, STAT3 pathway. In this pathway, gp130 dimer and LMO4 are combined with JAK1, and assists a whole response. Why we selected the IL-6α specially? That is, IL-6α is a unique receptor which has a Ig-like region at outer part as different with other cytokine receptors. The introduction of IL-6α, gp130, and LMO4 are below.
Gene Activation for Output
STAT1 and STAT3 proteins with the formation of STAT3/3 and STAT1/3 dimers are confirmed using probe, namely the APRE probe. APRE probe(Acute-phase response element probe) is the acute phase responsive element of the α2M gene promoter and known to bind STAT1 and STAT3 proteins. Using this pathway, we altered the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene instead of cytokine inducible genes. So, we could show GFP expression through the previous whole pathway.[Fig. 5]
  FGF signaling pathway
  We use FGF signaling pathway(FGF-2) which acts critical role in Craniosynostosis in suture closure. Whole pathway of FGF signaling change osteoblast cell activity eventually. In that one, We focused on osteopontin expression.
Fig 8. FGF signaling Pathway. Red line pathway is selected in our project.
FGF-2s(Fibroblast Growth Factor-2) binds to FGFR(Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor)
There are Syndecan-2 which help signal pathway of FGF in membrane. It make FGFR to activate to pass the signal.
There are FOS and JUN proteins in cytoplasm.(In addtion, FOS and JUN mRNA synthesize more when FGF-2 signal binds.) Especially, c-FOS and c-JUN attach each other and form AP-1(Activate Protein 1).
Changed FGFR and FGF-2 composition activate AP-1.
Activated AP-1 can bound to DNA and osteopontin gene is expressd.
  Like this,FGF signaling pathways have only 5 steps while RAS-MAP pathway require 9 steps,"

As a team led by students, we believe fostering youth interest in STEM should be a key pillar to one’s goals. Although we will not likely be the generation to colonize Mars, we are as important, if not more, to establish the fundamental research and information vital to future Mars missions. We hope that our efforts as a student-driven research team will show that passion in the STEM fields pushes for innovation in our world.
Our team has communicated with several other teams, such as
uAlberta
, iGem
Gifu
and iGEM TEC CEM. Thank you for your collaboration and suggestions! We are also extremely thankful for the help and support we received from our mentor team,
UAlberta
, in our InterLab study. We would not be where we are today without their advice and aid.
We successfully conducted two major fundraising events: a bottle drive and Summer SYNBIO. For the bottle drive, our team was able to engage with various communities across Edmonton as we collected bottles, stopping to tell Edmontonians about our project and purpose. Our second fundraising event was a three-hour occasion with presentations, science workshops, and a silent auction. We wanted to engage our community in our project, educate the public about synthetic biology, and present the importance of science in general. We based our presentations on some of the concerns and suggestions presented through interviews of students and researchers on campus; expanding the perception of genetic modification as a means of programming rather than taking resources away from those on Earth. In order to host the silent auction, we asked local businesses for gift cards and promo items, and despite this having been our first time planning a silent auction, we managed to get in contact with over 50 local businesses. Without the gracious donations and support of various business, our event would not have been able to happen. We would like to thank everyone who attended the night of fun and engaging science presentations!

Doing so allowed us to engage with a younger audience in a way that was more specific to our project. We had generated a great response during outreach events using other store-bought, general fluffy microbes, so we knew that making our own relevant ones would be a great tool.

UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Project#Honeybee Silk_-_-_TEXT.html," protein (sfGFP), which will act as our proof of principle that silk can be functionalized while still maintaining exceptional physical properties. Our second fusion is silk fused to SpyCatcher protein, which would allow for the capture of any protein modified to contain the short SpyTag peptide.
Methodology
Although previous literature has shown that wild type honeybee silk is composed of four highly similar proteins, we decided to only produce one. This decision was based on the result of Tara Sutherland's research, which claimed to be able to produce honeybee fibers with comparable physical properties to wild type fibers using only one of the four proteins. The protein they used was AmelF3, which is the protein we focused on.   We obtained the sequence of the AmelF3 gene from genbank.( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/100192201), synthesized it using IDT’s synthesis service and used this construct as our baseline sequence from which to construct our biobricks. Because we aimed to express honeybee silk protein, we added regulatory elements such as promoters and ribosome binding sites to several our constructs. Two of our biobricks represent fusion proteins between silk and another functional protein. The first fusion biobrick is silk fused to sfGFP( BBa_K1763015 ), which will serve as our proof of principle that honeybee silk can be functionalized while still retaining its mechanical properties. The second fusion biobrick is honeybee silk fused to SpyCatcher protein, which allow for capture of and protein modified to contain a Spytag peptide.( BBa_K1763008 ) Additionally, we fused sfGFP to AmelF3. Please see our list of biobricks ( Parts ) and the respective biobrick pages for more detailed design information and characterization of each biobrick.
In addition to creating honeybee genetic constructs, we needed protocols to express and purify honeybee silk proteins. We drew heavily from previous literature by T. Sutherland that had established a method of expressing and purifying honeybee silk proteins.  According to previous literature, honeybee silk proteins aggregate and form insoluble inclusion bodies within the e. coli cell. Therefore, it is reported that these proteins can be purified by lysing the cells and collecting the insoluble fraction. In order to determine protein concentration. Furthermore, because we wanted to use a T7 promoter to drive expression of our honeybee constructs, therefore, we used a strain of bacteria that expressed T7 polymerase, BL21 (DE3).  For more detailed descriptions of our protein expression and purification, please see our lab notebook entries"

Education & Public Engagement
Beyond the lab, iGEM is a synthetic biology competition whose one major goal is to spread all around the world creativity and engineering possibilities that biology can offer to address and solve current problems. Education and public engagement embodies this policy and encouraging us to share this knowledge to people by teaching, exchanging and engaging. Boundaries exist between scientists and people who often do not understand each other. Scientific mediation through education and public engagement is the best way to raise awareness and get close to people. That is what we tried to accomplish through different speeches and contributions.
Microorganism Awareness: Make Bacteria Great Again
Given that our project was based on bioproduction by microorganisms, we considered the microorganisms reputation in society. Often associated with disease because of pathogenic bacteria, microorganisms have a pretty bad reputation in France. Ensuring people that our project is safe is a base of Human Practices, so to provide a project that will reach people, we needed to prove that our work in lab was responsible as much as its components. To observe people opinon and to inform them about microorganism’s diversity and utility, we conducted a survey explaining our project and the possibilities of using microorganism for bioproduction ( click here to see the survey ). Moreover, Giovanna Pinaud, a student in scientific journalism, wrote a report on our relationship with microorganisms through History and their reality. She also presented our project and opened a discussion about the dangers of sugar and the need for prevention in sugar-related diseases, introducing Psicose ( find the report here ).
The Diabetes LAB
Still in our will to promote prevention around such diseases, our collaboration with the French Federation of Diabetics (FFD) led to our integration to the Diabete Lab. As we presented it in our integrated human practices, the Diabetes Lab is a community structure whose the purpose is to gather Diabetes stakeholders with diabetic people to provide better tools and applications to ease diabetics everyday life. Our integration with the organisation was very satisfying because"
SJTU-Software,2015,Team:SJTU-Software#project_-_-_TEXT.html," factor has only 5 values, so we just simply score it as a arithmetic progression. As for the other two factors, the distribution of values seems very unbalanced. And since we can be convinced that a brick is good when it’s used several tens times and the feedbacks are good, there’s no need to force a brick to get used for a thousand times before it’s recommended to other users, though some of the parts are actually used hundreds or even thousands of times. So we calculate the score by the expression below.             Score=log(n+1)/log(nmax+1)             The n in the expression refers to the values. By using this expression, we reduce the effect of extreme values and make the scores more convincing.
And the optimized weight of the factors are shown in the table below.

The above scoring system are used to evaluate all the bricks in our databases. It become effective in all the functions except upload. However, we still have another scoring system for devices.
2.Devices scoring method with relationship between parts
This method is mainly used in the evaluation function. For a device which is just designed by users, the score we get through the first method actually mean nothing, as there’re no information for the device on the registry. So we need to develop a new evaluation system based on its composing parts and relationships between the parts.
When evaluating the relationships between parts, we take several factors into consideration, such as the frequency and the average score when the parts are used together and so on.
Firstly the weight of the two aspects is confirmed. The default ratio is 65% for the parts and 35% for the relationships. In the first aspect, given that wet lab researchers care more about the outcome of a device, the weight of coding types is 80% while that of others is 20%. But in the second aspect, all relationships between coding parts and others share the same weight.
Since there’re two scoring system for devices, the weight in the second one is adjusted to make the scores made by different method close so that scores for new devices can have the comparability with those already in the database.

We released the video about the Big Bang Science Fair today, featuring interviews with several of the attendants there. We also started to write up the CRISPR proposal for the “CRISPR Design and DNA support” offered by Twist Bioscience and Desktop Genetics.
We skyped with Purdue for the second time and arranged a collaboration together. We have a Google Drive folder set up so it’s easier for us to communicate and request help from each other. Purdue will be running a continuous culture of a killswitch developed by Purdue’s previous iGEM team and sending us the data, and we’ll be helping them write up summaries of past team projects for their project database.

Today, we started the day meeting with Dr Paul James and Dr Chloe Singleton to recap our project idea, and the receive feedback from them on the approach we should be taking towards it, and how to better structure and word our CRISPR proposal. It was quite reassuring to have them both quite positive about our idea.
Leanne and Emily met with Dr Nicky King again to discuss what we have so far for the synthetic biology module we are writing. It was incredibly useful, as Dr King gave us advice on several different module structures we could look at and several other academics we could talk to. She seems very enthusiastic about our idea, offering to propose it to the Natural Sciences and the Biosciences committee at the start of first term to find out if it’s something we can implement.
We also redid headshots and our team photo, as everyone was present today and the previous image sizes were not appropriate for the wiki. We definitely like these ones, and it’s great to have the whole student side of the team together!

Big thanks also go to ""Baltic Clippers"" tourism and travel company and especially Tatjana Pavlova, who helped us to catch the best flight offers. We are kindly grateful for Vilnius Tourism and Information center for their booklets about Lithuania. We want to thank Association of Lithuanian Natural Sciences Olympiad, together with Vilius Malūnavičius and Rūta Leinartaitė for helping us out with the technical paperwork.
Laboratory support
For every kind of advices we are saying a big thank you to a mathematician Irus Grinis, the bioinformatics team at the Institute of Biotechnology (dr. Visvaldas Kairys and dr. Darius Kazlauskas) We got big help with the modeling from Juozas Gordevičius. During the hard days in the lab we are grateful for having an opportunity to seek for advices from our principal investigator prof. Virginijus Šikšnys, prof. Rolandas Meškys, dr. Giedrius Gasiūnas, PhD. Justas Lazutka, dr. Tomas Šinkūnas and PhD. Inga Songailienė. The InterLab Measurement project would have been be much harder without the advices from prof. Edita Sužiedelienė and Julita Armalytė. Big thanks go to PhD. Inga Songailienė for sharing laboratory techniques such as fluorescence measurements, Western blot and others.
Fundraising support
To achieve the required funds would be even much harder without ""Enterprise Lithuania"" advices and financial support from our prime sponsors “Thermofisher Scientific” in a friendly communication of dr. Egidijus Jaseliūnas, as well as “Neurotechnology” with a well-organized sponsorship by Algimantas Malickas and Irmantas Naujikas and Vilnius University.

Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Project#Carotenoids_-_-_TEXT.html," we were told that it was solely an error in annotation. The registry entry for K152005 has been updated to the sequence in the table above.
Teams of previous years constructed various composite parts containing two or more enzymes of the synthetic pathways (e.g. CrtEBI, CrtEBIY), but they were not available in the 2009 Distribution Plates.
Our Action Plan
In our project this year, we aim to incorporate the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in E. coli and produce different coloured pigments. Potential candidates are lycopene (red), beta-carotene (orange), and zeaxanthin (yellow). Since these three compounds are sequential in the biosynthetic pathway, we hope to demonstrate colour changes from red to orange to yellow, by controlling expression of the enzymes involved in conversion.
Our action plan is as follows:
1. Test the activity of K152005 (CrtEBIY) .
2. Test pigment production in E. coli strain MG1655 and its derivative (up-regulation in precursors) .
3. Construct composite biobrick containing CrtE, CrtB and CrtI (i.e. CrtEBI) and test its activity .
4. Transform E. coli with CrtEBI and CrtY. Test if activation of CrtY can cause colour changes in vivo .
5. Characterise our composite biobricks and the colour output .
6. Test compatibility with biobricks from previous iGEM teams and see if we can convert their outputs into pigment production .
Our Action Plan (Updated regularly). Green: completed. Yellow: Work in progress. Blue: Partially completed. Red: Planning.
Test activity of K152005
Close-up of K152005 in TOP10
We wish to test the feasibility of incorporating the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway into E. coli, which does not produce carotenoids naturally. K152005 contains the enzymes for beta-carotene formation, and is a quick way to verify our concept.
We transformed E. coli (TOP10) using K152005 from the 2009 Distribution Plate ( Week 2 ). After incubation for about 3 days, some light yellowish pigmention was visible. The long incubation time may be due to the fact that K152005 does not contain promoter. Although only small amount of yellow pigment was observed*** (instead of the expected orange colour), this gave us confidence that the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway was working in E. coli. ***Later experiments showed that the yellow pigment was probably not beta-car"

Human practice outside the lab
As we concerned, human practice is not only associated with the publicity of synthetic biology but also what significance we can achieve basing on our project. This year SZU-iGEM team has conducted a survey and interviewed professor Mr Caizhiming to find that the patient’s psychological state would largely influence the process of cure.Referring to the Group psychotherapy, we organized a meetup and invited a few veterans on defending against cancer for the cancer patients to heal their isolation. From the meetup the patients learned the significance of a stable psychological state and receive care and encouragement from us. When seeing the patients from sobbing to burst into laughter, we felt obliged to make a difference in their lives.

Education and public engagement
As for the education,SZU-iGEM team visited primary school students this year to illustrate the basic knowledge about synthetic biology and our project. It’s surprising for us to see their strong interest regarding to cancer,biology that some students came with more questions to ask after the lecture. Inspired and influenced by students’ passion, we decided to undertake to be their mentors on biological research and personal development. In terms of public engagement, we participated the Cultural Festival of Life and science in which exhibited our projects to the university students. Nevertheless we visited cancer patients in the hospital where we share our concerns and our project to extend hope for them.

The exhibition was composed of four parts: disease treatment, biopharmaceuticals, disease detection, and environmental management. Each team was responsible for one part. And teams from Sichuan University and team from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China completed forewords and conclusion respectively. We printed the posters a week ahead of the exhibition, and laid them out in Chengdu Library one day in advance. The exhibition lasted for 7 days. On the first day, the four teams went to the library early to distribute leaflets and small gifts to the public in the rest areas and outside the library. We introduced our theme to those readers, answered their questions, had discussions with them on genetic modification, and collected suggestions from them. The audience was very absorbed, and many said they had a more objective and comprehensive understanding about genetic modification, which makes us feel very rewarding. The four teams worked on the maintenance, publicity and explanation of the exhibition for the following days, and removed the posters and cleared the exhibition hall together on the last day.
Safety Consulting
In the preliminary development of the Staphylococcus aureus QS system, we contacted the teachers of the Department of Infection of Southwest Hospital and the department of microbiology, consulting with Staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity and biosafety level, which, doctor Li from the Department of Infection introduced to us within recent years, the hospital’s infection situation. The hospital’s acquired infection is always an unavoidable problem, at the same time, professor Wang systematically introduced us with the Staphylococcus aureus biosafety level and experimental operation of the standard process, with provide an basic understanding of Staphylococcus aureus in the initiation of the project.

Pick a clone from Step 2, and prepare a bacterial culture in a suitable flask filled with 20 ml or more of 2YT medium with 100 mM glucose. Glucose must be added as it prevents MP activation, and thereby keeps cells intact. Incubate the culture until an OD600 of 0.6-0.8 is reached. At this time bacterial cells are in exponential stage and can be safely infected by phages. Step 4: Glycerol stocks
Take 5 ml from step 3 to prepare glycerol stocks (see respective protocol; a main stock of 1 ml and several aliquots of 100 µl), and store them at -80 °C. Step 5: Centrifugation and MP activation
Centrifuge 10 ml or more of culture for 10 min at 3750 g to pellet your bacterial cells. The cultures result either from step 3 or while PREDCEL performance from glycerol stock aliquot culture with an OD600 of 0.6-0.8, that needs to be prepared early enough to minimize time between gain of phage supernatant and new infection round. If culture reaches the respective OD600 too fast, dilute the culture until you can infect with phages or cool on ice if it takes less than 10 minutes until infection. Afterwards, resolve your cell pellet in a 150 ml flask with a volume of 2YT equal to the volume spun down containing 100 mM arabinose to induce MP. Step 6: Phage infection
Infect with a suitable amount of phages. As titers of inoculation phage can vary a lot a MOI of 1 is recommended for PREDCEL rather than giving a specific inoculation volume. MOI of 1 means that there is one phage per cell in solution. In contrast, while performing PREDCEL, define a certain phage supernatant volume you kept at 4°C to be transferred, for instance 1 ml, as phage titer cannot be determined fast enough by plaque assays to calculate the right MOI. Make sure you have at least 1 ml of phage supernatant left to analyze. Transfer the same amount of phages used for infection into a phage"

Collaborations
This year, we attached much importance to communication and collaborating with other teams.                     Our collaboration could be divided into two parts, collaborating with other iGEM teams and biology companies.
Other iGEM Teams
Through two iGEMer conferences, the Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) and the 5th iGEM Asia Conference,                       we got to know a lot of iGEM teams in Asia, through friendly communication, we reached some effective collaboration.
University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)
USTC-Software is one iGEM team which also concentrated on developing useful software for bio-brick researchers.                                          The similar interest and purpose helped us two teams to work together. During the collaboration,                                          it was their members’ experience that made us realize we should make improvements.                                          They identified the problem that some data in bio-bricks database was inaccurate and these parts should be removed.                                          We have not noticed it before, and we removed some inaccurate bio-bricks from the database according to their suggestions.                                         If not removed, these bio-bricks may cause wrong search results.                                          Moreover, we tested their software Biohub 2.0 and gave some useful suggestions on safety and design.                                          The cooperation between two teams made a “win-win” situation which we were both delighted to see.
SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai
To strength communications between collegiate teams and high school teams, we had a in-depth conversation with Shanghai United International School. We exchanged constructive and meaningful opinions on many topics, like the the future tendency on high school level’s development of biotechnology, how to attract more high school to attend iGEM, what can be done to improve cooperation between high schools and colleges and the some problems high school teams are faced with etc.. We concluded that the most serious problems hat most high school teams faced is lacking experience of doing practical bioengineering and necessary professional scientific knowledge,. We came up the idea to build a well-spread network among high school teams to increase the efficiency of information exchange to promote the communication and cooperation. This will also provide the platform and opportunities for collegiate teams to contact and help high school team. What’s more, they have a project"

Teams participating were Stanford-Brown, UC Santa Cruz, Santa Clara University, SF Bay Area DIY Bio, and ourselves. We had the opportunity to present our work through talks and posters, and even had time to socialize and hang out!
This Meetup was part of a larger conference, the Sierra Systems and SynBio Symposium, which our group integrally co-organized with the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) and Synberc (see more on our Practices Page ). This two-day event gave the chance for undergraduate students from various class levels to present their findings and network with local iGEM teams. Students in lab positions (not related to iGEM) were also part of this opportunity. During this symposium, session topics ranged widely from “protein structure and degradation” and “drug interactions and genomics,” to “biosynthesis and metabolism.” We even set up a four-person graduate school panel for students to open a forum for questions and inspire the students to continue their education. Since there was ample time for us to communicate and spend time with other iGEMers, we were able to share ideas, help each other with concepts, and deepen our understanding of life around us.

All runs simulate 1000 cells, which should be sufficient to get stable averages. The model assumes well-mixed conditions in each cell, but considers each cell independently.  The model has no cut off for maximum values of relE, as we don’t know the exact relation between relE concentration and hibernation state, yet as a functional cutoff is found through wake-up times, it is not necessary.

Scandinavian iGEM weekend

Like many other countries, we also wanted to have a regional pre-meeting. Since Sweden is a small country, we invited all Scandinavian teams to the first Scandinavian iGEM meetup, for a weeked with project presentations, lectures and a visit from Herbert Boyer. It ended with 35 happy iGEM:ers meeting during a weekend in Uppsala. Read more...
Parts sent to other teams
Back to top
The 2011 Uppsala team made some BioBrick parts that are very popular, but were not included in the 2012 kit. Work has continued on the chromoproteins this year. They have been sent to and further characterized by a number of other teams around the world.
Groningen
Team Groningen from the Netherlands is constructing the ""Food Warden"", a  project to get a visible output from Bacillus subtilis when rotten meat volatiles are present.  The recieved the amilCP (blue) and amilGFP (yellow) chromoproteins, and implemented them in B subtilis with wonderful results !
Columbia-Cooper
Team Columbia-Cooper in New York develops a method of etching circuit boards using bacteria. For this, the blue light sensor FixJ had potential to be very useful. They also requested the amilCP (blue) and amilGFP (yellow) chromoproteins, which we happily provided as agar stabs.

HebrewU,2018,Team:HebrewU#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," on a cation rather than via the scavenging of a radical by molecular 02. The first step in this proposed mechanism is the one-electron oxidation of I by the oxidized enzyme intermediate LiP compound I, resulting in the formation of the aryl cation radical A. The LiP oxidation of a variety of nonphenolic aromatics to their corresponding aryl cation radicals has been well established. Indeed, the LiP oxidation of the related nonchlorinated compound dibenzop-dioxin to a cation radical has been reported. However, DCDD is considerably less soluble than dibenzo-p-dioxin. Furthermore, chloride is a much better leaving group than hydrogen; therefore, the aryl cation radical A is probably short-lived. For these reasons, the cation radical A was not detected during the oxidation of DCDD by LiP.
Attack of H20 at the cation would result in the loss of chloride and the formation of the carbon-centered radical intermediate B. One-electron oxidation of B by LiP or MnP would result in the formation of the cation intermediate C. Attack of H20 on intermediate C would lead to the first C--O-C bond cleavage and the formation of the quinone intermediate D. Subsequent oxidation of the phenolic function of D would generate the phenoxy radical E, which is in resonance with the carbon-centered radical E'. Oxidation of E' by either LiP or MnP would yield the cation F. Finally, attack of H20 on the cation F would result in the cleavage of the second C-O-C bond and generation of 4-chloro-1,2-benzoquinone (V) and 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (VIII). In the metabolic pathway, both chlorine atoms are removed from the aromatic rings as chloride before ring cleavage takes place. This is advantageous because the possible formation of toxic chlorinated aliphatics is avoided. Indeed, peroxidasecatalyzed oxidative dechlorination followed by reduction of the quinone products results in the introduction of phenolic groups, which facilitate subsequent ring opening. Similar peroxidase-catalyzed oxidative dechlorinations of polychlorinated phenols have been reported.
We propose that a similar metabolic pathway is probably involved in the fungal degradation of TCDD and have initiated studies to examine its metabolism.2
