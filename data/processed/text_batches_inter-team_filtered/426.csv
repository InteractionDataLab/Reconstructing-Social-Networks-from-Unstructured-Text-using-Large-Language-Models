TEC-Costa_Rica,2016,Team:TEC-Costa Rica#Project#System#Detection_-_-_TEXT.html," Due to the potencial of targeting the genome there’s a lot of research in Cas9 applications. One approach elucidates that the Cas9 protein tolerates protein domain insertions at specific sites of the sequence without affecting the binding nor the activity (Oakes et al, 2016).
Thinking of an interesting approach of modifying the detection system and nor the response part we started to look up points of interest for insertions. Cas9 insertion were validated inserting random PDZ, a 86 amino acid domain, into the DNA sequence of the protein using transposons; finding a lot of hotspots in the sequence but specially in six clusters, including the HNH domain defined Oakes et al (2016). As we saw the HNH domain is a key component in the dCas9 activity, so we define this hotspots as a posible insertion site.
Inserting various domain into the Cas9 protein it’s possible but it has some considerations. Cas9 or dCAs9 could tolerate multiple domain insertions while retaining its activity; however three or more insertions could lead into a considerable decrease of the activity, in the experiment case repressing GFP expression argued Oakes et al (2016). We decided to use a multiple insertion strategy to create the detection chassis as shown in Figure 2. We chose pairs of hotspots based on our structural modelling and finally define two events: version A with Leucine L390 - Glutamic acid E802 and version B with Asparagine N588-Asparagine N888 as hotspots.

Design
1. dCas9
We were able to design two dCas9 that allow protein insertions in two sets of hotspots. For testing these spots, we created an A and B version of the protein: A-dCas9 BBa_K1903001 accepts protein insertions in amino acids L390 and E802; these hotspots come close when dCas9 binds to the target molecule, which could trigger a reaction between the proteins inserted in the sites. On the other hand, B-dCas9 BBa_K1903002 allows insertions in amino acids N588 and N888 and these sites come close since the sgRNA binds to the dCas9.
For designing these proteins we used Streptococcus pyogenes’s Cas9 (Uniprot accession Q99ZW2) optimized for E.coli and mutated for being catalytically inactive (mutations D10A and H840A). We added a Double Terminator (BBa_B0015) at the"

Maker Faire: Building With Biology
The Maker Faire is a two day event where scientists, engineers and other “makers” gather to promote their craft to the public. We partnered with the Atlanta Science Festival in hosting the venue where the public could learn about synthetic biology. The events we hosted were from a kit provided by Building with Biology, a foundation dedicated to the education of synthetic biology to the public. The activities provided included a simple DNA extraction, a simulation of CRISPR/Cas9, and graffiti wall where attendees wrote down their thoughts on synthetic biology.  The event was a great success in educating the public. People of all ages enjoyed the DNA extraction and children especially liked the CRISPR/Cas9 simulation. The graffiti wall also stimulated many conversations on synthetic biology. For instance, many people who were initially wary of genetic engineering ended up appreciating its uses in medicine. Overall, people enjoyed learning about such a confusing topic in an easy to understand way. Over 500 people visited us throughout the duration of the event and learned more about applications of synthetic biology in the world around us.  We could not have hosted this event without the Georgia State University iGEM team and the Atlanta Science Festival. In addition to providing materials for us, the two groups also contributed volunteers to help with our activities.
Atlanta Science Festival
The Atlanta Science Festival is an annual event in Georgia where interested people of all ages are able to learn more about science and see how it affects our daily lives. Our iGEM team was chosen to host a Discovery Dialogue discussing genetically modified organisms with the public. A group of experts, including a professor of chemical engineering, an ethicist, and several scientists, initially discussed aspects of GMOs in their career field, and then responded to audience questions. Overall, the forum was extremely educational and the audience polls taken reported a 32% increase in positive perception of GMOs. The panelists provided a balanced view of GMOs, discussing both the benefits and drawbacks. Some positives of GMOs they mentioned were the decreasing use of pesticides, the ability to cure malnutrition, and more nutritionally beneficial plants. The major drawback discussed was not knowing the long term effects of genetically modified organisms. Many participants admitted they focused more on the negative effects of GMOs, and were glad to hear a new perspective"

XJTLU-CHINA,2015,Team:XJTLU-CHINA#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," asked people this question to find if they knew the application of synthetic biology. Result was that most of people considered that conventional industries such as agriculture, cottonocracy and oil industry could be replaced by bio-synthesis. Particularly, the majority of people chose oil because they know biofuels have been widely used. However, only a few people knew that synthetic biology could be applied in metallurgic area as well.
Question 3
Have you ever heard about bio-safety before?
您在这份调查之前是否听说过生物安全？
Biosafety is an important issue in biological research as well as human society. We wanted to find if people knew about bio-safety and we hoped they could pay attention to bio-safety after this survey. Result was that less than a half people heard about bio-safety before and over a half people did not consider about safe problem. Therefore, we provided some information about biosafety after they answered this question; they could learn and start to think about bio-safe problem.
Provided information: Biosafety is the prevention of large-scale loss of biological integrity, focusing both on ecology and human health. These prevention mechanisms include conduction of regular reviews of the biosafety in laboratory settings, as well as strict guidelines to follow. Biosafety is used to protect us from harmful incidents. A complete understanding of experimental risks associated with synthetic biology is helping to enforce the knowledge and effectiveness of biosafety.
Question 4
Some people consider that modern biotechnologies including synthetic biotechnology may cause problem in safety of human society. do you agree or disagree?
有人认为现代生物技术包括合成生物学技术会对人类社会安全带来严重问题。你是否同意这个观点？
Modern biotechnologies improve the development of human society in many areas, for example clinical treatment, biofuels and GMOs. Nonetheless, some people worry that biotechnologies may cause ethic or safe problem in human society. Hence, we ask people this question to find their opinions about biotechnologies. Result was that 32.5% of people agreed that synthetic biotechnology may cause safe problems. While, 28.75% of people considered it was absolutely safe. However, over one third people were not sure that it had positive effect or negative effect. We thought many people in China did not accept biotechnology, they worry it would be harmful to their heath. We should do more work to ensure the safety of biotechnology so that more people will trust it.

The culturing tubes of the transformants from the Transformation protocol were kept in the 4°C fridge. No colonies were observed in the plate the next day. To troubleshoot why the cells did not grow, plasmids were isolated from the inoculation tube with the transformed culture that was kept in the 4°C fridge. Confirmation digest was performed on these plasmids. The gel electrophoresis did not work. Therefore, we decided to redigest our gblock, ligate, and transform it again.   Our fadE and fadD DNA inserts from IDT were digested with HindIII/SalI and SalI/KpnI, respectively following the Restriction Digest protocol. A salt solution was made to adjust the final salt concentrations. After heat inactivation, the digested DNA was stored at -20°C for the weekend.
Week 12 (July 17 -July 21, 2017):
The ligated pET29b(+)-phaC and pET29b(+)-phaCJ were transformed into competent DH5α cells and plated on Kan LB agar plates. Colonies appeared on these plates. A master plate and overnight cultures were made to screen these transformants. The overnight culture was used to isolate plasmids from. The plasmids were digested and screened for confirmation of insert and directionality. The enzymes used are shown below along with their respective restriction sites and expected band size. The screening results showed that there was no insert.

""CLC bio"" and ""Epoch Life Science"" are the latest businesses to offer support to Team St Andrews. The former promises CLC bio Main Workbenches to members of the team while the latter offers products and expertise in DNA/ RNA preparation for molecular manipulation.
""Metal Binding Protein"" Weekly Summary
""After a short meeting (which was dominated by the excitement of receiving our very own iGEM pins) we decided to split our iGEM family of nine into three groups.  Josi, Veronica and Yiwang were to look into Omega-3 production; Constantine, Michael and I were to investigate Metal Binding Proteins and Antti, Alexey and Zoe were to focus on setting up the wiki.
The wiki team duly produced a sophisticated template.
The research teams, however, were unanimously agreed that biology is hard.  Our motif quickly became standardised.  Read, Think, Re-read, Re-think, Repeat.
After three days, our previously nomadic team settled in the University’s new Biomedical Sciences Research Complex.  This proved to be a good move as it was followed by breakthroughs on all fronts.  Metal binding peptides were located in their tens and the decision was made to try and express them on the surface of cells in display proteins as well as cytosolically.  A membrane protein was found, preliminary peptides selected, and a primer design tutorial set up for the following Monday.  All this success left us with one very important and so far unanswered question- how exactly are"

Overview
Based on modeling work, we find that negative feedback can contribute to the network’s adaptation to DNA copy number variation. So we analysed the following three-node networks, A and B. The difference between A and B is the output nodes of network A has negative feedback. We transfected this two circuits into mammalian cells (Hela cell). By testing the mean value of EYFP (Enhance Yellow Fluorescent Protein, the output of our circuits), and the relationship between the EYFP and the DNA copy number, we can prove the hypothesis.
Construction
We constructed the following circuit A ,B and C .The circuit A corresponds to the network A ,while the circuit B is the implementation of network B. Circuit C is used as a control design to testify the function of A and B. In circuit A, as we can see, the input is miR-21, which can repress the plasmid pz371 and K1116002(The plasmid’s information can be found in parts). K1116002 induced by rtTA and Dox, serves as an auxiliary node, producing the LacI gene to inhibit the expression of EYFP. EYFP(Enhance Yellow Fluorescent Protein )is used as output. Besides, the miR-FF3 restrains the expression of LacI. The reason that we get the most of post-transcriptional control can be seen in Supplementary text. In circuit B, however, the plasmid K1116003 does not have FF3 target, leading to the contrast between circuit A and B. We can see miR-21 can’t target at pZ349 and pZ331 in circuit C , that is, there is no input in circuit C. The miR-21, used to distinguish cancer cell from normal cells ,is endogenous in Hela cell.

Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Math Book#CRISPRi_-_-_TEXT.html,"y state assumption for that reaction, which requires that it reach equilibrium on a much faster time scale than the rest of the system. We thus defined a range for the possible values based on the other model parameters
Details on the more roundabout estimations are given below:
Production of dCas9 from dCas9 mRNA
We were unable to find a peptide chain elongation rate for S. aureus, so instead we used the values reported in BioNumber 107869
which gives a range of 0.59-3.17 amino acids per second per ribosome in Streptomyces coelicolor, another gram-positive bacteria. Freiburg's dCas9 part from last year
is composed of 1372 amino acids. This translates to a range of 0.0258 to 0.1386 dCas9 molecules per minute per ribosome.
We were unable to find ribosome densities in S. aureus, but found two different estimates for ribsosome density in Bionumbers: 0.22 ribosomes per 100 codons (i.e. per 3 nt coding sequence)
and 3.46 ribosomes per 100 codons
. Using our assumption of 3 nt:1 amino acid, we then multiply to get the 0.0057-0.4797 range of dCas9 molecules per minute.
Degradation rate of dCas9
We were unable to find any specific data on dCas9 degradation, so instead we used a protein half-life of sarA measured in S. Aureus by Michelik et al.
. We chose sarA rather than a protein more chemically similar to dCas9 because data on sarA was readily available and because dCas9 is transcribed using the sarA promoter, which allows us to at least capture sensitivity of the degradation rate to production.
mRNA production from the sarA promoter
We used the time-series data given by Cheung et al.
to estimate the rate of production from the sarA P2-P3-P1 promoter in S. aureus. The figure from their paper is reproduced below. After diluting 1:100, the S. aureus strains were serially monitored for OD_650. We used data from the sarA+ strain, as that's more like a wild-type S. aureus strain.
Using the laboratory-conditions doubling time of 24 minutes given in given in
, we found that the bacteria would re-enter stationary phase after 2.5 hours; for time-points after 3 hours, the number of number of sarA"

Although our team is conformed by biotechnologists, civil engineers, chemical engineers, designers and social workers we are not expert nor do we handle all areas of knowledge, so it was imminent to seek and contact professionals in a wide range of areas for helping us to understand in what conditions are the laws, projects and technologies associated with our work.
We started attending the MIT Global Start-up Workshop, that was held in Santiago, to learn about entrepreneurship, how to do a correct elevator pitch and how to start a business. Then we arranged a meeting with PhD. Tomás Egaña, who is leading an investigation with the microalgae that we are using, but for tissue regeneration! Also, via email the LMU München guided and helped us with the genetic constructions for our Chlamy, which is summarized here .
MIT GSW learning about enterpreneurship.
Knowing how difficult it is to enter a microorganism to Chile, we decided to write a protocol step-by-step for a correct importation. Download it here (it is in Spanish).
After the surveys results indicating that energy and transportation were the most perceived contributors to air pollution, the Energy Ministry was contacted by us, asking about the total emissions in Chile and some plans that are done to reduce them. Subsequently we knew that the Puchuncaví commune was our objective, specifically Los Maitenes town, because of the high concenration of thermoelectric plants in the Quintero’s bay, so we visited the environmental department of the municipality and contacted the Clean Energy enterprise that works with carbon capturing from one thermoelectric plant in the area. From these interviews we learned the importance of environmental protection in the region and that all the efforts must be concentrated on restoring the place and increase the inhabitant's life quality.

Kyoto,2012,Team:Kyoto#Consideration_-_-_TEXT.html," genetically modified plants can grow more easily in barren land . However, some people worry that genetically modified foods may do harm to our health and the environment. It is often reported that Japanese people tend to avoid genetically modified foods. Sure enough, previous surveys of attitudes toward genetic engineering showed that, in Japan, more people had “negative” or “neutral” opinions regarding genetically modified foods than people in other nations. These findings piqued our interest in the Japanese public’s views on genetic engineering and made clear to us the importance of active discussion on the subject of genetic engineering. In conjunction with other university students in Japan, we designed questionnaires asking for subjects’ impressions of genetic engineering and carried out a nationwide survey in order to clarify the reasons for Japanese people’s attitudes toward the subject . In this paper, we suggest that educational differences have created a gap between the attitudes of students and adults of their parents generation. read more: File:ENGLISH.pdf
Walk-in science
The Faculty of Science, Kyoto University, held ""Walk-in Science,"" a science communication event at Kyoto City Hall Station in February 25 & 26. We iGEM Kyoto also joined it and ran a booth of synthetic biology.
Today, it is a problem in Japan that more young people are moving away from the sciences. Hence, it is important to let people, especially children, know more about sciences. ""Walk-in Science"" was an event to show what we study, how interesting sciences are, to people who walk in non-academic place. ""Walk-in Science"" joiners had booths on the street of the underground mall.
To walkers of all ages who live in Kyoto, we told what Biobrick is, with ""BioBrick Blocks"". Although most of them did not know about biotechnology, everyone listened to our speech and enrich their understanding.
Kyoto University Academic Day
Kyoto University Academic Day is a place of communication that anyone can notice the attractiveness of learning fun regardless of Citizens and researchers.
The main purpose of this event is to reflect public opinion in national policy and research activities in the university.
Actually we used a poster and a screen to tell how to conduct an experiment of gene recombination, what ""iGEM"" is, and our results of research to children, housewives, teachers, and so on, then we could communicate and explain it with the people who don't know about ""iGEM"".
After our presentation many people said ""I have had a bad impression on gene recombination and gene modified crops but today I heard the possibility of gene recombination and Synthetic biology, then I change my root thought about it""

Safety
Any laboratory experiment, big or small, can become dangerous when those involved do not consider the risks involved. The Washington University iGEM team has gone to great lengths to address the risks involved in this year’s project. Overall, our project can be considered low risk as it was never intended to come in contact with humans. However, as it is designed to be a tool to be used by other researchers, it is never certain that it will not come in human contact. To ensure that our organisms do not acquire dangerous mutations, our E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae should be cultured and tested in proper laboratory environment. If the bacteria and yeast are in fact ingested, it would not produce adverse effects as the bacteria and yeast would not be able to survive in the stomach’s acidic environment. If, however, the organism was engineered to produce a toxic protein using the engineered splicing machinery, handling the organism without proper protection or ingesting it would be hazardous. Because the probability of this happening is dependent upon the design of the project, teams utilizing the splicing machinery must take any necessary precautions. The same could be said of the project being hazardous to the environment. The main safety concern of this project arises during DNA purification using gel electrophoresis.
Gel electrophoresis utilizes the carcinogen ethidium bromide to tag DNA as it travels though an agarose gel. It can be absorbed through the skin. For this reason, a separate lab bench was set aside specifically for gel electrophoresis. Everything coming in contact with the toxin, including pipets, tips, gel rigs, and glassware is clearly marked and contained within that lab bench. Anybody touching anything on the lab bench must wear proper laboratory clothing and nitrile gloves. Furthermore, there is a container designated to store all waste, solid and liquid, with any traces of ethidium bromide. This then will be deposited and properly disposed of later.
All research conducted at Washington University (medical school and main campus) is under the supervision of the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research (OVCR). This office is responsible for all"

Summary
All BioBricks of the iGEM Team Bielefeld were screened to identify the best conditions for protein expression. The first trials were made by shaking flask cultivations with different parameters. These parameters were various shaking flask designs, different temperatures, different concentrations of chloramphenicol, various induction strategies, several cultivation times and some cultivations in absence or presence of CuCl2. To detect the produced laccases, different analysis methods were performed like SDS-PAGE analysis as well as MALDI-TOF. The iGEM Team successfully produced four active bacterial laccases and succeeded to purify four of them. Besides the successfully scale-up fermentation, these laccases could be purified in a high amount to characterize the optimal activity conditions regarding pH, temperature, buffer solutions and organic solvent resistance. Furthermore, the iGEM Team Bielefeld demonstrated that the produced laccases can be immobilized maintaining their activity and the degradation capacity was screened for several micro-contaminants. These tests indicate that all of our produced laccases are able to degrade estradiol and the two laccases TTHL and BPUL are able to degrade ethinyl-estradiol in combination with a mediator. At this moment, the self-designed shuttle-vector for the production of eukaryotic laccases in yeast is ready to go. This vector was tested to integrate by courtesy of homologous recombination genes of eukaryotic laccases into Pichia Pastoris and produce them in an active form. First experiments show a successful production of one laccase of Trametes versicolor. A cheap alternative purification and immobilization method via a cellulose binding tag is also close"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html," Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernat"

Sanny et al. [26] and Arnaldos et al. [27] demonstrate that the expression of small amounts of VHb, despite of being counterintuitive for a fermentation process, resulted in a significant increase in ethanol production.
The delivery of small amounts of oxygen to the bacteria have generated an increase in ethanol production in E. coli using feedstocks as diverse as glucose (30% increase) [26], xylose (119%) [26], corn stover hydrolysate (59%) [26], potato processing waste water (5-18%) [28], cheese whey (21-419%) [29] and whey powder (17-362%) [29] among others. VHb have also been shown to increase ethanol production in yeast [30]. Also investigators in Hong Kong have shown that its expression in Aurantiochytrium sp. enhanced the production of fatty acids that could be used as precursors of the synthesis of biodiesel [31].

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," threat equal to that of terrorism”, the growing resistance to antibiotics is hindering the effective prevention and treatment of an ever increasing range of infections.
antibiotic resistance poses a catastrophic threat. If we don't act now, any one of us could go into hospital in 20 years for minor surgery and die because of an ordinary infection that can't be treated by antibiotics.
Professor Dame Sally Davies
Chief Medical Officer
March 2013
The World Health Organisation’s antibiotic resistance Global Report on Surveillance, reports increasing worldwide incidences of antimicrobial resistance, in particular antibiotic resistance. This highlights very high rates of resistance in bacteria that cause common healthcare associated and community-acquired infections, such as UTIs [ 1 ]. UTIs account for over 7 million doctor visits per year. Catheter associated UTIs (CAUTIs) are the most commonly acquired infection in hospitals, and there is a high incidence of antibiotic resistance in the bacteria that cause UTIs globally [ 2 ].
Biofilms
Major structural elements of bacterial biofilms.
Biofilms are aggregates of surface-associated microorganisms that are encased in a matrix of highly-hydrated extracellular polymeric substances, which include extracellular polysaccharides, extracellular DNA, as well as proteins [ 6 ]. Van Leeuwenhoek, using his simple microscopes in 1684, first observed microorganisms on tooth surfaces and can be credited with the discovery of microbial biofilms. ""The number of these animalcules in the scurf of a man's teeth are so many that I believe they exceed the number of men in a kingdom."" - Leeuwenhoek
We now know a great deal more about biofilms. Environmental changes are responsible for the transition from planktonic growth to biofilm [ 13 ] and cause changes in the expression of surface molecules, virulence factors, and metabolic status. This allows the bacteria to acquire properties that enable their survival in unfavourable conditions [ 14,15 ], such as in the presence of antibiotics.
The low nutrient and oxygen levels at the bottom of the biofilm give rise to metabolically-inactive bacteria, better known as persister cells. These persister cells are rendered unsusceptible to most traditional antibiotics, which rely on bacterial metabolism to exert cell-killing effect [ 7 ].
UTIs
Biofilms are currently estimated to be responsible for over 65% of nosocomial infections and 80% of all microbial infections [ 16 ]. Bacterial biofilms play an important role in UTIs. UTIs are caused by the pathogenic invasion of the urinary tract, which"

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Tag-Optimization_-_-_TEXT.html," The negative control is E. coli TOP10 without a plasmid. All transformants have been grown on LB agar for 48 hours at room temperature, cells were not induced. One can see that even without induction all strains express the indigoidine synthetase and produce the blue pigment indigoidine. However, the strains BAP1 and NEB Turbo grow faster in the first day, exhibiting a white phenotype (data not shown). Colonies on the plate of E. coli TOP10  are very small and dark blue/ black. Assuming that indigoidine production inhibits cell growth due to its toxicity, we concluded that TOP10 produced the most indigoidine among the strains we tested. We used E. coli TOP10 for the following experiments. b) Comparison between different PPTases concerning overall indigoidine production The Figure shows E. coli TOP10 cells co-transformed with indC and four different PPTases (sfp, svp, entD and delC), respectively. The image bottom left shows E. coli TOP10 cells without additional PPTase and the negative control is TOP10 without a plasmid.
Indigoidine Production Varies when Co-expressed with Different PPTases
The expression of indC under activation by the endogenous PPTase entD in E. coli was sufficient for easy detection of indigoidine production on plates Fig. 3b , indC). In order to determine, whether the amount of indigoidine in the E. coli TOP10 cells is dependent on the quality of the interacting of indC with the PPTase, four PPTase dervied from varying origins were selected and amplified from the genome of the hosts of origin. E. coliTOP10 cells were co-transformed with plasmids coding for the different PPTases and the plasmid containing the expression cassette for indC. As reference for the endogenous PPTase activity served cells only transformed with the indC plasmid. Irrespective of the PPTase, growth of colonies was retarded. Remarkably however, colonies co-transformed with the PPTase plasmid remained of smaller size than the ones only carrying the indC construct. On the other side, indigoidine production was more diffuse in the latter cells with secretion of the blue pigment into the agar ( Fig. 3b , indC) and only slight blue-greenish coloring of the colonies. The four PPTases additionally introduced into the TOP10 cells were all shown to be functional (blue phenotype of the"

Executive Summary
iGEM Stockholm, formed by 20 bright entrepreneurs, has developed Biotic Blue, the new innovative enzymatic degradation solution to pharmaceutical pollution in the aquatic environment. Our team, based in Sweden, fights against the ecotoxicity and antibiotic resistance as a result of high concentrations of pharmaceutically active compounds in the Baltic Sea Region.
Aiming to develop our research project to the next level, we started our entrepreneurial journey. Among the different stakeholders, the Swedish Government, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and municipal and private wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) management were identified as major key players. Swedish WWTPs were determined to be the target markets, where we undertook a competitive analysis and a macroenvironmental factors study. Applying for a patent in Sweden through the Swedish Patent and Registration Office (PRV) and establishing the regulatory framework are fundamental aspects that we think will facilitate our business growth opportunities. Shaping our market entry strategy as well as the funding strategy will contribute to a successful business performance. Finally, we also present some industry perspectives towards Biotic Blue from the companies AstraZeneca and Pharem Biotech.
Problem Description
Consumption of pharmaceuticals has significantly risen over the past years. This trend will continue as lifespan increases, and pharmaceuticals become more available. Between 30 and 90% of orally consumed pharmaceuticals excreted in the urine, end up in the water reservoirs after going through the sewage system [1]. Lack of strong regulations prevents WWTPs from treating water from pharmaceuticals.
Development of antibiotic resistance is one of the major consequences of pharmaceutical pollution, posing human health in great danger. The presence of antibiotics promotes acquisition or independent evolution of resistance from bacteria that generally lack innate antibiotic capacity [2]. Eventually, these resistant bacteria reach humans either via food or direct exposure to animal hosts [3],[4].
In addition, pharmaceuticals also provoke ecotoxic effects on marine organisms. Some biological pathways are highly conserved in nature. Therefore, pharmaceuticals similarly intervene both in human and marine organisms’ pathways, exerting sign effects in their physiological functions [5].
The antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) presents one of the highest concentrations among Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) detected in samples from rivers and effluent streams from WWTPs ending up in the Baltic Sea [6]. SMX poses an imminent threat to regional ecosystems as WWTPs are unable to remove it.
Therefore, we can define our need as it follows: a way to"

NYMU-Taipei,2011,Team:NYMU-Taipei#background-review_-_-_TEXT.html,"1). This even led to one mentioning on 2009 iGem official website about “magnetic bacteria” as one of the Ideas for Bacteria .
File:Table 1.gif
Table 1: Magneto-related iGem teams in the history.
(2) Obstacle 1: Hard to Cultivate Yes, we have heard your voice fellow iGemers. We knew from your previous/current brainstorming pages that the main reason for your giving in lies mostly in the STRINGENT growth conditions required to successfully cultivating these bacteria. It is a good reason, indeed.
There are only a few magnetotactic strains capable of pure culture. Among them, Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum MS-1 [ 2 ], Magnetospirillum gryphiswalden MSR-1 [ 3 ], and Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 [ 4 ] are used most frequently in research on magnetotactic bacteria. In recent years, significantly improved cultivating methods for MS-1 [ 5 ], MSR-1 [ 6 ], and AMB-1 [ 7 ] have also been achieved. These have lead to the field buzzing about the realization of applications spanning fMRI reporting, tumor targeting, etc., using magnetites produced by these cells [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ].
To be honest, we also encountered some problems in cultivating strain AMB-1, but finally a complete cultivating method has been established here. See Chassis for more details.
(3) Obstacle 2: Lack of Genetic Toolbox Sadly, for previous iGemers, there were way too many obstacles in front of their magnetic fantasies. This has lead to the fact that few precedents ever proceeded into thinking and encountering the BIG questions, that is, the lack of ANY available genetic tools in Parts Registry!
File:Tranformation of MG, MM, and AMB-1.gif
Fig.1 Transformation of MSR-1, AMB-1 and MS-1, plated on ACA medium [ 12 ]
To this date, provided with our utmost efforts in literature study, we've found, from previous research on magnetotactic bacteria, two strains are capable of undergoing transformation--MSR-1 [ 12 ], and AMB-1 [ 13 ].
For the genetic manipulating system on MSR-1, Dr. Dirk Schüler, et al. has developed a stable and efficient method by conjugation with Escherichia coli S17-1. Plasmids used in the system are derivatives of pBBR1MCS (broad-host-range vector"
NJU-China,2016,Team:NJU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," cancers; 30.9% chose liver cancer, which is of the same high degree of malignancy with Lung cancer; the remaining 30% people choose other types of cancer.
This result demonstrates that people in China still hold a superficial and inadequate perception in the cognition of the malignant degree and the death rate of cancer.
The attitude towards cancer treatment and new therapies
● Of the 780 respondents, curative efficacy and side effects were their top priority concern if selecting cancer treatment.
● Under the influence of ""Wei Zexi incident"" (a malpractice due to deceptive advertising of immune therapy), 40.86% of the respondents worried about the curative effect and side effect of immune therapy as a new therapy for cancer, and 31.04% said they are afraid to be cheated and take advantage of by criminals when try a new therapy. 24.75% said they would believe the latest research achievements, while only 3.34% expressed entrust or even rejection of immune therapy.
● With a brief introduction of the background of molecular targeted drugs (e.g. Iressa), 64.87% of respondents were open to molecular targeting drugs and consider it acceptable, while 18.27% respondents were worried about the high expense, which they may be unable to afford. It should be noted that there are still 16.92% of the objects consider the immunotherapy as immature and are unwilling to take any risk.
Attitude & Suggestions
Figure 2.
Figure 3.
Figure 4.
Interview with doctor
To better understand the current situation of cancer treatment and further shape our project direction, we interviewed a doctor from Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School (also known as ‘Drum-tower Hospital’) for a broad view of therapeutic concern from professional perspective. There are many teams focusing on technical problems on the interaction between targeting drugs and their models, but the acceptance and trust issues from patients are less discussed. In our project, attitudes of patients is correspondingly valued, so we interviewed doctors from Drum-tower Hospital (Its oncology department is the National Key Clinical Specialist) for their opinions on patients’ acceptance and our project. The suggestion would not only be used for the further improvement of our project, but also provide a general concept of the safety issue that must be dealt with when synthetic biology encounters clinical medicine. Their professional experience and advices are valuable if we want to apply synthetic biology to a broader clinical field in the near future.

Training process of ProteinGAN
Generator receives a set of numbers from random gaussian distribution called noise which is passed through pre-defined number of filters that contain trainable parameters. These filters are arranged in blocks called residual blocks. After each block the length of the input increases until it matches the length of a real protein (analogy to increasing resolution in image generation) (Figure 2). The last layer ensures that the range of values and shape matches original data.
Figure 5. Visualization of protein generation
Discriminator receives generated and real sequences and passes them through the network containing same size filters stacked in reversed order compared to generator (in order to not overpower one over another). At the end, discriminator arrives to a single number for each sequence that corresponds to the confidence level of discriminator that a particular resembles natural protein sequences.
Using the scores from discriminator, each part of the GAN is evaluated using loss function.
Hinge loss where D - function of discriminator that returns a single number for each sequence, G - a function of generator that takes noise as an input and returns sequence of amino acids. N - the number of examples looked in one step.
Intuitively, this means that discriminator will do well if it assigns low scores to generated examples and high to real ones. On the other hand, generator is penalized if generated examples are scored low. These scores drive the direction of how parameters are being tweaked to improve the scores of discriminator and generator separately.
As generator and discriminator have opposite goals, they compete against each other in so called mini-max game. Forward pass and backpropagation is repeated until the generated sequences are not improving further or is hardly distinguishable from real ones.
To train ProteinGAN we used Google cloud instance with NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU (16GB). Training took approximately 60h for each class which contained at least 20000 unique proteins. Entire network contained ~4M trainable parameters. For optimization Adam optimizer has been chosen with learning rates of 0,0001 for discriminator and generator (β1 = 0, β2 = 0,9). Both discriminator and generator were trained the same"

The Best Design Platform
The needs in Designing a Circuits were considered seriously to achieve the best user experience. Simple interaction logic, beautiful UI.
The tree of words
Simply by clicking the words, you will see the subordinated words. After few repeats, you will finally get the projects that you want. This function is designed to help specify your need, to help you construct your idea better.
Interaction Analysis
This function is implanted in the design platform which will tell you the potential parts interacting with the chosen one. Use your imagination, ponder how to utilize these interactions.
Simulation
Even though it’s difficult to develop a model that fits in all the circuits, it worths a shot. Our modeler developed a general model to allow users to simulate any circuits.
WHY S-Din?
Background
Biosciences research is now facing an increasingly severe problem that most works were ignored and not evaluated properly. Numbers of research articles are published every year. How to utilize previous works to aid the current problem should be considered by everyone.
Image source: http://blogs.nature.com/news/2014/05/global-scientific-output-doubles-every-nine-years.html
This year, SYSU-Software is trying to ameliorate this situation in Synthetic Biology, exploring treasures buried in the ocean of projects.
To make a full use of our predecessors' geniuses and efforts in Synthetic Biology. We concluded two problems.
How to find the project you need much faster and more accurately?
How to integrate parts of the project you found into your own work?
Following the standardization in Synthetic Biology, we standardized all aspects of previous projects, no matter they were from published articles or iGEM projects, into a New data format to provide you a clearer, better view when using our search engine.
Network analysis: designed to uncover potential connections between projects, helping users to locate exactly what they need.
Customization:The most exciting part of S-Din is that searching and designing are seamless. Once you find a project that might be useful, you can start editing in design platform immediately. Or you can just simply create your own from scratch.
Extensible: To ensure the database can be updated, new information can be added manually or ‘Spider’(Web crawler).

Because of that, the iGEM Team Düsseldorf invited members of our team and other iGEM teams from North Rhine Westphalia to come to Düsseldorf. Here we were given the possibility to present our project idea to the public and to talk about the advantages of synthetic biology. This gave us the chance to review our project and integrate the opinions, fears and ideas from other people. We want to thank the iGEM team Düsseldorf for organizing this.
Future Lab Gala
Future lab is a gala organized by different institutes and organizations in Aachen to present Aachen as the perfect place for research, science and industry. During this gala, the participants presented themselves with the help of scientific experiments, art, and speeches. It was a great opportunity for us to get in touch with politicians, people from the industry, and different universities and to tell them about iGEM and our project.

In September, the team from Göttingen and us, the iGEM Team Aachen, were invited to the “DECHEMA Jahrestagung”. The “Society for Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology” gave us a slot to present our project in front of a scientific audience. Our presentations were included in the “Zukunftsforum”, a subitem of the conference with focus on the future perspective and strategies for the biotechnological industry in Germany.  We are thankful for the opportunity to establish a dialogue with the scientific community and practice our presentational skills for the Giant Jamboree.
Analytica
We visited the trade fair “Analytica”, for analysis, biotechnology, laboratory technology, and devices in Munich. Here we got in touch with different companies and presented our project to them. Moreover, this trade fair gave us the possibility to win over supporters for our project. We also met members from the iGEM Team Munich.
SynBioBeta
SynBioBeta is one of the main communities of entrepreneurs, investors, and policy makers devoted to promote the responsible growth of the synthetic biology field. On their international conferences and events many members of the synthetic biology community come together and discuss possibilities to promote the development of this industrial field. The background of people, visiting these conferences, is very diverse and therefore various aspects are discussed. Our members were not only able to meet industrial members and scientist, but also other iGEM Teams and Randy, founder of the iGEM organization. This was an amazing"

Doesn't rubber come from trees?
Let your eyes (and mouse) wander to these trees to discover our ideas on how to help the environment and change the future of rubber production. Take a look at our short project description below.
The growing demand for natural rubber causes deforestation of the rainforest and occupation of arable lands, due to the establishment of new plantations. If producing rubber by bacteria succeeds, production of natural rubber will not be limited to the regions where the rubber tree can grow. Rather, rubber can be produced even in barren lands.
Our project aims to enable a common bacteria to produce natural rubber while grown under controlled conditions.  Natural rubber is composed of molecules consisting of the substance IPP linked together like a chain. The common bacteria that we use (E. coli) already possesses the ability to produce the IPP, but it lacks the enzyme to connect the IPP links together into a chain.  We introduced the enzyme that the rubber tree has for connecting the links into the bacteria. Furthermore, we introduced genes that allow the bacteria further production of the IPP links.
No, rubber is made in the lab.

Population Dynamics
1 Overview
In this section, we want to model the proportion of the plasmid that is knocked out after the addition of Cre when         accounting for population dynamics, namely cell replication and death. Here, as before, we wish to ﬁnd how the gene         of interest (GOI) concentration will eventually decrease. Here, we assume that the population has reached carrying capacity and so the rate of cell replication is equal to the rate of cell death. We also assume all cells with the construct have Cre constitutively         produced after the activation of the construct.
As described in the Cre module model, the GOI is separated from the origin of replication (ORI) when Cre recombinase         cuts the construct at the lox sites.
During each cell replication, all plasmids with an ORI will be replicated before the cell divides. If an unrecombined         construct (with both the GOI and the ORI) replicates, it would create another copy of itself. Any plasmids with only         the GOI cannot replicate as they lack an ORI. The plasmids with only an ORI would also replicate.
Here, we will refer to the proportion of unrecombined plasmid as S, the proportion of the recombined version (having         the GOI and ORI in separate plasmids) as P, and the proportion of ORI-only plasmids from the replication of the recombined         version as N.
Referring to the figure below, during cell replication, when S replicates, it will generate a copy of S, while when P and N replicate,         they will generate a copy of N. Because we assume the cell population is at the carrying capacity, meaning that the         rate of cell replication will be equal to the rate of cell death. Thus, we will only have to consider the replication         and death mechanism for P because the rates are balanced for S and N.

From One to Scale
Developing a prototype poses an interesting set of problems, but manufacturing a new device at scale is a completely different challenge. Whereas we design, build and test our prototypes completely in house, our startup aims to achieve economies of scale for manufacturing. This is only possible with a suitable workflow; specifically we want to turn our prototype devices into technical implementations plans that can be sent to a number of different supplies and manufacturers. In turn, these partners assemble sub-components for us with maximal efficiency reducing our manufacturing works to assembly and testing of the final product.
Manufacturing Costs
Suppliers
During our prototype development, we identified the best suppliers for production scale-up, described in the following table.
Regulations and Safety Requirements
To manufacture electrical equipment in the UK, we must meet the Electrical Equipment (Safety) Regulations 1994 which covers all equipment designed for the workplace and domestic electrical equipment. Our responsibility as the manufacturer is to ensure the Darwin Toolbox meets the safety requirements, and declaring this with 3 key components:
Technical documentation
a European Conformity Declaration of Conformity
a European Conformity (CE) mark.
Technical documentation
Manufacturers of new products subject to European product safety Directives must collect and be able to assemble comprehensive information covering the design, construction, conformity assessment and use of the product to demonstrate how their product complies with all applicable Directives. This is known as a technical file. It should be in one or more of the official Community languages and kept available for at least the time specified in the relevant Directive (eg for machinery this means for at least 10 years since last production of the product range).
- Health and Safety Executive
European Conformity Declaration of Conformity
Our product must be supplied with an European Conformity Declaration of Conformity. This is a written certificate that show that we, as the manufacturer, formally declare that our CE marked equipment meets the requirements of the regulations. In this document we must state:
identify the manufacturer or the authorised representative
describe the electrical equipment to which it relates
where appropriate, specify the harmonised standard(s) or other specifications with which conformity with the"
McMasterU,2017,Team:McMasterU#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," C. difficile has more of a niche to replicate and cause disease.”
- Dr. Nick Daneman, Hamilton Health Sciences
Thus, with more infected patients in healthcare institutions, this induces colonization pressure and increases antibiotic usage. The standard diagnostic test for C. difficile being usage of immuno-sensitive PCRs sent to public healthcare labs, this took a lot of time. We discussed how shortened turnaround time on diagnostic results would lead to better and more proper prescription of antibiotics, should they be disease carriers, or omission of an unnecessary prescription of antibiotics, should they not have the disease. Additionally, quicker redirection to other tests for patients to find their proper diagnosis. In addition, Dr. Daneman explained that thousands of dollars could be saved per case of prevention. Morbidity and mortality were very high for this diseases, with the Ontario Burden of Infectious Disease Study showing C. difficile coming out in the top ten for these factors. After having explained our proof-of-concept, he saw that our project would fit into this needed aspect of diagnosis and prevention.
Finally, Dr. Daneman stressed that the issue of antibiotic and AMR stewardship and education were key in preventing C. difficile from developing into a bacterial disease.
“Any antibiotic can cause C. difficile [to become active], ...[including] the antibiotics we use to treat C. difficile. It is important to focus on when to start, how to choose, and when to stop treatment.”
Educating practitioners about antibiotic overprescription was vital, and we talked about how the public also needed to become more aware of this issue to prevent the widespread problems surrounding AMR. Since “90% of antibiotic use is in the community, ...better antimicrobial stewardship [is needed].” With us tackling important topics on local, national, and global scales, very important topic, he commended us and pressed us to move forward with our work.
Harpa Isfeld-Kiely
— Project Lead on AMR and AMS, Senior Project Manager; National Collaborating Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCCID)
To develop a stronger background in the broader policy dimensions of AMR, we interviewed Harpa Isfeld-Kiely, a Senior Project Manager at the Canadian National Collaborating Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCCID). Our conversations focused on understanding the complexities of public education on AMR, antimicrobial stewardship, the worldwide burden of disease, and Canada’s political role in combating AMR.
We learned a great deal around the breadth of qualitative research done by prominent biomedical research funders such as the Wellcome Trust around science communication, and public perception of antibiotic use."

Here is Yun Xue, this is my first year in iGEM. I joined iGEM because I'm fond of synthetic biology and I'm skilled in the mathematical modeling, genetics and molecular biology. And I would like to pursue these interests in future and do research about mathematical modeling of biological systems. I enjoy sport activities such as badminton, tennis and basketball. I am lookng forward to solving problems and getting good achievements.
Qiushuang Wu: the smart girl provided us with the original idea for our project this year in the brainstorming. As the housekeeper in our lab, she kept the lab organized when doing experiments. And she herself did a lot of experiments, involving all parts in our project. As some people's comment, she was always in the lab or on the way to the lab. She usually says if love, please love deeply. She loves biology very much, and will devote to her true love all her life.
Long Yu, coming from Hubei, China, majors in biology in College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University. In his second year, he entered into the lab of Prof. Chen, whose field is microbiology. During those times, he was mainly devoted to reveal a new kind of mechanism by which genetic materials were transferred between Bacilus subtilis other than three traditional horizontal gene transfer (HGT) ways. In his third year, he participated in this iGEM team, and devoted much time into it, so granted, he learned a lot. But it is a pity that he could not keep it up. Now in his fourth year in college, he was prepared to go to Monash University in Australia, conducting researches about Tfh cells.
My name is Han Dong. I have been studying in Wuhan University for more than 2 years, majoring in biology. I was born in a coastal city named Qingdao, where I grew up with the sea, thus I like seafood, beach and sea breeze. Sea makes me open-minded, willing and have broad interests like swimming. I also enjoy reading and drawing, so I am the main graphic designer in our team. I believe that painting will help people to learn the world better by watching it carefully, and it is the same with biology. That is why I join the team , I want to show our idea with my pen.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," difficult these days. In our era, fake news, populism and pseudo sciences are found in all parts of society and social life, steadily diluting teachings about the true scientific method.     Often, trust in rabble-rousers is higher than trust in medical doctors and evidence-based science. While some people are working hard towards finding solutions to deal with major threats to nature, certain governments are cutting funding for climate research and conservation of wildlife reserves [ Guardian , Nature ]. In some countries, people are waiting in line to get vaccinated against deadly diseases, while in others, ""highly educated"" parents risk the lives of their children by listening to fear mongers. Measle outbreaks thanks to holes in herd immunity threaten immunosuppressive patients even in rich countries [ CDC , RKI (German) , RKI (German) ]. The decadent behavior of western civilizations is obvious: on the one hand they deny the positive impact of genetically engineered plants to developmental countries, dooming people to death by starvation and malnutrition [ Al-Babili (2005) , De Steur (2017) ] . On the other hand they profit from genetically engineered organisms producing insulin and many other useful compounds [ Bomgardner (2012) , Goeddel (1979) , Howard (2013) ]. The two-faced nature of this is very disquieting.
Therefore it is our duty as scientists to work towards a more enlightened world.     The international ""March For Science"" initiative is a wonderful way to shed light on these matters. On April 22nd, people all over the world took to the streets in protest against fake news, populism and pseudo sciences.     Of course, our iGEM team wanted to be part of this movement. We also invited all other teams in North Rhine Westphalia: Aachen , Bielefeld-CeBiTec and UBonn_HBRS . In our opinion the best way to deal with misinformation about science is to show that science is not witchcraft but rather an open field of study clearly evident for everyone who is interested to (further) educate oneself. We want to talk to people about their fears and concerns rather than letting them alone with their questions.     The march for science was a great opportunity to combine showing solidarity of the scientific community with socializing.
On a rainy Saturday morning, our team met at Duesseldorf main station. We had some empty signs and lots of pencils. To brighten up the gray day we drew some colorful signs, quoting the famous scientist Rick Sanchez or other scientific phrases. In Bonn we met up with the i"

Parts Submitted to the Registry
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts on the Registry than on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
When should you put parts into the Registry?
As soon as possible! We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better recall you will have of all details surrounding your parts. Remember you don't need to send us the DNA to create an entry for a part on the Registry. However, you must send us the sample/DNA before the Jamboree. Only parts for which you have sent us samples/DNA are eligible for awards and medal requirements.
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#VanessaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," we brainstormed ideas on how to find the right combination for ligation protocol between reaction time and ligation ratios.
- I tried ligation reactions with Bba_E0430(YFPc) and Bba_R0040(ptet) for 30 minutes, 1 hour, and overnight on the bench. The reactions were the same sample with two different ratios 1:3 and 1:7. I transformed these reactions with TOP10 competent cells. Unfortunately, nothing grew on the plates this try. With the 1:3 ratio, I tried transforming with 4 tubes of TOP10 competent cells, but nothing worked either.
- The ligation reaction was transformed with alpha-select competent cells and there was success. A few colonies grew on each plate with various reactions. It grew best at 1:3 for 30 minutes reaction time on bench at room temperature. To confirm these results, 4 plasmid preps were taken from each plate. There were a few with false positives, but the others seem to be at the right position on the gel with okay quantification values.
- Two other constructs were ligated and checked on a gel to see if it fits right with what was needed. Unfortunately, the ligation of YFPc and R2000 did not show up on the gel, there must be some kind of error in the reaction.
Week 8: 7/23-7/29
Because our ligations seemed to be working successfully, we began to restriction map the various constructs.Before this, the plates with various constructs were checked under UV light. The construct with the constitutive promoter, pcat, BBa_I14033 did not glow under the UV light; however, the construct with ptet_YFPc (BBa_R0040_BBa_E0430) did glow brightly under the UV light.  The other constitutive promoter, BBa_R2000 made BBa_E0240 glow green under the UV light. The inducible promoter, pbad (BBa_I13453), had the correct response in which it did not glow because there was no arabinose present. In addition, the constructs were checked by making 4 plasmid preps of each plate, just in case there were false positives on the plate. The plasmids of each plate were then ran on a gel. The constructs tested include:
This is a figure of a gel with construct samples.

Some say there are unanswered questions regarding the potential long-term impact on human health from genetically modified food. Also, there are concerns about the contamination of the non-genetically modified food supply from the genetically modified food.
Therefore, on July 3rd, 2015, we interviewed with the expert Mr. Cigang Yu, the research assistant from the research center for nature conservation and biodiversity,  Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People’s Republic of China (NIES). (For details about the institute, see “ Brief introduction of NIES ” He is researching on the biosafety of GMOs. The purpose of the interview was about the transgenic technology and GMOs. The interview clarified the attitude of Chinese government towards the transgenic technology, and helped us to have more in-depth understanding for the safety of GMOs, and to build up expectations for the future development of the transgenic technology. Furthermore, we will be dedicated to spread the scientific and objective attitude towards the transgenic technology to the people around in the future, since the more rebuttal there is, the clearer the truth becomes.

2.NGO ( Non-governmental organization ): Leader of an environmental group in Nanjing
There are many environmental groups which are devoted to environmental protection in Nanjing. They have successfully launched many campaigns such as “Purification of a Drop of Water” to raise public awareness of environmental protection. Besides, they are very familiar with the conditions of the aquatic environment in Nanjing. Therefore, we made contact with them and participated in the activity named “Journey of Love” on July 26th, 2015. We volunteered to take approximately 50 pupils to the polluted river called the Hong Hua River. We also helped to show them how to use environmental detection device to test the concentration of pollutants in the river. Many pupils were impressed by the pollution, exhorting them to no longer throw domestic garbage into the rivers. We also propagated our project among the pupils and their parents to know about different opinions.
After the activity, we interviewed the organizer of the environmental group and learned a lot about the environmental groups and development of sewage disposal in China. What is more? We sincerely appreciated it when the organizer gave us his suggestions about our project.

CSA Astronaut Dr. Robert Thirsk
We had the amazing opportunity to talk, by proxy, with CSA astronaut Robert Thirsk. An engineer and physician, Robert Thirsk also holds the surprising distinction of being the first person to ever receive a university degree in space (having been given an honorary doctorate degree from his alma mater: The University of Calgary). Dr. Thirsk provided us a look into the life of an astronaut and incredible insight into the space industry and why more people, and governments, should be investing into the projects being developed by their space agencies. A busy individual, Dr. Thirsk responded to one of our questions regarding space exploration.
How do you convince taxpayers that spending money on a manned mars mission is their best interest?
Dr. Thirsks: The strongest driver for continued support for space programs is simply economic benefits. The Canadian Space Agency, funded by Canadian taxpayers, makes $3.00 Billion in revenue. Striving for space missions makes economic sense. There is also a trickle down effect, plenty of spin-off technologies comes from innovation in the space industry. For example, MD Robotics developed the Canadarm for use on the International Space Station. Developments from the Canadam include the NeuroArm, a robot designed for neurosurgery, and improvements to modern flight simulators. There is also a utilitarian component. Canada has the second largest land mass in the world, plenty of rural areas lack modern amenities such as internet access and TeleHeathcare. Developments in satellite technology would provide these amenities to people in our northernmost regions, as well as improved remote sensing technology. Successful space missions also inspire the public. If we can achieve the impossible in space, then we can adopt that mindset and face other problems back on earth (climate change, poverty, etc.). Dedicated space programs also educate younger generations and inspire the next generation of leaders. They promote international cooperation and instigate dialogue between countries that wouldn’t normally cooperate. Politics don’t get in"
Tsinghua,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html,"Background
In China, because of the UN human issue that scientists used 60 children to examine their new transgenic product, Golden rice last year, the question about the safety of transgenic technology remains indistinct. The masses even became scared of the transgenic technology as well as the total biotechnology. As a result, transgenic products were resisted all over China.
Lectures
Although many biologists came out to prove their justice, many Chinese still have stereotypes of biotechnology. We hosted two lectures about the correctness of biotechnology for college freshmen and high school students. We introduced the current stereotype phenomenon, then presented the biological applications that have made great contributions, such as bio-fuel, Artemisinin (kind of drug for malaria, first extracted by Chinese pharmacist Youyou Tu) produced by yeast and microorganism which can curb environmental pollution. Because our project involve the knowledge of both biological process and the lecture also involved the development of Synthetic Biology, which is a course of cross-disciplines, requiring us to look at a living organism from the perspective of information system. These contents attracted the attention of students from College of Information.
Brochures
To circulate synthetic biology knowledge and inspiration, we demonstrated key ideas in the discipline in a booklet and handed out the booklets to more high school students. Two students e-mailed us to express their interest in synthetic biology and consulted to us about how to be admitted by Tsinghua University.
COLLABORATION
Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM.
Communication & Collabroation
With University of Science & Technology Beijing (USTB)
We cooperated with the iGEM team from University of Science & Technology Beijing (USTB) and we both learned a lot of thing from each other.
We often had friendly conversions through WeChat and told each other what our projects is about and how our projects is going. They told us that they had some trouble in assembling a plasmid they needed. They tried a lot of ways to assemble the plasmid but failed and they asked us for help. They sent us the photo of their unsuccessful plasmid and after some analyses we suggested them using a method called Gibson Assembly. They adopted our opinions and did some try again. Later, they told us that they had made it successfully and we were all glad to hear that.
We also invited them to our school and talked about our projects. We learned about that their project is about a kind of compound named notoginseng saponin. They told us about the process and purpose of their experiment in detail and we noticed that there are"
TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," She is an assistant professor in mechanobiology in bone tissue engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology. We had found a paper (Johnson et al., 2018) on bone fracture healing with lysostaphin that we wanted to discuss with her, as we considered the secretion of lysostaphin by our living material.

×
June 22, 2018. Meeting dr. Sandra Hofmann
We proposed our plan to combat bone infections with bacteria producing lysostaphin, encapsulated in a hydrogel. She would not use it for bone infections, because only a hydrogel on bone is not enough (not load-bearing), and combinations with other materials are very complicated. Also , some interesting alternatives eliminating the need for secondary surgery are already being developed right now. And there are some (non-ideal) alternatives which guarantee a reasonable quality of life, which makes it more difficult to find people willing to take the risk of incorporating living GMOs into their body. However, our hydrogel may still be helpful if we turn it into a composite of hydrogel and granules. But for the scope of this project (limited time), she instead recommended us to focus on skin infections. She believes it is very promising. Furthermore, the need for it will only grow as people live longer. This means they develop more decubiti’s and more metabolic syndromes, which in turn increases the risk of skin infections. These infections even have the potential to spread to the bone, worsening the situation. She also gave us some advice in how to handle the bacterial invasion problem: she suggested to research ion release.
Thank you, Sandra, for your extensive feedback!
Insights
Our living material would not be the best solution against bone infections, as hydrogels are not load-bearing, alternative, GMO-free solutions are already being developed and alternatives exist which offer a reasonable quality of life.
In contrast, Gelcatraz would be very suitable as a plaster against skin infections.
Increasing life-spans and a surge of metabolic syndromes increase the demand for a solution against chronic wounds.
Follow-up
This was the final feedback we ‘needed’ to settle on skin infections as our application.
We researched ion release as a method to prevent infiltration of foreign bacteria into our gel.
June 22, 2018. The final decision
We took the feedback received from Sandra Hofmann, during the Dutch Technology Week and earlier feedback from previous iGEM teams and experts into account to settle on the application we would be working on.

UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"yl moiety and to mimic CoA’s role as an acyl carrier. We wanted to explore a large chemical space to increase our chances of finding a hit. We weren’t completely sure if FabI only reduced carbon-carbon double bonds, so we tested valeraldehyde to see if FabI could reduce the aldehyde to an alcohol. To see if FabI could reduce the C-C double bond of an unsaturated carboxylic acid, we tested crotonic acid. We then tested three unsaturated aldehydes, just like crotonyl-CoA, but without the CoA moiety. And finally, to try and find potential acyl carriers, we tested bulky substrates with rings (phenyl acetaldehyde, p-anisaldehyde, and 3-(5-methyl-2-furyl)butanal).
We discovered enzyme activity on the three unsaturated aldehydes (trans-2-pentenal, 2-ethyl-2-butenal, and trans,trans-2,4-heptadienal), but had no activity on any of the other substrates!
We found the enzymes were most active on trans-2-pentenal. There was no measurable enzyme activity using the other 5 substrates. This is highly consistent with the enzyme mechanism in which an allylic double bond is reduced when adjacent to an activating group, such as an electrophilic carbonyl (e.g. an aldehyde or thioester).  Furthermore, crotonic acid has a less electrophilic group adjacent to the allylic double bond, highlighting the high selectivity of FabI for the electronic structure of its substrates.
While significant activity is observed on these alternative substrates, there was a decrease in overall enzyme activity relative to the near-native Crotonyl CoA substrate of ~100-fold. This made it so >500nM enzyme is needed to see enzyme activity in assays.  In order to be used to detect relevant levels of TCS in wastewater the enzyme must have measurable activity at concentrations lower than the concentrations of triclosan in wastewater ( up to 9nM).  Therefore, we have begun to explore the use of enzyme engineering to enhance activity on trans-2-pentenal!
        ↥
Fortunately a crystal structure for the P. falciparum FabI enzyme had already been determined[28]. We used the computational tool Foldit (See 1 ,
2,
3 ) to design 28 mutants. We hypothesized the trans-2-pentenal would occupy a highly similar structural space as"

Thursday 31st
Really need to start working on designing the wiki, but it’s so hard to get away from the lab at this stage. Today was more PCR, and some PCR purification ahead of sequencing.
Friday 1st
We had a meeting with today with some of the supervisors, who are keen to feel out aspects of the project we can ‘kill’ – now that there’s four weeks left. This caused some dismay, but there is some logic to it. There is to be a more official meeting next week where a final decision will be made.
We also had a meeting with Dr. Sam Brown, who advised us on the best way to go about modelling our populations and the mathematics of their growth patterns.
Weekend 2nd-3rd
It rained.
Week 11 (4th August – 10th August)
Monday 4th
Today we became acquainted with the mysterious ‘concentrator’ on the 8th floor, which we used to rescue some primers we diluted too much, like Superman if he was a Biologist.
We met with Frazer again today, who showed us the thing he’s made. It’s a boat with a tree in it, and it represents all kinds of stuff. Then we went to the pub.
Tuesday 5th
Had a Skype chat with the iGEM team from Colombia – seems they are an organising an interesting competition that they want us to be a part of – we shall investigate this.
The model is also becoming more sophisticated after a long discussion today.
Wednesday 6th
Elize and Chiara read all about ants and bees and viruses. They seem confident that this will further our human practices, but it also possible they have simply gone mad.
Thursday 7th
Another big, grand meeting with the supervisors, which ended up being mostly about branding. Some rash promises were made regarding wiki deadlines, and we talked about our art project by Frazer.
Friday 8th
The population control genes were transformed into our cells, and a PAGE gel was run for our degron ligations.
Weekend 9th-10th
Overnight incubations for some transformants were set up - nothing major.
Week 12 (11th August – 17th August)
Monday 11th
The population constructs were miniprepped out and examined on a gel, to mixed results. On a more positive note, we all had a branding meeting at the pub in the evening, where a sort of proto-logo was designed"

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," experience. So it takes much time to understand one thing. But otherwise it’s not a very big challenge.
Dominika:
And in terms of collecting the data?
George:
n terms of collecting the data there are too many challenges. As you know it is hard to reach areas. [...] So distance is one of the problems of data collection. […] Other challenges we have managed to overcome them, because we want quality data [...].
Samira:
What sample size do you take when you go to one village? How many households do you test?
George:
Different countries use different numbers, but in Malawi, because of the nature of our districts, I think we use 1090 children per district. So those districts which are very big, we divided them so that they fit to the WHO criteria. Because WHO, they have their own district size. So our districts, some of them are big. So if you say in our district they maybe tell us to take 30 households. So we are allowed to take 30 households per district. Than according to our districts, they are too big. So we divide those districts into maybe three portions and from those three we take 30, 30, 30. So Malawi maybe has 26 districts, but in terms of trachoma it could be having 40 districts. Because we want to match with WHO saying in a district you can take 30 households.
Samira:
And we heard about that when a certain prevalence is reached when you do the sampling you do mass treatment for the whole village. So what is this prevalence?
George:
Prevalence, especially when you are dealing with trachoma, you are very much worried about the infection. The disease is active when it is trachoma follicle. So [...] in terms of TF, if you have got maybe nine per 1000, then you are thinking Oh, that’s a lot! In terms of trachoma trichiasis, if you find less than one per 1000 [...] BICO considers it as not very important.
Daniel C.:
Is there a difference in the thresholds between villages that have [...] chlamydiosis outbreak for the first time and villages which already have been treated? So are the thresholds different?
George:
No. Because if it is treated for you to have a survey you wait for maybe two years. So we have an impact survey that is ok. After we treated we just want to see what’s the prevalence now. So if you find it’s the same, you just use the same. Like Chikwawa. We treated now a few"

ZJU-China,2015,Team:ZJU-China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," In the seminar, we shared our project and carried out a short discussion about safety issues (see: Seminar) .
Society
May is termites' adult song season, numerous termites fly into houses: rooms are severely damaged, residents could not sleep well, students' daily lives have been spoiled. The whole city is full of complaint and suffering. Thus, thing has to be changed.
So, in the brainstorming phase, ZJU-CHINA 2015 consulted residents around us; high school students; Prof. Mo Jianchu from Institute of Entomology, Zhejiang University; Hangzhou Institute of White Ant Prevention And Cure. A series of consultation helped us to first know about basic cases of termites and current suffering situation in the city. After that, we decided to create something new to terminate termites and so that could save people's life (see: Consultation) .
Our project was processing quickly, with the help of the application scenario (see: Synenergene) , the original idea could be shared easier. In order to know more about people's need and improve the acceptance of Termite Terminator, we were continuing making surveys throughout the project (see: Survey) .
From lots of facts and analysis of the survey, we could find that people's fear of GMOs and the acceptance of a new product were still main points we need to solve in the future. So, to complete the team's reflection, we conducted an experience of Syn-bio Debate and philosophy dialogue throughout the project. What is a successful innovation of a project? Synthetic biology's project stems from life and tries to make a better world. So, one vital point is that how the project can interact with the world naturally.. Based on this thought, except for  the throughout philosophy dialogues among iGEM team, we also invited participants from different majors to be in the Syn-bio Debate (see: Syn-bio Debate) .
Application
How to apply our product into the real world and achieve its ideal function? Based on current references, ZJU-CHINA 2015 designed the indoor device to achieve the goal of monitoring, trapping, and terminating termites successfully (see: Device) .
By writing application scenarios, we have already visualized the intended impact of TERMITE TERMINATOR and present Techno-moral vignettes (see: Synenergene) , focusing on the potential wider impacts of our application. According to these unintended scenes, to reduce future risks, a series of warnings have been added to the Instruction Manual can be proposed (see: Instruction Manual) .

This year we chose to tackle two projects: Biofilms and Bees
At the beginning of the year, our team had many great project ideas. Over the course of a few weeks, we managed to narrow our options down to two projects—saving the bees, and eliminating biofilms. However, we could not decide between them. Both had their merits- saving the bees had a veritable cornucopia of human practices, but difficult, risky lab prospects. Biofilms had almost no human practices opportunities, but an amazing line to follow in lab. This was when one member of our team suggested that we co-develop these projects so that the strengths of one would make up for the weaknesses of the other. At that point, we decided to develop our projects together, and see where they lead us."

VictoriaBC,2009,Team:VictoriaBC#project#biothermometer_-_-_TEXT.html," while the ccdB gene prevents unaltered construction vectors from continuing.  These plasmids would be finally assembled together in a single cell.  It may be advantageous to switch from high copy number assembly plasmid backbones, used while combining the parts, to low or medium copy backbones for the final product.
The individual plasmids should be tested first on their own to determine their individual effectiveness.  This would also allow us to more easily form BioBrick parts for these systems.  The working parts would then be combined to produce cells with multiple temperature reactions.
 
 
Testing Procedure
1.      Grow each plasmid individually in cultures at 30 oC, 35 oC, and 38 oC (nine samples).
2.      Grow the combined cells in cultures at 30 oC, 35 oC, and 38 oC (three samples).
3.      Grow control cultures to account for system biases.
4.      Assay for fluorescence proteins.
 
 
Discussion
The largest issue that might be a problem is that the 37 oC RNA thermometer part ( BBa_K115020 ) has not been shown to be effective.  If it is in fact ineffective this would mean that only the CFP plasmid would work entirely correctly.  The GFP plasmid would either never be repressed (still useful by producing a working change in temperature at 32 oC), or would be always repressed (no GFP ever produced).  The RFP plasmid would also suffer similarly, either always on or always off, serving no purpose.  In this situation, we would want to assemble a system involving only the 32 oC dependent aspects; this system would only have one change, from blue to green at 32 oC.
Other factors that might hinder the overall visible result include, if the fluorescence proteins take too long to show visible results; if the old fluorescence proteins take too long to disappear after a change in temperature; if leakiness in the promoters leaves too much background colour, muddying the indicator; and if the repressors and activators do not produce a  great enough change in fluorescence to be observable.  Depending on these factors the system may be most accurate when intended for use at only one temperature – a situation that would then have proof of being at a constant temperature within a certain range as long as the expressed colour was relatively pure.  Mixed or muddy colouring would indicate inconstant temperature.
 
 
Conclusion
            This presents a procedure for developing a bacterial thermometer with three distinct states"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS_-_-_TEXT.html," 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with"

Module III - Isobutanol production
Overview
Isobutanol
Genetical Approach
Results
Product Synthesis
The CO2 fixation of module II generates 3-phosphoglycerate generated by the Calvin cycle. The 3-phosphoglycerate is transformed to pyruvate by glycolysis. The pyruvate is now used as the initial point for the product synthesis. Pyruvate is the starting point of the producing pathways of a variety of industrially relevant products like isobutanol, isoprene, putrescine or even antibiotics. We decided to introduce an isobutanol production pathway which starts with pyruvate (Figure 1). ( Atsumi et al., 2008 ) This pathway is explained in more detail in the section Genetical Approach .
For this we used and improved some of the BioBricks from iGEM Team NCTU Formosa 2011/2012, which were available at the parts registry. We used the gene coding sequences of four out of five required proteins for the isobutanol production. For further information about our cloning strategic, please check our Genetical Approach section.
We used coding sequences for the following proteins:
AlsS (α-acetolactate synthase)
IlvC (Ketol-acid reductoisomerase)
IlvD (Dihydroxyacid dehydratase)

Aug 30 ~ Sep 5, 2010 Plan: Think about what database modification tool a senior user would like to use. Write full database that includes the whole oscillator. Read more on XML. Have fun working.
Summary: Not having much fun working, with both sides’ tasks to be done. Full database for oscillator is done 2010/9/2. I haven’t checked it in detail yet. It is very likely we are going to change the db structure yet again, good thing though. Learn from libsbml the sbml modification tool, our db modification should somehow like that. It should focus on adding and constructing new model. Discuss on UI&input with Liao, writing the new UI draft.
Sep 5 ~ Sep 12, 2010 Plan: Discuss UI&input with Soimort. Discuss ODE solver with Kun. Teaching junior students how to write DB. Have fun working.
Summary: This is a crazy week for me! Together with Liao, we make huge modifications on the structure of for at least 3 times! We change the xml structure for storing data, revise the attributes on each item, and have heated debate on our standard of bio-modeling. At first the modification process seems endless, but by the end of the week, we have come to agreement on most of the details. This gives me a lot of hope, and this week has definitely been a big leap for our DB. This time Liao finally realizes that we are actually making the next-generation"
Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioMembrane Elastin_-_-_TEXT.html," come from?
While most natural examples of circular mRNA formation do not appear to function as infinite translation templates, circularization machinery has been adapted from an intron splicing system from the thymidilate synthase gene in bacteriophage T4 to produce both long, repetitive proteins1 and circularized aptamers more stable to exonucleases2. The circular RNA produced by Perriman and Ares was 795 bp in length,1, so the 750 bp construct we aim to synthesize should be well within the realm of possibility. The mechanism is described in detail by the Gifu team , but essentially the native functionality depends only on attack of free GTP to remove the intron by circularization and subsequent degradation; this process is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: Native functioning of the intron results in a desired linear exon product and a circular intron which is eventually degraded
Figure 3: When the ends of the original intron are rearranged around a new gene, the same mechanism acts to circularize that functional RNA when it is transcribed; if it has a ribosome binding site it can then be translated.
However, if the 5' and 3' ends of the intron (with a small accompanying portion of the native exon sequence) are conjugated to the 3' and 5' ends of a coding sequence with ribosome binding sites, the reverse process can happen with th exon circularized and the intron pieces removed; This process is detailed in Figure 3. Multiple sources have shown that these products can be translated, but the 2015 Gifu team estimated yield of the circularization product at a mere 2.5%. It is possible that additional proteins are involved, with some indication that initiation of translation by the ribosome encourages proper splicing of the native gene and other proteins can rescue splicing.3 Clearly, the possibility of tuning the response further remains. However, the potential use of this technique to produce a useful naturally repetitive protein remains promising.
Elastin-Like Polypeptides (ELPs)
This is not the first time an iGEM team has worked with ELPs: the 2014 Bordeaux Team studied the characteristics of different numbers of characteristic pentapeptide repeats as potential purification tags and the 2008 Imperial Collage team added a Bacillus subtilis secretion tag to the (EP) 20-24-24 construct from the work of Bellingham et al.4 That work demonstrated the complexity of function dependence on sequence of different ELPs, but did not rule out the generation of alternative interesting constructs"

BACKGROUND
Body odor is very complex and varies between individuals. In order to get non-scientists involved, we used a crowdsourcing approach. Citizen scientists learned about the project and synthetic biology, while helping us collect and analyze samples.
AIMS
Our aims included getting citizen scientists involved by giving us their samples and by analyzing samples. To facilitate this aim we needed to develop an online platform to analyze the data for a wide range of volunteers
ACHIEVEMENTS
More than 600 citizen scientists participated.

Introduction
Body odor is a complex concept that is specific to each individual. To assess this relationship, we chose a crowdsourcing approach, which has been shown to be successful in the past (such as Fold It and Eterna) for big data scientific studies.
In this study, the general public has the opportunity to participate both by giving us their sweat samples and evaluating smells using ""The Smell Game"" platform (a screen shot of which is shown in Fig. 1). While helping us with the project, citizens can learn about their own odor and synthetic biology.
Figure 1: Different types of odors you might smell.This is just part of the odor range people can choose on the platform, alongside the type of emotion they feel when smelling the samples.
Aims
Getting citizen scientists involved: The general public should be involved by either giving samples and/or by analyzing them through an online platform called “The Smell Game”.

Jilin_China,2016,Team:Jilin China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," in judicial work in Intellectual Property Law. In the conversation between Jilin_China and Ms. Fang Ruan, she provided us with a full-scale perspective of gene technology law in China.
The following 4 questions are answered based on our conversation.
1. In China, what are the existing laws concerning gene technology?
The legal aspects of gene technology in our country, embodied in science and technology law，which is an important part of our legal system. Science and technology law refers to the state of science and technology activities arising from the various social relations to adjust the legal norms.
China has developed a number of technical and legal norms on encouraging innovation, safeguarding inventions and patent rights. In the Constitution, we mentioned that science and technology are part of the productive forces, in addition, the state has also formulated the "" Science and Technology Progress Law of the People's Republic of China"", "" Patent Law of the People's Republic of China "" and so on, all of these have a great impact on gene science and technology.
""Science and Technology Progress Law of the People's Republic of China"" is the basic law of our country, however, there are the protection of intellectual property rights and scientific and technological achievements reward of the laws and regulations related to gene technology,, such as "" Patent Law"", the legislation of scientific and technological research institutions and the management of science and technology associations, such as the ""Natural Science Research Institutions to establish, adjust and approve the pilot scheme"", there are also some international scientific and technological exchanges provisions, international treaties and agreements.
2. How popular is the law on gene science and technology nowadays? Whether it is necessary to increase the publicity？
The concept of scientific and technological law is first proposed by the Chinese people. But our development is extremely slow. In recent years, the United States has established more than 100 research centers of various types of technology, published dozens of specialized magazines, nearly a thousand kinds of monographs. Taiwan in recent years has also set up seven research centers of science and technology, and some universities also specifically recruit graduate students in science and technology, science and technology enterprises specializing in the recruitment of legal and technical director. At the same time, many countries are also strengthening the research and legislation of science and technology. Science and technology legislation, scientific research and specialized personnel training has become a global boom.
China also adopted the Popularization of science and technology in People's Republic of China in 2002, which shows that China is also attaching importance to the popularization of science and technology law. It has established a new mechanism from the angle of legislation and social promotion. It has also formed an atmosphere"

Stimulated Plastic Enzymolysis
We used Cut1, FsC, Cut1-sJanus-m(fusion protein) and Janus(sJanus&inJanus) we expressed to conduct PET hydrolysis experiments. We achieved a lot and met some problems as well.
Pre-experiment
Overview
We have found out appropriate concentration of the cutinase we made and suitable pH for our enzyme Thc-Cut1, the right time to detect the product of hydrolysis of PET.
Result
We use absorbance in 600 nm to measure the turbidity of the liquid in tube. We tried different concentration of enzyme with one piece of plastic(3*3*0.25mm), decided to use 2mg/ml to conduct our experiment afterwards.
Figure 1. This curve described the OD600nm after 3h’s reaction changes through the concentration of Thc_Cut1. We can see clearly that at 2mg/ml ,the curve reaches a peak, at which concentration we will compare the hydrolysis effect.
We also conducted our system in various pH, found that the activity of Thc_Cut1 doesn’t change much in different pH, so we chose pH 7.0 as one of our experimental condition.
Figure 2.  The curve shows the absorbance at 600nm changes along with pH. The activity of enzyme doesn’t change much in various pH.
In order to find right time to detect, we detect OD600nm in several time, here’s the result.
Figure 3.  The line clearly indicates that the hydrolysis rate rises along with time.
Considering we need an appropriate detect time to measure the hydrolysis effect, we set our detect time at 3h.
Main experiment
Overview
We discovered the right temperature to conduct various way to mix up our sJanus (or inJanus) and Thc_Cut1. And we have found out the best way to increase the hydrolysis rate.
Result
We conduct our trail in different temperature, realizing 50℃ is the proper temp for the enzyme and our Janus to combine.  
Figure 4. Different colors represent different ways of mix. Thc_Cut1+Janus means enzyme had incubated with Janus for 16h before the plastic was added into the system. And Plastic+Janus means plastic had incubated with Janus before adding enzyme. And we also conduct these incubation separately"
Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#EricDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," S. cerevisiae without Snc1 fused to a membrane anchor for a control. We will measure the active GUS in the supernatant with a liquid assay based on the turnover of  4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide to 4-methyl umbelliferone (4-MU) (Blázquez et al, 2007) . Here we expect a higher activity of GUS in the supernatant of cultures with Snc1 decorated peroxisomes.
To increase the variability of our constructs we also designed vectors with and without a GS-Linker connecting the Snc1 with the Pex15. Additionally we tested our constructs in strains with a deletion of Pex11 . This deletion leads to formation of larger peroxisomes and may increase the efficiency of our secretion mechanism.

In Vivo Sensors
Surveillance of key physiology factors is indispensable for a good understanding and optimization of metabolic processes in compartments. In comparison to in vitro measurements, in vivo sensors have major advantages in terms of measure relevant physiological properties in living systems. Former methods required destructive assays, expensive and time consuming preprocessing of cells or compartments to determining fluxes inside cells Frommeret al. (2010) . This leads to inexact measurements with poor spacial and temporal resolution. The usage of in vivo sensors tackles all of these problems at once. They allow detecting fluxes inside the cell and compartments in real time and supersede difficult and time consuming cell and organelle extraction.
Sensors
To enrich our toolbox we decided to measure four essential physiological factors: ATP, NADPH, Glutathione and the pH.
ATP/ADP conversion is used as an energy currency in many cellular processes like translocation of proteins and metabolites or anabolic and catabolic turnovers. It is assumed that ANT1P an ATP/AMP antiporter is located in the peroxisomal membrane and that the re shuttle mechanism of the peroxisomal protein import machinery is ATP dependent (Palmieri L. et al., 2001) . NADPH plays an important role in anabolic pathways and is also indispensable to our desired pathways of nootkatone and violacein. Glutathione is an antioxidant and redox buffer which is also found in yeast peroxisomes. It is used as cofactor by at least two types of peroxisomal proteins the glutathione peroxidases and glutathione"
