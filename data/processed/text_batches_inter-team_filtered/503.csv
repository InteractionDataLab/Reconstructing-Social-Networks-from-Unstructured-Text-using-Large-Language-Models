We design siRNA sequence from LAR gene (to inhibit non-EGCG compound) using bioinformatics tool and use P97 promoter to initiate expression in mammalian cell (using HeLa cell). That part will be insert into the psB1C3 linear backbone. To checking performance of this part, we insert sequence target of siRNA into the plasmid Bba_E0240 and get the promoter CMV from Bba_K747096 part. We also prepare for positive control and negative control for this experiment. Positive control part containing siRNA for GFP, insert into Bba_K747096 part that contain CMV promoter, and negative control containing CMV promoter and insert to the Bba_E0240 part containing GFP. Each part will be growth in HeLa cell culture and observed the succeding by fluorescent microscope.

A. DETECTOR
1. Background
Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in womenworldwide,with an estimated global incidence of 470,000 newcases and approximately 233,000 deaths per year. Then, we try to make an idea to build a new prototype for early detection to cervical cancer, especially caused by HPV 18 and HPV 16. From the previous results of the two teams, Calgary Team 2013 and Freiburg Team 2012, we build a new prototype with some combination from those teams. We learn about the prototype sensor from Calgary Team 2012 that consist of detector, linker, and reporter that combined into one small test pack. Then, to make the detector, we learn from Freiburg Team 2012 to constructing a new specific TALEs that can bind to our target sequences and we called it TALE 1 and TALE 2.
TALEs or Transcription Activator-Like Effectors comes from natural bacterial effector proteins used by Xanthomonas sp. to modulate gene transcription in host plants to facilitate bacterial colonization (Boch J and Bogdanove, 2010).The central region of theprotein contains tandem repeats of 34 amino acids sequences (termed monomers) that arerequired for DNA recognition and binding (Kay, 2009). Here is the natural structure of TALE from Xanthomonas sp. :

 Ink Production
      
The modeling portion of our project will allow us to estimate our pigment yields. The main pigment example that we are using is melanin. When designing the melA expression construct, we referenced from the Lagunas-Munoz et al., 2016 and we learned that the yields of melanin in E. coli are the highest at a temperature of 30 degrees Celsius and at a pH of 7.0. We will be using their experimental results as a model for what we should be expecting during our attempts to produce the melA tyrosinase and melanin in E. coli. As our system is modified from the system used in this paper to account for BioBrick standards and what we have available to us in the lab, we may be able to explain some differences in our production levels. We are using a different plasmid, cell strain, and will initially be using richer media.
The graphs below summarize some of the data obtained by Lagunas-Munoz et al., 2016. Firstly, they found that the cultures would reach stationary phase before melanin production would begin (or at least be detectable). Secondly, melanin would only be produced when the glucose in the media was consumed, which correlates with the culture reaching stationary phase. The group also found that melanin production was not favourable at growth temperatures of 35 degrees Celsius or higher. They found that the optimal balance between cell growth and melanin production occurred at 30 degrees. Using this information, we decided to grow our melA expressing cultures at 37 degrees until we induced expression with IPTG, then continue to grow the cultures at 30 degrees.

Before holding the presentation, we had done a lot of research and basically determined the theme of our project. So, besides introducing the work of Team USTC in previous years, we also introduced our result of investigation and the rough direction of our project. So the public could know what we were doing.
Experiments for Kids
Bacteria and DNA are what we commonly work with in synthetic biology. And we also frequently talk about them in our daily life. However, the public usually don't have accesses to know them closer,so we managed to make them accessible.
Attempting to attract more citizens, especially children, to know more about biology, we designed a simple experiment to extract DNA from fruits with kitchen materials.
Experiment procedures:             1. Grind the fruit(strawberry, watermelon, peach or kiwifruit) with NaCl into paste.             2. Add 5ml domestic detergent and keep stirring for 1min.             3. Filter it.             4. Add 10 ml EtOH into filtrate.           5. Nodular DNA shows.
We do hope our human practice can attract kids to think further, lead them into a new field of scientific research, or even make they become new scientists one day. It turned to be a great success. The experiment taught kids basic konwledge on synthetic biology and molecule biology. In the experiment, children have to choose the finest fruit to extract DNA. So it also stimulates their interests on the process of research.
""With this experiment we--both me and my kid--have learned a lot about biology. I have never expected that I can SEE DNA with my own eyes."" said a parent,""It's quite amzing. I'll do it again with my kid in our own kitchen!""
Plastic for Plants
The ecological stability of human settlements is part of the relationship between humans and their natural, social and built environments.Fundamental human needs such as the availability and quality of air, water, food and shelter are also linked to sustainable development. However, the pollution from plastic has become a main block of sustainable development nowadays. So we held an event called 'Plastic for Plants', aiming to recycle massive plastic from college students. And we sent out plants in return.
Environmental sustainability concerns the natural environment and how it endures and remains diverse and productive. Since natural resources are derived from the environment, the state of air, water, and the climate are of particular concern. To protect our planet, the waste of plastic,"

To expand our influence in the society and let more people participate and focus on our project, we also need some financial support. We wrote an article on the internet to describe what synthetic biology and iGEM are, and to introduce our own project.  Our team members also introduced our project in the real life: they visited some companies which are related to biology and explained our project to them. We got the funding from Nanjing Zhengbeicehui Equipment Inc., Hunan Tianxingjian Project Management Inc., Shanghai Songyuan Cork Foam Inc., Beijing Shiyuan Business Inc., Kanglihua Company and Beijing Huaxiafengxing Advertisement Inc, etc. Through this practice, we not only challenged ourselves in negotiating with adults, especially the managers of some enterprises, but also expanded our influence in the society such as the marketplace. We played a role in promoting the influence of synthetic biology and iGEM.
Field Trip to Tsinghua University and Peking University
On July 20th and 21st, 2017, our team took a field trip to Tsinghua University and Peking University to attend a meeting with instructors and their former iGEMers. We explained our project idea and they warmly offered us some specific suggestions in our experiment design and human practice. Informed that our attempt was to improve the salt resistance of the yeast and increase the efficiency of food waste disposal, they generously provided us some information from the former teams which had studied the similar project from a different perspective. After the communication, we had a pleasant dinner and appreciated their help. Then they offered their contact information to us, looking forward to our further improvement.
Propaganda in families and communities
Most of our family and community have no idea about the synthetic biology. We gave lectures to our parents and our neighbors. Most of people are confused with or held some wrong opinions about synthetic biology. Through our introduction and explanation, they realized that synthetic biology is not as horrible or scary as what they used to think. We changed their opinions, also taught them some basic knowledge of the synthetic biology that they have never thought of.  We also helped many children understand that biology is really useful and interesting. We not only introduced our project, we also spread the influence of the synthetic biology and iGEM.

Examples of Misuse of Terminology:
For Composite Parts:
PartID: BBa_S04055
PartName: Synthetic lacYZ operon
This part is functional and responsible for the production of LacY     and LacZ proteins. This part partially fits the definition for “composite     part” but actually should be a protein generator as it fits fully to     the definition of “protein generators”.
For Protein Generators:
PartID: BBa_J45299
PartName: PchA & PchB enzyme generator
The part which is illustrated above actually fits the definition     for “composite part” but in part registry it is classified as protein     generator. This part can be functional but it needs a promoter. Even     though this part is not functional and is not capable of producing protein,     part registry assigns this product as protein generator. We suggest     that all parts in the registry, which are composed of more than one     atomic part and which are not functional on their own but can be functional,     should be classified as “composite parts”.
For Reporters:
PartID: BBa_J04451
PartName: RFP Coding Device with an LVA tag
This functional part is classified as “Reporter” in the parts registry     database. It is very clear that this part fits the same description     as Protein Generator in Biobrick part registry standards. Although,     this part has specific and known functional role, characterizing this     part as a reporter is unnecessary and contributes to the level of complexity     of information provided. Instead, we suggest that this part should be     classified as “protein generator” and related detailed information about     the specific function of this part, should be provided in the part information     page.
In conclusion, as mentioned above we tried to reorganize and normalize     the information about parts which is provided in part registry for 2010     in order to develop our algorithm for the BioGuide application. During     this process, we encountered some inconsistencies and misuses of the     terminology being used and also inadequacies about the information provided     about parts. First of all, we claim that a standard nomenclature should     be constituted for future use in the field of synthetic biology. Based     on the information gathered according to new nomenclature a professional     database should be constructed to address the needs of synthetic biology.     This will enable easy information exchange and exhibition globally.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#modelFeatures_-_-_TEXT.html," there are no restrictions, but parts of compartments are not suggested to appear in a binding structure.
The Basic Assumption
The basic assumption of Chain-Node Model is that a part ALWAYS carries its properties wherever it is placed in an instance of Chain-Node Model. This means no matter how complicated the complex is, you can always keep track of the location and properties of every single part. By letting complex inherits its parts’ properties, the assumption saves modelers from rewriting the structure and function of each new complex. However, we should address that the assumption is not suitable for all circumstances. For example, under this assumption, a fusion protein will carry the properties of the fused proteins, which is not true in many cases. A fusion protein may not remain its old properties and even have new properties that none of the original parts have. In this case, our suggestion is to define the fusion protein as a new part. So it is suggested that users choose different strategies of describing the same thing in Chain-Node Model base on different situations, instead of modeling everything in the same way.
Examples
With great power there must come great responsibility. In order to use the powerful Chain-Node Model correctly, please have a look at a few examples we presents.
Example of a species: E.coli cell
In MoDeL, the cell of E.coli is described as a species with only one part of E.coli(see Figure 1). Since the concept of part has been extended greatly, living cells can be described in the same way other species. Compartment belongs to “Non-sequence”, so it is suggested that E.coli only exists as a one-part-species.
Figure 1: The Chain-Node Model of a E.coli cell
Example of a species: pLacI*:LacI4 and its tree structure of binding.
Here is another example of template species with more complicated structure.(see Figure 2) In biology, LacI tetramer (or LacI4) can bind with promoter pLacI as a repressor. When bond with LacI4, pLacI is repressed and its transcription speed will decrease significantly. In order to express this alteration, as mentioned above, we use another part of pLacI* with decreased transcription speed instead of pLacI in the species.
The structure of binding sites is shown in figure (see Figure 3). The graph indicates that LacI monomers first bind together to form LacI dimer, then LacI dimers forms LacI tetramer, and finally LacI4 binds with pLac"

We thereafter made a very easy, quick and succesful assembly. Afterwards we expressed the CYP and confirmed that a membrane preperation of BL21 cells were able to confirm trypthophane to an oxime with a TLC
TLC
cB1: B1 with illegal restriction sites.
User B1: B1 assembled with USER assembly method
Tryptophane: Substrate for B1.
Oxime: Reference oxime.
As is observed from the TLC, the bond of the reference oxime has moved slightly shorter than the oximes produced by the cytochromes. The reference oxime was the oxime produced by CYP79A1 and would probably migrate a little different, but insignificant.
We believe that the difference in migration is due to the fact that the container used, caused a smiling effect on the TLC.  Because of limited time, we did not have time to reproduce data in another container, but we are convinced that if we used an other container, the reference oxime would verify the production of oximes produced by B1.
CO-measurement
A specific characteristic of p450's, is their absorbance of light at 450 nm in their active state. As a part of our characterization, we have performed CO-measurements on the purified p450 membrane fractions, which supposedly should contain a enriched amount of p450 enzyme.
CO (carbon monoxide) is added to a membrane sample, by blowing bubbles at approximately 1 bubble/sec in 60 seconds.  The reason for doing this, is that the CO binds the heme group of cytochrome p450, which holds the p450 in its active conformation and shifts the absorbance from 420 to 450 nm. For the CO to bind, it is necessary to reduce the heme group with a strong reducing agent as dithionite.
Unfortunately, we did not observe a peak at 450 nm. We did although repeatedly observe peaks at 420. This is most probably something endogenous substance in E.coli. We did not perform a negative control, which could have indicated whether the 420 was only a result of endogenous compounds or the oxidized form of p450.
Although all active p450's theoretically should absorb at 450 nm in their active state, it is in some cases possible to have an active enzyme without observing the peak"
IIT_Delhi,2017,Team:IIT Delhi#Bifurcation_-_-_TEXT.html,", where all the repressors have the same cooperativities and degradation rates.  The results for the bifurcation analysis are shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3. The hopf branch is clearly visible in Figs. 1, 2. We see that for a give cooperativity, increasing the degradation rate leads to reduction in the amplitude of oscillation and finally the oscillations die out. Frequency has an inverse relationship with amplitude; points close to the hopf branchin in the oscillator region have high frequency, while moving away from the hopf branch, within the oscillatory region, leads to a reduction in frequency.
Fig.1: Colour map representing bifurcation analysis w.r.t. frequency
Fig.2: Colour map representing bifurcation analysis w.r.t. amplitude
It is evident from Figs., 1 and 2 that the range of degradation rate over which the system oscillates increasing with increasing cooperativity. Thus, selecting a higher cooperativity would make the system more robust to variation in the degradation rate of the system.
To assess the extent to which the system response is close to a square wave, we define a ‘squareness’ metric. To compute the metric, we calculate the correlation between the system response and an ideal square wave with same period as the system. This correlation value is compared against the extent of squareness of a sinusoidal wave. The final squareness value captures the extent to which the system response is squarer than a sinusoidal signal.
Fig.3: Colour map representing squareness
We see that majority of the oscillatory region shows some square behavior. The maximum squareness is observed for high cooperativity values. Given Figs. 1, 2 and 3, we expect that a point selected in the mid to low degradation ranges for high cooperativity would sustain robust square like oscillations.

Through collaborations and partnerships with other Chinses iGEM team, we share our idea, provide assistance within our capability, promote our friendships, and strengthen our understanding of synthetic biology. And on this page, we would like express our heartfelt gratitude towards all the teams below that we have kept sound cooperative relationship with this year. Furthermore, we expect that all of these will pave the way for a deeper cooperation and are looking forward to build friendships with more iGEMers around the world in the near future.
schoolCollaboration with SYSU-Software
In order to design short hairpin RNA (shRNA) conform to demands in our experiments, we cooperated with SYSU-Software from Sun Yat-sen University to develop a corresponding software. We provided algorithms and design requirements, and then SYSU-Software wrote this delicate software for us. With their help, we successfully designed K-ras shRNA, whose sequence and predicted structure are shown below (Fig. 1). We validated that this shRNA was able to down-regulate the expression level of K-ras in A549 effectively. We thank SYSU-Software for receiving us with attention and for such strong contribution to our work.

Degrade endocytosed cellulose and produce H₂ plus CO₂. Anaerobic, occur on mitochondria in the cells
A termite, Zootermopsis angusticollis
Information about Species that live inside Termites (1,2,3) .
The termites that are attacking the MIT are Zootermopsis angusticollis, a type that live in several states of USA (4) .
In Research, Termites have started to destroy plastic because of a random mutation inside one of its symbionts organisms:  The protozoa Trichonympha, one of the organisms in charge of degrading the cellulose that Termites bring inside their guts.
Termites are hard to kill, so in this hypothetical scenery, destroying them with normal insecticides wouldn’t be a definitive solution for this problem. Termites would probably resist the attacks of insecticides, and if we aren’t able to destroy them all, the plastic mutation would spread in a world that is plastic made, with the force of Darwinian evolution boosting it.
This is where Synthetic Biology appears.
Targeted microorganisms
Trichonympha, one of the protozoa that lives inside Zootermopsis angusticollis
The objective of the game is to eliminate the termites that have the mutated Protozoa, in order to save the world from the disappearance of plastic. As the termites are hard to kill, the target is the mutated protozoa, Trichonympha. But a protozoa itself is hard to kill, too. Should we try to attack the protozoa with toxic compounds? If it isn’t effective with termites, there is no reason to believe that is a good and effective strategy for Protozoa. Should we genetically modify them, in order to stop the mutation? But protozoa are eukaryotic, and because of that are hard and slow to modify. The answer Research gives to this problem is: treat this issue just as the old one. If the strategy was killing the protozoa in order to kill the termite, then kill the symbiont bacteria that lives in the surface of Trichonympha in order to kill the protozoa, and with this, kill the termite. It is also necessary to consider that the strategy used should be controlled enough in order to stop it when it is needed. The idea is to kill the termites that possess the mutated Protozoa; not the entire termite community, which could cause horrible"

Rutgers,2013,Team:Rutgers#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"ucer producing bacteria [1]. This cell-cell communication in bacteria is a process called quorum sensing, which allows for bacteria to respond to fluctuations in the number of species present by altering physiological activities [1].
Acylated Homoserine Lactones are neutral lipid molecules composed of a homoserine lactone ring with an acyl chain. AHLs produced by different species of Gram-negative bacteria vary in length and composition of the acyl chain which contain 4 to 18 carbon atoms, making most quorum-sensing systems within bacterium species or group specific. AHLs are synthesized by AHL synthases and diffuse in and out of the cell by active or passive transport [1].
LuxR: LuxR is a gene that codes for the receptor protein that binds to the autoinducer. As the receptor binds to the autoinducer, the complex binds a specific sequence of DNA in front of the right operon and activates the expression of lux structural genes. The LuxR protein is at first inactive but when the autoinducer binds the receptor protein becomes activated. The LuxR-autoinducer complex binds to a 20 bp palindromic sequence, called the LuxBox [2].
LuxI: LuxI is a gene that synthesizes the autoinducer.
LuxBox: The LuxBox is a 20 bp palindromic promoter sequence. The binding of the luxR-autoinducer complex to this sequence increases RNA polymerase's affinity towards the promoter region of the LuxI and structural genes downstream of LuxI region [2].

We do this by searching for dioxin receptors which might have arisen in species living in contaminated areas.” However, this is not their usual approach in developing new sensor systems, which consist of extensive literature study and making use of toxicological research.
When we came to discussing Electrace, Van Der Burg reacted very enthusiastic. “Alternative read-outs are very interesting. For light and fluorescence assays you need lots of equipment and devious procedures. For us, this is not really a problem since we do our measurements in the lab, but for a device like yours, which is to be applied in the field, is a really ‘nice trick’.” Also, our plan to create single-use, disposable paper microfluidics strips fascinated him: “That is very interesting; a disposable device is really the thing you need. What would make it even better is if you don’t have to cultivate your bacteria anymore. These costs a lot of time, and maybe even more important, a lot of money.” We further discussed possible (commercial) application of our Electrace system. “Even when a handheld device shows to be unfeasible, there is a lot of potential for you to develop your project in a kit-like setting. This is much easier to sell than a license!”
We told Van Der Burg that we had some concerns about the speed of our system. He told us not to worry about that too much: “Our systems have a response time between 4 and 24 hours. If you really want a fast reaction you should use the translocation of tagged proteins, but this is at the expense of your accuracy.” Furthermore, he gave us some valuable advice: “The specialty of BDS is the measurement of complex mixtures, which is really important for real world applications. If your reporter responds to TNT in a distilled water solution, that is nice, but you should try if it is also possible to sense it in the kind of sample that you will use. In your case this will mean adding TNT to ground water and test it.”

Thawing of eukaryotic cells
New Phoenix cell stocks were thawed:
cryotube was thawed at 37°C water bath until almost defrosted
stock was filled in 9 ml warm completed growth medium and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 2 min
medium was removed and refilled with 10 ml warm completed growth medium
cells were seeded on 100 mm plates
Testing optimal cell density of mouse fibroblasts
NIH 3T3 have a really fast growth so that we tested the optimal cell number for seeding NIH 3T3 for having around 60% cell density on the next day. NIH 3T3 cells grow very fast; therefore we have tested the optimal seeding cell number to obtain 60% cell density on the next day. Results indicate that the optimal cell number is 1 &ndash 1.5x10^5 cells per well ( = 0.5 – 0.75 cells/ml)

Miller Assay Results
The Miller Assay yielded the following data set:
The data shows that the cultures induced by isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) yield higher Miller Units than the uninduced control after 60 min. Therefore, a higher amount of β-galactosidase was produced. This shows that the part is working as expected. Furthermore a slight quantitative dependence of the Miller Units on the concentration of IPTG can be seen. After 120 min the Miller Units of the culture induced with 1.0 mM"

Procedure to Measure OD
1 mL of LB broth in cuvette used as blank
100 ul of sample, 900 ul of LB broth in cuvette
AD 600 reading multiplied by 10 to obtain OD measurement (Beer-Lambert's Law)
Next, we autoclaved 1 L LB, added 1 mL of Ampicillin. The OD measurement from start-up culture tube labelled G-Block 4, Colony 1, was 0.38, the highest and most optimal out of the three. The contents of this tube were added to the 1 L of LB and 1 mL of ampicillin. The contents were put in a shaking incubator for 3 hours and 45 minutes. Another OD check was completed, this time reported to be 0.5. Next 5 mL of IPTG was added to further initiate growth and the contents were left to incubate overnight."

Intra-Provincial Collaboration: Alberta Strong
This iGEM season the UAlberta Team participated in a province-wide collaboration by hosting the Alberta iGEM Meeting, called aGEM, for all the Alberta iGEM teams this September. At aGEM, teams were able to present their progress on their projects and get valuable feedback from previous and current iGEM judges. There was also a free-for-all session that enabled teams to get together, discuss issues and solicit suggestions regarding different aspects of the project (e.g., wetlab, fundraising, human practices). In addition, we also submitted monthly updates documenting Team UAlberta’s adventures to a monthly newsletter assembled by UCalgary.

pSB1C3 transformation into Enterobacter ludwigii FCP2-01
Our team used the plasmid backbone pSB1C3 in the organism Enterobacter ludwigiiFCP2-01 ( BBa_K2633006 ), and provided the first evidence that an Enterobacter species can be transformed stably with this organism. The clade which our chassis comes from is important medically, agriculturally, and ecologically (Hoffmann and Roggenkamp 2003), and this provides potential to apply this part and many parts in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts to organisms in this group.
Our improvement upon pSB1C3 is by the composite part BBa_K2633000 . A restriction illegal version of this part was used to transform Enterobacter ludwigii FCP2-01, as seen in Figure 1 . The transformed strain was then used to inoculate Brachypodium distachyon by soaking seeds in bacterial culture, and the plant were grown for 5 weeks with images taken at 1 week intervals. Example of FCP2-01 expressing acdS-GFP are seen in Figure 2 .

After our club members had enough background knowledge, we arranged lab courses in both our high school and Peking University for them to practice basic experiments.
The establishment of the iGEM club enables us to learn about synthetic biology in a constructive and supportive environment. Moreover, we were also impressed by questions asked by our team members, since these questions demonstrate not only understanding, but also application of knowledge. These questions forced us to review the mechanisms of molecular biology in more depth. And when teaching our club members about experimenting, we learned through their mistakes, often points that we forgot to point out, which strengthen our experimentation skills.
Street Science
In order to spread the idea of synthetic biology and genetic engineering, we held a street science exhibition at school during lunchtime on October 19th. We performed the DNA extraction from fruits with two steps: polarizing and extracting. Strawberries, salts, and detergents were prepared for the exhibition as raw materials of the experiment. In the first step, we mixed salts, ground strawberry jam, detergents, and water to differentiate nonpolar substance from cells. We put the mixture in water bath 60° Celsius, for 15 minutes to speed up the reaction. Then we put the final DNA solution into a beaker and poured the same amount of alcohol into the beaker. Feather-like substance sank down to the bottom of the beaker in a process known as ethanol precipitation.

Induction of the light-switchable promoter systems in Y190 S. cerevisiae with red light
Investigator: Jeff, Ingmar
Aim of the experiment: Induction of the light-switchable promoter systems in Y190 S. cerevisiae with red light. The induced light-switchable promoter system will hopefully switch on the gene expresesion of the reporter Renilla luciferase.
Procedure:
The 2 days old transformated Y190 yeast cell suspension were diluted until it reach an OD600 of ~0.5-0.6.
Phycocyanobilin (PCB), which we extracted moths ago, was added after steril-filtration into the medium (cend(PCB)=25 µM).
3 samples of each system were induced with full red light intensity, 2 samples of each system with 1/10 intensity and 2 samples of each system remain non-induced.
Every sample contains 3 ml cell suspension and was pipetted in a 4 ml cuvette.
Before start of the experiment, we took one sample for luciferase assay and OD600 measurement for getting the start value. (PCB was added, but we defined this sample as without PCB because PCB needs about 30 min to get into the cells)
The induction red-light-box was set up as following: Every 5 min there was a 10 s lasting red-light pulse with intensities as described.
Induction was performed overnight (15 h) at 30 °C in a 200 rpm shaker.

Standardization
Standardization of MoDeL
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. Knowing the importance, USTC_Software puts a lot of effort on the standardization of MoDeL. We have requested BBF RFC55 for MoDeL, and constructed a beta version of XML schema to describe the XML structure of MoDeL.
BBF RFC55
BBF RFC55: Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language (MoDeL) mainly describes the detailed language specifications of MoDeL with concrete examples, which provides enough information for serious database constructors to build up a database on his own. As a highlight of MoDeL, the concept and the syntax of Chain-Node Model are described in detail. The content of document is currently arranged as follows:
Figure 1: Draft document of RFC55 - Table of Contents
The document of RFC55 has already been submitted. You can find it on the webpage of The BioBricks Foundation:RFC . Following are some more previews at the draft document.
Figure 2: Preview at draft document of RFC55
Figure 3: Preview at draft document of RFC55
XML Schema
XML Schemas express shared vocabularies and allow machines to carry out rules made by people. They provide a means for defining the structure, content and semantics of XML documents. Being written in XML fashion, a Schema is perfect for MoDeL to allow software to perform check on syntax. Following is the preview of the beta version of XML Schema for MoDeL. The Schema can be downloaded at iGaME project page on SourceForge.

Figure 5: Preview at XML Schema of MoDeL
Future Work
Future work
To promote MoDeL for wide use as a standard, we need to refine the structure of MoDeL definition and extend its content to enable descriptions of more biological process. In the future, the new version of MoDeL will be proposed and new functions of iGame will be added.
Next version of MoDeL
MoDeL is young, to be exact, just born. There must be a long way before he can stand up and run by himself. At this stage, we have to take extra care of him. Knowing the drawbacks of MoDeL, we have already got a list of improvements waiting to be implemented in the next version of MoDeL. They are:

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html," a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.

Mass action kinetics
Mass action kinetics is the assumption that the rate of reaction is proportional to concentration of the reactants. We chose to create a mass action kinetics model as we could use relatively few parameters. Reducing the number of parameters, whilst keeping the model representative of the system, made it easier to understand the effect of varying each parameter. We built the model in MATLAB first, and later ported it to JavaScript to make it a better design tool for the biologists and better communicate how the model works.
Graph interactivity
We spent a long time reviewing previous teams models. A problem we found was that most models weren’t communicated in a way that was engaging and easy to understand. We’ve tried to explain our model in a way that someone with no experience in modeling could understand.
We’ve used interactive graphs on this page - when you get to them you can drag the sliders to change parameters and see how they affect the system.
We initially ported our model to a webpage so the design team could try out new stuff when they were designing our toehold switches. This turned out to be very useful for both of us. We decided to make it look a lot nicer and improve its compatibility with different browsers so we could put it on the wiki.

Results show that COMPy is expressed on the membrane of the bacteria ( Figure 2 ). Though it remains a small increase, reasons for this can be that the bacteria are having trouble expression the protein itself or the non-natural amino acid causes problems for expression. For the used protocol see Antibody Labelling .
Figure 3. COMPy labeled with DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA.
DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA Confirmation
Now that it is proven that the protein is expressed on the membrane the next step can be taken. This assay is to see whether or not the non-natural amino acid is being incorporated into COMPy. For labeling DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA was used. If the non-natural amino acid is present in the protein then DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA should be measured after washing steps. DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA was added in two different concentrations, in excess, to bacteria solution after expression of COMPy was induced. The bacteria were then analyzed with FACS.  Data clearly shows that DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA is still on the membrane after washing steps ( Figure 3 ). Therefore the DBCO of the dye is clicked to the azide, in other words: the dye has covalently bound to the protein. The fact that there is also a lot of signal at a lower fluorescence (around 102) goes to show that there is a lot of variance between bacteria expressing COMPy. A peak at high fluorescence is what is expected when the bacteria produce the protein well. For the used protocol see FACS sorting with DBCO-PEG(10kDa) and FACS sorting with DBCO-TAMRA .
Influence Non-Natural Amino Acid on the Expression of COMPy
To be able to determine the influence of the Non Natural amino acid on COMPy a small modification had to be done to the protein. The TAG codon has been mutated into a TTG codon, coding for a serine. The mutated protein is called COMPy noTAG. After mutation the new plasmid has been transformed into a BL21 strain and cultured. The original COMPx was also cultured. Protein expression has been induced and the pAzF amino acid has been given to both cultures. After expression both types were labeled with Anti-HA antibody in two concentrations and have been analyzed with the FACS. For the used protocol see Antibody Labelling .

In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," Oriented iGEM is a global initiative encouraging students to use synthetic biology to solve real world problems. Our project tackles two major problems facing Atlantic Canada: sustainable fuel and forestry waste. We’re using synthetic biology to convert cellulose waste from the forestry industry into ethanol, a potent biofuel. Our team is comprised of eager and passionate undergraduate students and graduate mentors from all disciplines. iGEM is currently the only opportunity in Atlantic Canada for students to obtain hands on synthetic biology research experience. We’ll be traveling to Boston in November to represent Atlantic Canada at the 2017 iGEM jamboree where we will be presenting our findings to researchers, corporations, and students from around the world. The message: Our project tackles two issues for Atlantic Canada and could offer an economically viable solution. Furthermore, students part of iGEM have training that is not found elsewhere in the province. Technical difficulty: Limited scientific jargon. Very short and concise. A 6-Year Old: Fun Oriented Within your stomach are millions of very tiny bugs called bacteria that help you out in all sorts of ways such as breaking down the food you eat. It is not just people who have these helpful bacteria, lots of other animals do as well. For example, the spiky animal called the porcupine has bacteria in its stomach which help it break down the wood it likes to eat. We wanted to see if we could get the parts of the bacteria responsible for breaking down the wood to function outside of the porcupine stomach. That way we could break down left over wood into helpful things such as fuel. The message: We are attempting to harness the different abilities of the bacteria found on and in the body. Technical difficulty: No scientific jargon. Not focused too much on our project. As communication is the major theme to our outreach efforts , it was imperative that we practiced and attempted to better our own communication habits. Writing these elevator pitches served as an important exercise in learning how best to convey our project."

We connected BBa_K1755401'MarO', as a promoter, with BBa_1755003'RBS+ribB CDS+B0014'to get BBa_K1755301.
1.1.2  How does it work
MarO is a promoter, which belongs to the mar operon in E.coli. Genetic organization of the mar regulon in E.coli shows as Fig 2a. There are two promoter sites on the marO operator, and both of them can be bound by a kind of regulatory protein called MarR, which is coded by MarR and can repress the expression of marO(Fig 2b and Fig 2c)[2]. MarR is a very special and vital transcription factor, which can bound to either of marO's two promoter sites rs1 and rs2(rs means re"

CLSB-UK,2016,Team:CLSB-UK#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," fuels, governments across the world have begun to increase funding for renewable energy sources such as solar energy. As a result, it seems realistic to expect subsidies for BPVs. This should further reduce their cost. Such subsidies are likely to be similar to those that already exist for solar power. In the UK, those who install solar panels are paid a set rate for every kWh of electricity they produce for themselves and can also sell excess energy (which would otherwise go to waste) back to the electricity supplier, earning up to £4.85 per unit of electricity. Thus, governmental subsidies will also go some way to bringing down cost levels, making BPVs feasible in the long term.
Social Justice
Future iterations could help to solve the world’s energy problems. BPVs could provide a consistent and easy-to-maintain energy source for less developed countries with limited expertise due to their ease of assembly and ability to self-repair. Moreover, their natural reliance on sunlight makes them a perfect fit for countries near the equator, providing a reliable source of energy in otherwise difficult conditions. Therefore, they can act effectively wherever traditional solar cells do well  - that is, everywhere from South Africa to the Sahara as well as other areas that receive a great deal of sunlight.
Our Plans to Address This
As a result of the lack of information on genetic engineering, our team is considering setting up a club for younger members of our school to gain a basic understanding of the principles of genetic modification, and provide an easy route for pupils to access relevant material and learn further about the subject if they so wish. The club will be run by current iGEM members, so we will be able to answer questions and inform younger students about our current project and about synthetic biology as a whole, possibly allowing for Question and Answer sessions giving students a different perspective of what iGEM consists of beyond books and online research. This will help spread general understanding about synthetic biology, and possibly spark interest that could lead to future iGEM teams!
We have also focused on spreading the word through social networks, most noticeably on the Facebook page IGEM-Clsb-Uk. We have carefully documented many crucial stages, from growing our cultures to building our first Biological Photovoltaic cell, and have spread the word amongst family, friends and other iGEM teams, such as Sheffield iGEM and the University of Edinburgh iGEM team.

BIT,2017,Team:BIT-China#HPGold_-_-_TEXT.html," features of sweetness?
Through these two questions our questionary got the information about the market demand. We knew that people might be more acceptable to natural sweeteners, and comparing with aftertaste, coolness and mellowness, sweetness is more important.
Sdic Zhonglu Fruit Juice Co.,Ltd
As soon as we completed the initial plan, we visited the Sdic Zhonglu Fruit Juice Co.,Ltd, the most outstanding company in the area of producing concentrated fruit juice in China. We regarded the chance of discussing with the the chief engineer Mr. Wang as an honor and he was so friendly and warm-hearted to answer all questions asked by us and introduced the plight and prospect of sweeteners. For instance, saccharin is extremely sweet and low calories, but it has some certain potential risks to human beings, while the international standard of food health was never ignored by anyone. Thus our project has a really great future of the application through the two aspects including market prospect and policies.
COFCO
When several constructions of genes had been finished and tests had been carried out, the COFCO which is the one of the top 500 corporations and the most advanced food supplier in China became our next interviewee. Some of the managers showed up to welcome us and  they are the principal of innovating new product—Mrs. Zhao, the one of vice chairmen of the company—Mr. Huang and the doctor who is responsible for the manipulating of electronic tongue technique—Mr. Liu. We had a long but meaningful chat about the current device used by most of the food producing companies, which made us realize that the generally used machine’s range is so limited that it is hard to measure the sweetness conveniently as well as some devices like electronic tongue technique would only be efficient after the association with the assessment given by workers, which results in the humongous uncertainty. Therefore, an innovative bio-system which relies on Synthetic Biology to observe and select new types of sweeteners will have a non-negligible contribution to the society. Finally, we accepted the advice which came from COFCO and what they suggest is to let us start with some classical and conventional sweeteners like stevia rebaudiana，liquorice and Momordica grosvenori.
COFCO AGAIN
When we had run the experiments for several months and attained a certain achievements, we decided to visit COFCO again to show what we had done and what we expected to do in the future, which thoroughly pleased almost all of managers shown up and made them create the idea to cooperate with us afterwards as they appreciated our bio machine"

 HOME HUMAN PRACTICES SAFETY NOTE RESULTS PARTS PROJECT TEAM
Integrated
Our human practices involve in several aspects including biosafety, social activity and public education. Our aSTARice is a genetically-modified organism, (GMO), so our work focuses on promotion of the knowledge for GMO and survey on people's concern about GMO.
1. Public
Our public activity was the main body of our human practices, so we made a lot efforts on it. As we all know, genetical modification is now a critical technology, which is misunderstood by many people. Because our astaxanthin rice is basically a kind of transgenic product, it's our duty to do some efforts to help the society to form a correct understanding of this technology.
Part I:   Self-improvement
First of all, we should make sure that we ourselves have correct understanding on this question. For this reason, we took part in a great lecture about transgenic.
Keynote speaker of this lecture includes Jianping Kou,who is director of the Department of “genetically modified organisms safety management and Intellectual Property Office” from “Department of Science, Technology and Education” in MOA(Minstry of Agriculture) of China, and Min Lin, who is director of Institute of Biotechnology of CAAS (Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences).
In this lecture, we got to know that transgenic foods, that are saleing in market are absolutely safe. For they were tested by associated departments and labs for many years in scientific ways. And up to now，there are only a few kinds of transgenic products have gotten permission into Chinese market. After lecture, we communicated with these scientists about new technologies on transgenic research.
Apart from that, we've also took part in a talk given by Yongning Wu, who is the director of ""Key Laboratory of Food Safety Risk Assessment, Ministry of Health"", which belongs to China National Center for Food Safety Risk Assessment (CFSA). In this talk, we obtained a lot of informations in analysing GMO.
As we are working to create a new kind of crop, we think we should also know more about agriculture, so we joined in The Sixth Asian Conference on Precision Agriculture as volunteers.

3HB sole carbon source growth in M9S with 3HB permease. MG1655 with 3HB permease can grow better in M9 supplement media using 3HB as the sole carbon source, compared to MG1655 empty vector. 3HB concentrations were tested at 4 levels - 1 mM, 10 mM, 50 mM and 100 mM. Growth inhibitory effect exhibited at 100 mM of 3HB. Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=3.

Of interest is phaCAB in M9S at 10 mM, as this appears to be a local optimum, indeed this is seen in M9M grown phaCAB, while empty vector at 10 mM grows much less in comparison. An ANOVA for this data gives (F 3,12 = 1.669, p < 0.2262), which means that there is no significant difference between the data.

Waterloo,2010,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html,"0. In less than twenty years, most of the S. aureus strains known to man were unaffected by the antibiotic. In the late 1950s, a penicillinase-resistant penicillin was brought forth to the medicinal market; this was methicilin (Deurenberg and Stobberingh, 2008.) The bacterium's subsequent resistance to methicilin came two years after its introduction in 1959. The mecA gene responsible for methicillin resistance is also to blame for the organisms’ desensitization to several classes of antibiotics (Deurenberg and Stobberingh, 2008). This has led to the creation of the term: MRSA, now commonly used worldwide.
While an MRSA infection is much like a S. aureus infection, the difference comes in the lack of sensitivity of the MRSA to several classes of antibiotics. This makes MRSA infections a serious threat in both health and economical aspects.
The infection could be easily transferred directly (through regular skin-to-skin contact), as well as indirectly (through contamination of surfaces). The ease with which infection could occur, as well as the high mortality rate involved with the infection, make MRSA a serious threat to the health of patients worldwide (Durai et al., 2010.)
Apart from health issues, the high treatment costs associated with MRSA infections are also of priority. The treatment of MRSA infected patients may result in intravenous antibiotics being taken, as well as a prolonged hospital stay. A recent study found that the costs of such a treatment can range between $8 364 and $13 940 per patient. This means that one patient’s treatment is approximately a fourth of the cost of an annual MRSA screening for the staff of an entire hospital. As the spending associated with treatment will far out-weight that of screening, it is very important that efficient and low-cost screening methods be implemented in hospitals (Durai et al., 2010.)
There are only a few methods, which currently exit for MRSA screening. These are plating, liquid-broth inoculation, and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assays. While these will be discussed in further detail later on in the report, it is important to note that these methods could be costly and time consuming, and could sometimes present incorrect results (Durai et al., 2010.)
The International Genetically Engineered team at the university of Waterloo has been working on a method which will be used in supplement to the already-existing ones for the detection of MRSA infections. It is a proof of"

Intro: Today we designed the primer sequence for our codon optimized cage sequence from Yates' lab. I initially researched the iGEM specifics for the prefixes and suffix they require, so that we knew how to design primers for the sequence. Additionally, another set of primers with NdeI (prefix) and XhoI (suffix) sites will be designed for protein expression within the pET22b vector, since this plasmid was used by Dr. Yates.
We first spoke with Fasih to learn how to order gBlocks and to confirm our primer design methodology. This is what we learned:
1. select gBlocks gene fragments on the IDT (integrated DNA technologies) website
2. name the order
3. copy the gene from benchling into the sequence window
4. test the complexity to make sure its good to go
5. say no to all the questions asked by IDT
6. Notes: A. for payment, use oilgocard B. send to david attn. iGEM C. 1,000 ng is a good guaranteed yield
Remember to resuspend the gene at a concentration of 10 ng/microL.
Add a double stop codon.  Snap gene is a good place to look for plasmid sequences.

Amgen meetup (4th August 2017)
We also presented our iGEM project CascAID to the 8 students of the Amgen Scholars program. Amgen Scholars provides undergraduate students from different fields with the opportunity to engage in a hands-on research experience at some of the world's best institutions. In Europe, there are 5 hosts institutions who conduct the Amgen Scholars Program namely, ETH Zurich, Pasteur Institute, Karolinska Institute, LMU Munich, and the University of Cambridge.
The students who were part of the Amgen Scholars program at LMU Munich were invited to a special presentation with us. We answered their queries and gave them more information on synthetic biology and iGEM. Most of them were unaware of both and it was a great pleasure for us to be able to give them some insights into the iGEM world. Many were also highly motivated to hear that iGEM provides such a big platform for students interested in synthetic biology.
Marienplatz public interaction (3rd September 2017):
We believe that the best way of making people aware of synthetic biology and its future perspective is public interaction. Most ethical issues can be overcome by informing the public about the subject. For that sake, we went to the center of Munich, Marienplatz which is famous not only for the locals but also it is a hub for tourists from all over the world. We took our team members along with our camera and survey sheets to ask the public about their view on synthetic biology and modified organisms. We also explained them about our project design and asked them if they would be interested if we had such a device in the market. The people seem to be very excited about it and were willing to buy such simple lab-on-a-chip devices if they become available in the future. You can read the results of the survey here.

From figure 6 above, it can be suggested that anti sigma11 can function to inhibit the activity of sigma11 as the fluorescence output from the sigma 11 promoter was significantly reduced in presence of anti11. Nevertheless, the anti sigma11 is not strong enough to function as a “switch” that can turn the promoter back to the state when there is no ECF sigma11 present.

The way to make a 100-stage cycle
In our project, sigma factors, promoters and anti-sigma factors all need three independent types to design a three-stage genetic cycle. So, if we want to create a 100-stage cycle, should we use 100 sets of transcriptional regulation components? The answer is NO.
Let's think about the creation of a 15-stage cycle which is much easier. You don't have to prepare 15 types of sigma factors to design this cycle; you need only nearly half －only 8 types! First of all, besides the three-stage cycle, you have to create a five-stage cycle with transcriptional regulation components which are not used in a three-stage cycle. By transferring these two cycles into E. coli at the same period, E. coli will obtain 15 different expression patterns. Furthermore, by constructing AND circuit that receives two transcription factors expressed in the last generation of each cycle as input, you can control what genes would be expressed in the 15th generation. In the same way, you can control genes that would be expressed in any other generations.

Concentrations of LacI mRNA, protein, dimer and tetramer versus time are plotted in Figure 4. Since dissociation constant (Kd) of LacI-LacI monomer interaction (77nM) is mush larger than that of LacI dimer-dimer interaction (0.1pM), steady-state concentrations of LacI mRNA and protein are in different scales with that of LacI dimer and tetramer. Due to very large Kd of LacI dimer-dimer interaction, LacI protein would finally exist in form of tetramer in the system (concentration of LacI dimer is several orders of magnitude lower than the scale of the left Y axis and thus be ignored).
Figure 5 shows dynamic behaviors of plasmids in our model. Since only one copy of plasmid DNA0 was transformed, its quantity increases at the very beginning and decrease soon because all DNA0 will bind with LacI tetramer and no free plasmid exists. The process will end in one hour and quantities of both DNA0 and DNA1 enter into a stable level. It is worth mentioning that the stable concentration of DNA1 is about 380 nM, a little lower than its maximum concentration 475 nM. It is owing to reproduction of E.coli cells. After quantities of E.coli cell go into its stable stage, its concentration will continue to increase until the maximum setup value.
This basic example proves great success for iGAME to automatically model genetic regulatory systems. It shows real biological process in a qualitative manner and give suggestions for users to adjust their experiment plans.

Each protein when expressed will be equipped with the LT, enabling Sortase mediated conjugation/immobilization of the proteins to the spider silk naturally occurring C-terminal glycine.
During our iGEM project, we successfully isolated Sortase A from the S. aureus genome and employed two cloning strategies to achieve the fusion with GB1. Unfortunately, the problematic assembly meant that we were unable to assemble the full expression construct or conduct functional testing.
The Sortase Package
Sortase has been identified as an enzyme with a broad range of applications that can be extrapolated to the usage of the enzyme in future iGEM project serving as a potential standard BioBrick used within the iGEM Community.
We thus aimed to generalize our Sortase strategy further, to develop a system in which future iGEM teams can easily utilize Sortase to conjugate/immobilize any type of fusion partners of interest. For more information please see the Part Collection page.

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," it was difficult to monitor the concentration of the copper ions in solution in real-time. Using a biosensor seems to be a good solution to this problem.
This idea was inspired by the naturally-occurring metal-ion-induced promoters. Ligating this kind of promoters with a reporter gene such as RFP is a common idea to visibly monitor the concentration of metal ions. Take copper as an example: after browsing through parts, we found copper-ion-induced promoters in both E.coli and S.cerevisiae. Actually, the ability of E.coli and S.cerevisiae to tolerate copper ions differs from each other. E.coli's maximum tolerance level to copper ions is 1 mM, which is much less than that of S.cerevisiae's (over 15mM in YPD medium and 6.25 mM in SC medium). Considering the response range, the budding yeast is a much better host for copper detection.
We built a biosensor based on the CUP1 promoter and yEmRFP to monitor the concentration of copper ions. The response range of this biosensor was characterized by a fluorescent spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-2700). To improve the sensitivity of the biosensor and enlarge the response intensity when it is induced, we used error-prone PCR to obtain lots of promoter mutants and then characterized them.
CONSTRUCTION
The biosensor consists of two main parts. One is the Cu-induced promoter CUP1p, the other is yEmRFP, which is modified from a mCherry mRFP to adapt to the transcription environment in yeast. The promoter was synthesized without RFC sites (XbaI) and the RFP was amplified by PCR. We used overlap PCR to combine the two parts and added two restriction sites on the ends. By digestion and ligation, we constructed this biosensor on the plasmid pRS416 which contains a selective marker URA3. After that, we sequenced this part with M13F and M13R as primers. The sequencing result showed that this construction was successful, so we can take the next step – characterization.

The prodrug is administrated into the systemic circulation and induces cell death in the cells that have previously been transfected with Herpes Simplex Virus Thymidine Kinase. The HSV-Thymidine Kinase phosphorylates Ganciclovir from Ganciclovir-monophosphate into Ganciclovir-diphosphate, and from the latter to Ganciclovir-triphosphate. The Ganciclovir-triphosphate is incorporated into the DNA, inhibiting the DNA synthesis and causing cell death. We made a pharmacokinetics model of the killing mechanism to illustrate the elimination of our bacteria from the human body.

Macquarie_Australia,2016,Team:Macquarie Australia#NoteNPS_-_-_TEXT.html,", using PCR. There were good amplifications for a number of them, but the theoretical product sizes do not match up. The product sizes needed to be checked again.
Fig 6.Results of the operon MZHWK’s protein expression under IPTG induction. When compared to the protein standard a strong over induced band occurs between 25Kb and 37Kb. This is the correct size of the MZHWK protein complex when completely assembled. Although these samples underwent SDS and boiling for over 20mins and therefore should show a fraction of smaller bands. It can be clearly seen here that IPTG is not an effective way to overexpress MZHWK as the control in lane 3 has a similar sized band from due to background induction.
Now that we have most of our operons together and separate, we decided to try and expressed them individually via IPTG induction (can be found under our protocols tab) as our operons all have lac promoters by design.
We began protein work and this involved expressing the operons MZHWK, OPQR, ELJ and TB separately. From the results only MZHWK was conclusively overexpressed from the normally expressed proteins. These MZHWK bands were then cut out for Mass Spec (MS) analysis.
Due to this, alternate methods of expression must be used like Auto induction.
We continued to digest the cut out bands with trypsin, left for overnight digestion and these then went to our Australian Proteome Analysis Facility (APAF) for MS.
MZHWK protein expression yields an interesting looking band that is roughly at the combined size of the 5 proteins. This ""complex"" does not break down with additional SDS, and is very mass spec unfriendly; too hydrophobic throughout, lack of good peptides. Next attempt, is to show that it enriches in a ""membrane"" fraction as comparison, and if so, show chlorophyll binding. Note: no good mass spec results could be obtained from this protein complex.
Another attempt to ligate CA+D in a Kan backbone was made and this resulted in several cultures being produced. These were then digest checked and 3 samples were chosen DCA10, DCA11 and DCA12.
Ligation of MOET (MZHWK-OPQR-ELT-TB) was attempted, digest checked (GEL) – the results showed that the MOET bands form a E/P digest were smaller than should be (5,500bp smaller) and weren’t sent for sequencing for obvious reasons.

BioBrick Model
Attempted to go though our proposed designs. However there was a lack of clarity on how and where the biobricks fitted into the system. As a new action point, it was suggested that we place on the wiki a clear description and diagram showing all of the components of the project linked up in the correct way.
Modelling Questions
Question: In the metal intake model, should we consider the manganese ions (cadmium sneaks through the membranes of Bacillus subtilis through the manganese transport system)? Answer: Yes - Mn should be considered in the model eventually. For now, we need to concentrate on cadmium alone.
Question: What about the invertable sequence for the second stochastic switch? Answer: Look to see whether part is in repository. If it can be found there, use the part and characterise it/make it better.
Labwork
So far in labs, the team has made competent cells. Attempts to transform these E.coli with plasmids containing the ampicillin resistance gene will be made tomorrow. There will also be 'controls' carried out including media with/without ampicillin. One half of the team will take part in these transformations; the other half will do transformations of Monday but with BioBricks sent to us from iGem.
In the meantime, the advisors have asked the team to research the parts repository for a plasmid backbone to use for the project.
MatLab
In the meeting, the issues surrounding MatLab were discussed. Apparently, we need the Syn Biology toolbox. Jen says she has not yet done it but will be able to do it soon.
Sequentia Tutorial
Neil would be able to give us a tutorial except the key server on which Sequentia works is currently not working. However, Neil has advised that we download the PC trail version of Sequentia onto our computers and learn through the tutorials online.

We had no idea about how hard it will actually be to get a living organism to produce foreign toxic proteins, without mutating or killing itself. In theory we often got the impression that in science “everything is possible, there are no limits” but in real-life it is still living organisms that we are working with.
Above all, we got a better insight of real-life research with all its chances and challenges.

Uppsala,2016,Team:Uppsala#Project#UnaG_-_-_TEXT.html," the BioBrick without the flexible linker also exists.
IDT sequenced the entire pUCIDT-Amp vector including the ordered insert as part of their quality control workflow, so their results were used as a reference when doing modification to the plasmid. The IDT plasmid contains the lac-promoter so it is possible to do test expression directly with IPTG. However due to the way the final product is created, the UnaG sequence had a 50% chance to be incorporated in reverse, which was the case. Therefore suites of different BioBrick promoters were extracted from the 2016 distribution to test for expression. Those include a medium constitutive promoter (BBa_K608006), a strong constitutive promoter (BBa_K880005), IPTG inducible promoter (BBa_J04500), and a T7 promoter (BBa_K525998). All of those contain an RBS already assembled in order to speed up work. The UnaG sequence itself was excised from the IDT plasmid using EcoRI and PstI and ligated into pSB1C3 backbone cut with the same set of enzymes.
After successfully obtaining UnaG assembled with a variety of promoters, mutagenesis was performed in order to create several variants of the BioBrick for future use. The “stock” option contains the UnaG coding sequence. Upstream of it lies a 6xHis affinity tag, separated by an additional Serine amino acid to increase flexibility between the tag and the protein. In the registry it is annotated as BBa_K2003010. Note that this part is designed with RFC25 (Freiburg Standard) prefix and suffix in mind, hence it contains additional restriction sites, that do not affect normal 3A assembly but enable in-frame protein fusion without creating stop codons. Downstream of the part lies a short Glycine-rich flexible linker to minimize the effects of possible protein fusion. However the base part still contains the double TAA codons before this flexible linker. The stop signal has been removed with PCR in BBa_K2003011. This is part retains all the features, including the RFC25 prefix and suffix, but now the flexible linker is properly expressed and in case of fusing to another CDS would not cause premature termination.
Finally, to avoid potential interference from the 6xHistidine affinity tag, BBa_K2003012 was created based on BBa_K2003011. In this part, the six amino acids were removed (again through PCR), as well as the Serine linker in between. This"

According to Jeffrey M. Brake et al, we found that the change of long chain phospholipid                         molecular arrangement induced the change of liquid crystal arrangement when the copper net with                         liquid crystal was covered by phospholipid molecules. According to the commonly used inducers of                         liquid crystal molecules, such as DMOAP, polyimide and other molecules, they are long chain                         structures. Therefore, we speculate that long chain molecules may affect the alignment of liquid                         crystal molecules. Therefore, we designed to increase the sensitivity of liquid crystal                         detection by modifying long chain molecules on ordinary nano-antibodies.

Based on the above principles and designs, we can construct a liquid crystal biosensor. Using a                         competitive immunoassay, we can induce the vertical homogeneous orientation of liquid crystal                         molecules by modifying self-assembled monolayers on the glass substrate to observe the changes                         of color and brightness of the liquid crystal film before and after the binding of β2-MG                         nano-antibodies to β2-MG, and design the liquid crystal through modeling. A non-labeled, highly                         sensitive and specific liquid crystal detector for β2-MG was constructed based on the                         relationship between the color and brightness of the membrane and the concentration of                         β2-MG.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,", in the    section “DNA Sequencing Costs: Data. [10] The following graph contains the data of    the costs of DNA Sequencing up to October 2015.
Cost per Megabase of DNA Sequence
The graph above shows how the cost for the sequencing of DNA has    plummeted since the beginning of the 21st century; this is mainly given by    the introduction of high-throughput techniques.    By October 2015, according to the data provided by    the National Human Genome Research Institute, the cost for    Megabase base of DNA sequencing was $0.0145. By this year    2016, the cost of the DNA sequencing is expecting to be further    reduced. However, until now, not official data has been released.
According to Moore’s Law, that states that the number of    transistors in a dense integrated circuit and its computational power    doubles approximately every two years, the cost per Megabase at 2015    was expected to be around $50; however, the computational equipment    associated with the DNA sequencing has growing exponentially decreasing    even further the price, besides the new techniques that allows a faster    and more precise analysis.
With all this information, our hypothetical scenario seems to be    possible in just a couple of years, in which novel upcoming techniques    are available on the market.
However, CryptoGErM is not only a system for the storing    of information, our system goes beyond that; rather than just storing    encrypted information, our system can be used for physical sending.
And if the system is in the wrong hands?
What would happen if the system would end up in the hands of a criminal? Which impact would it have?
To give an answer to this question, we propose a computational    simulation to model the behaviors of some of the agents that could use    the CryptoGErM system, within these agents, a potential criminal was    included. Please consult the AI Agent Model in The Modelling Section for further information and discussion

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," no danger of the bacteria leaving the hydroponic facility or being ingested by any consumer. Second, all produce is processed and sanitized before being sold at market and/or eaten. Any bacteria residing on the vegetables would be washed off or killed.  Both of these factors provide little chance for the bacteria to ever enter or harm consumers of these hydroponic crops. The risk of foodborne illness is not significantly higher compared to conventionally grown crops.
Though there is no theoretical danger to adding our E. coli, we have not addressed all risks. We do not know how the oxidative state of the growth solution will affect the nutritional value and chemical composition of produce. It is also possible that the bacteria could cause the aeration system of a hydroponic setup to clog and/or fail. We plan on further testing these unknowns.
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
OxyPonics improves the practice of hydroponics, and hence it carries with it environmental impact that hydroponic farming has overall. Hydroponic farming has greater water efficiency and can be a solution for food production with limited supply of freshwater, especially in drier regions. Furthermore, since hydroponic setups are enclosed systems that can be situated nearly anywhere, it avoids the negative impacts associated with conventional farming , including a large land requirement, soil degradation and erosion, and runoff of pesticides and nutrients [9].
In some cases, hydroponic farming has been shown to require greater energy input than traditional farming [9]. However, it is largely still considered beneficial since areas that use hydroponics to reduce water usage typically have large amounts of renewable energy available. Furthermore, as our system is dependent on bacterial fluorescence, there is minimal energy input to OxyPonics. This will lower the energy needs of hydroponic systems, increasing their sustainability.
Another concern shared by many about hydroponics is that the nutrient solution in the water can cause environmental harm during disposal [10]. OxyPonics tackles this issue as well. With accurate, precise, and real-time monitoring, OxyPonics can ensure that the water quality of the hydroponic system is high enough that even upon disposal, there is no adverse impact on the environment. Moreover, we can reduce waste because better monitoring allows nutrient solutions to be utilized longer, meaning that there is a decreased need for growers to throw out and replace their nutrient solution.
As mentioned in the Safety & Risk section, the E. coli we utilize will be contained within dialysis tubing. They will be handled with care, and all produce leaving the system will be sanitized. The E. coli hence will not"

-“I brought doughnuts!” exclaimed Andrea as she walked in the door in the morning. The group had planned a Skype meeting with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army. After getting the connection set up, the students were able to have a myriad of conversations from topics regarding to giant Jamboree to technical components of the wiki. After some casual conversion, the students were able to have a better understanding of the happenings at the Jamboree and how to improve the wiki as well as Interlab components.
Sense/Respond: Next, the long part of the Interlab began. The students tested for absorbance and fluorescence of the bacteria samples over 0,2,4, and 6 hours. Later in the afternoon, the students did a dry run of their presentation in preparation for Monday.
Packaging: The entire iGEM team participated in a video conference with the Army and Navy iGEM teams in order to discuss similarities and issues with managing military teams. Afterwards at the lab, the RX team transformed the ligation into NEB 5-alpha competent cells and left the cells to grow in an incubator over the weekend.

Sense/Respond: The student sat around nervously waiting for their presentation to begin. In a few minutes they would be presenting to the whole lab about their project and goals. The students gave a phenomenal presentation that received much praise and applause. They were relieved to be done and went back to work on the wiki. Everything in the lab is up to date so the young researchers dedicated the rest of the day for wiki organization and miscellaneous tasks.

We will discuss first how to set the goals of a workshop, then the general set-up, followed by the materials and people needed and finally do some suggestions on documenting the event. In each case, we will first present the general principles we followed, and then give an example based on our experience duirng the iGEM EurAsian meetup in a dropdown.
1. Set your goals
Setting up the workshop starts with asking yourself some questions:
What is the goal of the workshop?
What is your starting position?
What is the end position you want to reach?
What are the conditions/factors/variables to account for that will effect getting to the desired end position?
When answering these questions, make sure they connect to each other logically! Also make sure that the goal you are setting is realistic given your setting. If  you for example have a workshop time of one hour, it might be a bit much to ask people to come up with complete answers to questions they had not yet thought about.
Example: setting the goals of the iGEM EurAsian meetup bioethics workshop.
Goal
We aimed to increase the awareness of bioethics in the participants and to trigger reflection on the bioethical questions of their own projects.
Starting position
Participants from iGEM teams with ages between 15-28 and very different cultural backgrounds.
Ending position
Each participant has started to ask bioethical questions concerning their own project.
Conditions/factors/variables to account for that will effect getting to the desired end position:
a limited time of 90 minutes
a large number of attendees (120)
2. Make a set-up
When you have set your goals and determined the variables you need to take into account, you can start setting up the workshop itself. Decisions that need to be made are:
How many topic(s) do you want to cover?
What topic(s) are you going to discuss?
How are you going to introduce the topic(s)?
Do you want a plenary discussion, discussion in smaller groups, or a mixture?
Are you going to guide the discussions and if so, how? It is important to consider this question carefully. Having a moderator per discussion group can help deepening the level of the discussion, since this person can keep asking ‘why’ questions if the discussion stays superficial.
How long will each discussion round take?
Would you like participants to prepare something beforehand?
Example: setting up iGEM EurAsian meetup bioethics workshop.
Based on our considerations, we answered the questions in the following ways.

Mathias started researching if there existed a gene regulating the frequency of hyphal fusion in the fungi. This was based on findings from polymer science, which showed that vulcanized rubber showed increased strength if the network of rubber was more interconnected or more elastic if the rubber was less interconnected. This would be possible if we could find a homolog of a known gene that regulates hyphal fusion.

Synthlab Overview
23/7/2018
Experiment: First insertion of genes into a backbone
Competent cells were transformed using the transformation protocol . After the transformation, the cells were plated on LB amp plates (which in retrospect is the wrong kind of plates) and left overnight. The plates from Monday 23rd were not successful, as we used amp plates instead of cam plates. The protocol has been rewritten accordingly.
The leftover cells were plated on some new LB cam plates.
25/7/2018
Experiment:  Preparation of 2nd round of genes
The purpose of this experiment is to insert the DNA delivered from IDT into plasmids for progapagation and further use. The genes that are to be inserted are; pGpdA, pTrpC, pTrpC-GFP and ScGPa. This will be accomplished as per the Adapted assembly protocol .
26/7/2018
New Gene have arrived: CaMV 35S Terminator, TS1 holology region, Hygromycin B. These were digested following the adapted protocol .
The ligation results was transformed and plated on LB cam plates O/N.
27/7/2018
Experiment:  First insertion of genes into a backbone
The prepared O/N cultures were miniprepped (see miniprep protocol ) in order to have the purified plasmids.
Experiment:  Preparation of 2nd round of genes
The O/N plates produced 3 transformants and a correct positive control, but the 4 older digestions produced no colonies, which suggests that digestions was unsuccesful. Consequently, the digestions, ligation and transformation was redone.  The transformation used 35 µL competent cells instead of the 50 µL the protocol requires. The liquid media was scaled down acordingly.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 Notebooks Chromoproteins_-_-_TEXT.html,". Unfortunately the specter readings were not successful because we need to do extracted protein instead of the cells straight fro culture
○
We also heated some of the cupidPink to the color change of purple to try and compare the two specter readings. Instead of taking 5 min at 75 °C to make it purple so we turned up the heat to 80 °C for 10 min until the color changed was observed
○
We then heated new aliquots of the same Cupid Pink cultures and heated them for 15 minutes at 75 °C and observed the color change we expected. This makes it seem like we might be able to detect color change if we treat with heat for a long time.
●
We then decided to do more heat testing with CupidPink because we wanted to see if we left the chromoprotein in the thermal cycler longer than 5 minutes but at a lower temperature if the same color change from pink to purple would occur.
○
We saw that after an hour at a lower temperature the chromoproteins did not reach as much of a purple color as at a higher temperature for less time but it did reach a more purple color than the original CupidPink
CupidPink Color Test
CupidPink chromoproteins that had been sitting for longer at a lower temperature did not fully change color like the ones that sat at a higher temperature for less time

Ran colony PCR from the plates with Gibson product on them and picked same colony that we picked from for the culture yesterday
●
Mini prep of the cultures started from the Gibson product yesterday
●
Ran colony PCR on the gel to see if the transformation was successful

Created NASA sticker using the AE blue fusion protein to coat a cellulose sheet as the blue background of the NASA sticker and added the lettering and red swoosh with stickers.
NASA Sticker
Here is a picture of the sticker we created with our AE Blue fusion protein. The blue background was created with a cellulose sheet and pipetting the AE blue protein onto it
●
We placed our sticker onto a beaker and poured boiling water into it. The water changed the sticker color from blue to purple and then we poured out the hot water and poured cold ice water in instead and the color changed back to blue. This sticker prototype shows a reversible color change in the presence of heat. Videos of this process are uploaded in the googleDrive

The gel we ran of the colony PCR ran off the end so we re made and re ran a"
