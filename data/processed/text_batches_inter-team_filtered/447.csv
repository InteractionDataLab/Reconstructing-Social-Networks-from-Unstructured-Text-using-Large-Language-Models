Noted that the concentration peak level of (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 are nearly more than twice the max concentration of (lacI)4, this may attribute to the difference of binding tendency between (CIlam)2, (tetR)2 and (lacI)4. The internal binding strength of (tetR)2 dimer and (CIlam)2 dimer are stronger than that of (lacI)4 tetramer. more details

Enzyme kinetics are used to further understand reaction parameters of the enzyme. Enzyme kinetics are largely based on the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model that allows us to calculate Vmax (The maximum rate of reaction) and Km (Michaelis Constant: the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is at half-maximum).
Where [S]=Substrate concentration and V=Rate of Reaction
The lineweaver burke plot is a double reciprocal plot of 1/[S] against 1/[V] that allows 1/Vmax and -1/Km to be understood via y and x intercepts respectively. We used our data for the decolorisation via enzyme BsDyp (see data page) to create a lineweaver burke plot and hence infer the values of Vmax and Km.
From this we can infer that Vmax=0.0305 mg/mol per hour (4 d.p.) and Km=0.0034 mg/mol (4 d.p.)

Surveys

Notebook
Survey Our team has written and sent out two online surveys (one written for high school students, another written for non high school students). The purpose of this study is to better understand the level of knowledge the participants have about the emerging field of synthetic biology, what they feel the future of synthetic biology holds, what implications of advances in synthetic biology may be and what the framework of governance for synthetic biology should be.  To start somewhere, we sent the link to our survey to 130 different people who were asked to send the link through their networks. It was hoped that we would reach in this way diverse people who are linked to government agencies, industries, Universities, NGO’s and are from the general public.  By doing so, we have received a broad spectrum of responses rich in diversity and perspectives. We also sent out a link specific for iGEM participants in the hope that we can showcase what the thoughts of iGEM participants are  The survey for high-school participants takes in account their level of knowledge and background in biology, technology, ethics and society. The high school survey contains more examples of current products and applications of synthetic biology at present. However, in doing so, we put much attention in making sure that the examples do not bias the understanding and thus the answers to our survey.   As of July 31, 2008 we received 206 responses for the non-high school survey and 49 responses for the high school survey. We are also anticipating survey responses from participants of the iGEM 2008 (as of July 31, 2008 we have 30 responses).
Presentations As an extension to our survey, our team also met with a group of high school students after they took our survey to provide answers to any further questions they had regarding our project, survey or the synthetic biology field itself. We also had a PowerPoint presentation that gave them a thorough understanding of the field and encouraged a debate on its implications.
Collaboration Our team is also collaborating with the Guelph iGEM team 2008 by assisting them in writing a feasibility studies on their project where we cover the E3LS issues and we provide also E3LS feedback to the wetlab team from Calgary.

Precipitator fused with GST tag
The Precipitator was fused with the C-terminus of our GST tag in order to extract and further test the construct for its Nickel binding affinity. We successfully cloned it together using the Gibson Assembly and then subsequently pasted it into the iGEM vector. The submitted sequence was partially confirmed by sequencing.
BBa_K608408 GST-tag
The GST-tag was PCR amplified from a pGEX vector with overhang primers including the iGEM restriction sites and then pasted into the iGEM vector. To verify the functionality of the construct we cloned it before a GFP sequence and expressed it with an IPTG inducible vector. Results see partsregistry page. The submitted sequence was partially confirmed by sequencing.
Results
The non-purified, sonificated supernatant of a 50ml E.coli culture pellet was resuspended in 7.5ml PBS. This sample delivered 319,4 µg/µl of protein detected with a Bradford assay. A second identical sample was GST-purified with a Glutathion-Sepharose pull down assay and resulted in 1ml of sample with a  protein concentration of 1,6 µg/µl.  However both concentrations were a little above the straight calibration line values. Therefore the results are not perfectly quantified, but the numbers are still significant enough to provide a good proof of the functionality of the assay.
Then the GFP fluorescence of 100µl of supernatant of both samples was measured with a plate reader:
Non-purified: 180630
GST-purified:  243011

UCL,2014,Team:UCLA#Project#Functionalizing Fibers_-_-_TEXT.html," page).  We have also designed, ordered, and assembled functional silk sequences.  These sequences include the N terminus-sfGFP-C terminus fusion, as well as a sfGFP-MaSp 2 fusion (see above).  We synthesized the N terminus-sfGFP-C terminus fusion as a gBlock from IDT.  We designed the sequence so that the GFP in between the N and C termini could be swapped out for other functional proteins using Assembly Standard 23.  This is possible because the GFP is flanked by Bsa1 restriction sites that generate overhangs that are complementary with EcoR1 and Spe1.   We are assembling the sfGFP-MaSp2 fusion by introducing an extra two nucleotides the the end of the registry sfGFP coding sequence to keep the sequence in frame, and then using standard assembly to fuse the two sequences.    We are ready to clone both of these sequences, and will ligate them into the shipping backbone very soon.  The next step will be to express these proteins, purify them, and and then co spin them with the processed Bombyx mori silk.

Cooperation with team Uchile
Both our team and team Uchile are trying to make use of aptamer to simplify the detection process. Thus we get in touch with each other to discuss our common problems and give feedback to each other.
Team Uchile
Team Hong_Kong CUHK’s feedback for team Uchile:
Maybe in the presentation you could give more details on why you choose to detect this toxin instead of other toxin?
For the project, have you compared your accuracy with the current widely-used method?
In the results part, could you put some labels on the rows and columns on your results page because we are a little confused about what is inside the samples.
For the hardware part, we are still quite unclear about the design of your hardware, would you mind offering some further details on that?
Team Uchile’s feedback for team Hong_Kong-CUHK
biosecurity: Will tracer  be reusable? is it possible that with the misuse of the hardware, contamination can be generated?  How will you proceed in case the hardware is discarded?
Answer: Tracer is reusable and contamination will not be generated if people follow the user guide.Tracer is intended for the general public,  if people are diagnosed with influenza, then we will suggest the user to give Tracer to the local hospital/clinic to disinfect before it is reused.
In the results part, could you put some labels on the rows and columns on your results page because we are a little confused about what is inside the samples.
Answer: The refractive index of PLA is as low as 3%, which can prevent the diagnostics results from the influence of the outside environment. Moreover, with a melting point of around 160 °C, PLA provides great heat stability. Also, PLA is an environmentally-friendly material as it is biodegradable.

Module 4: Stop-Star Codon “TGATG”
We did some experiments to detect the ratio in SAM.
Fig.19  Plasmids constructed for testing TGATG efficiency.
Four plasmids were constructed on the backbone named pUC-yder. “Control-1” only expresses GFP, as well as “Control 3”. “Control 2” shows the result of GFP expression overlap with m-cherry. “Experiment” shows the ratio between GFP expression and m-cherry expression. After transfected into E.coli stbl3, we confirmed the plasmid with DNA sequencing. Also we activated the wild type and used IPTG to induce the expression of all target genes.
The detect process was done with FCM(flow cytometry).
In experimental group, we set X-axis as FSC and Y-axis as SSC to circle the living bacteria which is in green, yellow and red color. After that, we changed the X-axis as FITC-A(represent for green fluorescent intensity)and Y-axis as Histogram(represent for bacteria density), then selecting the highest single peak around X-axis coordinate 103. We recorded the number of bacteria in this green fluorescence peak (named Group 1). Then we changed X-axis to mCherry-A (represent for pink fluorescent intensity) and used similar method to record the number of bacteria with pink fluorescence in Group 1 (named Group 2). An average of 20% of the bacteria in Group 1 were included in Group 2. The geometric mean of fluorescence of mCherry and GFP also be recorded.
In control group 1 and 3, almost the same method is used to find the wanted statistics. We didn't need to change X-axis after selecting the Group 1, neither do we need to record the number of bacteria.
In control group 2, we firstly processed the living bacteria and then we set X-axis as FITC-A and Y-axis as mCherry, using Quad to split the whole space into 4 parts. Q3 is the part without any fluorescence, Q1 and Q4 is the place in which bacteria can only express single kind of fluorescence. Q2 is representing for bacteria express two kinds of fluorescence and"

After we did co-culture with CaCo-2 cells, we didn’t observe any clumps around cancer cells, they were freely located but we observed illumination of GFP. We concluded from the results that because there wasn’t any ribosome binding site between GFP and FimH proteins, they fused together which resulted only FimH protein to be affected from this fusion and become unfunctional.

Our monthly cash flow helps us track our expenses along with a running balance of available funds.  The cash position at the end of each month is carried over to the beginning of the next month and any income or expenses are added or deducted respectively.
Please click on the Quarterly Income Statement to view a larger size.
The quarterly income statement helps us track our expenditures and income throughout the year.  From this sheet we are able to determine our given spending patterns and when in our development we will need required investment.  Additionally it can tell us how to strategically align grant and funding programs and where we can appropriately place government assistance programs such as the Industry Research Assistance Program (IRAP).  As we move forward we can input our monthly cash flow and income statements to compare with our projects.  This can be used to help ensure future projections are on par with expectation based on past experience.   We are planning on using a staged investment strategy where continued investment is based on the team achieving previously set milestones with the investor.  These projections have outlined a breakeven point in our third year following commercialization.

UiOslo_Norway,2016,Team:UiOslo Norway#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," a high level of security. To investigate this, we brainstormed around the issue, and reached out to Gissle Hannemyr, an expert in software security at the University of Oslo. This is something that in general has been of great importance to us; to utilize the potential and the potent expertise that resides in the institution that we are lucky enough to be a part of.
However, he did not respond immediately, and this ended up being something that we kept in mind, and would have moved forward with if we were to continue with the project.
Detection limits:
The first thing we did in respect to clinically relevant detection limits, was to contact experts to find out the bacterial number one can expect in urinary tract infections. The numbers that returned (averaging around 10^5/10^6 bacteria/mL) did not correlate with the detection limits we saw in our initial experiments with nitrocefin.
Thus, we proceeded to better our set-up. To do so, we investigated different factors that could improve the detection limit. In the end, by using a high concentration of nitrocefin and lysing the bacteria, we achieved a detection limit of clinical significance.
Testing our set-up with ESBL-producing bacteria:
This was important to us; as a proof of concept, we formed our set-up using “regular” AmpR bacteria. But, eventually, we wanted to move on to the big bads; clinical isolates of ESBL-producing bacteria. To do this, several things had to be done. First of all, we had to get our hands on both the bacteria themselves and information about them. This was achieved largely through corresponding with Ørjan Samuelsen at the Norwegian Center of Competence on Antibiotic Resistance in Tromsø. Second, ESBL-producing bacteria classify as bio-safety level 2, meaning that we had to thoroughly think through and plan whatever we wanted to do with them. This was done by conferring with the experienced people working in our lab, walking them through our set-up and having them supervise us when we were handling the bacteria.
We did in the end attempt a run of our set-up with clinical isolates. This was not entirely successful, but we learned a lot from the experience, and we feel certain that we would have achieved clear results from this if we had time to do it again. For more information about the strains that were used, the set-up and the results, see under the “Lab”-section.
Positive controls:
The first positive control that came to mind when designing our project, was to use bacteria with known resistance. Naturally, this"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#CFPS_-_-_TEXT.html," energy content are needed that fuel phosphorylation of ADP (for example via creatin phosphate, abbreviated CP) or that fuel glycolysis (for example phosphoenolpyruvate, abbreviated PEP). In general, the use of the high energetic CP in combination with creatin kinase gives the best results ( Shimizu and Ueda, 2010 ; Kazuta et al., 2014 ). However, CP and creatin kinase are very expensive compared to other reagents. In recent years many different energy sources have been established which give good results at less costs. You can find detailed information in reviews and particulary in these publications:
Kim and Swartz, 2001 ; Jewett and Swartz, 2004 ; Ma et al., 2010 ; Caschera and Noireaux, 2015a ; Cai et al., 2015
Medium
2xYTP and 2xYTPG medium are most frequently  employed for production of homemade E. coli cell extract ( Caschera and Noireaux, 2015a ; Kwon and Jewett, 2015 ). The phosphate buffer helps to maintain a stable pH during cultivation and cell harvest.
Transcription
Template
The use of DNA as template has some advantages over the use of an mRNA template. For example, one needs only small amounts of DNA compared to mRNA to obtain the same output signal as long as transcription is not limiting ( Rosenblum and Cooperman, 2014 ). Compared to mRNA, DNA, especially plasmid DNA, is more stable during the reaction ( Spirin and Swartz, 2008 ). The use of linear DNA as a template can support protein production if the PURE system is used ( Chizzolini et al., 2014 ). Higher amounts of DNA template result in higher amounts of mRNA produced, but this is only to a certain level advantageous for protein production ( Chizzolini et al., 2014 ).
To improve the synthesis of your protein of interest in E. coli cell extracts, the adjustment of the DNA-sequence takes less work but is of outstanding importance ( Spirin and Swartz, 2008 ). The resulting mRNA has to be highly expressible: RBS, distance and identity of the sequence between the RBS and the start codon, an 5'-upstream enhancer sequence and the first codons of the CDS greatly influence the ""expressibility"" of the mRNA ( Spirin and Swartz, 2008 ; Lentini et al., 2013 ; Karig et al., 2012 ; Tak"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," decided to take our collaboration one step further and a physical version of the Lithuanian “Spaceship E.Coli” comic book. We have hoped that the physical version of the comic would generate even more interest as many people agree that reading a paper version of a comic book is a much more exciting experience!
Therefore, we have prepared a printable version of our translated comic book and even managed to find the sponsors “Kopicentras” who would later print out the books for us and even gave us tips on how to prepare them correctly.
Finally, our Lithuanian physical comic book version of “Spaceship E. Coli” was completed. We have then proceeded to distribute them by giving them out in our educational events, after our various synthetic biology lectures in universities and schools, also in conferences and popular science events.
We truly believe that such comic book is what we have needed in order to grab the attention of young students in schools and universities. In turn, we are extremely happy OUC-China team have initiated the collaboration and the line of communication between China and Lithuania!
Participation in various surveys to help out fellow teams!

The serial dilution was performed four times, and the Abs600 was measured to create the following standard curves:
Finally, a fluorescence standard curve was created to have a point of comparison between outputs of different plate readers, getting rid of the arbitrary units assigned by different instruments. Fluorescein is used as an easier, lower-cost alternative to GFP as it has similar excitation and emission properties. Four identical serial dilutions were completed for fluorescein, and the Abs600 was measured to create the following standard curves:
CFU
This part of the Interlab found the volume of a 0.1 OD600 culture and the number of cells in a known volume by growing a sample and counting the number of colonies that grew. For the “Starting Sample Preparation,” the OD600 of diluted overnight cultures of positive and negative controls were taken along with that of blank media. Based on the starting sample, overnights were diluted in triplicate, and the OD600 was taken and adjusted using the blank, yielding the absorbance. To find the number of cells in a given volume, a serial dilution was performed for each sample, and the last three dilutions were plated and grown overnight. Colonies were counted, and, with the understanding that one cell grows into one colony, the number of cells per unit of volume was found. To standardize across dilutions, we used the equation:
number of colonies x final dilution factor = CFU/mL

Riboregulators
High basal expression from inactive inducible promoter (leakiness) is a common challenge in the implementation of robust biological control system. The problem is especially severe for systems that approximate digital Boolean logic or drive an amplified downstream response. In the first case an OFF state can be interpreted as ON resulting in incorrect computations. The second scenario leads to high levels of undesired final response. Many former iGEM teams have encountered unwanted basal expression of their genes of interest (goi) due to promoter leakiness ( ETH2013 , Groningen2012 , amongst others), resulting often in narrow optimal operation conditions for their biological devices. Since our system is based on Boolean Logic for its decisions and relies on downstream amplification to regenerate and propagate the signal as a first step we investigated strategies to improve tight gene control. Looking into the available literature we found riboregulators as a promising, highly generalizable approach to address the issue of leakiness [32] .  As a convenient proof of concept we coupled the system with quorum sensing modules characterized the response and made the resulting parts available for the iGEM community in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . We suggest that this approach can be generalized to improve many of the inducible system contained in the registry
The riboregulator systems include two parts: 1) a cis-repressed RBS in front of the goi, and 2) a co-expressed trans-activating RNA.
To characterize this system for reliable cell-to-cell communication, we combined the riboregulator part with promoters of the quorum-input-sensing systems used by our team ( LuxI/LuxR, LasI/LasR, and RhlI/RhlR ). In our final gene circuit , the riboregulators were intended for tight control of integrases . However, to have an easily quantifiable and proportional output, we initially used GFP as our riboregulated goi and measured the output fluorescence with a Tecan plate reader . This approach is described below in the figure 1.
Figure 2 Characterization of the riboregulator system. First, a defined amount of the incoming signal molecule 3OC6-HSL binds to LuxR. After dimerization, the complex binds to its corresponding promoter pLux. Both, the trans-activator(taR12y) and the cis-repressor (crR12y) together with superfolder"

Lysis of Cells, Testing the Protocol with Fractions 1-5
Observations: Purified Tamura still slightly cloudy and not completely transparent solution. The white cell debris pellets at bottom still contain specks of green and fluoresce when observed under UV light, indicating incomplete lysis and not all protein is extracted. This is likely because Tamura is suspended in very dilute lysis buffer, making it more difficult for reagents to react in a homogenous manner, especially since such small volumes and amounts of reagents are used. To troubleshoot, lysis protocol is repeated with remaining cell pellet from final centrifugation step.
Lysis Protocol
1. Add Lysozyme.
2. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
3. Add PMSF solution, and while swirling, slowly add Deoxycholic Acid in powder form.
4. Incubate at 37 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes.
5. Add DNAse.
6. Incubate on rocking incubator at room temperature for 30 minutes.
7. Centrifuge sample for 15 minutes at 3,000g at 4 degrees Celsius.
8. Collect supernatant and store at -20 degrees Celsius."

The facility will also be responsible for the full design, fabrication, assembly, and quality control of the detector system: All components of the system.
Manufacturing facilities will ship cartridge components to FREDsense Technologies for addition of biological components: lyophilized bacteria and dried electroactive compounds and buffer chemicals. As these components are required in extremely low volumes (for example 100μL of bacteria per cartridge), FREDsense Technologies will have the capacity to produce these in house. As we have significant experience in growing and lyophilizing bacteria, we will also be capable of producing these components efficiently.
Shipment of cartridges to FREDsense Technologies will occur on a per-contract or sale basis depending on demand (see selling activities for details).  Detectors and cartridges will be held at the FREDsense Technologies facility based on a percentage of sales from the previous three months and projections for sales in the future. This will allow for the fulfillment of small orders whereas large contracts or batch orders will take more time to distribute to the client as they will be made to order. FREDsense Technologies staff will be responsible for final assembly of the cartridges, quality control testing, packaging, and distribution for the first few years of production, until scale-up is needed.  Detector systems will ideally be directly distributed from the manufacturer, however, if this is not possible, FREDsense will distribute the detectors as well.  At this point, we will sub-contract to a distributor.
As capacity is reached, new manufacturing contracts will be established with larger partners and different manufacturing paradigms in order to maintain profitability and efficiency during company growth.
Assumptions - Long-term storage of the product is feasible as the bacteria and chemicals are in a lyophilized state.  Bioreactor grow-up for a batch order would take 24 hours based on preliminary technical findings for our organism.  We estimate that the amount of bacteria that we would potentially need for each cartridge is 0.1mL of 1x109 cells/mL, meaning that roughly a 10L bioreactor would account for over 100,000 cartridges.  These numbers were determined based on the concentrations of bacteria used in our lab-scale system. Lyophilization may take up to two days which means sales turn around times may be affected for small orders.  It may be of value to have a set of ready-made products that could be distributed next day.
Capacity - Starting capacity for operations will be set to accommodate the production of bulk numbers of cartridges in the hundreds (involving daily operations) with the intent of increasing this production to accommodate thousands of cartridges"

As a preliminary test, we observed increased Chalcopyrite precipitation with Caulobacter cells expressing a Chalcopyrite binding peptide in the S-layer. While non-quantitative, the data showed noticeable differences in precipitate settle when the peptide expressed in various locations in the S-layer. See the video below.
Your browser does not support the video tag.
Figure 7.Various peptides from Curtis et al. are displayed in different positions in the S-layer of Caulobacter cells. The cells were mixed with calcopyrite and precipitate settling was observed.
Biomining protein assays
In an attempt to support the above observation, we incubated Caulobacter cells with Chalcopyrite and separated the Chalcopyrite by centrifugation. The supernatant and cells adhered to Chalcopyrite (eluted after several buffer washes) were assayed for protein concentration as a read out for biomass. For fucose containing cells and cells expressing Chalcopyrite binding peptides in the S-layer, we expected protein concentration to decrease in the supernatant and increase on Chalcopyrite as compared to controls.

Eindhoven
The 2013 TU-Eindhoven iGEM team started their ""synthetic facts"" project . With this they want to bring the world of synthetic biology closer to everyone (scientist & non-scientist) in a correct manner. They provide facts that are thoroughly analysed by different teams and given a final statement noting that the fact is either true, false or undecided. We were happy to contribute some of our time to checking a fact and got this nice medal for it!
BeNe(Lux) – UGent & Groningen
In the beginning of July, the idea of organising a debate attracted us. After consulting multiple people (Professors, PhD students,…), we found out that everyone noticed the need for such a debate. Furthermore, they advised us to give the general academic public an introduction on synthetic biology and iGEM. The idea was therefore extended to a symposium followed by a debate. We invited all teams of the BeNe(Lux), from which the team of UGent and Groningen responded positively. After introductory seminars by Prof. J. Robben and Prof. K. Verstrepen, and our own project presentation, we were pleased to welcome the team of Groningen. After a five hour drive they still kept their enthusiasm for the Symposium. After some ‘Belgian’ fries we were ready for the debate. The end of the day was closed with a reception where the people could further debate.

PRESENTATIONS AT SCIENCE FESTIVALS
We made presentations for the wider public as well. Wanting to interact with youth interested in  science, we arranged to present ourselves and iGEM at science festivals.  We spend a day at a booth at ZOTKA's talents science festival. ZOTKS (Association for Technical  Culture of Slovenia) is a society that organizes a research competition for high school and elementary  school children every year. After submitting their research, the finalists are honored and given their  awards at ZOTKA's talents, where they also present their research. Other societies and people with  interesting research to show are invited as well, and the event attracts many visitors: finalists, other  competitors, their families, important researchers, members of Association for Technical Culture and  politicians. We were glad to be able to present our work and the whole field of synthetic biology to  many aspiring young scientists.
Presenting at science festivals
We decided to present our project to children as well, and were fortunate enough to be able to make  a presentation at another science festival aimed at younger children and their parents. Hiša  eksperimentov (The House of Experiments) is a museum trying to appeal science to kids. The  museum is full of fun experiments (giant bubbles, a bed of nails, dancing non-Newtonian fluid, visual  tricks etc.) that explain the basic concepts of natural sciences (such as surface tension, the  distribution of forces, electricity, friction…) to young children in an entertaining way. The museum  also has exciting curses, such as ''Eggology'', ''Bubblelogy'' and ''Ice creamology'' to interest children  in science. Every year the museum organizes Znanstival (Sciencetival), a festival of sciences for  families with children, where we presented iGEM and our project as well. We found this presentation  particularly challenging, as the children do not understand more"

[...] While we'd never claim to have solved world hunger at a stroke [...] biotechnology provides one means to feed the world effectively."" [16] The article also details that the Advertising Standards Agency concluded that Monsanto had ‘exaggerated its years of safety testing [and] [...] not made clear academic opinion on GM technology was divided.’
By providing a message that could be interpreted and reported in this way, this advertising approach has encouraged the view of naivety on the part of biotechnology companies to the actual role of their products, coupled with mistrust generated by their reportedly dubious ASA result. This report and similar fuel the perception that the primary purpose of GM is to line the pockets of the big companies through misleading the public and overstating its claim as the relief of a major world problem.
Our response
Efforts need to be made to avoid making sweeping claims and generalisations about synthetic biological technology and specific product benefits. Instead we need to provide accurate and informative statistics and explanations to substantiate claims.
We have environmental motivation for our product, which can be presented in the context of the wider problems of pollution and carbon emissions: it is designed to reduce nitrogen use and can be used on any scale. It is not intended to displace any other products directly, as there do not appear to be any chemical alternatives currently available.
As we are unsure about the size and construction of our hypothetical ‘company’, so claims cannot be made in reference to company size/monopolies.
Our researched target market is the UK arable farming community, and we must bear in mind that other countries and cultures have different media coverage, regulations and attitudes. We intend our product to reduce costs by saving fertiliser, rather than claiming subsequent gains, such as increasing profits or yield from the same amount of fertiliser. The safest approach is to remain with the basic claim of reducing excess nitrogen fertiliser use.
Mistrust fostered by the media
Scare stories – misreported research, unclear labelling of products and tenuous comparison with other health scares, amongst other things – have led to public mistrust of biotechnology, and GM in particular. In some cases the lack of scientific input into the stories is partially to blame, in others it is clear that more public information is needed. There are three examples that we will consider, although there are many more.
Firstly, scare stories that have been since discredited have still played a part in forming public opinion on a subject. As part of his crusade against ‘bad science’, Ben Goldacre in a 2007 Guardian article reinforced the point raised by"

Summary
Salt water is causing problems all over the world, leading to a loss of diversity in ecosystems and freshwater scarcity. A main reason for this pollution is industrial wastewater.
We tackled this problem by using salt accumulating microorganisms engineered through synthetic biology.
Our project is based on Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Read more about why we chose this organism in our Design section.
We engineered different ion transporters to increase the NaCl uptake into the prevacuolar compartments and the vacuole of S.cerevisiae.
We started by knocking out the native systems responsible for the extrusion of sodium to the extracellular room.
Additionally, we overexpressed the native sodium hydrogen antiporter Nhx1 that, together with the chloride channel Gef1, is responsible for the sequestration of NaCl in the       prevacuolar compartments.
As part of their salt tolerance mechanism plants like Arabidopsis thaliana are able to sequestrate ions in their vacuole. We used this system to increase the salt accumulation in S.cerevisiae.
We integrated an optimised variant of the Arabidopsis sodium hydrogen antiporter into the vacuolar membrane of S.cerevisiae, enabling salt sequestration in that compartment.
AtNHXS1 uses H
+
protons to transport sodium against its concentration gradient. By integrating the Arabidopsis pyrophosphatase AVP1 into the vacuolar membrane of yeast we       acidify the vacuole and thus increase the efficiency of transporters using such a proton gradient.
Following our Integrated Human Practices we expanded our project from NaCl to also accumulate other salts. For this reason we integrated Arabidopsis channels for the import of sulphate       (AtSultr1;2) and potassium (AtAKT1).
To get an idea of the efficiency of our designed system we modelled the kinetics and interactions between the tranporters.
We proved that S.cerevisiae does survive high salt concentrations and furthermore does not burst when the intracellular salt concentration is significantly higher than       the extracellular one.
We proved that our designed yeast accumulates more salt from the environment"

Week 2 (May 8 - May 12, 2017): Designing constructs and protocol for media
This week, we worked on researching protocol for media to be used for bacterial growth. Our mentors and advisers raised questions concerning the containment of the bacteria. This led our group to look into an antibiotic-free selection system; a number of methods for antibiotic-free selection were brought up. We also looked into the possibility of using Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) to deliver our inserts due to concern over the large size of the insert. Ultimately, we decided that, if time allows, we will consider pursuing the antibiotic-free selection method and BAC.  The lab training we participated in this week allowed us to practice protocols for performing transformations, preparing competent cells, and performing cPCR using template DNA from colonies on a streak plate. We also practiced agarose gel electrophoresis.
This week, the details of the plasmid design were discussed. We decided to use pET29b(+) as our vector because it has an inducible lacI and a T7 promoter. We also planned characterization experiments for PhaJC + FadE, and compare PhaCBA with the PhaCAB Biobrick from Tokyo 2012. We decided to code our parts on Benchling with the following template: junk-ENX (prefix)-RBS-cds-SNP (suffix)-kpn1 (restriction)-junk.  We finalized the three plasmid inserts with T7 promoters (phaC1P. aeruginosaJ4P. putida and phaCBAR. eutropha) and double-checked the spacer sequences using BLAST. We also decided to add 6x-His tags after methionine to help with characterization in the later stages of the experiment. Restriction sites were decided on for each part so that the whole final biobrick can be ligated together (3 pieces for beta-oxidation PHA sequence and "

Moreover, lysostaphin is able to lyse actively growing and non-dividing cells in biofilms rapidly, whereas most antibiotics works effectively only on actively dividing cells. Last but not least, lysostaphin has low toxic and cause nearly no side effect on human body. Therefore, we select it as our lytic enzyme against the biofilms of Streptococcus mutans.

Functional Measurement
For testing our circuit’s function, we designed a set of experiments.
Stage one— Test the Asr promoter
Asr promoter(with RBS)+RFP+Terminator
Transform the circuit to Escherichia coli, and grow the modified E. coli on agar plates overnight.
Steps:
Pick both red and non-red colonies, and grow the E.coli in separate liquid cultures.
Prepare 2 sets of 2 plates, one pH 4 and one pH 7. Spread the red strain liquid culture on one set of the ph4 and 7 plates, and repeat on the other set with the non-red strain.
Select the strain that expresses growth differences from the previous step. Prepare two of each liquid culture tubes for pH 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, and 7, and grow the selected strain in all tubes. Use the growth data from each tube to plot the precise effect of pH on asr promoter.
Measure the OD value (RFP/bacterium number).
Stage two— Test the signal protein yebF
(1) J23100+yebF(with RBS)+RFP+Terminator
(2) J23100+RFP+Terminator
Transform both circuits to Escherichia coli, and grow the modified E.coli liquid culture overnight.
Steps:
Adjust the two cultures to the approximate OD value.
Centrifuge the cultures and extract the supernatants.
If the YebF signal sequence does work, the E.coli supernatant containing first circuit should be red while the second circuit having normal culture color.
Stage three—Test the lysostaphin producer iGEM part BBa_K"

Overview
To better our project, we have done four bravo jobs as our human practice.
First, we shared the beauty of synthetic biologyour, a topic which we presented and promoted in front of our schoolmates and also to those in Taipei American School. Enthusiastically sharing our ideas, we met up with some of the iGEM teams in Taiwan and China, taking part in the conference and sharing knowledge.
Second, we cooperated with other team to combine different technique that would improve our project. We help NTU-Taida characterized their BioBrick devices, the ACE (BBa_K1157020) and CEA (BBa_K1157021).
Third, we determined to build up an easier way in doing experiments for those who are not that familiar with the basic experimental techniques. We have made some videos of doing experiments. They are the way we teach students how to conduct wet lab experiments.
Fourth, we tried to make our project a practical application to the environment. We had lots of interviews with experts concerned and beekeepers. More importantly, we have gone to bee farms and help the beekeepers to check if their bees were infected by Nosema ceranea. We also created primers to identified Nosema ceranea. This provides a fast and precise way to find out Nosema ceranea besides barely using microscope.
Our wish is to change the world in a tender way and make others soaked in the overwhelming astonishment of biological wonder.

Exeter,2017,Team:Exeter#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"ili expression with insertion of the operon alone.
Figure 14: ΔFimB should not, theoretically, produce pili. The regulatory gene FimB has been knocked out, and so the operon has effectively been switched off. These electron micrographs show wild type ΔFimB with strong, peritrichous flagellar expression, but no visible signs of pili. The image on the right shows little evidence of pili or flagella connected to the cell surface, which suggests that the negative staining technique can be damaging to these structures and could cause detachment and fragmentation.
Figure 15: We transformed a plasmid containing the fim operon under control of promoters P_J23100(left)  and P_Ara(right) into ΔFimB. Both exhibit flagella on their cell surface, but the right electron micrograph shows a suggestion of pili.
The electron micrograph images presented above suggest that under control of the arabinose inducible promoter, the fim operon is expressed and pili (albeit incomplete as they are lacking FimH) are formed on the cell surface. Further work is needed to fully characterise this, particularly in combination with out modified FimH constructs. We have successfully shown a suggestion of pili using the arabinose inducible promoter and no pili production using a constitutive promoter.

Cell Cycle
In addition to factoring extracellular conditions such as cell density and nutrient availability into the decision to sporulate, the intracellular environment is monitored as well. Damage to DNA and blocking of either the initiation or progression of DNA replication prevent the initiation of sporulation. These conditions lead to the expression of Sda (suppressor of dnaA) because of the presence of binding sites in the sda promoter region for the repressors DnaA and LexA, which no longer repress when DNA replication is blocked or DNA is damaged, respectively. Sda impairs KinA autophosphorylation, blocking the phosphorelay. As a result, a developmental checkpoint is established that only allows cells with undamaged, replicating chromosomes to proceed into development.[1]

Lethbridge,2011,Team:Lethbridge#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," Ag43 is an autotransporter that promotes bacterial cell-to-cell aggregation, which accelerates sedimentation rates19. The Peking 2010 iGEM team successfully characterized Ag43 in the E. coli chassis. We will take advantage of native E. coli surface polysaccharides’ clay-binding properties and use them in conjunction with Ag43 to efficiently settle clay particles more rapidly than the current conventional methods. The team will introduce Ag43 into E. coli and apply the bacteria to a clay solution. The bacteria will aggregate the clay and form sediment at the bottom of the container and the removal of clay will be observed by monitoring the optical density of the solution. This experimental parameter can be measured using spectrophotometric methods and changes in optical density over time of the solution will indicate the efficiency of the auto-aggregation system.
(4)    To prevent contamination of the environment with GMO’s DNA we will utilize natural methods of DNA degradation to degrade the genomic DNA of our chassis to ensure that our tailings pond clean up kit will not contaminate the environment with DNA. We will utilize the part characterized by the UC Berkeley 2007 iGEM team that degrades the genomic DNA of the organism. The gene, BamHI, codes for a restriction endonuclease that effectively degrades the genomic material of the cell when induced, while having no effect on the function of other proteins within the cell21. Thus, the expression of this gene will allow for the pathways we introduce to the E. coli chassis to remain functional while removing the risk of DNA contamination. By having the ability to destroy the chassis’ DNA on command, we gain tight control over regulating the engineered bacterial cells. We will be able to degrade the genomic DNA and create an inert organism unable to adversely affect the environment and ensure that all parts of the kit are free of GMO DNA. The viability of the chassis once the DNA has been degraded will be tested under different conditions to determine the best conditions for use.
Significance and Future Directions
Production of an environmentally safe tailings pond clean up kit, which contains methods applicable to large-scale treatment facilities, has multiple advantages. Use of the kit will both accelerate remediation of current tailings ponds in addition to providing methods of water treatment directly after industrial use. The kit will be an environmentally safe prototype that contains biological components for tailings ponds decontamination of (1) toxic organic molecules, (2) heavy metals, and (3) fine clay particles. Future work on the project will include extending the types of toxic organic molecules that it is capable of degrading to molecules that are metabolized by cells"

TUST-iGEM 2018 team members are committed to the establishment of a wide range of diverse parts library. We have constructed a detection and degradation system for tetracycline and data and phenomena demonstrate that they are valid.
We use the Gibson assembly method to build our parts. This way we were able to generate our required parts in a fast and efficient way. Therefore, all of the parts we used are composite. The different basic parts comprising the composite parts are documented seperately, although they do not exist induvidually.
In the case of a constitutive expression, the promoter is included in the biobrick itself. For the inducible expression, we made use of a plasmid backbone containing a Tet-promoter ，a Lac-promoter and the LacI gene, which encodes for the Lac repressor. And we improve both the function and characterization of the some part to better express in our constructive chasis.

CCiC
Conference of Central China iGEM Consortium
From September 2nd to 4th, Conference of Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC) was held in SYSU, Guangzhou. Four members of our team attended the conference. Our instructor, Zhang Haoqian gave the keynote speech to 26 iGEM teams from different cities of China at the opening ceremony of CCiC. With the help of this platform for Chinese iGEM teams to communicate, all the teams got numerous feedbacks from others, including suggestions on the of experiments, heated discussions on circuit design, and reflections on safety and application. Peking performed well during the presentation and poster section and provided many useful suggestions for other iGEM teams during communication. Also, we recognized the limitations and inadequacy of our project which motivated us to make more effort.

Tianjin,2015,Team:Tianjin#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"us could promote the production of some proteins in various cells, like E4GIcore-sJanus in T. reesei [2] and GFP-sJanus in Nicotiana benthamiana plants [3].
To purify the target protein, we would make the target protein and Janus into a fusion protein, which is connected with a linker. Then, we could use aqueous two-phase system to make them separated from the bulk protein, according to the property that Janus will direct to the phase of detergent in the system of detergent/water.After back-extraction, we could get the protein out from the detergent.
Figure 12. The principle of Janus-based aqueous two-phase system
In our project, we would use four kinds of Janus to find the best one. Meanwhile, we aim to design a standard protocol to make this system applicative to almost every kind of protein, and we call it Protein Extraction Kit.  
Firstly, we use the principle of RFC 23 to design a universal Janus tag, which includes a linker able to be cut by TEV protease and a sJanus gene. Thus, if other teams want to use this system to express and purify their proteins, they could use the standard assembly to make a fusion protein. Secondly, we explore for the best detergent, the best concentration of detergent and the best buffer solution. Thirdly, we construct many fusion proteins, including three kinds of fluorescent proteins (GFP, BFP and RFP) with four kinds of Janus, which are inJanus, sJanus and their respective mutants. We also construct experiments about fusion proteins with cutinases Thc_Cut1, FsC and LC to test if this system could be used on the putification of enzymes. Furthermore, we build complete models to testify that this system is applictive to all kinds of protein and search for the universally good conditions for almost every protein.
Figure 13. The principle of Protein Extraction Kit
Of course, we also conduct experiments to detect the efficiency of this method and make sure that the target proteins have not lost their activity.

From left to right: My name is Qiaochu Guo. I am a current student of Nanjing Foreign Languages School and will graduate in 2016. I have a broad range of academic interests, including biology, physics, chemistry and management. I am especially interested in the intersection of biology and physics, such as electronic and molecular devices for health care and other purposes. In my free time, I also enjoy debate, cooking, watching and reading sci-fi. I'm Yinuo Jin from Nanjing Foreign Language School. I'm seventeen years old and now ‎in Senior 3. I have some academic interests such as biology and history. In my excurricular time, I spend a lot of time reading biology books, watching related documentaries and going to laboratories to fulfill myself. Not only attending iGEM, I also took part in a research studying  taxonomy of arethusa. From these experiences, I found my academic passion and practiced my experimenting skills and I'm willing to continue studying biology in university. I’m Chen Xin, a senior two student from Nanjing Foreign language school.  Biology is the one of the school subjects I like most. I am often impressed by the organisms in which the working mechanism is precise and innovative. I spent a great amount of time reading those bulky books required for basic knowledge of biology. Though others may regard reading thick books as a dull way to learn, I find it rather interesting because it’s able to present me with a whole picture of the subject and then reveal specific details one by one. After mastering the knowledge needed, I was then able to figure out my own idea and then put it to practice. My name is Xinran Han, a senior student in Nanjing Foreign Language School. Studying Biology for almost five years, I’ve developed a fascination in this field, as well as other relevant disciplines such as neuroscience. Apart from Biology, I also love physics, during whose courses I discovered my interest and passion to work in labs. In my leisure time, I like to study"
LMU-Munich,2014,Team:LMU-Munich#Project#Bakillus_-_-_TEXT.html,"Killus “suicide switch“ since it has been shown that the toxin also kills a variety of Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA-strains. [2 ]
So how does the suicide switch work? As soon as BaKillus detects QS-molecules of S. aureus or S. pneumoniae the cannibalism toxin SDP is produced and secreted. This leads to the co-expression and co-regulation of a transmembrane protein responsible for the immunity to SDP by binding the extracellular toxin. Simultaneously to the SDP production, the expression of an alternative σ-factor initiates a delayed suicide process by activating either one or both of two types of RNA: an antisense RNA, complementary to the mRNA of the immunity and a small RNA fsrA which has a binding site in the added 5'-UTR of the immunity coding mRNA. As a result the translation of the immunity protein is inhibited and the immunity is lost with the decay of the existing immunity protein.

Background
The sdp-System of B. subtilis consists of two operons: The sdpABC operon, coding for the production and secretion of the cannibalism toxin SDP and the sdpRI operon responsible for the regulation and production of the immunity protein SdpI (Fig. 1).
Fig. 1.  Gene organization for the sdpABC sdpRI operons. The hairpin symbolizes thetranscriptional terminators. [1 ]
In vegetative cells, both operons are repressed by the unstable AbrB regulator. However, during early stages of sporulation AbrB itself is repressed by the master regulator of sporulation Spo0A, making sdpABC and sdpRI accessible for RNA polymerase. [1 ]
The sdpABC Operon – Production and Secretion of the Cannibalism Toxin SDP
The production of the Cannibalism Toxin SDP is a multi-step process.  The sdpC sequence encodes the Pro-SdpC1-203,,which is translated by"

Below is some data showing differential absorption between our control (aeBlue-) and our two samples which contain the insert (aeBlue+), using a spectrophotometer.
Pic 5. Absorption spectra of our transformed spores (aeBlue+) and wild type spores (aeBlue-).
While absorbance at 597 nm (characteristic to aeBlue ) does not show, there is a higher overall absorbance despite having the same spore concentration. Further testing is being done to determine the cause of this absorbance.
We also undertook a cellulose binding assay using scanning electron microscopy. We used four samples:
1. Wild type spores without a PBS wash
2. Spores with our contstruct without a PBS wash
3. Wild type spores with a PBS wash
4. Spores with our contstruct with a PBS wash
All spore samples were diluted to the same concentration of 10^9 spores/ml
Here are our results:
Fig. 6 a. Wild type spores without a PBS wash (35 cells). b. Wild type spores with a PBS wash (10 cells). c. Spores with our construct without a PBS wash (463 cells). d. Spores with our construct with a PBS wash(93 cells). e. Graphical representation of cells remaining on each sample.
We can see that there is not only a net difference between washing and not washing the cellulose. But even more importantly, we can see that our construct yields a greater amount of spores adhering to the cellulose. These pictures were taken as representative of each sample, and thus these preliminary cell counts are accurate enough to show a statistical difference between cells that contain our construct and cells that do not. A PBS wash should get rid of all cells on the cellulose, but we can see that our CIPA+ spores are able to remain on the cellulose despite this wash, whereas the wild type CIPA- spores are almost fully washed out. This shows that our construct works.
Future Goals : From our work and the work done by Chen et al. , we know that synthetic HYDRAs function and can produce a large amount of force (10MJ/cm^3) [1]. Next steps would include building a biological HYDRA. While we have started to characterize our part, further tests would need to be done. We would need to evaluate why the spores do not show a distinct blue color from its aeBlue domain. Then, to better"

The taxonomic distance is currently determined from lineage information available in the NCBI taxonomy database [17], but could be easily extended to include sequence-based information [18] or other, possibly better fitting, criteria as soon as more experimental evidence becomes available. In addition, domains which are directly consecutive in their native organism are preferred over those from different modules, if possible. The well known shortest path algorithm by E.W. Dijkstra [19] is then employed to find the optimal domain combination, using the dummy nodes as start and stop nodes.
Implementation
Following the example of major bioinformatics applications like BLAST [20], the NRPSDesigner was split into a command-line executable comprising the core algorithm, and a web interface providing easy access to the functionality enriched with some extra features. This design enables potential users to set up their own NRPSDesigner instance according to their needs using the compiled executable and a database dump.
The Command-line Executable
We chose C++ as implementation language for the command-line executable to avoid dependencies on run-time interpreters and to maximise speed. Additionally the usage of C++ features like smart pointers, lambda functions, or hash tables from the new C++11 standard allows for terser, faster, less error-prone code. To facilitate re-use of the code in other contexts, all of the functionality is contained within a (currently static) library, with the executable being a thin wrapper around it. In the future, even tighter integration with the web interface can be imagined. In this case a python wrapper would be implemented around the library using a software package like SIP or SWIG.
In case the PartsRegistry or some other publically accessible NRPS database offers the necessary functionality at some point in the future we decoupled the algorithm from the database and allowed multiple database backends. We designed an abstract base class defining the interface required by other parts of our code, and a static factory function responsible for constructing an object of the appropriate backend class employing the singleton pattern, which allows only one instance of the database backend to exist within the entire program. Currently, only one database backend exists, capable of retrieving data from our MySQL database by using the MySQL C++ connector library. Custom exception classes complete the abstraction, as all SQL exceptions are caught within the MySQL backend and a DatabaseError is thrown containing information about the specific error.
Taxonomy information is retrieved on-demand from the NCBI server via the NCBI XML API [21] using the CURL network library and further parsed using the LibXML library. In case of network failure, the NRPSDesigner can fall back to"

Besides, we had several activities together; we presented several campus lectures promoting both synthetic biology and IGEM, and we started our IGEM community together. The collaboration with them not only enhanced the quality of our work, but improved the biology knowledge of our own.

Note: There were three tubes labelled J23110, and one tube that had the label wiped off. These may have been mislabelled. I believe two are J23110 and two are J23100. The two that have more color should be the stronger promoter, and the two with less color should be the weaker promoter. I labelled one plate “S” and one “W” for strong and weak.

The purpose of the interview was to discuss critical topics regarding antibiotic resistance in Kuwait, how these risks have been realized in hospitalized patients treated, for example, in the intensive care unit, and to discuss the microbiology of chronic diabetic wounds. The interview concluded with a discussion about how our product SMITe could find its place as a potential therapeutic solution to excessive antibiotic prescriptions for chronic wounds and the adaptations is might require.

Many thanks to Professor Rotimi for his participation. (Pictured with iGEM team member Betty, below).
Question: I would like to start by asking a few questions regarding antibiotic and multidrug resistance (MDR) in the local area. This is to give us a brief understanding of antibiotics and the increasing risks of MDR caused by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics.
Answer: Good morning Bethel. First of all let me define what an antibiotic is. Antibiotics are naturally occurring or semi-synthetic chemical substances that inhibit the growth of bacteria and are used extensively in medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. However, they are not a panacea for every bacterial infection. They are beneficial and in many cases life-saving. Despite these desirable effects, they can unfortunately produce dangerous toxic side-effects. The risk of developing resistance is another serious downside of these wonderful chemical compounds. Methods by which bacteria become resistant to antimicrobial agents include 1) an alteration in permeability of bacterial cell wall to the antibiotic, 2) an alteration in the target binding sites on the bacteria, 3) use of an alternative metabolic pathway, 4) mutation on a gene  coding for antibiotic-destroying enzyme and 5) acquiring a new gene for an antibiotic-destroying enzyme. The genes that mediate antibiotic resistance can be transmitted between organisms of the same species (intra-transfer) and species of different genera (inter-transfer). As a result resistance to commonly used antibiotics can become widespread in previously susceptibility organisms. These genes (DNA) are transmitted by 4 mechanisms: transformation, transduction, conjugation and transposons. Some gram-negative bacteria may acquire multiple resistance determinants gathered together on one of these transmissible elements thereby making the organisms difficult to treat and eradicate from hospital environment. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii containing these types of elements"

During the 5-day Conference, we met and had chats with other teams from China, Japan, and Taiwan; just until communicating with them then we found the space of improvement for us. These people were intelligent and full of passion paticipating in iGEM.             After the presentation of our project, we were questioned about some problems needed to be solved and also inspired a lot by professors.
We found some presenters from other teams well-prepared and speaking English very flutently. Furthermore, their projects were highly completed and these merits were worth for us to learn.
While listening the presentation of other teams, we could take a peek at their culture from their project. Different culture makes different vision; all we have to do is understanding their thoughts to broaden our horizons.
We were most impressed by NCTU Formosa’s presentation. Their presentation was just like a company’s product launch. We thought it was not only detailed but also catching everyone’s eyes. However, the safety issues were needed to find another way to accomplish.             Moreover, we found the well construction of NCTU_Formosa — everything for activities and every member seemed to be well-prepared; we think the key for a team to be high efficiency is some people strict with members but in the meantime accepting             the possibility for any different voices. We are always told to see further and wider, because iGEM is an international competition and what we’re doing is to make the world, instead of Taiwan only, better.
NCTU held a really fascinating conference because giving us a really comfortable place to discussed about the biological problem.
Different countries have different perspectives in one question, we always need to accept others’ ideas so that we can improve ourselves in the knowledge collision.
Team from Japan focused on the topic of pine tree, we can see their persistent on the environment issues. Sometimes we don’t really care about the environment because we often take it for granted, however, they showed us their responsibility as a human             being to save the environment.
Although English is not our mother tongue language, we still tried our best to use this language to communicate with each other. This is a huge challenge because we feel difficult to explain ourselves to others even we used our mother tongue language.             However, we learned so much when we face our fear in this conference.

Week Eight   20/7 - 26/7
In preparation for the arrival of our highly awaited DNA, this week was focussed on designing protocols ready for the super exciting experiments we will be doing! Our resident lab team had to be  careful not to miss any important details whilst also explaining to the non-lab members what they will be getting up to in the magical Mezzanine Lab.  Collaboration within the team has been high this week as the modelling team came up with some important experimental data they need in order to make the model more accurate. We are confident this is something we can achieve.
On Tuesday we met with Phil Leighton, a highly experienced vet, to discuss our idea with him. Phil was highly receptive to the work we are doing and also had a number of important points that we as a team need to consider in order to make our test viable ‘in the field’. As a consequence of the meeting, on Thursday two members of the team travelled to a Cornish farm, accompanying Phil on a test he had to undertake on a handful of cattle. After we had made a fuss of the two Border Collies present, we saw how the testing occurs first hand, and also got the chance to talk to a farm worker in order to try and understand some of the frustrations TB causes for farmers. Our project aims, in the long term, to assist with the eradication of Bovine TB and therefore alleviate the problems it causes. The farm worker told us how TB testing is an extremely stressful event for the cattle, so much so that on this farm they have had cases of cows losing calves. Furthermore the process of herding and bringing them in is a highly time consuming activity. Hearing this first hand was extremely important for the development of our Beyond the Bench work.
Week Nine   27/7 - 2/8
Revolution! Week nine has been an extremely important week for us as an iGEM team. On Tuesday we said goodbye to our beloved Emilia who leaves us to go and work for Shell in Houston for the next year - not bad going to be honest! We all went out for a team meal and then on to the cinema to see Inside Out. We all want to wish her the best of luck on the adventure ahead of her. She was very excited when we gave her a cuddly E. coli teddy to take with her. However, Emilia leaving gave us a wake up call.

Measurement
Overview
This year, our project focused on measuring the dynamical outputs of our decoding circuit. In the process we performed single cell time series measurements and developed novel protocols for the removal of small molecule inducers . Although single cell measurements using flow cytometry are our preferred way to obtain data, as our project developed, it became clear that much higher throughput would be required. As such, we spent a major portion of our project creating methods to test qualitative circuit behavior using a plate reader.  Throughout the many design build test cycles our decoding system required, we have created many advances in measurement protocols that we hope will be useful to other teams working on complex and dynamic circuits. Additionally, we attempted to follow best practices for data availability and measurement by displaying our graphs in a manner that shows the underlying data, as well as providing full data (in .csv format) and experimental methods for every plot shown on the wiki .
Measurement Techniques
We contributed several novel measurement techniques to iGEM this year. Firstly, we introduced to iGEM 3G Assembly , a new method of DNA assembly that will allow teams to easily create circuits with a wide variety of different parameters. This should not only serve to enhance future team's abilities to clone constructs, but should increase the ability of teams to characterize the properties of existing registry parts. Further, since this method is mostly compatible with CIDAR MoClo [1], we do not complicate characterization and standardization efforts by adding an additional and unnecessary standard. Indeed, we demonstrated this potential by collaborating with Virginia iGEM to characterize two commonly used ribosome binding sites.  Building off of this work, we also devised a way to utilize 3G to test different circuit design variants in a low cost, high throughput manner that requires no specialized equipment outside of a plate reader. Secondly, we have innovated in measurement by validating and using a protocol that allows for the ability to dynamically change the concentration of a small molecule inducers .
Lastly, we realized that many teams were unable to perform flow cytometry"

We could show that the gene of interest is integrating in yeast genome over site directed recombination and the produced protein of interest is secreted in the cultivation medium and detectable there. With this results we could show that the shuttle vector is working as expected and therefor can be used for the production of any protein of interest.

Table 1 Data used in the fitting
The log-sigmoid function was used to fit, because the nisin receptors on the cell membrane is limited, and this function value will not continue to increase as x reach to a certain value. This is suit for the characteristics of our promoter.
In the NICE system, the protein of interest production process is shown as below：
We tried to use Michaelis-Mentin kinetics to predict the protein production rate. We made several modifications on the equation to accommodate the transcriptional regulatory mode of the PnisZ promoter.
The Michaelis-Mentin kinetics equations:
Attention：We replaced [PnisZ] in the Michaelis-Mentin kinetics by F(X) that we obtain by fitting, and we try to transform this typical math model to describe the direct proportion relationship between [PnisZ] and the concentrate of extracellular nisin.
[PnisZ], [mRNA] and [P] represent the concentrations of PnisZ, mRNA and product protein respectively. Coefficient k was got by the experimental result.
The remaining symbols are defined in Table 2.
Table 2 Definition of symbols used in the Michaelis-Mentin kinetics
Analysis and Results
Using the model we established, we predict the protein production rate under different nisin concentrations as shown in Figureure 1.1. The higher concentrations of nisin will lead to higher expression levels of protein of interest.
Figure 1.1 Simulated protein production levels under different nisin conditions
To test whether our model can be applied to the real situation, we compared the expression levels of mCherry proteins and the simulated results. As shown in Figureure 1.2, the two curves are well matched.

The reactions in the dashed box which occur only in the marine cells and other reactions happen in polar and coastal cells. The cloud-like icon stands for two substrates that produces the AHL, the wavy lines represent transcription of the protein and the “*” represent degradation.
We further assumed that the concentrations of SAM and, C6-ACP are at a constant levels S0 and C0, respectively. Hence, we may model the production rate of AHL by,
The background noise production rate is donated as kd and ka is the AHL production rates due to the initiation process.
Compared to the timescales of interest, cell division time, these internal biochemical reactions occur very quickly, and it is reasonable to assume that equation (A.1) is in equilibrium (mathematically, it means dL/dt =0). Combining the result with (A.2) gives
When 'Polar' and 'Coastal' cells were initiated by the diffusion of AHLs, they would start to produce chromoproteins. However, it is very hard for us to determine how many chromoproteins that those cells produced unless we disassembled the cells and purified proteins multiple times. Thus, the second attempt of this modeling practice was to investigate the initiation status in polar and coast cells.
To achieve this thought, we need to find the diffusion pattern of AHL toward/from the medium. We introduced the factor η=σ?A/Vc based on the work of Garcia-Ojalvo (2003) and ETH-Zurich 2013 igem project (2013), with σ representing the membrane permeability, A is surface area and Vc is the cell volume, and ηext=δ/Vext with Vext being the total extracellular volume. Hence,
in which Ae was external AHL concentration and Am was internal concentration of AHL in marine cells.
The marine cell concentration nm change rate is donated as,
Where K is the carrying capacity and α is the intrinsic growth rate.
We assumed that, for the location of coast and polar cells, external AHL concentration was consistent with Ae. Hence,
The production of chromoproteins depend on both the concentration of AHL (A) and growing stage. We use a Hill function (Eq. (6) and Eq. (7)) to model the AHL-dependence of chromoprotein synthesis. The Hill function provides cooperative switching from the synthesis-off to the synthesis-on states, via two parameters a and m,
Those two cooperative switch function gave the insight of the producing rate of different chromoproteins in polar and coast"
SCU-WestChina,2017,Team:SCU-WestChina#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," concentration is not valid. Which can be justified in the future work. The results show that efficiency of uric permeating in femoral vein simulation is much better than that in cephalic vein simulation, because for the former one approximately 30 minutes are needed to reach concentration equilibrium but for the later one the time consumed is about 1 hour. It suggests that femoral vein could be more feasible for our device to work with. But there is also an application for cephalic vein. The traditional dialysis demands abundant dialysate fluid to keep the concentration gradient but our bacteria can metabolize uric acid permeated into the bacterial circulation which means we do not need vast dialysate fluid. This working characteristic together with the microminiaturization of sensors make it possible for our hardware to become a wearable device.

Prokaryotic cells
In prokaryotic cells, the system consists of three circuits. One induces flip, one flips and the other expresses. According to the properties of the promoter pBAD, we build the first circuit, using arabinose as an inducement to generate the recombinase Cre. readmore
Eukaryotic cells
Life process in eukaryotic cells is much more complicate, especially when it is related to signal transportation. We choose microRNA to transport cues and Bxb1 to realize the flipping process. Using microRNA can not only simplify the design of the system, making sure the transportation is precise and efficient, but also ensure the independency with other life processes due to the orthogonality of the microRNA and other signals. readmore
Optimization
The efficiency of cre-loxp system is extremely vital to our design; it may fluctuate a lot in that the DNA are reversible.
Based on our model, we designed some experiments to test the inversion efficiency. We used the flow cytometer to analyz our results. readmore

MALDI-TOF
Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization – Time of flight (MALDI-TOF) is a procedure to analyze large biomolecules by their mass.
Our MALDI-TOF device
Before measurement, the analyte is co-crystallized on a metal plate within a solid matrix. 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) are most commonly used.
Desorption of the analyte is taken by a laser beam, commonly with a wavelength of 337 nm. The matrix absorbs the laser light and the upper layer explosively vaporizes, ejecting both, matrix and analyte molecules. In addition to this vaporization, the laser beam also leads to an ionization of the analytes. The mass analysis is performed by the TOF (time of flight)-analysator. The evaporated ions are accelerated in an electric field. Typical acceleration voltages for this are 10-30 kV. The velocity of an ion depends on its mass and the charge. An ion detector converts the incoming ions into an electrical signal. The advantage of this method is the rapid analysis of a relatively large mass range.
The MALDI-TOF analysis was performed with the ultrafleXtreme™ by Bruker Daltonics.
We used the MALDI-TOF Analysis to characterize the following BioBricks:
<bbpart>K1172201</bbpart>
<bbpart>K1172501</bbpart>
<bbpart>K1172303</bbpart>

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html," reduce the CI concentration that is, switch back from the channel C in our system. However, we can fuse an ssrA tag to the protein an target it for faster degradation within the cell. According to Keiler et al. (1996), such tagging can reduce the half-life to 4 minutes. Hence, we used the LVA tagged version of the CI lambda repressor protein ( BBa_K327018 ). This enables much shorter reaction time and nearly real-time control of the CI concentration. However, it also lowers the highest possible concentration of CI. We hypothesize that by using a strong enough promoter, we can reach sufficient CI concentrations for PRM repression.
.: This is our unidirectional version of the lambda repressor with duplicated OR sites and planned genes A and B. When there is no CI present, only gene A will be active.
.: As a CI dimer binds to the OR1 site it immediately recruits another dimer to the OR2 site. In this situation, only gene B will be active.
.: As CI octamerizes, the DNA will be looped and both genes A and B are deactivated. Gene C is then activated.
Parts
The gene circuit consists of two different segments: the light sensor that produces CI according to the intensity of light and the actual switch that responds to the differences in the concentration of the repressor protein CI. You can find the complete sequence of the switch from this file (click) .
.: This is our gene circuit. The upper part is the light sensing segment that produces the CI protein and the lower part reacts to differences in the CI concentration and switches the gene channel. The turquoise arrows are promoters, the turquoise circles are operator sites, the light blue circles are ribosome binding sites and the gray squares are expressed genes. The promoter of the YF1 gene can be any constitutive promoter.

Sample collection and background investigation
In order to obtain more accurate and up-to-date data of the salt concentration in food waste, our team decided to collect samples from the canteen of China Agriculture University, where we conducted our experiments. On the evening of 28th July, after most students finished their dinner, five team members, carrying several test bags and glass bottles, headed to our destination.
After receiving the admission from the manager of the canteen, we started to collect samples.  Two boys of us put on the gloves to prevent contaminating waste samples. They dug their hands into the full garbage bin to take out solid food waste. Then we separated approximately 100 grams for one test bag and collected three repeats at each sample site. After carefully sealing the bags, we also collected 80 milliliters of liquid food waste in each of three glass bottles to record the salinity data of different types of food waste.
In order to avoid decay, we quickly stored our samples in the fridge of the lab. Next, we sent our samples to a professional salinity test site, Agriculture Science and Biology Research Center, to collect the salinity data for the future experiments.
According to our analysis, we found that the result was not convincing enough to support our hypothesis. Thus, in the whole month our team visited more sample sites and collected new samples. To make the results more accurate, we divided our samples into three groups on the basis of the sample sites, family kitchen waste, canteen waste and restaurant waste.  On 19th, 20th and 21st, Oct., we visited more than 20 restaurants and 10 canteens and finally collected 12 samples. Meanwhile our classmates helped us with 6 family kitchen samples.
The most difficult part is getting the restaurant samples since half of the managers rejected to provide samples, either because the restaurant cannot understand the"
Harvard,2017,Team:Harvard#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," or diffusion per unit area per unit time, \(D\) is the diffusion coefficient, which we will take from literature, and \(\nabla \phi \) is the concentration gradient. However, to avoid partial derivatives, we will simplify the equation above into the following:  $$ J = -D \frac{[csgX_{per}] - [csgX_{ECM}]}{\omega}$$   where \([csgX_{per}] - [csgX_{ECM}]\) represents the difference in concentration of a protein between the periplasm and the ECM, and \( \omega \) represents the width of the outer membrane. The equation now gives us the moles per unit area per unit time. To obtain the number of molecules per unit time, we multiply the equation above by the surface area of the cell, which we will represent as \( S \), as well as avogadro's number, \( N_A \):  $$ J = -D \frac{[csgX_{per}] - [csgX_{ECM}]}{\omega} S N_A$$   The equations above will be used to represent the rate of translocation of csgF, csgA, and csgB from the periplasm to the extracellular matrix, as their mode of transport is known to be selective diffusion.
Aggregation and Polymerization
One of the most useful properties of curli fibers is their self-assembly and aggregation. However, this feature also poses a problem when curli is used as a biomanufacturing platform – production of csgA that outpaces the E. coli maximum efficiency cell's natural secretion machinery can lead to accumulation and aggregation within the cytoplasm, causing the cell lysis. Thus, it is crucial to examine both the buildup of intracellular fibers as it pertains to cell health, as well the effect of extracellular aggregation in driving the diffusion equilibrium forward.
Fibril formation can be broken down into two main reactions: nucleation, describing the interaction between two csgA monomers to form a seed for further fiber growth, and elongation of fibrils, which refers to the addition of csgA monomers to an existing fiber. These two steps proceed until the species involved reach an equilibrium.  $$2 csgA_m \underset{\epsilon_{-1}}{\overset{\epsilon_{1}}{\rightleftharpoons}} F$$ $$F + csgA_m \underset{\epsilon_{-2}}{\overset{\epsilon_{2}}{\right"

HBUT-China,2018,Team:HBUT-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"ing on-campus lectures
So far, we have held two lectures. We have sent invitations throughout the school and hope that all interested students will participate in our lectures. The lectures were conducted in English. In the first lecture, the HBUT-China 2017 team made their participation in the 2017 iGEM team project introduction and the silver prize. They also mentioned the wonderful performance of other teams, such as team videos from other teams. Our event was also recorded by the Science and Technology Department of the College Student Union and a press release was published on the College's official website to report the lecture. The second lecture was in June. It has been more than a month since we determined our project. The InterLab part of the team has also been actively prepared. We introduced the project design ideas and the experimental part of the plan to the audience. arrangement. At the meeting, everyone's attention was very concentrated and they were very fascinated by the content of our lectures. After each lecture, we have a question time for the audience. Everyone asked questions from various aspects, and we patiently made the best answer. Below are some of the questions we have recorded and our answers.
Read Q&A
(2) Attend the Science Festival
We were invited to attend the Science Festival.In May, the school held a Science Festival, and the HBUT-China 2018 team were invited to attend. We made our own panel early before the event. When the event officially started, the event venues gradually increased. We introduced all of our team's projects to all the students who came to our booth.
(3) Community cultural activities
In addition to holding lectures, participating in academic-related activities, and sharing with the public, we also have a variety of community cultural activities. After the discussion is exhausted, we will bring the guitar and relax outdoors. If the weather permits, members of the community will gather and sing and dance together in the Central District playground on Friday night of the second week of each month. We have also held several IGEM special English Corner events, and we will invite our foreign language instructors together. All the participants came to conduct English free talks.
B. Teaching in high school classrooms
We spend most of our energy on contacting with the student group. We hope that more students will follow their hearts and be brave enough to choose to study deeper in the biological field and can make a huge contribution . We went to the high school classes to communicate with them and hope to bring them together to appreciate the fun of biological knowledge.
