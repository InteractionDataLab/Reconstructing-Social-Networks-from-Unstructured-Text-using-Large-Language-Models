SUSTech_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," we got single colonies by FACS. After extracting cell’s genome, we established a  real-time qPCR strategy to identify cell clones with single copy Loxp inserted to genome. With this cell, we then used Cre-loxp system to integrate a single copy of TRPC5 mutant into genome. The diversity of cell library with TRPC5 mutants is also critical. Although the new site-specific recombination method might provide one step solution, however the recombination efficiency of ~1% for CRISPR, is not comparable of the recombination efficiency of 10-80% for Cre-LoxP system.
Downstream of channels' response is designed to indicate channels’ sensitivity. High sensitivity channels in cells would induce stronger GFP expression through downstream promoter (pNFAT), since there is more calcium influx into cytosol under same condition.
Figure 8. A two-step TRPC5 mutant library screening strategy.1. Neo gene with C-terminal Loxp sequence is integrated in to the CHO genome with piggyBac transposon system, and selected with G418.  2. The cell line with a single LoxP integration is used to insert Loxp-puro-TRPC5 library, and selected with puromycin.  The cell library is exposed to chronic sonic stimulation, and clones are FACS sorted based on NFAT-GFP intensities.

Safety Considerations
1.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety,
public safety, or
environmental safety?
1. From the perspective of the researcher, our project has minimal associated risks. We are using the E.coli K-12 strain – a laboratory strain – which is safe to handle and registered as GRAS (generally recognised as safe). The strain poses no direct risk even upon consumption. As always within the lab, good lab practice should always be followed, although there is no reason this should pose a danger.
As The E.ncapsulator is to be ingested, the issues regarding public safety could be debated. Whilst many in the field would argue that the K-12 strain is essentially harmless, counter-arguments could come from fears about ingesting live bacteria. Whilst this is commonplace in probiotic drinks for example, we still thought it necessary to allay people’s fears by including a cell death module in our system. This means that upon ingestion the cells are dead. However, as with any biological system, this will not be 100% effective, and some bacteria will survive the killing mechanism.
Environmental safety is a less critical issue in regards to our project. With many new developments within the field of Synthetic Biology, one great fear held by the public is that of ‘escape’ of a genetically modified organism into the wild, and causing environmental problems. In reality the risks of this happening are minimal. Any scientist who has worked with lab strain bacteria will know the difficulties of getting them to grow even under strictly controlled laboratory conditions, never mind the harsh variable conditions of the outside environment! Still, there is even a very remote possiblity of this happening – but there should be no reason why this genetically modified strain will be any more dangerous than the Escherichia coli encountered naturally. Good laboratory practice will ensure that no bacteria being worked on in the lab will come into contact with the outside environment. Such practices include autoclaving all waste that has come into contact with bacterial cells, virconing all culture flasks, safe and proper disposal of any material that has been used to work with bacterial cells, washing hands before leaving the lab and not transferring anything from the lab to the outside environment.
2. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
2. Imperial has its own Biosafety board, details of which can be found here .

iGEM Utrecht: Sample analysis and BioBrick testing
We also performed a mutual collaboration with iGEM Utrecht . For us, they characterized three BioBricks involved in the fluorescent output of our device. In turn, we analyzed their samples on a western blot.
Sample Analysis
To verify the secretion of sCpf1 and sCas9 by the animal cells of iGEM Utrecht, we performed a western blot analysis. For this, samples of both the medium and the cells were prepared. We ran these samples on a SDS-gel in our laboratory, followed by western blotting. The full protocol can be found here and the results of the western blot can be found below.
Results western blot
Figure A: Results for iGEM Utrecht of the western blot for Cas9 protein in both medium and cells.
Figure B: Results for iGEM Utrecht of the western blot for Cpf1 protein in both medium and cells.
BioBrick Validation
iGEM Utrecht did measurements on our visualization module by testing five of our BioBricks: the CpxR construct ( BBa_K2387032 ) and the BiFC system with both GFP and Venus ( BBa_K2387045 , BBa_K2387046 , BBa_K2387047 and BBa_K2387048 ).

Visit to OBiO

Since our team planned to use exosomes as molecular carriers, we would like to know how it is in neurons. Then we went to OBiO Shanghai, a high-tech enterprise integrating basic research service, gene therapy drug research and development and clinical recombinant virus industrialization preparation. In the visit to OBiO Shanghai, we discussed with specialist Dr. Diao the safety and rationality of the design and execution of our project. While, during the discussion, we were more clear about the advantages and possible disadvantages of the usage of exosomes and AAV as molecular carriers and realized that our original plan remained some defects indeed. Dr. Diao generally approved our design but pointed out the possible defects at the same time. She believed that when it comes to vessels with the ability of targeted transporting molecular substance, AAV virus are more efficient than exosomes. Our old friend, the exosomes, are good molecular carriers in that they are natural and highly compatible to the cell. But the expert pointed out that further consideration of the transportation efficiency of exosomes and the duration of the effect should be carried out in our experiments. The content inside the exosomes, are not universal, so the future of exosomes as drugs is probably not that bright. However, Dr. Diao encouraged us to conduct the experiments synchronously both with AAV and exosomes to compare the effect by ourselves. Also, she suggested that systematic injection would be preferable to targeted injection.
What she pointed out gave our experimental design a valuable and precious improvement. In fact, during our later experiment, it comes out that the efficiency of exosomes encapsulating mRNA is very low.
What’s more, Dr Diao told us, virus has been coming into sight as an important carrier in gene therapy. For example, lentivirus can be used in CAR-T due to its ability of gene integration. However, in the cure of genopathy, the AAV virus is a better choice in that it can cause slight immune reaction in the body and the effect can be rather prolonged. Because the virus genome will not be integrated with that of the host cell, the safety of application of the AAV can be guaranteed. Moreover, AAV has the capacity of passing through the blood brain block and this enables us to use AAV for transportation of target elements to work in the neurons. While, our original carrier, exosomes, cannot transport contents universally like AAV.
In addition, with the interaction with biological company, we learned about the current situation in the policy and industry"

One type of carboxysome, is the ɑ-carboxysome, which consists of a proteinaceous outer shell composed of six different shell proteins designated CsoS1ABCD and CsoS4AB. This shell encloses RuBisCo, the shell associated protein (CsoS2), and the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CsoS3). In the proteobacteria Halothiobacillus neapolitanus, these genes are clustered into the cso operon. The carbonic anhydrase converts HCO3-, which diffuses passively into the carboxysome, to CO2, thereby driving the continued diffusion of HCO3- into the microcompartment Mangan NM, Brenner MP.

We then reached out to one of the publishers of the paper, Rajeev Ram, who is a professor at MIT University. We wanted to have an up close look at the device after realizing the high level of complexity it took to design and manufacture the chip. We went to visit his lab and see a copy of the microfluidic device as well as the corresponding system that is used to run it. Both teams were provided with valuable insight into the chip’s operation and design after the visit. This allowed us to understand the minimum pieces of the design that needed to be kept in order to maintain the same functionality.
Stage 3
The BostonU Hardware team worked to develop and manufacture a replication of the microfluidic device. Eventually with the help from the Harvard iGEM team we were able to replicate a relatively accurate design of the chips cell culturing chamber. However, when the chip was tested using colored water there was very little success. The fluid was unable to move in a proper clockwise movement and was not able to be displaced fully from any chamber. Progress was eventually stopped due to the lack of hardware resources from last year's project, Neptune.  In order to continue the development of the microfluidic module more work would be needed with programmable syringe pumps.
Stage 4
The last portion of the collaboration was to validate the Harvard iGEM team’s optical density sensor. The BostonU Hardware team developed small scale microfluidic chips in order to test the sensor. However, in order to test the OD sensor, the Harvard iGEM team vapor polished the surface to remove any etchings that was left from the manufacturing process. This aimed to decrease the possibility of inaccuracies that could occur during testing. The Harvard iGEM team came to the BostonU Hardware team’s lab. Check out the Harvard iGEM team's wiki for more information.

This collaboration was based around co-engineering a microfluidic chip that performs the BostonU Wetlab team’s Toe-hold protocol. This chip was then integrated into the MARS Chip Repository as the fluorescence chip. Our preliminary fluid functionality checklist was used while testing the final chip design in order to receive feedback regarding its effectiveness.

    •  GlgX induced with IPTG: glycogen extract mass = 14.6 mg
    •  GlgB Non-induced: glycogen extract mass = 77.0 mg
    •  GlgB with IPTG: glycogen extract mass = 77.0 mg
The mass of the glycogen extracted when GlgX was induced was nearly half that of glycogen extracted from the same, non-induced culture. This is expected because the GlgX enzyme will de-branch glycogen resulting in linear glucan strands which are lost from the glycogen molecule. Therefore, less glycogen will be extracted from the culture in which GlgX was induced.
Both glycogen extracts from GlgB induced and non-induced bacteria weighed exactly the same. It was expected that there would not be a discernible difference in these glycogen extracts. This is because the branching enzyme GlgB, cleaves and re-anneals glucan strands, which would create a more branched structure, but no glucan strands are lost and so the amount of glycogen extracted will be similar in induced and non-induced samples.
Representative TEM images are shown in figure 2, confirming that the white solid obtained in the extraction protocol is glycogen.
Figure 1: Glycogen extracts of GlgX (left) and GlgB (right). The IPTG-induced extract is on the right and the non-induced extract is on the left, in both pictures.
Figure 2: TEM image of GlgB without IPTG induction (left) and GlgB with IPTG induction (right). Little difference in glycogen structure can be observed in these images. The samples were prepared by adding a drop of sample (approximately 10 microlitres) onto a 3 mm 400 mesh copper/palladium (CuPd) grid. This was left to soak on the grid for about 10-15 seconds, then the excess removed by filter paper. Then a drop of uranyl acetate was placed on the grid, left for 10-15 seconds and then removed again and left to dry. The grids were imaged on and FEI Tecnai 200 kV TEM.
Determining if expression of glycogen branching and debranching enzymes affect E. coli glycogen structure

We aimed to determine whether the glycogen extracted from bacteria expressing GlgB and GlgX had different structures. We wanted to see if there was a difference in the branch length distributions when GlgB or Gl"

Keratinocyte Experiments
We began our first keratinocyte experiments in      Dr. Prince’s laboratory. The goal of the experiment was to      determine which MOIs of the bacteria strains (Putida,      Mutant, Arginosa) were toxic to the cells and to establish      whether the bacteria was engulfed by the cells by      plating. The experiment took longer than expected as we      included two incubation points: 2 hours and 4 hours. We      then had to leave the laboratory as there was no longer a      qualified scientist available to watch us. Before leaving,      we placed the cells on slides in preparation to count them      in a different laboratory for later use. However, by the      time we got to the other laboratory the cells had died. We      learned from this experiment that we should not make the      slides too far in advance. We also learned that we should      use a legitimate cell viability assay rather than a crude      counting method. Finally, we realized that we should split      the large experiment into smaller experiments to determine      dosage and time point this way we will have enough time to      accurately complete both experiments. Then we can use the      optimal conditions determined by these experiments in a      future culminatory experiment.
Rhamnolipid Production Troubleshooting
Seeing as it seems that there were no Rhamnolipids being      produced by our strain from the MS and TLC data we decided      it would be best to break down the process to a step by      step level and trouble shoot at each level. To test our      hypothesis that there was a metabolic burden, we agree it      would be best to see if a high concentration of      rhamnolipids is toxic to cell growth and test an inducible      promoter. We also thought that there may be necessary      reagents to grow such as glucose. So, we decided to      replicate the exact conditions of the primary paper from      which we were working. We questioned the promoters as      well. Should we clone the natural promoter of RhlAB into      P. Putida. Furthermore, is the bacterial strain an issue?      To answer the lattermost question, we decided to check if      transformed E.Coli produces Rhamnolipids along with      P. Aeruginosa. To analyze the transcription step we ran a      qPCR and to assess the translation step we ran an      SDS-Page.
Based upon the TLC analysis, we made the following      conclusions. First, we Conf"

USTC_CHINA,2013,Team:USTC CHINA#team3_-_-_TEXT.html," cheerfully immersed himself in the labwork. Matts main computing interests are game design and bio-informatics. Outside academia, Matt enjoys playing and coaching basketball and is president of the University basketball club.
Vivian Wong
Vivian studies Pharmacology and is from Hong Kong. She’s a dedicated member of the team, often working late into the evening. As well as her competence with practical lab work, she is quietly confident in many aspects of the project such as navigating the wiki and having design input. Although first seen as a little shy, Vivian quickly came out of her shell, giving excellent advice and listening and responding to problems or concerns. In her spare time she enjoys playing the piano, eating out and enjoying a good cup of tea.
Christopher Wall
Studying in the first Synthetic Biology Masters in the country (alongside Rob), Chris completed a BSc in Biology at the University of Sheffield before moving to Newcastle.  As one of the more experienced members of the team, Chris' extensive lab skills and resourcefulness have made him the first person other members turn to when an experiment goes wrong or a protocol needs adjusting. Found in the lab at weekends and late into the night, Chris' enthusiasm and maturity have enabled him to successfully juggle iGEM with the end of his Masters project. When not in the lab, Chris can be found playing or watching football, and is also something of a movie aficionado.
Justas Miknys
Justas is one of our computer scientists in the team and provides a lot of help with the computing and modelling parts of our project. Even though he doesn’t have much background in biology, he tries his best to help us all the time. Justas has a signature laugh which cheers everyone up after a long day. Throughout the day, he also likes to share haribos and cookies with everyone on the team to keep everyone full. If you see Justas really tired in the morning, it’s probably because he has been up at night playing poker. Justas suggested that our iGEM team be called Newcastle Mafia. This name was luckily voted out but he was devastated.
Alina Tamciuc
Alina is our only architect in the team but has thrown herself into the lab work with lots of enthusiasm. Her strengths are in her strong eye for design (as seen in the team logo), her straight talking attitude and supportive and friendly nature. She also enjoys hikes, cheese, wine, watching Miss Marple, cherry tea, trips to the cinema and photography.

Tartu_TUIT,2018,Team:Tartu TUIT#Human Practices#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," only UV radiation that induces MAA synthesis - other stressors also increase       the yield so perhaps one of these will work in yeast if UV doesn’t - these include increasing       the nitrate concentration, thermal stress, osmotic stress, increase in salinity. There may be others too.
In your opinion, do we need to add some additional compounds to our sunscreens to increase photostability of MAAs. If yes, what compounds we can use?
From our work we have found MAA to be extremely photostable          (only a few percent degradation after massive UVR doses), so         I would say that nothing would need to be added to increase photostability.         The MAAs we have tested are much more photostable than most of the currently          available synthetic filters we have tested.
How do you think, is the combination of Shinorine and Porphyra-334 reasonable for sunscreens?
It is a reasonable start as a proof of concept but they both have very similar         absorption spectra with the same peak at 334nm. It would be better to have         a diverse range of MAA, with peak absorptions across the entire UVR spectrum          if possible to create a broad spectrum sunscreen that meets regulatory requirements.          For example, covering the shorter wavelengths palythine has a peak at 320nm,         gadusol (a precursor of MAA) has a peak at 294nm, and the longer wavelengths         usijerene has a peak at 354nm and palythene at 360nm. if it would be possible         to create these 6 MAA together it would be almost perfect.
I would like to ask you if you already tried similar experiments and maybe you can suggest more precise values or methods?
I havent tried these experiments but there is evidence of           all of these in the literature. You will find some examples of           these in my review on MAA which I have attached.           (sent an article)
Could you please advise if there are simple basic tests that can be done to check photostability?
Photostabilty is very easy to check. Essentially all you         need to do is irradiate the MAA dissolved in         a solvent (I u sed PBS) with increasing doses of         UVR and then measure the absorbance with         a spectrophotometer. The percentage degradation         can then be assessed using the decrease in         absorption or measuring the shift in spectrum.         It is important to use a relevant source,         either environmentally relevant like a solar         simulator or a source relevant to the         absorption spectrum ("

Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#Results2_-_-_TEXT.html,"L and EutK are toxic to the cell, however, the production of EutS may be less toxic. This may be due to less strain being put on the cell due to the expression of a single microcompartment subunit, rather than multiple subunits being expressed simultaneously. Overall this data indicates that the expression of complete microcompartments is likely to be toxic to the cell and should be highly regulated.
Figure 6. Average optical density at 600 nm of Eut S, EutMN, EutSMN constructs induced and non-induced. Measurements were taken at 0 hours, 4 hours and 20 hours.
This would ultimately interfere with the real-life implementation of our bacteria in a continuous culture system . In a continuous culture system it is important to balance biomass accumulation with PPK expression and phosphate accumulation. When phosphate levels are low, the cells should invest their resources into growth, rather than phosphate accumulation. To alleviate this problem, we designed and modelled a regulatory operon that aims to regulate the synthesis of microcompartment proteins under different external phosphate levels.

Results
In the minimal M9 media, all possible combinations of parameters listed above were tested.                             None of the concentrations of glucose had any aﬀect on the growth of E. coli. It was expected that as the concentration of glucose increased, the growth of E. coli also increased. However, the variation between the concentrations of glucose may have been too small for a noticeable increase in E. coli growth as the concentration of glucose increased. Also, even the maximum concentration of glucose tested, 100mM, may have been too low to aﬀect the growth of E. coli to an observable extent. Eventually, 10mM was determined to be the optimal glucose concentration for the purpose of least interference possible in solution.                             NH4Cl as minimal nitrogen source was proven to be not suitable for E. coli growth at any concentration as the OD600 testing results showed that cell density didn’t change throughout the time.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#10 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," well as how the ratio of output to input energy is much lower than most other energy-production endeavours. Many of my questions were answered, but naturally, many more also arose.
We started off with a look at some of the bitumen lakes, complete with artificial men and cannons to scare ducks away. Our attention was then directed to one of many restoration efforts, where they were able to re-grow much of the natually-occuring vegetation on previously-pillaged land. That aspect accounted for much of the focus of the tour. Indeed, the efforts are very admirable and they have been quite successful in revitalising the land (so far). Whether or not this (a) succeeds in the longer-term; and (b) erases more of the environmental footprint (land scorching, greenhouse and noxious gas release, significant changes to the landscape) requires more enquiry.
We also observed some of the excavation and mining operations, where workers mined for the oil-rich sands that would eventually undergo separation and be turned into a heavy-oil slurry. This also induced some questions - namely, how much usable/useful energy can be extracted from this, relative to the amount of energy necessary to convert the oil-sand energy into a usable/useful form. I have heard everything from 4 barrels of oil output per input barrel equivalent in energy (Pressnail, 2007) to 20 barrels output per input barrel equivalent in energy (Hale, 2009), the latter of which was quoted today (although he wasn't entirely certain of the number). This also merits further enquiry, as the 95% seems a little high (given that light oil in Southeastern Saskatchewan isn't even that usable in its raw form). Moreover, if it were a 95% efficient process, they should be able to operate comfortably even if the price of oil sinks below $50/barrel.
So, I'm currently working on a list of questions for tomorrow and checking more into their figures and statistics. It has been a very interesting experience that is well worth the time and distance. More details to come tomorrow!

The plastic figure was clear and good. After that, we detected RNA’s concentration by ultraviolet spectrophotometer. At last we chose the best one in three samples. We conserved the sample for reverse transcription tomorrow.
Monday 31/8
We extracted the RNA from cells which were used different concentration of virus to transfect the cell to silence gene. The concentration gradients of virus were 4μl, 8μl, 12μl, 16μl, 20μl and control. And then we ran the gel electrophoresis. The plastic figure was less than satisfactory.

On the other side, we wanted to find out optimum concentration of cDNA which was added to PCR.
Thursday 3/9
We extracted the RNA from cells which were over expressed bothαsubunit andβsubunit. And we used the RNA to do reversed transcription. And we used those samples to do general PCR method. We ran the gel electrophoresis in the final step. We found that the expression ofαsub unit increased significantly. But, unfortunately, the expression of βsubunit was required to confirm since its control group is not available. To our surprise, the group which was added Nuclease-free water and primers appeared strip. We thought that it must have something wrong in our experiment today and we needed to find out the mistake.
Friday 4/9
We chose the best primers which we designed the day before yesterday. We added different concentration of sample and found the best concentration in the experiment.

Today we redid the experiment on Friday. But we did the real-time PCR this time. We extracted the RNA from cells which were over expressed bothαsubunit andβsubunit. And we used the RNA to do reversed transcription. And we used those samples to do real-time PCR method. And then we ran the gel electrophoresis. The result made us disappointed.

We labelled 4 PCR eppendorfs and added this appropriate amount of PCR water.
Next 15ul of buffer mix was added.
Next the primers were added- take care and keep reading the labels!
Next the template DNA was added to the 2 tubes that are NOT controls.
1ul of the taq polymerase solution was added- to avoid mistakes this can be added to the master buffer solution instead.
The final solutions can be put into the PCR machine and the appropriate program set.
The PCR products can then be run on a gel which we did in the afternoon.
DNA Extraction
We took the eppendorf tube containing 184mg of gel from the fridge and solved the gel in 552ul(184*3) of gel solubilization solution. We left the tube containing the mix in 55C hot water bath for 10 minutes and vortexed every three minutes. We used two collection tubes and added 184 ul of isopropanol, 700ul of wash solution and 50ul of elute for each tube at the relevant steps. The first collection tube had 700ul of the solved gel whereas the second one had 450ul. 110ul of Elute was placed in an eppendorf tube and preheated in 65C prior to use. After adding the elute we left the tubes on the bench for a minute to incubate before the centrifuge. We got 100ul of DNA from the first tube and 80ul of from the second tube. We then combined the tubes, measured the DNA concentration and placed the tube to -20C fridge where midipreps are stored.
DNA Concentration
Concentration of the DNA was measured as 12ng/ul using the spectrophotometer

Summary
Today's lab experiment will be focussing on a second attempt to PCR the genome of Bacillus subtilis 168 cells which have taken up and inserted the pGFP-rrnB plasmid. In a couple of the previous lab sessions, the Metal Sensing team focussed on growing up some B. subtilis transformant cells (i.e. those which had taken up the plasmid pGFP-rrnB) and carrying out a PCR reaction on them using four synthesized primers to make sure that the genome carries out the insert.
Also in the last lab session, the Metal Sensing team digested 10ul of BBa_J33206 ("

Edinburgh_OG,2018,Team:Edinburgh OG#Toggle Switch_-_-_TEXT.html," only glucose as the inducer would be used as a control element.  This toggle switch leads to the optimization of expression of a useful enzyme by inducing the transcription of the genes downstream of it as the glucose levels diminish at the peak of bacterial density.  This removes the need to add an external (and potentially expensive) inducer to stimulate production of the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the desired product.
This project was designed to work alongside the other 2018 Edinburgh overgraduate iGEM team projects, advancing our goal of a more efficient and improved production of bioplastics. This project set out to combine several existing genetic elements to create a single plasmid that contained the genes coding for enzymes that could construct a pathway that would optimize the synthesis of PHA in E. coli and to place the regulation of the transcription of those enzymes under the control of a promoter that responded to low glucose concentrations.
Figure 2 Proposed design for a new toggle switch bio brick.  The toggle switch architecture showing individual parts and contains the LacI responsive promoter (trcp), which expresses TetR and mCherry, and a TetR responsive promoter (tetOp) which expresses LacI. The Biobrick Prefix and Suffix would be added on each end and device would be inserted into pSB1C3.
The main regulatory aspects would be kept such as tetR, lacI, TetR responsive promoter (tetOp), the LacI responsive promoter (trcp), and (cAMP) receptor promoter (crpp). In order to create this iGEM part, the Biobrick Prefix and Suffix would have to be added (Figure 2).
Materials
Cloning was carried out in Escherichia coli. DH5α. pSB1C3, gfp (Bba_I20270), and phaCAB operon (Bba_K1149051) were obtained from 2018 iGEM distribution kit. Biobrick plasmids were transformed into DH5α E. coli.  pKDL071, pKDL071-TaraF, and pKDL071-TaraF-phaECAB in LacIΔ MG1655 E. coli were given as a gift from William Bothfeld in the Kyo Lab at Northwestern University(Bothfeld et al., 2017)
Results
Using Gibson assembly proved difficult for this project. To remove an EcoRI site, the toggle switch was cloned out in two pieces and mixed with the vector in a Gibson Reaction.

Project Design
Our project aims to construct a safe and efficient drug delivery system targeting specific oncogene to provide a new strategy of cancer therapy. We chose lung cancer as our disease model due to its substantial morbidity and mortality.
Generally, the project design can be divided into three portions: (1) RNAi module, (2) targeting module, and (3) RNAi module and targeting module assembly.
RNAi module
RNA interference (RNAi) is an emerging technology of gene silencing. It uses siRNA segments to destroy specific mRNA, thereby, shut down the expression of target genes. RNAi has been demonstrated as a novel treatment modality of cancer and we decided to utilize this technology to silence the expression of specific oncogene [1]. KRAS is one of the most commonly mutated oncogenes in lung cancer. The mutation rate of KRAS can be up to 25% in NSCLC (a main type of lung cancer) [2]. Thus, we picked KRAS as our target oncogene. Then we designed anti-KRAS siRNA as a therapeutic agent to degrade KRAS mRNA, therefore, repressing the expression and function of K-ras protein. We used a specialized software developed by team SYSU-software to find the ideal siRNA sequence. This tool also designed pairs of oligonucleotides needed to generate short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in the plasmid. When the shRNA plasmids of KRAS are transfected into HEK293 cells, the dsRNA is cleaved into siRNA of KRAS by the enzyme Dicer, and then target KRAS mRNA. However, due to the short half-life period and poor cellular uptake of exogenous siRNA[3], an efficient delivery vehicle is needed to stabilize and enhance the naked small interference molecule's function.
Fig 1. Pre-designed shRNA sequence
Targeting module
Exosomes are natural nano-sized vesicles secreted by numerous cell types [4]. Exosomes derived from cells naturally contain a substantial amount of RNA. Moreover, their membranes endow exosomes with a specific cell tropism, attaching themselves to target cells by a range of surface adhesion proteins and vector ligands. Besides, exosomes are endogenous transporters, so they are unlikely to exert toxicity or immune response [5]. Hence, exosome is regarded as a potentially ideal siRNA delivery tool with advantages in three aspects: RNA-loading, targeting and safety.
Moreover, exosomes can be endowed with the ability of targeting specific disease site through genetic modification of donor"

Stanford–Brown–Spelman iGEM 2014 — Human Practices
Uses of UAVs & Orthogonal
Systems in Nature
Intro ● EPA Partnership ● Uses of UAVs ● Interviews ● Survey
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) (also known as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) have a long history of usage. According to DraganFly Innovations Inc. , early UAVs took the form of balloons and they were primarily used for military purposes for monitoring and eliminating enemies in the battlefield. However, in  recent years, UAVs have been increasingly used by civilians to accomplish various scientific and humanitarian missions. Due to their promising ability to accomplish tasks that otherwise could have been tedious, unreachable or even dangerous to civilians, our team has considered the idea of improving the current models of UAVs in order to make them more biodegradable, modular and even cheaper and hence increasing their accessibility and practicability to the scientific and civilian societies.
In the midst of our scientific design process and laboratory work, our team has taken into serious consideration the risks, ethics and stigma of using UAVs for civilian uses.  Our aim in conducting this iGEM human practices project was to dive deep into the social and economic impacts of using synthetic biology in general. Our second aim was to consider how to work around the stigma present in society regarding the uses of UAVs. Part of this project was also to discuss the regulations and policies involved in the flying of civilian UAVs and assess the accessibility and practicability of the current civilian UAVs. The main reason of doing this human practices project was to bring our laboratory work closer to humanity by assessing the impacts of our creation to the general society.
Our Work with the EPA—
Synthetic Biology in the Air: Biological
UAVs and Environmental Safety Concerns
We are currently working on a series of projects towards the construction of a fully biological unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for use in scientific and humanitarian missions. The prospect of a biologically-produced UAV presents numerous advantages over the current manufacturing paradigm. First, a foundational architecture built by cells allows for construction or repair in locations where it would be difficult to bring traditional tools of production. Second, a major limitation of current research with UAVs is the size and high power consumption of analytical instruments, which require bulky electrical components and large fuselages to support their weight. By moving these functions into cells with biosensing capabilities"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html,"ET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in pur"

BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," presentation, and the fact that Adrian was not around to help us with the competent cell protocol, we decided to hold off on this.
Need to run gel on PCR products.
Also, heard back from Christina Smolke.  She is sending us the W303_alpha strain that has a knockout for the gal2 gene.  She is also sending us the construct that will enable us to do the same knockout in W303_1a.  Apparently, the construct can generate a knockout via homologous recombination for anything as long as we attach the correct ends during PCR.  The ends should target the construct to a specific site (locus) in the yeast genome, which will then cause a knockout of that gene.  Thus, once we receive the gene, we only need to PCR it with the primers that will target it to the GAL2 gene.  Note that this construct operates using G418 resistance this gene replaces the GAL2 gene via homologous recombination, thus simultaneously providing the knockout and inserting a selection marker.  G418 is expensive!! ($100 per gram).
Are there other possible uses for this powerful construct as we move into tests?
One other consideration to keep in mind is that if we decide to use the gal2 knockout strains we need to change our plan for subsequent transformations.  Hopefully we will not have to redo the transformations we have already completed, though we should keep that option open, especially if we do not see a good enough response from the GAL1 promoter in the normal W303 strains.

Our results reveal that BL21 loses the T7 polymerase gene at some point during the process of making the cells competent, as only three out of the ten colonies analyzed did result in (a rather faint) amplification of the gene.
2 . Behavior of different Biobricks in sub-optimal conditions
We show below a summary of our Biobrick characterization program, in which we have subjected selected Biobrick-expressing strains to a range of environmental stresses. Our results clearly show that whereas UV light, pH variation and salt content do not significantly affect Biobrick expression, sub-optimal temperatures can in some cases decrease the Biobrick output. Anaerobic, vacuum culture resulted in a dramatic decrease of Biobrick 2 (RFP) activity.
Temperature Stress
37ºC and 200 rpm are the standard growth conditions of E.coli. Varying these conditions and measuring the growth after three hours, (O.D.600) as well as fluorescence (Biobrick output), was used to test the effect on Biobrick expression (all data are the average of at least three measurements; fluorescence values are normalized to OD600). We also built a model of the temperature stability of the constructions used in these experiments, and compared to the data. Interestingly, our model captures the shape of the temperature profile and predicts that additional variations at lower temperatures are independent of the chosen Biobrick.
Figure 9A: The strain XL1-Blue transformed with a Biobrick which encodes GFP (Biobrick 1, Bb1) was grown at different temperatures in a thermocycler for three hours, the cells were collected and O.D600 was measured. Fluorescence was also determined and compared to the non-transformed/wildtype or control strain. As the plot shows, Biobrick expression is affected by growth at different temperatures, fluorescence (normalized to O.D600) is higher around E.coli optimal growth temperature (37-41 ºC); over or below this rather short temperature range fluorescence decreases. The green line represents the theoretical prediction of our model, which                    captures the shape of the temperature profile. Click here to see our model.

Week 3: Digested all parts necessary for golden gate reaction of pp2551, several oddities with smaller pieces. Decided to move on to possibilities of gibson assembly of sensing assembly. Started working on Human Practices and Wiki in earnest.
July 24 - July 31, 2017
Week 4: Designed primers for overhangs of CP25, pp2551, and Venus for gibson assembly. Retried a golden gate reaction to assemble the pp2551 cassette plasmid, grew up, but did not seem to have any colonies with the correct insert (all colonies were red instead of white from the rfp dropout). Looked into a new backbone to clone the cassette assemblies into.
August 1- August 4, 2017
Week 1: Ordered primers for sequence verification and gibson assembly of cassette plasmid parts. Redid PCR reactions of parts (CP25,  evpp2551, venus, backbone) to add gibson overhangs). Decided to try using a new backbone with lacI gene. Digested and ran gels to check lengths of PCRed parts. All parts looked fine. Got in contact with Power for Parkinson’s
August 7 - August 11, 2017
Week 2: Did golden gate reactions for backbone (ColE + lacI). Ran a gibson reaction of parts (CP25, evpp2551, venus, backbone). Started looking into testing the promoter pddc  background. Visited and helped out at Power for Parkinson’s (Public Engagement)
August 21 - August 18, 2017
Week 3: Sent in the gibsoned multigene assembly and backbone (btk524) for sequencing. Transformed Venus cassette plasmid into BL21 DE3s. Sequencing did not work.

Introduction
Humans, as a species rely on energy greatly since the industrial revolution; whether it is for lighting, heating; or much              more advanced systems of contemporary life. Thus, it's fair to say that security in electric energy supply is essential to              us which made us rely heavily on fossil fuels (McDaniel et al., 2002).
Problem Statement
Typical energy sources of now; which are petroleum, coal and natural gas have proven to bring tremendous economic progress              where they are abundant (Abu-Rub et al., 2014). Worldwide primary energy consumption has grown by 1,8% in 2012 alone              (Abu-Rub et al., 2014). In the same year; coal, natural gas, and oil accounted for 87% of the global primary energy consumption              (Cusick, 2013). With this data, it’s fair to conclude that we are actually growing more dependent to fossil fuels by the day.
A dependency like this is very unhealthy; since such fuels' combustion produce plenty of air pollutants, which contribute to              greenhouse gas emissions, also the resources are very limited (Radovič, 2006; Frost, 2015). Furthermore, they cause a plethora              of political and socio-economical problems; which can reach catastrophic levels, even in regions prospering from them (Radovič, 2006).              They are like a poisonous band-aid to a larger problem.
Among fossil fuels, oil starts hurting us even before getting a chance to be used; when they are being transferred (Nikiforuk, 2016).              Oil spills happen more than one would think; just in 2016, 11 oil spills happened just near the lake in Saskatchewan (Suzuki, 2016).
Cleaning an oil spill comes at a hefty price; costs can snowball up to $21"

How can we connect the library with the industry?
Our alk-sensor has innumerable applications. But what should we do to change the experiment into product and other commercial products? By cooperating with the industries company, we started to take a fresh look at our project. For example, our genetic modified microorganism can be used in the solid to repair the contaminant solid, however, the important thing is how can we control the characteristic can be unchanged and how long can be the engineered bacteria live without the supplant food and compatible living environment. Profit is no wonder the most essential question we should consider. To minimize the cost without the influence of the effect is the next goal of our team. Of course, controllability can only be improved when completely understanding the process and its consequences.
With the help of our advisor, we try to think as an engineer and follow the purpose of IGEM treat all the parts of a microorganism as the mechanical parts. Being aware of the complexity of natural systems, we know there are quite a lot of things we should do in the future.

How can we connect the library with the industry?
Oil production of Dagang District in Tianjin has won its name in China. By communicating with engineers from PetroChina Dagang petrochemical company, we can work on turning our products into productive force, which will draw a perfect ending to our project. It will also leave some questions for future teams to answer, encouraging them to come up with better ideas.
We visited this company to get a better understanding of oil production. During the factory study tour, we communicated with engineers in the plant and found some environmental problems in the production. Then we introduced our project of producing alkanes in the bacterium E. coli, engineers put forth their suggestions to apply this project to large-scale production in the factory. This visit broadened our eyes and gave us practical knowledge, thus the significance of our project showed up more clearly.

In March 1951, I graduated from Nagasaki Pharmacy School, at the top of my class. The school was reorganized as the Department of Pharmacy, Nagasaki University. Professor Yasunaga offered me a job there as an assistant in the analytical chemistry laboratory for students, and I took it. When I had spare time, I continued the chromatography experiments I had started when I was a student. I became interested in classical music after I heard an LP record somewhere. However, one LP cost nearly a month of my salary. Somehow, probably with my parents' financial help, I managed to buy a record player and speakers, and I assembled an amplifier out of glass vacuum tubes, condensers and resistors.
Professor Yasunaga was a gentle and very kind person, trusted by people. After I had worked for him for four years, he obtained a leave of absence with pay for me, to study for one year. Moreover, he offered to introduce me to Professor Fujio Egami of Nagoya University, a well-known molecular biologist. We took the train to Nagoya, but unfortunately we found Professor Egami wasn't at the university that day. Professor Yasunaga visited another person, Professor Yoshimasa Hirata (Fig. 2, center), an organic chemist. We chatted a few minutes. As we were leaving, Professor Hirata said to me, ""Come to my lab. You may start at any time."" This was surprising, because we had just met. I didn't know much about molecular biology or organic chemistry, so it didn't matter to me which specialty I would study. I thought Professor Hirata's words might be the direction given by heaven, and I decided to go to his lab. It seems that this decision determined my future, directing me to the studies of bioluminescence, aequorin and green fluorescent protein (GFP).
The Hirata lab and Cypridina luciferin
I enrolled in the Hirata laboratory, Department of Science, Nagoya University, as a research student in April, 1955. The Hirata lab was a wonderful place with a splendid atmosphere. Nobody taught me anything, but I learned much by watching other people and by independent study.
On my first day, Professor Hirata brought out a large vacuum desiccator and said, ""This contains dried Cypridina."" He explained to me that Cypridina"

Figure 1: Fermentation of E. coli Rosetta-Gami 2 with <partinfo>BBa_K863012</partinfo> (TTHL) in a Bioengineering NFL22. Conditions: 6 L of autoinduction medium + 60 µg/mL chloramphenicol at 37 °C, pH 7. Agitation increased when pO2 was below 30 % and OD600 was measured each hour.
After measuring activity of TTHL we made a scale-up and cultivated E. coli Rosetta-Gami 2 expressing <partinfo>BBa_K863000</partinfo> in a Bioengineering NFL22 fermenter with a total volume of 6 L. Agitation speed, pO2 and OD600 were online monitored and are illustrated in Figure 1. No initial lag phase was noticeable. Due to the cell growth the pO2 decreased,breakdown of the control unit resulted in a drop to 0%. After a cultivation time of 9 hours the agitation speed was therefore increased manually up to 500 rpm, which resulted in a higher pO2 value of more than 100 % for the rest of the cultivation. During the whole process the OD600 increased slower compared to the fermentation of E. coli KRX expressing <partinfo>BBa_K863000</partinfo> or <partinfo>BBa_K863005</partinfo>. The maximal OD600 was reached after 19 hours cultivation time at which point the cells were harvested.
Purification of TTHL
The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in Ni-NTA-equilibrationbuffer , mechanically disrupted by high pressure homogenization and centrifuged. After preparing the cell paste the TTHL could not be purified with the 15 mL column, due to a not available column. For this reason a small scale purification (6 mL) of the supernatant of the homogenisation was made with a 1 mL Ni-NTA-column.

Welcome to iGEM Aachen 2016
Public Engagement
“Education is a common task of science and economy [...].”
Dr. Karsten Schürrle, DECHEMA
Establishing a dialogue with the public and getting them in contact with synthetic biology was something we feel is extremely important. Listed below, you can find in which ways attempted to spread the iGEM spirit.
Spreading the News
We wished to get in touch with as many people as possible. Hence, for presenting our work without us being physically there, we developed several ways to spread information about our project and the idea of synthetic biology.
Newsletter
From the beginning on, we received a lot of support from various sides and many people were interested in our project. That is why we thought of a way to inform them all at the same time about our progress and developed a monthly newsletter. It was sent to all of our supporters and everybody who opted in. With the newsletter, we intended to explain our project to people with and without the scientific background and therefore developed a short and an extended version. Writing it helped us reflecting about our work and also preparing for the wiki. We even received suggestions from experts who read about our main challenges in the newsletter.
Flyer Distribution
Our flyer was created in the beginning of our project to give interested supporters a short overview about our idea and to inform people about what we are doing throughout this year of participating in iGEM.
As iGEM is a great opportunity and experience for everybody - not only university students - and as we could not visit as many schools as we wished, we also sent an adapted version of the flyer with additional information about the competition to about 300 different schools.
Presenting iGEM and Our Project at Schools

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Description merge_-_-_TEXT.html," the native cellular biosensing processes discussed previously, such as protein or RNA binding, and use these interactions to induce transcription of a reporter gene, such as a fluorescent protein.
These sensors may be expressed as living whole-cell sensors, but are also increasingly being expressed in cell-free protein synthesis systems . However, thus far, the costs of these systems has been prohibitive to wide-spread use in synthetic biology (Smith et al., 2017).
Why are Biosensors Useful?
Click to learn more
One main advantage of synthetic biology based biosensors is their cost-effectiveness. After the research stages, production of the biosensor relies only on the maintenance of a population of cells expressing an engineered system, which is a relatively cheap process in comparison to other traditional methods such as immunoassays or mass spectrometry. Synthetic biology biosensors can be designed to have no dependence on additional equipment, which not only adds to their cost-effectiveness, but also enables onsite diagnostics (Bhatia & Chugh, 2013). Synthetic biology approaches also enable the introduction of more complex behaviour into biosensor designs, such as logic gates which allow for signal generation in response to a variety of simultaneous triggers (Chappel & Freemont, 2011).
One specific example of a biosensor is an arsenic biosensor, developed by Aleksic et al. (2007). This sensor was able to generate pH changes in response to the presence of arsenic in drinking water. In this system, ArsR, an arsenic responsive transcription factor, represses the pArs promoter in the absence of arsenic. When arsenic is present and bound to ArsR, the protein no longer binds and represses the promoter, enabling the transcription of downstream genes. In this example, the downstream gene is urease, which generates a detectable pH change. Therefore, the presence of arsenic can be detected by the monitoring of pH.
What Problems do Biosensor Developers Face?

The Sensynova Framework
Click to learn more
In this project, it is proposed that modularity, and therefore the ability to use parts “off-the-shelf” without further genetic engineering, could be improved by splitting components of biosensors into different cells which communicate to coordinate responses. The orthogonal quorum sensing systems Rhl and Las will be used as biological “wires”, linking different biosensor components together. This separation of components will enable the decoupling of non-specific components from specific detection systems. Using this approach, production of biosensor variants will not require subsequent engineering steps: cells containing desired components will simply be mixed together"

A more accurate model using Gillespie algorithm
To make the model more convincing, we use Gillespie algorithm, which is a kind of stochastic simulation algorithm to generate a statistically correct trajectory (possible solution) of a stochastic equation.
Summary of the steps to run the algorithm
“Step 0 (Initialization). Input the desired values for the M reaction constants c_1,. . ., c_Mand the N initial molecular population numbers X_1,. . ., X_M. Set the time variable t and the reaction counter n both to zero. Initialize the unit-interval uniform random number generator (URN). Step 1. Calculate and store the M quantities a_1 = h_1 c_1,, . , , a_M = h_M c_M for the current molecular population numbers, where h_v is that function of X_1,. . ., X_M defined in (1). Also calculate and store as a_0 the sum of the M a_v values. Step 2. Generate two random numbers r1 and r2 using the unit-interval uniform random number generator, and calculateτandμaccording to (2) and (3). Step 3. Using theτandμvalues obtained in step 2, increase t byτ, and adjust the molecular population levels to reflect the occurrence of one R_μ, reaction; e.g., if R_μ is the reaction in (4), then increase X_1 by 1 and decrease X_2 by 1. Then increase the reaction counter n by 1 and return to step 1. “(Danlel T. Gillespie, 1977, p. 2345)[7] We define for each reaction R_μ and h_μ according to the equations below.

After comparing the results, conclusion was that using the cryoprotector at concentration of 100mM is the best solution.
Comparison and conclusion
Hanahan protocol (described in the article “Process for producing freeze-dried competent cells and use thereof in cloning”) was also compared with the one using sucrose at 100mM.
Figure 4: On the left – transformation with bacteria freeze-dried following the Hanahan protocol. On the right – transformation with bacteria freeze-dried following the protocol using sucrose previously described
Results of the two transformations lead to the conclusion that the protocol using sucrose as cryoprotector agent is more effective (more colonies were obtained). This is the reason why this protocol was chosen.

Team Substrate Analysis:
TVEL0 and BPUL were able to degrade 100 % of estradiol and 100 % of ethinyl estradiol. To get comparable results, the reaction temperature was lowered to 20 °C again, to have a closer look, where differences are apparent. Again TVEL0 and BPUL degraded 100 % of the substrates. But before the laccase stocks deplete, first ECOL, BHAL and TTHL should be tested.
Did substrate degradation analysis with ECOL without ABTS. Experimental setup: 1 µg substrate, 0.1 mM ABTS, 110 µL BR-buffer and 0.6 µg laccase in 200 µL reaction volume. Measured at t-0 and after 3 hours.
Sunday October 21st
Team Fungal and Plant Laccases:
Genomic isolation was done with the Promega Wizard genomic DNA purification system kit of our approximately 50 yeast clones with integrated (a) GFP and (b) tvel5.
Team Activity Tests:
Today was BHAL's and TTHL's turn. The experiment setup was the same as described the day before. But again we could not make sure, that 5 mM ABTS is the substrate saturation for our tested laccases. We are now sure to go higher in ABTS concentrations.
Activity assay of our new BHAL laccase with different ABTS concentration to find the substrate saturation of BHAL. 616 ng ECOL laccase (incubated with 0.4 mM CuCl2 and 20 % Britton-Robinson buffer pH 5) were applied.
Activity assay of our new TTHL laccase with different ABTS concentration to find the substrate saturation of TTHL. 616 ng TTHL laccase (incubated with 0.4 mM CuCl2 and 20 % Britton-Robinson buffer pH 5) were applied.

UNOTT,2017,Team:UNOTT#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," their fluorescence intensity is very comparable at all stages of growth. It is worth noting that measurements were taken at 0 and 1 hours in figure 2, and these showed minimal fluorescent intensity, suggesting that further optimisation needs to occur to achieve 0-1 hour readings. For details on the revival protocol, download here.
For future research, this process could be optimised to produce even more reproducible results and yield a more robust identification process. Distinct 0 hour expression levels might also be possible, greatly increasing the potential of Key. coli becoming a common security system. Multiple reporters should be the next focus to strengthen the security of the key. All reporters will need to be tested for their stability and reproducibility.
Figure 3: Testing the affect of storage time at various storage temperatures (Room temperature, 4°C and -80°C) on the fluorescence of revived cells expressing strong or weak RFP expression
STEP 6: CRISPRi & gRNA Efficiency
Why
In our experiment, the production of differentially identifiable expression patterns is paramount. A library of promoters with robust expression patterns was generated to achieve this (step 3 to 5). To further modulate the expression patterns, a promoter targeted short guide RNA (sgRNA)-dcas9 repression system was devised. Using such a system will add a third expression level to the already existing ON and OFF states of our system, expanding the options further.
The sgRNAs have a 20bp ‘SEED’ region homologous to the promoters (used in step 3) between the -10 and -35 box, which will form a complex with a deactivated Cas9. The complex will be directed to the  promoter through the homology between promoter sequence and the sgRNA. Binding of this very big RNA-protein complex to the promoter sequence will inhibit recognition and binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter region due to allosteric hindrance. The strength of inhibition is related to the binding affinity of the complex to the target DNA. Ideally, each promoter will have its own unique sgRNA which only inhibits the intended promoter to prevent cross interference.
How
To exemplify that the presence of a repression system would allow an increase in possible key outputs so we decided to start with a simple proof of function experiment. Therefore, we decided to go for a two plasmid based system.
One low copy vector was used to express both the catalytically inactive Cas9 protein and the RFP reporter, fused to any of the five promoters previously tested in step 3. Using a low-copy plasmid for the expression of"
Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," (OmpA), the mercury metal binding peptide will be translocated and displayed on the surface of bacteria. In our design, I conducted this experiment.
Ying Sheng
My work mainly focuses on the characterization of merOP. The response curve of merOP was characterized in Ecoli strains possessing different genetic component combinations to figure out the affects of different module to merOP and finally contributed to the rational design of the bioreporter.
Yang Hu
For the bench work, I was responsible for the construction of mercury metal binding peptide cytosol expression module and T7 promoter drove MerR generation module. I also helped to conduct western blotting assay.On the other hand, I take charge of the work of Human Practice concerning about the potential problems of horizontal gene transfer.
Donghai Liang
Being responsible for the periplasmic module of the bioabsorbent display, I successfully completed the construction of DsbA-MBP and DsbA-MerR (serving as a control). At the same time, the standardization of the module mentioned above is also completed. Besides, I participate in the TF-DNA binding affinity characterization of the mercury promoter.
Yiwei Chen
I expanded the MerR protein engineering strategy to lead-responsive regulator, PbrR. Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) was fused with Pb binding peptide at its C-terminal via the same method in mercury binding peptide construction. I also participated the construction of mercury absorption facilitation module and inductive aggregation module.
Ao Liu
I Conducted mutagenesis library for Mer OP and research on the feature of promoter functional sites through screening the library (characterizging promoters with different dyad MerR binding site). Then promoters with different Hg binding affinity was integrated with the results gained from operation analysis to acquire the wider range of bioreproter Hg-sensitivity.
Boxuan Zhao
My work is merging OmpA and anchor protein Lpp with metal binding domain of MerR to accomplish the goal of surface display. Additionally, I participate the functional testing of whole-cell bioabsorbents. By recognizing the homologous regions among them, I designed the metal binding domain complex for four different MerR family proteins, which can be used to verify the reasonableness of our project design.
Qianzhu Wu
To characterize the regulating role of MerR on PmerT, promoters from parts-registry constutitive promoter library with different strength were prefixed before MerR coding sequence to exogenously maintain MerR expression at different intensity. GFP expression response to mercury concentrations was measured by microplate reader.

Basic Parts
FOR ANTIDOTE
MSMEG_5998 ( BBa_K2382001 )
This is an enzyme that could degrade aflatoxin with the aid of coenzyme F420, also called Australian MSMEG_5998 in our project. It belongs to the F420H2-dependent reductases family from Mycobacterium Smegmatis.
F420-Dependent Glucose-6- phosphate Dehydrogenase ( BBa_K2382002 )
The working condition of MSMEG_5998 includes the help from coenzyme F420. F420-dependent glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (FGD) is the enzyme that reduces the F420 being used by MSMEG_5998 and make it available again.
T7 promoter & Lac operator and RBS from PET-29a ( BBa_K2382003 )
This part originated from pET-29 a (+) Vectors, and it is composed of T7 promoter, Lac operator, and RBS.
Thioredoxin with polylinker( BBa_K2382004 )
This part previously functioned as a DNA recombination and repair protein in E. coli. It is also found that Thioredoxin is capable of increasing enzyme activity of our protein, MSMEG5998. We designed a polylinker that has multiple restriction cutting sites at the end of this part for future iGEM teams who want to make their protein more effective.
Thioredoxin-MSMEG_5998 fusion protein ( BBa_K2382009 )

After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

Communication activities
Introduction video to GFP protein and awards
This August, Institute of Physics Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing Association for Science and Technology etc organization held a “3 minutes for science” activity, aiming to collect videos which introduce scientific phenomenon to the public. Our team members made a video to introduce GFP protein and relative knowledge, won the special award and had our video broadcast in the Scientific Carnival in Beijing Olympic Parks.

Parts Submitted to the Registry
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts on the Registry than on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
When should you put parts into the Registry?
As soon as possible! We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better recall you will have of all details surrounding your parts. Remember you don't need to send us the DNA to create an entry for a part on the Registry. However, you must send us the sample/DNA before the Jamboree. Only parts for which you have sent us samples/DNA are eligible for awards and medal requirements.
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)

Human Practices
iGEM’s parts registry is the only current database that holds information     and DNA for over 3000 standard parts for the use of synthetic biology     community. BioGUIDE is the first designed software that organizes the     parts in iGEM spring 2010 distribution as possible atomics parts to     build new biological device and systems for specific input and outputs     based on graph theory. We are the first group who has applied a novel     algorithm to search for input/output relations between the parts to     reveal possible construct assemblies. This new approach will chance     how the parts registry is used by the scientific community. And the     availability of software implementing our algorithm with a very user     friendly graphical user interface will allow all the users of the parts     registry to explore new and novel constructs according to their parameter     with ease. Additionally as the BioGUIDE software is an open source ware     , any user can contribute to the development of the application. So,     BioGUIDE will be improving with a collaborative effort, which will make     it even more widely used among the synthetic biologists.
We also had many collabrations with the teams such as, INSA-Lyon,     Lethbridge, WashU through our survey and WARSAW as we have participated     in their survey"

This system is well suited for the diversification of initial binding proteins derived from our library. This mutagenesis system was functionally characterized by various reversion experiments . Precise mutation rate and mutation types were analyzed via high-throuput sequencing . In contrast to genome-wide mutation system, our system is especially useful to future iGEM projects to apply mutagenesis of BioBricks within the standard plasmid.
Selection system
Finally, we used a bacterial two hybrid system to give cells with fitting binding proteins to the target protein an advantage in growth by developing an antibiotic resistance. Functionality of this system was demonstrated by several experiments, ranging expression controls over binding controls to interaction controls and in vivo tests. In summary, we provide a functional bacterial two hybrid system for other iGEM teams to work with.
In a nutshell, we provide evidence that all devices of our project work as expected . Moreover, we made it iteratively even better by modeling our system, integrating experts and public reviews . Industry scale applicability was indicated by continuous fermentation experiments and a business plan .
In particular, we reached all of our milestones: (1) We designed and created two functional libraries with high diversities, (2) we assembled a working system for plasmid-targeted mutagenesis and (3) we implemented a functional bacterial two hybrid selection system."

ProtoCat 3.0 - Project Description
Background
Two years ago the Michigan Software 2014 team began development of ProtoCat 1.0. Like many innovative ideas, ProtoCat began because of a problem. Studies have estimated that only 10-25% of published scientific results are reproducible.  A 2014 survey conducted by the Michigan Software team confirmed that the repeatability problem exists in synthetic biology, with every scientist surveyed reporting prior struggles with replicating protocols. The majority of these scientists indicated unclear language and missing steps are the greatest contributors to the irreproducibility of synthetic biology protocols. A second study conducted by last year's Michigan Software team only further confirmed the sentiments of the first study. These issues are what ProtoCat has been designed to solve.
Solution
Every respondent of the second survey indicated that they would use a database to browse and download protocols, with over 85% indicating that they would upload and maintain their own protocols if such a site existed. ProtoCat 3.0 is a free database of crowd sourced protocols designed to make existing protocols more repeatable and enable more accurate computational models of biological systems. We believe this can most efficiently be accomplished with a commitment to open source protocols and a broader more active community of digital troubleshooters. ProtoCat 3.0 works to establish such a community by giving anyone with an internet connection or smartphone access to a repository of synthetic biology protocols collected from all over the world. Additionally, ProtoCat 3.0 encourages the development of higher quality, more repeatable protocols by allowing users to document, rate, review, and edit existing methods.
What's new in ProtoCat 3.0?
ProtoCat 3.0 is a complete re-imagining of the ProtoCat software that has been in development for the last two years. By making dramatic changes to how we store protocols, we have been able to add new features that would have been impossible before. These features include variable reagent calculations, allowing users to scale the amounts in a protocol to their liking, and timers on a per-step basis. We have also made it possible to link to specific reagents so that users can immediately learn more about the reagents used in the protocol. Another benefit to the new protocol model is that the user is able to upload fully customized steps and, unlike in previous versions of ProtoCat, add warnings"

Model II
Competition model
Raising different adapted E. coli cultures together in one flask, one can observe that they compete for the limited space and nutrients. To determine how much better one E. coli culture must be adapted in comparison to its rivals and how long our system takes to produce a winner E. coli culture, we decided to model the competitive behavior.
The growth behavior of one E. coli culture can be modeled with a logistic growth function (Bacaër 2011):
were x stands for the population [OD], r for the reproduction rate [h-1] and C for the maximal capacity [OD].
For different adapted E. coli cultures equation (15) must be modified to:
where x1,...,xn stands for the different adapted E. colis and r1,...,rn for the different reproduction rates of the different adapted E. colis.
The growth behavior of one adapted E. coli culture depends on its specific reproduction (r1,..,rn) rate. But one adapted E. coli culture can only reach the maximal capacity C. Thus, the change in growth also depends on the amount of free capacity ((C-(x1+...+xn))/C).

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

Cindy HAMMAMOUCHE
The woman at a hundred degrees! After two years of hard preparation to the competition of engineering schools, she spent a year preparing a diploma as dietician-nutritionist in which the inactivity displeased her. So she raced to the laboratory, with permanent activity where she could run after the enzymes and equipment! So she goes into a company of more than 2000 m2 of pharmaceutical bottles. Cindy is a perfect Igemer !! She is verry joyfull , dynamic and funny girl . She was our first cool wiki teacher and She Was verry helpfull During the lab work . Her Enthusiasm , her good mood and her efficiency will allow to our team to advence in our project .
Mathieu HUBERT
After obtaining his scientific high-school diploma, he did a Biotec degree in Bioanalysis and Controls where he acquired several laboratory competencies. He wanted to dive into scientific research, and he flew to study in Paris in order to do training in biomedical research. Second of the class, his passion for virology grew and he integrated UPMC Master Molecular and Cellular Biology. He did the Master 2 Fundamental Virology of Institut Pasteur, where his knowledge about virology increased exponentially. Second of the class, he obtained a grant to fund his virology doctorate during the next 3 years. Mathieu is a person who seems very calm at first sight, but when you know him well, he is a very funny guy and we spend very pleasant time in his company. Between each laboratory experiment he doesn't hesitate to make jokes to lighten the mood. He just validated his master in virology brilliantly and he is very good at what he does. We can say without a doubt that he is of a great help in the lab and in the scientific design of our project.
Lise HUNAULT
After her high-school diploma mention Science in Labruyere school in Versaille. She spent 3 years in prep school in Henri IV. And now, she is in the second year of engineering school at ESPCI. Lise is one of our team member, from ESPCI, where she is studying physics and chemistry. She is also involved in her school association, with which she loves doing parties and playing volleyball! Above everything else, Lise is a really funny girl, who has a great sense of humour, who knows when to be serious, and who always bring happiness in the group.

Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," where the odors are coming out most strongly. So you can benefit from the odors that are naturally coming out of someone’s home and then lure them with a little bit extra with your stronger lactate or CO2 whatever that is being produced and then kill them before they actually kill a person. Quite a cool idea.
iGEM Hamburg: That sounds very promising.
Dr. Hammond: And as a general piece of advice I would try to stick clear of including to many attractants and killing components. I would keep it minimum because it is much easier to keep your construct stable and ensure that your bacteria maintain the different components and it is all working. If you can test them separately and find this is the best attract component out of the five we have tested. And it might not be necessarily the same as the best that has been shown in publications because your bacteria might to be able to produce so much of each one. And at the concentration you are producing it might turn out that the one that is usually less good is better in your specific case. So I would pick one good attractant and I would pick one good killing component or perhaps two good killing components. Keep it nice and simple.
iGEM Hamburg: We have a last question. You are introducing some kind of genetic modification into another country, maybe a poorer country where people are not that educated. You have talked about it at the ESCH and I thought it is very interesting but maybe just for the interview: You are basically introducing something new into another country and need the allowance. Does the population know what you are doing? Does the population need to agree on what you are doing to “their” nature? Sorry for the provoking question.
Dr. Hammond: There are a few levels of the question. One part of it is it is not going to be “us” as our lab and our project that is actually going to run this. This is going to be in the hands of African scientists and African countries that are going to come together and really do this on themselves. [...] We are really hoping we are going to develop the technology, we are going to develop the mosquitoes, and we are going to try and show that they are safe and efficacious and provide recommendations of how to use it. But really this needs to be in the hands of the people how are suffering from this disease. So actually a lot of people on this project are African scientists. They have been on this project for a long time so they actually know very well how the technology works and very well how she will be implemented and they are actually the ones who are telling us how to"

TJU_China,2018,Team:TJU China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," the targeted delivery of sgRNA/Cas9 complex into cells, we make use of BODIPY, a kind of fluorescent             dyes, to combine with sgRNA/Cas9 complex (RNP) and to deliver them into cells, since BODIPY can target nucleus             itself[1] and can be observed as near-infrared (NIR) dye. Firstly, we constructed the template of sgRNA and completed             the in vitro transcription of sgRNA using T7 promoter. We also expressed and purified Cas9 protein, and then             we successfully tested the cleavage activity of sgRNA/Cas9 complex on plasmid. Then we combined BODIPY with sgRNA/Cas9             (BODIPY/RNP) and proved that our new complex had high in vitro cleavage efficiency. So we proceeded to the delivery             of BODIPY/RNP into cells and found that BODIPY/RNP had better gene editing efficiency than RNP only and Liposome/RNP             complex. After we succeeded in targeting nucleus, we tried to target not only nucleus but also mitochondrion.             The plasmid we used was the pET-NLS-Cas9-6xHis plasmid, digested with Xba1 and Nhe1. In order to target mitochondria,             we need to replace the NLS leader sequence on the plasmid with MTS (mitochondrial targeting sequence). We selected             three MTS sequences, COX8a, SOD2 and ATP5. Since the MTS fragment is small and there is no suitable restriction             site at both ends, we synthesized the MTS and the previous fragment. By annealing the two primers and then connecting             the preceding fragment to the segment of Cas9 by overlap, we get the entire fragment. We then digest it withXba1             and Nhe1 and connect it with the vector.
