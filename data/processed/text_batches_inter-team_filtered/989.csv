Stanford,2009,Team:Stanford#ProjectPage_-_-_TEXT.html," that the induction chemical paraquat, which can be toxic to E. coli cells at large concentrations, begins to have a negative effect on the cells at higher concentrations.  Specifically, it seems that at 80uM concentration of paraquat, there is a marked decrease in growth rate with time.  This is shown by the OD levels, which seem to begin stabilizing around an OD600 of 1.1 three hours after induction.
While growth inhibition seems to occur at 60 and 80 uM concentrations of paraquat, the overall stability of the low copy system and its ability to sense a large range of inducer concentrations over a long period of time suggests that it is ideal sensor system for our anti-inflammatory device.  In particular, by virtue of the low copy system's ability to induce GFP production over a longer time and larger range range of concentrations, we would like to use it in the diagnosis and treatment of stable post-operative Crohn's patients who need long-term, stable retinoic acid therapy.
High Copy SoxR/SoxS Sensor
Fig 2.3 High Copy SoxR/SoxS Data for concentrations of 5, 10, 20, and 30 uM of inducer
The SoxR/SoxS sensor was similarly tested on a high copy vector. Both of these assays lead to our characterization of this system with respect to its production of downstream GFP through induction by superoxide stress (in this case paraquat). As shown by the graphs, our results from the high copy varied sufficiently from the low copy vector. In the case of the high copy, one should first note that there is a greater growth inhibition occurring at lower inducer concentrations. As compared to the low copy in which growth inhibition seems to occur at 60 and 80 uM, the high copy showed growth inhibition occurring around 30uM. The second factor to take note of is the greater standard deviation occurring in the OD levels. Both of these factors are most likely due to the nature of the high copy vector itself. Since the cells are more metabolically active and have a higher rate division, they are under greater stress. When coupled to the stress of the inducer, this leads to larger growth inhibition and discrepancies in the OD with varying inducer concentrations.
The differences between the high and low copy results allow us to tailor our device to meet individual patient needs. The high copy vector will have the greatest application in treating high risk, post-operative patients of Crohn's Disease. In this stage of the disease, the patient's will require a burst of high dosage retinoic acid"
UoA_NewZealand,2016,Team:UoA NewZealand#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," The team showed absolute dedication and passion on both the lab and human practise. Finding that both teams shared the same vision of bringing positivity into our communities by utilising our bioengineering knowledge, it was not hard at all to fit into this passionate team. The team leaders showed us around their lab area and kindly shared their detailed and well planned perspective on their human practice project which most definitely broaden our horizon as a start-up team on how extensively an iGEM can affect and influence the community. We exchanged with them our experience as a start-up team on what challenge we faced just to get the team together as we are all interested to know what would be the different kind of administrative barriers from a team that have a developed system and a newly set-up. We concluded that the main difference would be the focus that shifted from the system development of the sub-teams and relationship building with the University to inter-team communication and interaction within team members. This is discovery will assist with both teams sustainability in iGEM competition in the future to come.
Sydney University Team
In true ANZAC spirit, iGEM UoA collaborated with the iGEM team from the University of Sydney. An initial introductory skype session allowed us to meet, give one another a run down on our respective projects, and to figure out how we might be able to assist each other.
We found that the best way the UoA iGEM team could help the Sydney team would be to liaise with large New Zealand horticulture companies on their behalf. This was done, and a relationship was established with Turner’s and Grower’s NZ who were able to provide the team from Sydney with valuable information regarding the influence of fruit ripening on the produce storage and transportation industry.
Members of iGEM UoA were also able to fill out a survey provided by the iGEM Sydney, and distribute this survey to other people in order to assist them in their data collection.
To help us at iGEM UoA, the team at the University of Sydney provided their laboratory protocols for His-Tag purification and IPTG Induction. These proved useful as resources in iGEM UoA’s own experimental design. Our Sydney colleagues also liaise with Australian Waste Management Firms on our behalf.

Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," our team has applied speculative design into our integrated human practices. In contrast to science, which aims to describe how things are, the purpose of speculative design is to show how things could be. This can help us to discover how we think things should be and what actions to take to reach this future. Speculative design aims to provoke thought and discussion by postulating a future situation or society in which the subject matter is portrayed. This could be in the form of stories or simple descriptions of how life is in relation to the discussed subject. It could be how transportation is envisioned, how society is organised or, as in our case, how synthetic biology is applied and how it has affected the world.
Since the future consequences of new technologies may be difficult to imagine and even harder to predict accurately, the stories are intentionally fictional. The reason for this is to remove the restrictions one commonly places on imagination when trying to come up with “realistic” ideas. This problem does not arise when it comes to fiction since these restrictions are lifted when you know the story is not real. What may seem “unrealistic” today can often be commonplace tomorrow, fiction can help us embrace unconventional ideas. The purpose of speculative design is therefore to liberate our creativity and open our minds to what might seem impossible.
Consider the idea: If all industrial production of chemicals across the world is based on biosynthesis, what could the world look like in 50 or 100 years? Below, three short stories are presented, inspired by our own project idea.
Some areas that are worth considering when discussing the future of synthetic biology are: Safety, regulation(law), education and general ethical aspects.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

3)Being sensitive to common antibiotics helps to clear the bacteria from organisms with antibiotics to interrupt the treatment.
4)As anaerobic bacteria, Salmonella can survive in both hypoxia and necrotic areas of tumors to accumulate selectively in tumor microenvironment.
5)With a distinct genetic background, the bacteria can be easily genetic engineered and attenuated.
6)The experiments can be conveniently operated with oral administration.
7)Salmonella administrated orally can reach the solid tumors.  With distant injection, the bacteria can target different tumors, and even track transferred tumor cells.
8)The bacteria can express effect genes, therefore express various therapeutic proteins, taking part in the combination therapy of enzyme prodrugs.
9)With low expenses, the bacteria can be applied in long-term treatments.
To date, there are a number of avirulent salmonella which have been typically impaired biosynthesis of aromatic compounds, purines or amino acids in the tumor therapy.  They are used either to directly kill cancer cells or to deliver the expressed therapeutic proteins to tumor in the mouse models.  For example, strain A1 and its derivative A1-R which has defects in leucine-arginine target a metastases model. Defects in guanosine5'-diphosphate-3'-diphosphate synthesizing an attenuated salmonella which is an effective vector against CT-26 tumors and metastasis.  A defect in the aroA gene gives rise to SL7207 which has been used by several groups. VNP20009 which has defects in msbB and purI exhibited antitumor effects and has been used in the clinical trials.  (Modification at the purI genes increases dependence on adenine and disruption in the msbB gene alters lipid A and greatly diminishes the potential to induce TNF-α and cause septic shock.)
As for the mechanism to guide the bacteria accumulation in tumor, we think various nutritional environments in a tumor may compensate the metabolic defects in these bacteria, thereby allowing effective growth in a tumor.
4 Promoter
In animal models, attenuated Salmonella prefer to colonize solid tumors.  The concentration of bacteria in solid tumors is 1000 times of that of normal tissues, causing cancer tissues to shrink, even cure cancer.  In fact, people used bacteria therapy to cure cancer from a long time ago (over 150 years).  However, due to uncontrollable toxic effects to normal tissues, this method has been disregarded for"
BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," syringe A is open and control syringe B is closed while direction to waste occurs when control syringe A is closed and control syringe B is open. When dispensing into a well, the output specified by the user is selected and all other outputs are directed to waste. Once the dispensing is completed all outputs are directed to waste while the XY Plane moves to the next well; this process is repeated until all wells specified by the user have been hit.
Controlling the XY-Plane
The XY Plane software is responsible for taking the well coordinates given by the user and moving the the plate to each coordinate during dispensing. The software snake loops through all the wells, going through row by row, on the vessel and compares each to the coordinate array given by the user. If there is a match between the a well on the vessel and a well in the coordinate array, XY Plane moves to that well to dispense. This process continues until the software has hit all the wells in the coordinate array.
To accomplish we needed to calculate the number of steps between wells to program the stepper motors. Given either a 24, 96, or 384 well plate, we calculated the steps between wells for each plate by using the distance between wells and the circumference of the pulleys.
In addition to moving the well plate for dispensing, the XY Plane software is also responsible for homing TERRA. Before a run on TERRA, the system needs to be homed in order to start from a known location. The system is homed by moving the well plate so that left-most corner is under the nozzle. Because the well plate can be in any location on the XY Plane, contact switches are used on both the X and Y paths send a signal to to halt the stepper motors once they’ve reached either end.

Pilot Study Questionnaire
Introduction
What do people think about iGEM? Or synthetic biology? And what if we mention GMOs? In order to enthuse others for iGEM, without scaring them of genetic manipulation, we have to assess the public opinion on synthetic biology. To this end, we performed a survey that would pose questions about the various aspects of this research area, including: medical, agricultural and sustainable fuel applications.
Proper study design requires us to first evaluate the effectiveness of our survey in answering our research question on a small group: a pilot study. Therefore, we handed out our survey at the Museumnacht, about which you can read more here: Museumnacht
Results
In the pilot study, we found that opinions on synthetic biology depend on the intended application. While most people strongly support the use of synthetic biology for medical and biofuel applications, opinions on its use in agriculture were more varied. Nevertheless, the practical examples of applications were all received positively by most interviewees.
Our pilot also showed a trend towards a slightly more positive view on synthetic biology by male interviewees. No trend was observed for different age groups or level of education. However, the number of observations in the pilot study was small (n=22), so perhaps the actual survey"

Nevertheless the graph decreases still over time and the polymerase seem to be active even after 500 min of the reaction. The Sp6 shows activity as well.

Establishment of Titration Curves for Quantification of the in vitro Transcription
Fig. 13. Calculation of RNA yields in real time using the Spinach/Malachite Green system.
A
Malachite Green Aptamer RNA was titrated to different concentrations (10 µM, 7.5 µM, 5 µM, 2.5 µM, 1 µM, 0.5 µM and 0 µM of RNA) and the fluorescence determined using a multiwell-plate reader. A calibration curve was calculated and applied to quantify RNA yields in real time.
B
As an example we calculated the RNA amount of the different transcriptions in presence of different DNA template concentrations (0-2.5 nM). As expected best RNA yields were determined in presence of the highest DNA template concentration.
The quantification of fluorescence is necessary to estimate the total amount of RNA synthetized in the in vitro transcription. For this purpose we transcribed the Malachite Green Aptamer and purified it by denaturing PAGE. Finally Malachite Green Aptamer RNA was titrated to different concentrations (10 µM, 7.5 µM, 5 µM, 2.5 µM, 1 µM, 0.5 µM and 0 µM of RNA) and the fluorescence determined using a multiwell-plate reader in presence of the dye and all other transcription components (Fig. 13). We were able to obtain a calibration curve (Fig. 13A) with a correlation coefficient of 0.99 which enables us to calculate the final RNA yields of different in vitro transcription reactions (Fig. 13B). As an example we calculated the RNA amount of the different transcriptions in presence of different DNA template concentrations. As expected best RNA yields were determined in presence of the highest DNA template concentration.

We were going to carry out a B.Subtilis test transformation but as we are not in the lab tommorow we decided to do it next week.
In the mean time, as Neil asked us to dig out last year's Dr.Jan-Willem Veening's plasmid, we searched in the TPA database to try to find these strain.
We found the strain we needed but we were not sure that it was the right one, so we e-mailed Neil about it.
The strain we found was : 2387/ delta amyE::pJWV113/B.subtilis 168
Neil confirmed that it was the one we need, so we decided to plate those out on 3 different plates.
We got the needed strain out of the -86 freezer and as we didn't know about the antibiotic resistance of the strain, we plated them out on:
LB + Amp
LB + Kan
LB + Tet
We stored these plates in the 37 degree incubator and asked the Stochastic Switch team to move them to the 4 degree fridge tommorrow morning

We conducted measurements of the salt uptake capabilities of different mutants by inoculating a diluted pre-culture in growth medium containing 0.6 M of NaCl.          The mutants which showed high ion uptake did not show significant growth. In application, a preculture has to be inoculated separately before desalinization of wastewater,          which means another installation for breeding the preculture has to be built. Nevertheless, the yeast is a self- renewing desalination method, which has low maintenance costs.          In comparison to the maintenance-intensive reverse osmosis, this depicts another advantage.
The relative cell mass over time measured by a growth profiler 960 (EnzyScreen) in 0,6 M NaCl YPDGal.
A specific nutrition-plan is important to check if by-products of industrial processes could be reused or external sugar must be bought from food industry. The cooperation with          Sitech has shown that industrial wastewater treatment plants buy cheap sugar from food industry to feed their bacterial mix and do not assume it to be a big cost factor.          (Link: NL) Use of a C-source which is by-product of a corresponding industrial process is an optimal solution to confirm the general trend of industries towards a recycling          economy.
In conventional plants the bacterial sludge is drained and fouled in fouling towers over weeks. There, methane is produced, which can be transferred into electrical energy.            A wastewater treatment plant like the one in Düren, Germany, is capable of producing up to 60% of their energy household with fouling. (See Sewage Treatment plant)
Yeast is an optimal nutrient for these bacteria. Cases in wastewater treatment plants in Germany have shown that yeast added to the fouling tower significantly enhanced the            energy production. We take advantage of the high nutritional value of Salt Vaults to enhance energy production. Substances like H2S disturb the gas production of bacteria, NaCl or heavy metals on the other side do not have impact on the fouling. These effects support our application for enhanced energy production. However, with our vision of microbial supercollectors for various kinds of pollutants, the possibility of fouling should be discussed for every specific kind of pollutant.
Most wastewater treatment plants, like the one in Aachen (Link: IHP sewage treatment plant), have traces of heavy metals in their fouling sludge, therefore the sludge is burned after          fouling. Industrial plants, like the one at the Chemelot Industrial Site in the Netherlands (Link: sewage treatment"
MIT,2013,Team:MIT#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html,", we are slated to assemble and deliver our first prototype kit for feedback from users in the Synthetic Biology Center in mid-November of this year.
Collaboration within the Academic and iGEM Community
In ambitious research projects, an extreme amount of collaboration must occur between far-flung research labs. This year, we had the opportunity to encounter several key research experiences during our project. The first was securing sequence and physical DNA in published literature from the originating lab. For multiple constructs, the lab’s principle investigators did not respond to DNA requests and made it very difficult for us to tackle our project. Thankfully, we were able to reverse engineer some constructs from existing literature methods sections as well as find suitable replacements from commercial or other academic sources. Speaking to researchers within the Synthetic Biology Center at MIT, this lapse in communication appears to be chronic in academia and illustrated to us the importance of standardized DNA repositories. For iGEM, the registry’s inclusion of both working and planning parts are instrumental in being able to push iGEM projects forward while other common repositories such as AddGene or NCBI GenBank serve the same purpose for the larger scientific community. The second challenge we faced was being ‘scooped’ this summer by a larger research lab on an idea we had conceived as part of our iGEM project. Throughout the course of the summer, we had elected to investigate the Cas9-CRISPR system’s use as a communicating message in exosomes and built a transcriptional activating version of Cas9, Cas9-VP16 https://2013.igem.org/Team:MIT/Cas9-VP16. However, several weeks into our iGEM project as we were testing our Cas9-VP16, a manuscript was published that effectively scooped our project with the protein Cas9-VP64, a transcriptional activator of similar design to our proposed construct http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n9/full/nbt.2675.html. Thankfully, we were able to utilize the work in the manuscript to better our design but it was still an eye-opening experience that in future research endeavors we need to be aware about.
Finally, we worked to help our fellow Boston area teams in two avenues. In the first, we worked with Wellesley on testing their software programs to provide valuable feedback from an experimental background on their tools to help experimentalists https://2013.igem.org/Team:Wellesley_Desyne/Human_Practices. We also took them on tours of our facilities to enable them to get an understanding of our workflow from design -> data to allow"
Fudan_China,2017,Team:Fudan China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,", we have also gained a lot.
Currently, the type of substances that can be monitored in a working fermentation tank is limited to simple molecules like oxygen and carbon dioxide. The dynamic monitoring of more complicated compound like the target protein and its intermediate product is not available in most cases. That may be a problem our memory device can solve.
The infection of different bacteria in the fermentation tank can be a serious problem. If we want to monitor the substance directly inside the fermentation tank, special attention must be paid to control the spread of the engineered E. coli. A suicide gene triggered by condensed bacteria population may be a good choice
Applications in daily life
What can a tiny sequential memory machine do in our daily life? That is also a question we are interested in. So, we advertised on our Wechat platform to collect ideas from the public. We got about three hundred clicks in a couple of hours.
The gif file on the left is the short video of the paper model we used to explain our circuit to the public. We posted the short video in our Wechat article.
We got ideas like ‘building a memo in sequential order, so that things can be done properly’. The ideas are quite crazy and may not be fulfilled by our project, but we do see an affection for an easy check of all the collected data via cellphone apps. If we want to popularize our memory device among the public, trying to digitalize the result can be a good start.
Conversations
At the same time, we are also involved in lively conversations both within the iGEM community and the more diverse world beyond
At the school club fair
The club fair of our university is very famous for its diversity and its large scale. To get more new ideas about our work from people with different majors, we brought our project to the club fair. One of our team members dressed up as a cute E. coli to interact with visitors.The conversations were far more thought-provoking than we had expected. Not only did we receive admiration for  delivering a new way to look at biology research, we also received challenges and questions for the attempt to ‘play the role of god’. The questions made us think more critically about our work and it remind us never to take it for granted that life is there to be programmed. At the end of the activity, we all gained a lot. We also recruited about 20 candidates for the iGEM team next year and have a lot more people to visit our Wechat platform.

1.HUST-Cheering Meeting
We always wanted to have a chance to communicate with iGEMers from other teams. During July 7th. – July 9th. , we attended a HUST-Cheering meeting in Wuhan. We were glad to have an opportunity to change our thinking about iGEM with other brilliant iGEMers in China.
The HUST-China team gave an excellent presentation. Their project focused on a new type of biological filter. They designed two ingenious plasmids that can work in prokaryote and eukaryon. This excellent team is also the sponsor of the meeting. They also held many other meetings to introduce the ideas of iGEM.
NCTU-iGEM team talked about a new protein they produced. They named it Pantide and it could be used as an alternative option as an insecticide by decreasing the efficacy of ion channels in lepidopterous larvae. Their presentation was really flawless, and they also talked about two biobricks they made.
NJU-iGEM team mainly introduced a plasmid that could produce hydrogen in prokaryote. The team members were very experienced researchers and we consulted a lot from them.
We also presented our project and many iGEMers gave us advices. They think our project is really interesting, and our modeling is really good. They gave us some advices on improving our experiment, and we are very grateful about that.

Achievement
        In 2016, we focused on to control mosquitoes. We cloned various Cry and Cyt toxin genes from LLP29, Bacillus thuringiensis strain. We also constructed Cry and Cyt toxin parts based on option optimization of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Meanwhile, we built toxin groups express device based on 2A peptide system. And we tested their toxicity to the larvae of various genus of mosquitoes under the safe lab environment. Considering the potential problems in the natural environment, BNU-China and ZJU-China helped us to build the growth and toxicity model to estimate the natural conditions. To introduce the practical knowledge about how to prevent and control mosquitoes, we designed a handbook covering this topic and sent it to Zambia to help local people who are trouble in mosquitoes. We are proud of our project!

Gillespie Algorithm
The Gillespie algorithm is a way to calculate the evolution of stochastic functions; in this case cell concentrations. To use the algorithm, two things are required:
Reaction rates of the system at a given configuration.
A random number generator.
For each time step, two things are calculated using the random number generator:
The time before next reaction.
Which reaction occurs.
The time before next step is given by:
Δt=S-1log(r1-1)
Where S is the sum of the reaction rates and r1 is a random number between 0 and 1. This gives the time, as if the system was one reaction with reaction rate S, using the random number to give an exponential distribution.
The reaction is chosen proportionally to each individual reaction rate using another random number, where reactions with high rates will occur most frequently.
As each reaction is carried out, the new time is the sum of the previous and added reaction times.   These calculations are carried out until the time reaches the wanted limit, or a specific number of reactions has occurred. It is necessary to have a limit on the number of reactions, as it elsewise is possible for the calculations to continue indefinitely.

Stochastic Modelling of the RelE-RelB Dormancy System
RelE and RelB Regulate Dormancy and Influence Their Own Expression
Modelling of the effects of different RelE and RelB expression levels were performed as an important aspect in the implementation of the RelE-RelB toxin-antitoxin system. The toxin RelE constrains bacterial growth by mRNA degradation, thereby inhibiting translation, whereas the antitoxin RelB inhibits this toxic effect by forming complexes with RelE. As seen in Figure 1, three different protein complexes are formed, namely RelB2, RelB2RelE, and RelB2RelE2, containing zero, one, and two RelE molecules respectively Guang-Yao Li, Yonglong Zhang, Masayori Inouye, Mitsuhiko Ikura, Structural Mechanism of Transcriptional Autorepression of the Escherichia coli RelB/RelE Antitoxin/Toxin Module,"

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#Content#PolicyAndPractices#PolicyandPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," pursued research approaches in the synthetic biology do not aspire the creation of life ""de novo"". “De novo” can be explained from the Latin term “newly create, invent”(Pons). In connection with synthetic biology this implies the creation of new organisms without any foundation in already existing organisms. Up to this day researchers are working with organisms found in nature.
However, in the future scientist attempt to design and manufacture new biological systems, with no origin in nature. (Boldt et al. 2009). Creating new life is consequently one main goal of synthetic biology.
There are three different approaches aiming at the goal: the DNA-based device construction, genome-driven cell engineering and protocell creation (O´Malley et al. 2008).
The DNA-based device construction approach engages with the method of modularization, standardization and abstraction of biological constructs (Arkin 2008). Building a collection of biobricks and inserting them in organisms gives these new functions. Creating new, not in nature occurring species (European Commission 2003).
Model for this is the technical field. Genetic sequences are intended to function like a construction kit, working in every desired organism. For the following discussion, the sematic analogy between the genetic constructs and man made machines is further investigated. Apparent are the used terms „bioengineering product“ or „living machines“ (Deplazes ans Huppenbauer 2009; Tucker/Zilinskas 2006).
The genome-driven cell engineering approach aims to create a so-called „minimal cell“. Parts of the cell should be reduced to a minimal extend, leaving only necessary properties for survival. Minimizing the genome after the top-down-approach pursues the creation of an organisms as a „cassis“. A variable frame where every biobrick can be introduced into the genome. (Gibson et al. 2008)
The protocell creation approach seeks to build a new organisms „de novo“ after the „bottom-up-approach”(Luisi et al. 2006). Unlike the two other approaches the protocell-creation is not guided by an archetype  (Boldt 2008).
These three approaches raise different ethical questions.
The ethical implications using the appellation of „living machines“ and „artificial cells“ will be elucidated. Focusing on the implicated hybrid-character of such designation, with regards of the relation between machines and living organisms and the deceptive idea of an “artificial cell”. Also  the acquaintance arising from the determination between “artificial cell/living machine” is illuminated.

For IGEM, I'm mainly responsible for human practice and have been giving lectures as well as other promotions on both synthesis biology and IGAM. It is this special experience that has not only made my college life amazing, but also presented me with a broader view of biology. Besides working for IGEM, I've also been researching biology statistics, including bioinformatics and biology networks.
My goal is to be a biostatistician in the future, on which I'm gonna keep putting effort. Now I'm applying for an opportunity to study as a biostatistics PhD. Good luck to me, huh? : )

BBa_K648011: Standard 25-Ready Xyle Reporter
This is a mutated version of the Xyle reporter gene which encodes for the enzyme catechol-2,3-dioxygenase (metapyrocatechase), which converts catechol to the bright yellow product 2-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconic semialdehyde. This version of Xyle has been made compatible with standard 25 assembly methods by removing three restriction sites (two NgoMIV sites: at bp 315 and 486, as well as one AgeI site: at bp 837). These mutations were made synonymous with the original sequence and codon optimized for E. Coli.  Because of the synonymous mutations, this gene can be easily used to create fusion protein parts. For more information on the Xyle gene and its uses as a reporter see part BBa_J33204.
BBa_K648029/BBa_K648034: Or Operator
This is the operating region for the Lambda switch that repressors C1 and Cro bind to. This region contains promoters prm and pr facing in opposite directions. It also contains operating regions Or3, Or2 and Or1. In the lysogenic state, the C1 dimer is bound naturally bound to the Or1, repressing promoter pr and production of cro. Once RecA cleaves enough C1 dimer the system switches to the lytic state. The Cro produced at the pr promoter then binds to the Or3 site inhibiting the prm promoter. For a more complete description of the Lambda system read the book ""A Genetic Switch"" by Mark Ptashne. We used Or in creation of the lambda system, as part of our project to create a sensor for DNA damage in bacteria due to radiation.

RecA is a protein used by E. coli to repair and maintain DNA as well as perform homologous recombination. Many normal laboratory strains of E. coli like DH10B are mutants that code for an inactivated form of RecA known as RecA1.  RecA1 is deficient in all known function of the RecA protein specifically in ATPase activity, binding with DNA in the presence of ATP, and changing conformation in the presence of ATP as well as repressor cleavage.

It was obvious that tryptophan productivity evolution indeed occurred with the increase productivity trend along the time course compared with the control group. From the wild type E. Coli BL21 (DE3) with nearly zero productivity, this sensor-based evolution approach successfully increase the productivity to about 3mg/L after only three rounds with totally irrationally knowledge-free fashion. Meanwhile, the control group without bitter defender part showed no growth during the three rounds of evolution, which gave strong proof that it was our constructed system which contributed to the evolution process.
However, the strains carrying mutation part showed no difference in final tryptophan titer than that of strains with naturally occurring mutation. According to the report of Leconte A. M.et. al [1] , in certain conditions, higher mutation rate contributed significantly to the final desired phenotype obtainment along the designed evolution process of biomolecule. However, for our whole-cell level evolution process, considering the inhibition caused by mutation to cell growth, it was possible that in our designed conditions the fitness of higher mutation was not such significant compared with inhibition in fitness. Thus, it was worthy considering resetting our evolution conditions to find the best ones for fast evolution derived by super mutator in the future work.
We further plated the evolved strains on agar plate, and picked 24 single colonies to culture in 24-well plate for 48h and detected tryptophan production by HPLC.

As shown in Fig.1 and Fig.2, each single colony has different productivity of tryptophan, as the evolved strains shown in Table 1 and Table 2 are mixed culture. Unfortunately, as the amount of the selected strains was only 24, in these two figures, we did not get the productivity as high as that of mixed culture. We finally found that evolved strain of rbs30-16 and rbs32-3 have the highest tryptophan productivity. We then selected these two strain, and confirmed there productivity comparing with the controls.

The media refers to Venter's research as ""new"", but the results show that a majority of 52% says that his research is not new, but is only based on engineering principles. In contrast 36% thinks his approach is new and that he uses new techniques, which makes the sample highly diverse in its answers.
The other-answers:
A small group is unaware of the research and honestly state they cannot answer this question because of insufficient specific knowledge of the research.
Most other-voters state that Venter is not doing anything new, but some of them nuance their answer by dividing it in two parts. The approach and idea of Venter is often considered new (""as new approaches usually are""), because this typical project has never been done before. Nevertheless, the techniques he uses are not perceived as new, but are categorized as standard genetic engineering methods.
Some mention that Venter is improving known genetic engineering approaches and that the combination of techniques is novel.
The most substantial result is that the synthetic biology community does not have a universal answer on this topic. Whether the research of Venter is new or not is apparently a difficult to answer question. Reasons for that can include that more specific knowledge on his research is needed, and that it is hard to when an approach or technique is typically new. Nevertheless, the technical challenges that Venter faces are acknowledged. The other-answers indicate that the tools of genetic engineering are not yet sophisticated enough to easily synthesize a complete genome.
Graph 5.
5. (See previous question) Venter says he will be able to create a life form artificially. What is your perception on his statement?
Venter is playing God by trying to create a new life form artificially
Venter is only applying genetic engineering to artificially change this bacterium
Other:
Compared to the last question, the results here are much more coherent. The use of the words ""playing God"" in combination with (among others) Venter's research is often come across in news papers but also in scientific papers and other media, consequently giving his research a controversial character. The iGEM community is clear on this point: only 4% thinks that Venter is playing God, versus a 76% that believes Venter is only applying genetic engineering. Nevertheless, 20% took the opportunity to fill in their own answer.
The other-answers:
There are a range of different open answers that all depict a different aspect important for this question, such as the definition of life and ""what is creating?"". Although very relevant, these"

McMasterU,2016,Team:McMasterU_-_-_TEXT.html," potential therapeutic effects against diabetes.2 In addition, researchers were also able to genetically modify commensal bacteria to secrete keratinocyte growth factor-2 (KGF-2) as a new drug delivery system to treat colitis. KGF-2 has been shown as possible therapeutic agent for inflammation in the past. The bacteria were fed to mice with colitis, and the results showed a therapeutic effect in reducing the symptoms, such as weight loss and rectal bleeding.5
The laws that we have considered for our project would apply to other research of similar types. Our project used Lactobacillus brevis, which is a generally-recognized-as-safe (GRAS) species, which have a long history of safe use and hence, exempted from the typical regulations by Health Canada. Research that uses an uncommon species of bacteria, such as Bacteroides ovatus, are classified as a type of a pathogen, and hence would have to be approved by the Minister of Health Canada that the species is not unsafe for use.1 This is the process that we would have followed if we have not chosen to use a GRAS species such as Lactobacilli.
Our project aims to genetically modify probiotic bacteria to treat gastrointestinal cancer. Any other research that engineers probiotic bacteria would follow the regulations that we have considered for our project. Most research with engineered probiotic bacteria observes the effects of administering the bacteria orally, as probiotic bacteria should enter the digestive tract. For example, researchers engineered commensal bacteria Lactobacillus gasseri to secrete glucagon-like peptides-1 (GLP-1) and looked at the treatment’s effect on diabetic mice by feeding them with the bacteria.2 Similarly, our project would be in the form of orally-administered pills if it was to become a product. The final products of such research or projects would be governed by the same laws, as they would both be considered as drugs or therapeutic products under the Canadian Food and Drugs Act. Unlike pure probiotics in the form of pills, which are considered as natural health products and regulated under the Natural Health Product Regulations, genetically-engineered bacteria with therapeutic properties, are considered as drugs.3 The Food and Drugs Act of Canada is different from the similarly-named Food and Drug Administration of the United States of America.
Another aspect that we have considered for our project is the laws and regulations of the secreted biological molecules, cytokines. We found that all products, including therapeutics, that are derived from living organisms are regulated through the Biologics Program, which includes cytokines.4 This"

Chemotaxis
We designed our device for testing chemotaxis. We first build a concentration gradient inside an agar bar as in any other traditional practice. When put in the water, the gradient agar bar will dictate the formation of a concentration gradient in water as solutes inside the agar can diffuse out. We use a dialysis membrane to wrap the bar and some water up, and then stir the water outside the membrane so that excess of solutes can diffuse outside the membrane and maintain the gradient inside the dialysis membrane.
Building agar bar
An agar bar can be built stepwise to generate any gradient we need. We first tried to build an agar bar with a linear gradient of the blue dye.
Test of gradient in water
We tested the formation of gradient in water by color dyes.
This color gradient maintained for over 30min, and is thus suitable for later gradient mediated chemotaxis.

Light sensor
ycgF-ycgE-ycgZ endogenous light sensing system
Light sensor that directly regulates the expression at the transcription level is rarely seen. Bacterial opsins usually appeal as light activated kinases or phosphodiesterases.  BBa_K238013, an exact promoter of the blue light receptor, is a portion of an E.coli constitutive light sensing system. This system consists of a receptor, ycgF, which is responsive to blue light. When blue light strikes, the
When blue light strikes, the receptor changes conformation and dimerizes driven by the BLUF-domain. This allows it to bind to the ycgE repressor through its EAL-domain, releasing the repressor from the promoter region. In summary, the irradiance of blue light will cause a positive induction, expression downstream   Light sensing feedback using ycgF-YcgE-YcgZ sensing system.
MG1655 strain
The PCR process results that dH5α,the strain we used as normal competent cell, does not contain such endogenous system. The MG1655 strain as a wild type of E.coli K12 was used for the construction of our light sensing design. See MG1655 genotype .
Sensor protein design
Issue
By using the YcgZ light inducing system, we have basically completed our gene circuits. But the performance issue is a critical topic to all the endogenous system.
With the help of the previous iGEMer, we could have a comprehensive knowledge of the ycgZ performance. Two charts placed here show the promote level of YcgZ and the leaky expression.
Weak promotion and high level leaky expression may reduce the ratio of signal to noise. More than that, negative feedback requires a repressive domain with in the sensation system. To solve the issue rise above, we have launched the DESIGN (Design of Enhanced Sensor Instead General Negative part) subproject aiming at providing a high sensitivity, low leaky expression and plasmid based light sensation negative regulation system.

Characterizations for MFC
Being widely reported its natural ability to generate electricity, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 was fed with lactate in the MFC to quantify the performance of our MFC device and to be used as the experimental control for our engineered Shewanella system. While Shewanella can utilize different carbon sources such as lactate, pyruvate and acetate, lactate is selected in our experiment because it has shown that lactate is an energy-favorable carbon substrate for this strain[1]. As described from literature[2], it is desirable to inoculate Shewanella culture until it reaches an early stationary phase. Therefore, we decided to characterize the stationary OD600 of Shewanella in LB by its growth curve since we used LB to proliferate the cell. To get a full understanding of the cell population of Shewanella in the designed condition of MFC, we also stimulated the anaerobic bacterial growth in M9 minimal medium. ""Anaerobic condition is chosen because Shewanella will have a better performance in generating electricity.""
Growth curve of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1
Figure 1. Growth curve of Shewanella MR-1 in LB under 30oC aerobic condition
From the graph, the stationary OD600 value was observed at around 1.8-1.9. In addition, the doubling time was 0.981h. Since a stable cell population is desired for a stable electricity generation in the MFC, we attempted to stimulate the anaerobic bacterial growth.
Figure 2 Growth curve of Shewanella MR-1 in 25oC M9 anaerobic medium
Stationary Shewanella MR-1 in LB was washed and transferred to M9 anaerobic medium at time zero. Although no significant cell growth was observed, the OD600 remained at 1.45-1.5 for 24 hours. After the decreasing trend was observed, we decided to repeat the measurement, but allowing aeration to the cell culture after shifting from LB to M9 for better cell adaptation to the new medium.

Promotion for primary school students
Students in Jiangjiachitou village, Xiwu street,Fenghua district, Ningbo
The small biology class from igemers was held in Jiangjiatoutou Village, Xiwu Street, Fenghua District, Ningbo. The village committee really welcomes and supports us. First, what do we share with children? How did humans develop? Arouse children's curiosity and doubts about biology. In turn, we developed genetic concepts that extend to synthetic biology. Here, we interspersed with an explanation of the benefits and principles of antibiotic use. After listening to our lectures, the students showed great interest. They made a lot of questions about what we said and some new ideas that surprised us.

Also we inoculated some of the HSP+pACYC184 #3 in 5 mL of LB media with 7.35 uL (34 mg/mL) of chlor to get a conc. of 50 uL/mL overnight so that we can do more testing   Also Devora accidentally diluted the stock of HSP+pACYC184 #3 and now it is 17.5ng/uL concentration. Then, we made a 1 in 1000 dilution of this, so it's around 17pg/uL. We also diluted HSP+pACYC184#1, with a 1 in 1000 dilution, so it's around 100pg/uL now.     7/18/14:  We ran a PCR of HSP+pACYC184 both colonies 1 and 3 so we could send them out for sequencing. We already sent them out as plasmids, but the reads weren't very good, so we're trying again and sending out PCR products.  We transformed the kids BioBricks that didn't transform for them using compotent DH5alpha cells, all onto chlor 50ug/mL plates.  We ran the four input backbone and four output backbone PCRs from yesterday on a gel to see if they actually were amplified. The results can be seen in the gels file for today. The inputs still didn't PCR but the outputs did.  We also took some of the inoculated 5 mL of HSP+pACYC184 and struck it out on a plate so we have some.   Then we took the 5 mL that we inoculated to do testing and did a mini prep on it because we realized we didn't inoculate anything else so we couldn't run anything. We followed the protocol for the quiagen mini prep. We then nanodrpped it and it was 12.3 ng/uL.

EcAMP-1 is an antimicrobial peptide of 37 amino acids  originated from the specie Echinochloa crus-galli,  a type of wild grass.  This peptide has a particular structure : it is helical because of two disulfide bonds.
EcAMP-1 has shown to have antifungal activities. Its mode of action may be the prevention of hyphae elongation.
This part was added to the Registry by the iGEM Utah State team in 2013.
Design
This part is composed of the constitutive promoter Pveg and strong RBS for Bacillus subtilis ( BBa_K733013 ) and the open reading frame of EcAMP-1.
The EcAMP-1 part was codon optimized for E. coli by the iGEM Utah State team and thanks to the Life Technologies GeneArt software program.

PROJECT  OVERVIEW
The iGEM HKUST 2018 team attempts to generate electricity from the degradation of the most widely used plastic, polyethylene (PE), using a synthetic biology approach. Making use of E. coli engineered with genes encoding for laccase to degrade polyethylene into smaller alkane chains, our team recognizes the opportunity to further advance this project by addressing another key issue – energy. Using Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 strain’s inbuilt extracellular electron transport mechanism in tandem with genes responsible for alkane metabolism derived from Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans, we will generate electricity from the metabolism of degraded polyethylene, hoping that it will one day help in solving the world’s growing energy needs. Thus, our project serves as an integrated effort to simultaneously solve two crucial problems.

IGEM 2018 - TEAM HKUST
MFC DESIGN
Aside from plastic degradation and alkane metabolism, generation of electricity was another important focus of our iGEM project.
For the Microbial Fuel Cell design, we focused on generating a stable electrical current by utilizing Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 strain’s inbuilt extracellular electron transport mechanism. In order to better harness its electrogenicity, we housed a culture of the bacterium within a microbial fuel cell of our design, aiming at maximizing electrical output for a given amount of substrate.
Our final design of biosphere-MFC conjugation had integrated the different comments and suggestions from our potential users. This MFC design aimed to be used both in households or indoor public areas.

1. Everyone should be prudent
DDT, the inventor of which won the Nobel Prize, was used as a pesticide at early time, but after 50 years we found out that it caused irreparable damage to human beings and environment. Therefore, it is necessary to slow the development of genetic engineering and focus on improving its basic research. We should make sure it won't cause side effects to the environment and human beings before its promotion.
2. Establish and improve the related laws and regulations, and strictly implement them
Wild type plant (left) compared with genetically engineered plant (right)
In the past two decades, Chinese government also put forward a lot of related laws and regulations. In 1993, the former State Science and Technology Commission issued a regulation called ""genetic engineering safety management measures"". In 1996 the Ministry of Agriculture issued the “Agricultural Biological Genetic Engineering Safety Management Implementation Approach"". In May 23, 2001, the State Council announced “Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms' (GMOs') Safety Management Regulations"".

Plasmid Assembly
We built two different systems: one containing TetR + RFP and another containing TetR + LacI + RFP.
In the first readout system, RFP is repressed when TetR binds to its Ptet recognition sequence. However, the sequential use of  two repressors in the second system allows us to have a direct activation of the selection gene when TetR binds its recognition sequence.
First readout system:
Second readout system:
We need several plasmids to build our two systems:
A reporter plasmid for the first system: J61002 Ptet-RFP
A reporter plasmid for the second system: J61002 Plac-RFP
A plasmid with TetR for the first system: pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR
A plasmid containing TetR and LacI for the second system: pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR Ptet-LacI
Reporter Plasmids
The reporter plasmids contain RFP under TetR or LacI regulation, depending on which readout system they are used in. Their structure is illustrated below.

The award for best presentation this year went to the newest team in the Nordic iGEM world: iGEM Lund. The voting by other iGEM teams’ representatives was almost unanimous and in agreement with the judges’ opinions. It was clear that iGEM Lund has an almost never ending enthusiasm about their project and an unique spirit and attitude amongst the teams! But even though we did not win the prize our team still got a shout out from the judges for having a reasonable and interesting project. We also got a great feedback and suggestions from other teams that helped us a lot while progressing in the project. Thanks to NIC we got the chance to meet other teams that are close to us and it gave us a great base for the other collaborations we had during the competition.
Teams represented at NIC: DTU-Denmark, SDU Denmark, UCopenhagen, Aalto-Helsinki, Chalmers-Gothenburg, Linkoping_Sweden, Stockholm, Uppsala, Lund

SUMMER BUDDY
During two weeks of the summer we shared our lab corridor with students from several chinese universities that was invited to Uppsala University for a course in synthetic biology. Since we shared the same interest in synthetic biology it was an opportunity to learn from each other, and it lead to many great discussions. We had some activities together with them as well, such as a “swedish fika” with swedish games, candies and pastries. Other activities include a trip to a lake in the surrounding area of Uppsala and one night we had dinner together at one of the student nations in Uppsala. All of these activities gave us the chance to get to know them better and to introduce them to iGEM in general while they got the most out of their trip to Sweden. We also held a more formal presentation of our project for the students where they had the opportunity to ask us questions. This gave us a chance to practice our presentation skills."

SynArt
100 years ago our ancestors invented laboratories to ease the observation of creation; to enhance our knowledge and develop for the better so a new renascence began. Today, SynArt may introduce a second renascence where science will work together as one wit art. ATOMS Turkiye believe that laboratories may be unsatisfactory to fathom creation itself. For this reason, SynArt will allow us to perceive synthetic biology from an artist’s standpoint. In order to take the first step, we contacted the other European iGEM teams and invited them to send their valuable artworks for the 2-day SynArt exhibition that was held in our university. We asked what the viewers’ interpretations were and their choice of favourite.

Transformation of all the Biobrick assemblies from yesterday and performed colony PCR on the plated ccaS_EcoRI_SpeI from 2011-07-17. We also did some O/N cultures of ccaS_EcoRI_SpeI. The gel showed nice and clear bands of the appropriate length.
Cloning of amilGFP_BB10 into pSB1K3 and later it was transformed together with YF1, FixJ and PfixK. These are parts of the blue sensor and they were synthesized by GenScript. Cph8 was cloned into pSB1K3.
The following parts were sent to sequencing: pcpcG2, CcaS_EcoRI_SpeI, CA2A, CA2B and tetR.inv. TagBFP and amilCP are sequenced by Erik Gullberg via IMBIM.

Transformation of pSB1K3-cph8 and Re-streak of pSB1K3-amilGFP, YF1, fixJ and PfixK.  This was done late because they were transformed very late. By the end of the day we did new ampecilin plates since there were non left.
The lambda red assembly plan must gain higher priority. The first assembly line involving EnvZ-KO could’ve been started earlier, but hasn’t. Thus, we have to hurry up the work on λ Red.

Jun. 16th 2014
This is the first time that we have presented our project to the group of faculties we invited, who come from different departments and labs. We introduced our project and discussed the main idea of our project, ""Comparmentalization""with them. And we learned a few of significant suggestions.
Jul. 10th 2014
On this day, we sent a delegate of our team to Hong Kong to communicate with the iGEM team members of the universities in Hong Kong.
Jul. 12th 2014
Wang Zhizheng met the head of the project of CUHK. We have a very fruitful discussion and a nice lunch in Shanheng College. We have a deep-going talk about the problems we faced in the experiments and the solutions and how to design a fantastic project. We gained some useful advice and experience. Meanwhile we talked about the expenses of the project.
This day, we had a online communication with the team leader of HKU. It is so nice of him to talk with us after a tired travel. We mainly talk about the team construction and HP work. We also exchange our own opinions about the development and continuity of iGEM team. Afterwards, we often have online talks with each other. It’s of great efficiency.
We determined to cooperate with the Innovation Club for Science and Technology of SCUT. We planned to use their “Wechat” public platform to issued our original electronic magazine，”iGEM Life”. The club is the biggest academic innovation club for science and technology, which is affiliated to Dean’s Office. Its public platform has a lot of members including students, teachers and staffs, which enjoys a high level of popularity. So we planned to use its great impact to introduce synthetic biology and iGEM. We planned to issue 2-3articles every 5 days.
Two delegates of GENEWIZ were invited to our lab. We showed them around our labs and told them our project and what we were doing. We"

“Business training isn’t in our course load,” said Ward, thanking all the advisors, Community Futures and everyone who helped them along their way so far.
“We’re thankful we have an opportunity to pursue this, and to see others think it’s an idea to pursue as well gives a real sense of encouragement.”
Team: Synbiologica CEC Site Idea: Technology
“We found the diversity of the workshops to be not only eye opening but also very informative.  The speakers that were brought in provided a lot of one on one time with participants to cater advice for their business.”
Mackenzie Coatham
Isaac Ward, Erin Kelly, Mackenzie Coatham, and Harland Brandon are four science students at the University of Lethbridge who are developing a hormone detection device called Biologically Enhanced Assay in Real-time (BEAR). As their studies at the U of L don’t include any business training, they signed up for the Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge and its 8 week training program.
The team of four students are currently working out of the laboratories at the University of Lethbridge, and are being advised by professors at the University. Isaac and Erin are currently obtaining their undergraduate degree while Mackenzie and Harland are master’s students. When asked if it is difficult to handle their duties for Synbiologica and their studies, Isaac responded “As with many start-ups it takes a lot of work but with integrating planning, dedication, and most importantly team work, we feel confident that our commitment to education will be enhanced through real world application.”
While Synbiologica is still in the research phase and has yet to produce a prototype of BEAR, they are already looking to future applications of their product. They plan to market it to scientific researchers – more specifically ones focused on endocrinology and neuroscience – but also feel that BEAR will be useful in an agricultural or medical application.
These four students are excited about their idea, and while it may be a few years until BEAR is fully functional and approved for use, they remain committed to their research.
U of L Scientist Win Entrepreneur Challenge
Posted by Genome Alberta via medicinehatnews.com , 4 months ago
A biotech company started by a group of scientists from the University of Lethbridge came out on tops in the ninth annual Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge. “It’s been a really exciting experience,” said Isaac Ward, who alongside Harland Brandon, Erin Kelly and Mackenzie Coatham have established Synbiologica a small biotech company based out of Lethbridge that is developing a method of rapid hormone detection.

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," above multiple times, we were not able to obtain an expression system for subtilisin E without fatal mutations. Combined with the experience of other iGEM teams that the promoter BBa_R0011 shows some degree of expression before the addition of the inducer, we assumed that subtilisin E prohibits cell growth of E. coli if expressed in its active form.
As a result, we progressed by exchanging the promoter.
Day 8
To exchange to promoter of our expression system, we started with extracting parts of it via PCR. Hence, we used the primers shown below to obtain a sequence with the secretion tag, the subtilisin E gene and a terminator that is flanked by the BioBrick prefix and suffix.
Figure 11: Extraction of a part of the expression system via PCR.
Afterwards, we cloned this sequence in the BioBrick BBa_J04500 with the restriction sites EcoRI and PstI. BBa_J04500 is a protein expression backbone which consists of the lacI promoter BBa_R0010 and the ribosome-binding site BBa_B0034 integrated in the BioBrick standard vector pSB1C3. Then, we transformed the obtained construct in E. coli BL21 together with all needed controls.

We want to check the size of the insert in the AmyE region(IA751) after transformation with an integration vector (to check if we have a single cross over or not).
We are going to test our transformation of ECE112 and 153.
We already tried this protocol, but our PCR did not work, so we tried again, with one sample of chromosomal DNA from bacillus to check if our transformation works.

Shaking Flask Cultivation
The first trials to produce the LttH-laccase from Thermo thermophilus HB27 (named TTHL) were performed in shaking flasks with various volumes (from 100 mL up to 1 L flasks, with and without baffles) and under different cultivation conditions. The best cultivation condition for <partinfo>BBa_K863010</partinfo> expressed in E. coli was screened by varying the temperature, the chloramphenicol concentration,induction strategy and cultivation time. Furthermore, E. coli was cultivated with and without 0.25 mM CuCl2 in the medium to provide a sufficient amount of copper, which is needed for bilding the active center. Under the screened conditions no biological active TTHL could be produced. Therefore another BioBrick was constructed and another chassi was chosen. To improve the expression another BioBrick <partinfo>BBa_K863012</partinfo> was used, which has a constitutive promoter instead of the T7 promoter system. Additionally, the strain E. coli Rosetta-Gami 2 was chosen, because of its ability to translate rare codons. TTHL was then produced under the following conditions:
flask design: shaking flask without baffles
medium: LB-Medium
antibiotics: 60 µg mL-1 chloramphenicol and 300 µg mL-1 ampicillin
temperature: 37 °C
cultivation time: 24 h

Dundee,2011,Team:Dundee#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"id pSB1C3. BMC protein expression was measured using western blotting, staining and also by radioactive labeling. BMC’s were also visualized using fluorescence microscopy and also using electron microscopy. We call our synthetic BMC the ‘sphereactor’.
2. The PduD20 targeting tag: BBa_K562001
A 20 amino sequence from the PduD protein which we hypothesized would act as a signaling sequence to target our proteins of interest to the interior of the BMC. It was previously thought that 40 amino acids was essential for targeting however our experiments where our PduD20 was fused to GFP have shown that it is possible to use a 20 amino acid sequence as a signaling sequence.
3. GFP with an ssrA destruction tag: BBa_K562019
GFP with an ssrA tag which would target GFP for degradation by the protease ClpXP. This allowed us to test our signal sequence (PduD40) since any GFP which left in the bacterial cytoplasm would be broken down, while the GFP targeted to the BMC would be safe from ClpXP provided that it reaches the BMC before it is broken down. Our blots of GFPssrA expressed without the microcompartment show no detectable levels of GFP, however when the microcompartment is present GFP was detected suggesting that GFP was being sequestered inside the sphereactor and so protected.

Outreach
Back in May, applied and received a Building with Bio kit through NSF. The kit is designed to help out with outreach events. While many of the activities were aimed at children in elementary school through high school, there was also a kit to set up a forum discussion designed for anyone over the age of 14. The activities focus on synthetic biology and exposing people to genetic modification. We were lucky enough to partner with a local children's science museum in the Lansing area for our event - Impression 5. We are incredibly thankful for the help of those at the museum for allowing us to set up in an open area of the museum and work with the kids and their families.
On Saturday, September 17, our team stopped by Impression 5 to run our outreach event. We brought two activities with us: Kit of Parts and Super Organisms.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer_-_-_TEXT.html,"ible promoters regulating protein expression over 350-fold (Lutz and Bujard, 1997) and sigma factor-promoter pairs providing up to 480-fold modulation (Rhodius et al., 2013).Despite the inherent programmability of RNA-based systems, efforts at constructing large sets of orthogonal riboregulators have been limited to libraries of at most seven parts with crosstalk levels of 20% (Takahashi and Lucks, 2013). Typical RNA-based regulators employ interaction domains consisting of30 nts, which corresponds to a sequence space of over 1018 potential regulatory elements. Thus, the sheer diversity of possible RNA-based parts suggests that previous devices have not come close to realizing the potential of highly orthogonal regulation.
Figure 5: (A and B) Design schematics of conventional riboregulators (A) and toehold switches (B). Variable sequences are shown in gray, whereas conserved or constrained sequences are represented by different colors.
Much of this discrepancy arises from the significant sequence constraints imposed on riboregulators engineered thus far (Figure1A). Like natural riboregulators, engineered riboregulators of translation have invariably used base pairing to the ribosome binding site (RBS) to prevent ribosome binding, thereby preventing translation (Callura et al., 2012; Isaacs et al., 2004; Mutaliket al., 2012; Rodrigo et al., 2012). Because repression is caused by RBS binding, trigger RNAs that activate translation are engineered to contain an RBS sequence to displace the repressing sequence, which in turn reduces the potential sequence space for the riboregulator.
Previous riboregulators have also relied on U-turn loop structures to drive loop-loop and loop-linear interactions between RNAs (Figure 1A) (Callura et al., 2012; Isaacs et al., 2004; Luckset al., 2011; Takahashi and Lucks, 2013). U-turn loops are common RNA structural motifs formed by tertiary interactions that have been identified in ribozymes, ribosomal RNAs, and transfer RNA anticodon loops (Gutell et al., 2000). Although recent work has begun to show that loops with canonical U-turn sequences are not essential for riboregulators (Mutalik et al., 2012; Rodrigoet al., 2012), the engineered systems reported to date have continued their reliance on the loop-mediated RNA interactions from natural systems. Although these loop interactions have been selected by evolution in nature,"
SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," in the study. Here, the iGEM modeling group wants to use some of the existing models to establish the mathematical model to describe the process of the transfection and gene combinations of Lentivirus in the cells.
5.1 Macro mechanism
In order to explore whether Lentivirus has a time delay like HIV in the erosion of the cell, we first make a hypothesis. We assume there is a time delay between the initial Lentivirus invasion susceptible cells and the subsequent infection of the virus. Because the Lentivirus can not produce new virus particles, so when we analyze the whole process,we should avoid the generation of new virus particles. Therefore, according to the research results of Perelson、Bonhoeffer and Xu Rui, we have integrated to establish the model of Lentivirus’s transfection with time delay:
Among them, healthy cells (also known as susceptible cells) x(t) produce with constant input rate,d represents the death rate,
represents saturated infection rate, healthy host cells are exposed to the virus particles after infected with bilinear infection rate of βxv into infected cells y(t);α>0; Infected cells’ death rate is a; The removal rate and initial amount of dissociative virus is μ and k; τ represents the time of virus’ invasion into susceptible cells to susceptible cells infected until death. Assuming  m represents the production rate of infected cells(not dead), e-mτdenotes the survival probability of the infected cells from time t-τ to time t (1/m represents the average survival time of cells infected but not with infectivity).
figure.12
In the case of other constant unchanged, we take different τ (τ=15,5,2.5,1,0.1) and use dde in MATLAB to solve the delay differential equations. From the image above, there are no changes of images with the changes of τ, but always overlap. Thus, we conclude that based on the establishment of Delay Lentiviral Transfection Model, Lentivirus does not have a time delay, which is different with HIV. As to whether Lentivirus completely has no time delay or it has other special properties, further studies need to be done in the future.
5.2 Micro mechanism
There is no conclusion on the study of Lentivirus, but because Lentivirus is gene therapy vectors which are developed on the basis of HIV-1, so we can simulate the process of cells infected by Lentivirus according to the process of HIV-1 infecting cells and some of the characteristics of Lentivirus. As Lentivirus belongs to RNA virus and the RNA virus’ coat protein contains the reverse transcript"

COLLABORATIONS
Imperial College London
We assisted by providing Imperial iGEM with growth data from Chlamydomonas, for their computer model A.L.I.C.E. This computer model is aimed at producing a platform with the growth conditions for various different species, and ultimately for identifying possible co-cultures. Find out more here
We hope that the data we provide is especially useful for Imperial iGEM, as chlamydomonas takes significantly longer to grow that bacterial species.
The image shows a 96 well plate, with various concentration and 2 levels of 'happiness' of the same algae culture. We took 2 OD750 absorption readings a day in order to provide data for growth analysis by A.L.I.C.E
Linköping University Sweden
The Linköping University Sweden Team
The Linköping University Sweden team were also working on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with the aim to transform the nuclear genome to introduce CRISPR/cas9 technology to disrupt the metabolism pathway and make the cells more efficient for biofuels. Due to the similarity in project goals we collaborated throughout the summer.
The nature of this collaboration has taken many formats: e-mails, skype meetings and weekly reports about the week experiments. Staying up-dated in this manner has allowed for the exchange  of questions of dealing with the organism, protocol sharing and advice on different strategies. Sharing knowledge in this way, both teams managed to get a “feel for the organism” over the summer.

Freiburg,2016,Team:Freiburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Their opinion was extremely important to us and we therefore decided to dedicate them an extra survey.
However, publishing surveys that may include sensitive medical and personal data, requires caution. To formulate the questions for our survey we went to get help from a variety of experts from different scientific backgrounds. We’ve held an interview with a team of pharmacists and asked them for their opinion and some input.
Based on these information, we conducted a second survey, targeting ulcerative colitis patients directly. We shared this survey on various facebook pages of organisations which are helping patients to cope with their sickness.
At this point, we would like to thank everyone who helped us spread our survey, and in doing so, enabling us to improve our project in ways we couldn’t have done without them.
The aim of our survey was to receive information about the experiences patients actually had, what their age of diagnosis was, how long it took until they were diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, what their first symptoms were and whether they had any side effects resulting from their therapy. Additionally, we presented our idea of targeted drug delivery using bacterial spores to get feedback on how applicable the people ,suffering from ulcerative colitis, actually think it is. To see what insights we gained from the survey and how we integrated it into our project, check out our integrated human practice page.
When it comes to a project like ours, communication is needed with people from all backgrounds. Questions kept floating around in our heads, wishing to be answered. Since we were able to receive feedback from the public and patients one part was still missing- the medical experts.  What do experts actually think of our idea? Do they think it’s applicable? Or even realistic? What are their concerns regarding the use of bacterial spores?
Do they have any experience with negative side effects of the current medication of ulcerative colitis? To find answers our third survey was designed especially for gastroenterologists, who are treating patients with ulcerative colitis.
Each survey helped us to understand different point of views regarding our project. This made us question our concept and brought up new ideas to improve our project.
After we established a clear structure for our project, based on the information gathered from all three of our surveys, we felt confident enough to share our enhanced concept.
Luckily we were able to publish a blog entry via the BIOSS Centre For Biological Signalling Studies on SciLogs Spektrum page. This was our first scientific draft of our project and the feedback differs from previous result, since now we gave others an insight in our final medical approach and thoughts.
Another great opportunity of sharing and collecting experience"
