SUIS_Shanghai,2018,Team:SUIS Shanghai#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," there was insufficient training opportunities in biodesign and engineering concepts in biology (37% strongly agreed and 56% agreed that there is a lack of sufficient training), while almost identical results were observed for citing a lack of suitable available resources as a barrier for its implementation (34% strongly agree and 54% agree).
Comparison of Groups
To answer the questions posed about whether differences in numbers of years of teaching or curriculum used has any impact on frequency of use of engineering and design in biology, comparisons between different groups were analyzed. Although there appeared to be some differences between groups when type of curriculum used was compared, Chi-Square Tests indicated the observed differences were not significant (p<0.05). For example when comparing AP Biology and NGSS Life Science classes it would appear that a higher frequency of teachers would use engineering and design in their lessons when following NGSS standards (14% used it often, 40% used them sometimes compared to just 6% and 29% respectively for AP). However these difference were not seen as significant (p=0.14) and we would like to collect more data from NGSS teachers. This data is further clouded by the fact that many respondents taught both NGSS and AP classes and therefore these groups can not be fully described as being independent.
We would like to continue with this line of inquiry in the near future and explore the impact of specific professional development workshops for biodesign. Our current data is insufficient for us to make any conclusions about this as only 12 respondents had received some form of training in this topic. 17% of this that had, did however respond that they often use this in their classes while a further 42% responded that they sometimes did with none admitting to never using engineering and design concepts in heir biology classes. This is compared with 5% (often), 38% (sometimes), and 13% (never) responses from teachers who never received any training. This data looks promising evidence for supporting continued effort into professional training for this purpose but again the differences are not significant (p=0.35). We would like to continue our work to overcome the issue of small sample size.
Conclusion/Action
These results confirmed our initial feelings that student designed lesson plans that can be easily incorporated and aligned to a teachers regular curriculum can have a profound impact on synthetic biology education. The results allowed us to realize that many teachers are unfamiliar with synthetic biology so we concluded that by simply sharing information about iGEM and BioBuilder to teachers, schools and districts is also great starting point. We also learned that we must provide very clear background information in"
Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Specificity_-_-_TEXT.html," 8. relative k-values of 24 different mutants compared to Cry3Aa and the empty expression strain.
Figure 9. Heatmap of the relative k values. A high relative k value indicates a higher toxicity and specificity of the tested toxin. As the legend shows, the lighter the colour, the higher the activity.
From these results, it can be concluded that the third binding site (amino acids 410-416) seems to be a good candidate for future engineering and specificity adaptation of this particular Cry toxin. Due to the relatively high deviation in reaction speed for the toxins 3.3.3 and 3.3.7, these should not be taken into account, as they are rather inconclusive. This leaves us with one proper candidate – mutant Cry3.3.5. This mutant has both a higher mean reaction velocity compared to the reference value and a relatively narrow range of measured relative k-values obtained for the 9 tested samples. Furthermore, the negative control shows that other proteins present in the cell free extract or cell debris (e.g membrane residue) interfere with our reading. Nevertheless, our preliminary results show that the mutant revokes a stronger response than the negative control, suggesting a specific binding to the Varroa vesicles.
Phage Display
Due to difficulty to obtain mites, the phage display experiments were set up in a model organism where a Cry toxin has already been described: T. molitor (Cry3Aa). We expected to prove the applicability of this technique for specific protein engineering towards toxicity for V. destructor. We used the filamentous bacteriophage M13 and two different libraries; 7-mer flanked by a pair of cysteine residues (The Ph.D.™-C7C Phage Display Peptide Library) and the 12-mer (The Ph.D.™-12 Phage Display Peptide Library).
Display of M13KE-PIII Libraries
Two different strategies for phage display were used, in vivo (conventional phage display) and in vitro (panning). For the in vitro display, a modified biopanning protocol, the Biopanning and Rapid Analysis of Selective Interactive Ligands (BRASIL) method, was used.
in vivo
First as a proof of concept feeding experiments were performed with fluorescein on mealworms and mites (Figure 10). In short, the mites and mealworms were fed with either a piece of carrot soaked with fluorescein or a bee larvae soaked with fluorescein. After washing with PBS buffer, the insect were"

2017 is the first year in which a team from Florida has sought to compete and complete an iGEM project. Luckily for us, we did not have to go through iGEM initiation alone! Florida State University happened to join us on this pioneering journey into the realm of synthetic biology. Along with a few other experienced teams, we engaged in varied collaborations that allowed us to share, learn, and overall gain a deeper understanding of the true potential of iGEM’s scientific community.
Team FSU
While our two schools might be known for an infamous athletic rivalry, that could not stop our two iGEM teams from working together to make it to the finish line as one. Initially, we used video chats to meet and discuss our experimental undertakings. We soon realized that it would be more significant to move our troubleshooting discussions to a public platform.  A joint YouTube channel was then created in order to expand on to the general populace. It was felt that the process of designing and accomplishing an iGEM project could be explained in a manner understandable to anyone interested. These videos feature a repertoire of one team answering a certain protocol/design problem and then querying a solution to one of their own. Our teams utilized this forum to develop our projects while also showcasing the collaborative values of iGEM and the synthetic biology field. In addition, these videos might inspire those previously uninformed about iGEM to develop their own project for future competitions.
Team Franconia
Although the project deadline might have passed, does that mean the work is truly done? Apparently not! Team Franconia plans on unveiling an elaborate augmented reality game at the 2017 iGEM Jamboree. This smartphone app will be themed around the epidemic spread of viral pathogens and requires collaboration between any and all iGEM participants. Different schools will attach QR codes to their displays which will provide ‘antidotes’ to combat the pathogens. UFlorida plans to not only facilitate the game by presenting a code but to also participate in the investigative efforts. This game will extend the scope of scientific collaboration by coordinating the efforts of young researchers in an innovative and engaging manner. By linking all these bright minds to a common goal, international unification is possible.

We did a fast ligation (30 minutes, room temperature) of Cre with pC13F and electroporated. The time constant was low, so the transformation may not have worked. We continued the ligation overnight. We were still waiting on a miniprep kit so we pelleted our pA13AM and pC13BG cultures to prevent further growth. We transformed with our new pC13AY ligation to hopefully get some colonies this time. We also ran a PCR of pC13F to append homologous regions to G. lucidum PgpdA for Gibson assembly to create pC13BH and another PCR to retry appending BamHI and KpnI cut sites to pC13F using half to reaction volume to see if efficiency would be improved. We also electroporated the 4 ligations for fluorescence from yesterday (pAK13D with GFP, pAK13D with mRFP, pC13P with GFP and pC13P with mRFP) along with a control of pC13F to make sure that the electrocompetent cell stocks made yesterday are good. We plated the electroporated cells onto selective antibiotic resistance plates and incubated in 37 degree incubator overnight. We made our first attempt at protoplasting G. lucidum today. However we were having difficulty forming pellets of protoplasts, so we viewed the samples under a microscope. It appeared that the protoplasting attempt was unsuccessful. pC13M and pC13K plates were lawns on their plates. We set up overnight cultures of pC13AS, pC13W, and pC13Y, planning to miniprep and make glycerol stocks.
We began constructing pC13BH with Gibson assembly, as well as making our first attempt at protoplasting G. lucidum. Electroporations of fluorescence constructs was also done today.

Week 5th-11th September
This week we continue the Golden Gate protocols for producing the fusion proteins. This time, since what we did before did not work, we began by amplifying the genes from the plasmids that were built last week directly. The primers are those that allow for complementary ends A-B to fuse directly the IDT proteins with the CBD, which carries the cohesive A-C ends.
For this we performed Phusion PCR because we needed high fidelity amplification.
The PC mix is as follows: 30uL of water, 10uL of buffer, 2uL of template (pFNS1, 3, 5, 9, and 11), 2.5uL of FNS01 primer and 2.5uL of one of the following primers (FNS4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14), 1uL of dNTPs, 1.5uL of DMSO and 0.5uL of the phusion polymerase.
Primer list
We then run a gel to see the results of the amplification. Looking at the following picture we realised that we made a mistake in our logic. All the bands we see correspond to the supercoiled plasmid, and none to the amplicons. This is due to the fact that our primers do not work, because FNS1 does not hybridise with the template, since after cutting the gBlocks for golden gating them into the plasmids the complementary sequence for this primer is partially lost.
Therefore, we suggested to change the strategy to our advisors; who agreed that it would be the best option. We decided to forget about the fusion proteins with CBD and amplify instead the genes with the best Fabric Binding Domains that had been found by the binding domains group.
First. we are going to fuse this fragments with the GFP protein to do binding assays and select the best FBD out of the existing ones. Then, we are going to fuse these FBD to our candidate enzymes to see if their activity"

Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan#Heritage_-_-_TEXT.html," us to step into the vast ocean of iGEM and synthetic biology, it was the first step we officially made, and has always motivated us to move forward.
Apart from the things mentioned above, we spared two separate days in the beginning and ending of the theory training program to give two-round of presentations on our designed projects. Leaders of last year’s teams would act as judges and point out the deficiencies of our plan, as well as offering us their valuable suggestions for improvement. At the end of the whole winter-break training, we were able to present a doable and sound project to the professors, and this could never be achieved without their help.
Experiment training
After theory learning, we experimented the basic operations on molecular cloning under the guidance of last year’s team members, which then became the experimental routine during our whole competition.
As most of us had never conducted molecular cloning, and some had never done wet-lab experiments before, they taught us the necessary steps beforehand, gave us protocols to follow and guided us through the whole process. When we failed at a particular operation, they would lead us to think what may be the trouble, thus teaching us how to debug. It’s their tolerance at our mistakes and their efforts to correct them that accompanied us in conducting our very first molecular cloning and so many more afterward. Of course, all these happened after we passed the safety test.
Throughout the competition
If the selection is the key to open the door of iGEM, and the winter-break training the first step we took to enter, then the competition itself would be the real journey to explore and have fun in the room of synthetic biology. As iGEM competition does not limit itself to lab research, we still have very much to learn, and members from previous years helped us tremendously and selflessly in this process.
It is certain that without the help of previous teams our project won’t be completed this thoroughly and we won’t be able to present our project as it is right now. We sincerely thank members of the previous teams for their help, and we are ready to offer our help to future teams that come.
Abstract
Contact-dependent signaling is critical for multicellular biological                         events, yet customizing contact-dependent signal transduction between                         cells remains challenging. Here we have developed the ENABLE toolbox, a                         complete set of transmembrane binary logic gates. Each gate consists of                         3 layers: Receptor, Amplifier, and Combiner. We first optimized synthetic                         Notch receptors to enable cells to respond to different signals across the                         membrane reliably.

Changes to the PCR protocol  *same conditions for Gro2 *GC buffer instead of HF buffer for Gro2 *Using Taq pol and Taq buffer for Gro2 *1/10 of DNA template *Shorter primers  *Same conditions using Abi's G blocks
Results - Large band of correct size was seen with Taq polymerase, using the same primer. Both G-blocks and the primers are working as expected. Next step: eliminate all plasmid, digestions with more DpnI should be performed again with more DpnI
Human Practices
Sunday
Began developing the activities for APCS
Modelling
Monday
Test the prototype electrophoresis circuit, now named ElectroStop
ElectroStop demonstrates a capability, after some tuning, to be able to accurately sense the presence of marker dye obstructing its laser.
Tuesday - Thursday
Adapt the standard codon harmonisation tool to accurately reflect the rate quantisations proposed by Spencer et al, which seems more physically realistic.
Thursday - Friday
Begin coding a new codon optimisation tool, now named TransOpt, which we hope will optimise many aspects of the translation process.

Lab Protocols
This page contains the lab protocols used by Team Newcastle.
Dr. Phil Aldridge's Lab Protocols
See Dr. Phil Aldridge's Lab Protocols
When carrying out procedures in the lab, whether it's transforming E.coli by heat shock or carrying out restriction digests, we always adhere to the protocols Dr. Phil Aldridge has given us. That way, the cause of an anomalous or undesired result in an experiment can be determined a lot easier.
Our Lab Protocols
See Our Lab Protocols
Some of the experiments that we carried out required protocols with which we were not provided in the lab; we needed to design them. Read this page to view these lab protocols which includes how to conduct a DNA gel electrophoresis experiment.
Other Lab Protocols

What We Do
The  burning  of  fossil  fuels  generates  greenhouse  gases  that  are  damaging  the  atmosphere  and  impacting  the  global  environment.  Energy  from  sustainable  sources  such  as  wind  and  solar  is  difficult  to  store  for  times  when  the  wind  is  not  blowing  or  the  sun  is  not  shining.
In  order  to  build  a  sustainable  energy  source  for  energy  on  demand  we  are  creating  a  system  using  living  organisms.  E.  coli  will  be  engineered  to  synthesize  lactate  which  will  then  be  used  to  feed  a  Shewanella  biofilm.  Shewanella  is  a  bacteria  that  can  transfer  electrons  to  a  cathode  and  produce  a  current  to  light  a  bulb.  The  community  will  be  involved  through  a  DNA  Code  Game  designed  for  middle  and  elementary  school  students  to  raise  awareness  of  synthetic  biology  and  iGEM.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 Notebooks Chromoproteins_-_-_TEXT.html,"2.0 chromoproteins that were done from liquid cultures yesterday were taken out of the 37 °C and placed in the 4 °C fridge. Some of the plates did not grow colonies: Prancer Purple, Dreidel Teal, Vixen Purple, Cupid Pink, Scrooge Orange. New cultures of these colors were started and will be plated tomorrow.
●
The culture of AE Blue-CBD-Tag that was started on Tuesday was spun down at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was disgarded and put in the -20 °C for two hours. Then protein extraction was done on these cells following the protocol detailed in the protocols section of this notebook. 2.515 g of cells were extracted then suspended in 25 mL of cell lytic B, 250 uL of DNAse, 50 uL of RNAse, and 2.5 uL of lysozyme then shaken for 10 minutes on the vortex. After this, 25 mL of Equilibration Buffer was added to the cell lysate then it was poured into 3 seperation columns.  3 washes were done using Equilibration Buffer then the extracted protein was eluted in 3 mL of elution buffer. This is a slight change in protocol which was done in order to prevent the protein from washing through th column too soon as happened yesterday. Minimal amounts of extracted protein were visible in the washes of Equilibration buffer.
●
Snake skin dialysis was used to concentrate the extracted protein using a 1 L solution of 1 x TBS.
Friday, 8/12
●
The extracted protein that was dialysized yesterday was removed from the buffer and placed in 15 mL falcon tubes. 3 mL of the extracted protein from Monday's culture was concentrated using a filter column (spun at max in the mini centrifuge for 10 minutes then the flow through is disguarded and the column is placed upside down in a new tube then spun at 3.8 rpm for two minutes-- .5 mL of extracted protein yields 20 uL of concentrated protein).
●
The concentrated protein was then pippeted onto cellulose sheets that had wax wells printed onto them. These sheets were then placed in an oven at 75 °C and were observed to change from bright blue to purple in less than 30 seconds (more accurate time tests will be conducted next week). The sheets were then removed and allowed to cool to room temperature. The purple color lessened, but was still obviously more purple than the"

Potsdam Day of Science
At our booth, we showed which products include or will be produced by genetically modified organisms. Many people do not know what genetic modification is or that every organism and every cell contains DNA. We tried to bring the synthetic biology closer to women, men and children.
We also isolated the DNA from bananas together with children. They were so excited to see the whole genetic information, since every cell includes it. DNA is everywhere but you cant ""touch"" it, thereby it was even more interesting for the small explorers.
Did you see this?

In the afternoon the time was taken to take a tour in the tourist center of the city and ended up having dinner with a picnic in the Parc Guell. A viewpoint that have views of the entire city at night.
During the morning of the last day, to close the meet up, we were able to attend to some enriching expert talks. They offered us their views on synthetic biology and they explained the works in which they are immersed today.
Back to Meet up Index
Organization of a Meet Up: Another European Meet Up
Reason
After attending two meet ups we realized that these meetings are very enriching experiences in preparation for the Giant Jamboree. One of the main reasons for these meet ups is to get to know and know the project of other teams. Other reason is that its also serves to practice the presentations of the project and its results. And finally serve to open the network of contacts beyond the contest itself.
We realized that the events to which more teams come are usually the first ones to be organized, and in these although if they serve to obtain collaborations, do not fulfill so much the function of practicing to present the results of your project due to at the beginning of the summer there are no results.
This year the European meet up was on July 20. Date in which novice teams, without sufficient contacts do not yet know how to deal with these events and do not have the necessary funds to attend. And teams with more experience do not yet have conclusive results. With this context we proposed this ambitious project: Make another European meet up. We invited all the teams of the continent in mid-September. A date that was supposed to be the best for the organization of new teams and with the possibility of simulating the final event.
Event
The event was organized between September 14 and 16. Although this event was given as much publicity as possible and contact was made with all possible teams in Europe, attendance was low due to several factors:
- Spain is geographically at one end of Europe and travel is expensive.
- The teams were short of funds and were saving for the trip to Boston.
- The event was announced at the beginning of September, many teams did not have room to maneuver in their organization to attend.
Despite these inconveniences we had assistance from several participants of some teams (all of them came from within the Spanish territory thanks to the facilities for transport). Although there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.

PlepA - SpoVG RBS
PlepA is a constitutive promoter in Bacillus subtilis (BBa_K823002) coupled with a RBS spoVG (BBa_K143021). To get the highest level of translation from this Promoter-RBS combination it must be connected to a coding region preceded by a coding region prefix. A standard prefix will increase the distance between the RBS and the start codon, reducing translational efficiency.  This construction is also working with Escherichia coli and has been verified by sequencing.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of g"
UNITS_Trieste,2011,Team:UNITS Trieste#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," but the original idea and the extensive validation of the submitted biobricks have earned our team the access to the final jamboree in Boston.
Considerable work has been done during this month after the regional jamboree and at the end, looking at our BioBricks and results, you will appreciate the validation (PDF BoBricks DataSheet) of all the BioBricks that we submitted and that will guarantee the proper function of the 3-cell consortium.
In particular we would like to focus your attention on:
BBa_K553001
BBa_K553003
BBa_K553006
BBa_K553008
BBa_K553009
BBa_K553010
BBa_K553020
BBa_K553021
BBa_K553022
BBa_K553023
The part BBa_K553020 presents the coding sequence for a mammalian secreted beta-lactamase (sBLA). We've used it associated to BBa_K553021 and BBa_K553022 that represent the core element of the DNA sequence recognized by P65-TraR (BBa_K553023) and a minimal CMV promoter, respectively. In a mammalian system these three elements plus a BBa_K553023 the mammalian TraR-based trans-activator represent an OXOC8-inducible expression system for the production of sBLA.
Inside the bacterial strain B the part BBa_K553008 guarantees the production of OXOC8 under the stimulation of OXOC12, while BBa_K553006 produces the C. firmi-derived beta-glucosidase upon OXOC12 stimulation.
BBa_K553008 and BBa_K553023 are the core elements of the communication between the two kingdoms. The first one produces signal molecules (AHL OXO-C8) and the second one produces P65-TraR a fusion protein, composed by a portion of the p65 a NLS signal and the whole TraR. This guarantees an appropriate response to OXOC8 in the eukaryotic system.
BBa_K553010 guarantees the constitutive production of OXOC12 in order to make the system self sustainable avoiding the need of a starting induction.
All these parts have been qualitatively tested and will guarantee the communication and the inter-independence between the two kingdoms. If bacteria and eukaryotes will communicate using OXOC8, they will cooperate for the survival of the whole consortium: eukaryotes will produce beta-lactamase, vital for bacterial survival in an am"

Introduction to Synthetic Biology
  Synthetic biology is an area of biology which aims on reforming and creating genes to let them function in expected ways, constructing new biological functions and systems that are not found in nature. The former focuses on synthesizing gene fragments, inserting artificial DNA into living cells and enabling them to express rightly; while the latter majors in rewriting natural systems, and building a new biological system as a platform for many technologies.
 
  Our instructor Prof.He gave students an splendid presentation to inspire their interest in synthetic biology.
 
 Our team member Xin Yang introduced our project BioSearch to freshman.

Warwick,2018,Team:Warwick#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," perspective on our Legionella project. He stated that decontamination against Legionella bacteria was far easier than effectively testing for the bacteria itself - most Legionella are highly susceptible to antibiotics. A rapid test would be valuable to dental practitioners to prove that their equipment would be sterile at low concentrations of Legionella bacteria. Equipment is usually sterile, however Legionella bacteria tend to find their way into dental chair units - waterlines can become dense with bacterial biofilm without regular disinfection.
Culture tests for Legionella can frequently result in false negatives, putting patients at risk when no threat can be identified. Legionella are a parasitic bacteria, both to humans and to microorganisms; they can revive themselves after being engulfed by amoeba, meaning that the amoeba cells must be lysed in order to correctly define the true prevalence of legionella in a given sample. An acid lysis step is required in order to free the Legionella, but due to the parasitic nature of the bacteria, cultures can still prove difficult to give consistent results. Disinfectant can also cause Legionella to enter a pathogenically-viable non-culturable state.
After the interview with David Coleman, we discovered a significant demand for an effective Legionella detection kit. We changed the sequence of our gRNA based upon his recommendation from an endA (highlighted in red) sensing device to a Legiolysin sensing device (highlighted in blue) . The interview with David Coleman has had a foundational impact on our project, changing it at a genetic, and therefore functional level.

Dr Ng Khuen Yen, Professor of Pharmacy at Monash University Malaysia
In our interview with Dr Ng from Monash University, he offered us great perspective on his thoughts regarding to our Bacillus Subtilis project. He stressed that in order for us to market our product effectively, we have to ensure that the lead floatation system is low in cost and has good sensitivity towards the detection of toxic metals.
David Lloyd, FREDsense
Mr Lloyd, co-founder and CEO of FREDsense gave us amazing insights into how we could improve and advance our project, specifically in the North America market, He spoke of how lead is a pretty common problem in ageing infrastructure, especially in areas such as Michigan whereby a high concentration of lead is currently leaking out of the pipes of various infrastructures. Hence, our project has a great potential marketability value. With regards to scaling-up, he advised us that we need to consider whether do we want our project to be a field-based technology or something that can be implemented in"

Wetlab
EcnB part extracted from A(ABEF) synthesized plasmids and purified.  It was then ligated with H backbone (pSB1C3) and transformed. Had some issues growing cultures with ligations. We are excited to start cloning!
Drylab
Dry lab discussed and finalized a design as well as the dimensions for the fish tag. Parts were designed through SolidWorks in member’s own time.
Policy and Practices
We began searching for fish farm contacts, and started our YOURS mentorship program. We introduced our mentors to the kids and taught them about DNA and its importance.
Week 2 (June 14 - June 20)
Wetlab
Week one steps were redone. Started gel purifications instead of column purifications, so plasmids were re-cultured (pre-ligation). We had some issues with low DNA concentrations after gel purifications, so we increased amount of DNA used in digestions.
Flavo Subteam
The flavo subteam made cultures of two strains of Flavobacterium, and measured growth of bacteria with spectrophotometer. In addition, daily OD readings were taken to determine growth rate.
Drylab
Dry lab continued with the CAD design of the fish tag. We also did research on a list of potentially compatible materials for the fish tag, including tubing, clamps, and syringes.
Policy and Practices
The YOURS kids got a tour of our lab and we taught them more about how DNA works in our body as the determining factor of our genetic characteristics. They were able to place their fingers on plates to “plate bacteria” and we showed them how to incubate the plates to help the bacteria grow. We helped them carry out an experiment that extracted DNA from strawberries and we showed"

Summary:
- The system is generally robust and stable according to our sensitivity analysis.
- The parameters related to properties of lux pR are relatively more sensitive to perturbations. This accords with our previous conclusions.

This simple medium can be used as a base. However, the complexity of P. pastoris genetics requires a more complex medium, including an ideal glucose concentration of 4% to activate pGAP and a nitrogen deprivation in order to allow the activation of pFUS by Ste12. Glucose concentrations higher than that in LB should not disturb the growth of V. harveyi, but nitrogen deprivation is likely to be a problem. Experiments to optimize the biological system or the medium will be required in a later phase of the project.
We should also make sure that the medium contained in the sachet does not diffuse importantly into the water to change its taste or to allow other microorganisms to develop therein. Once again, a more thorough modeling is necessary.
Operating instructions
One of the biggest challenges for our device to be accepted and widely used is its simplicity. The materials used, robust but light, make it easily transportable.
The cylindrical device is made of 4 parts. The two parts at the extremities allow to hold the Sunwaterlife membranes by screwing them. The seals avoid damaging the membranes and ensure watertightness. The sachet is then placed into the cylinder and the two parts are screwed to contain the sachet. The device can then be soaked into the adequate volume of water to be treated (tank, bucket,...).
At the end of the recommended treatment period, the device must be removed from water that can be used and drunk. The cylinder must be unscrewed and can be reused, as the seals and the membranes if they are undamaged. The sachet can either be thrown into a designated trash bin until the organization comes to treat the waste or burned to destroy the microorganisms. In the first case, NGOs or armies must regularly pick up this bin at the predicted time intervals depending on the processing capacity of the device.
The video below provides a virtual presentation of the handling of our device.
Demonstration of the device use (Solidworks)
To allow a better understanding of the device use, two operating manuals have been made for NGOs and for populations. You can find them here , in the Utilization section. They will be delivered with the device.
3D modeling and printing
As shown in the previous figures, a 3D modeling of the device was carried out on Solidworks when the features were defined. Moreover, Jean-Jacques Dumas, a teacher in industrial products design, helped us in this task, especially with respect to the"

Conclusion
pPIGBACK-CrtZ was transformed into Synechoccocus elongatus PCC7942 after 20 days cultivation, the electrophoresis result based on PCR CrtZ gene from extracted genomic DNA of transformants is showed below. Transformation efficiency of pPIGBACK-CrtZ is 11.4 transformants per μg DNA, and correctness is 52% (10/19), which is relatively high compared to low successful rate of gene recombination.
Therefore, we can conclude that pPIGBACK is quite a reliable vector which could accomplish gene double-crossover homologous recombination in S. elongatus PCC 7942 genome, because the successful rate of gene double-crossingover homologous recombination is low in cyanobacteria. Moreover, when comparing pPIGBACK-CrtZ transformants with wild type, we can assure that pPIGBACK could be express in S. elongatus PCC 7942, which is such a milestone in our project. With the high correctness of pPIGBACK-CrtZ transformants, we have the confidence that multiple colors of cyanobacteria is possible and could be functional in the near future.
This figure is pPIGBACK-CrtZ transformants electrophoresis result of CrtZ gene amplified from extracted transformants genomic DNA. C1~C20 represents the pPIGBACK-CrtZ transformant clone 1 to clone 20, and M represents 1 Kb marker.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP
What We've Done
Our OLS Synbio team has created a project which is desirable by people, viable as a business, and feasible with technology. These are the three main pillars we built our project on.
We have participated in many entrepreneurial workshops and conferences, such as the Berkeley Program, to learn about design thinking. The methodology of design thinking has been applied to each step of our project, over numerous iterations.  After months of research in many areas of study, we were able to narrow down our project to plastics. From there, we decided to focus on the recycling process of the plastic problem because of our outreach.  We are grateful for our design thinking education; without it, we would not have had the tools to take this community feedback and help it re-direct our project to a more promising direction. With the knowledge from the Berkeley program, we knew that our idea had to be desirable by people, viable as a business, and feasible with technology, and we were able to pivot to our current direction.
We pitched our project to representatives from ATB Financial and received important feedback on what to incorporate when presenting a business plan, including advice on how to properly persuade the audience of the viability of our design. Determining the value propositions for our project was something we would not have considered without the input from ATB Financial professionals. We later met with and pitched to the Bow Valley Credit Union and other local business, and received numerous donations - a testament to our community support for our idea and for its viability.
We presented our project at two different Mindfuel events, including Mindfuel's Alberta Genetically Engineered Machine (a provincial competition for iGEM teams, complete with an amazing panel of judges who provided excellent feedback to refine our project and presentation!), and were honored to win one first place award and financial grants from these events.
Our team attended an entrepreneurship conference and workshop where we learned about how to turn a product into a business and how to give an effective value proposition.
We also interviewed people who started and own their own biotechnology businesses, including Lisa Oberding and David Lloyd from Fredsense (Calgary, Alberta) and Justin Pahara and Julie Legault from Amino Labs (Lethbridge, AB)."

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," CUP1 promoter. Based on the new part, we carried out a further improvement.
2) Error-Prone PCR
In our experiment, we noticed that CUP1 promoter still has a certain degree of leakage expression. To make a better biosensor, we planned to reduce the leakage expression and increase the sensitivity. To reach this goal, we took the fluorescence intensity at both inductions or not into evaluation indexes.
The technology of error-prone PCR was taken into our experiment. Although there are many methods to introduce genetic diversity into a parent sequence, error-prone PCR is the most common way of creating a combinatorial library based on a single sequence. By adding some heavy metal ions into the PCR buffer and preparing dNTPs with different composition, new mutants were introduced into the CUP1 promoter. The whole procedure is shown in the following figure.
Fig. 4-5. The procedure for error-prone PCR experiment
Fig. 4-5. The procedure for error-prone PCR experiment
The library of promoter mutants obtained from error-prone PCR were ligated into plasmid pRS416 with two restriction sites (BamHI and XbaI). After that, we enriched different plasmids from E.coli and established the plasmid library with 132 samples. Then, different plasmids were transferred into S.cerevisiae BY4742 to test the fluorescence intensity under different conditions.
First, we tested and selected mutants with less leakage. Compared with control group, we test the fluorescence intensity with no induction and selected two mutants with lower fluorescence intensity. Actually, we test a lot of mutants, but most of them were not positive result. We picked EP-3, EP-5, EP-9, and EP-28 whose fluorescence intensity was less or close to the control group, and sequenced them. The sequencing results can be found in the parts' information: BBa_K2407013 (EP-3) , BBa_K2407014 (EP-5) , BBa_K2407015 (EP-9) , BBa_K2407016 (EP-28) .

Fig. 4-6. The leakage expression of different promoters
Second, we worked on the sensitivity of the biosensor. Leakage expression was not the only thing needed to be solved, and we also needed to increase the response range when it was induced. A good biosensor needs less leakage and more sensitivity.
We tested the 4 selected biosensors and control group with 0,"

Summary:
Assessment of S. elongatus and Bacillus subtilis survival after exposure to Mars-like conditions.
Adaption and acclimation of S. elongatus and B. subtilis to Martian environment.
To know
exactly
how this is achieved, see Red Lab Overview and Experimental Concept .
GROWTH EXPERIMENTS – Validating the acclimation of bacteria based on the assessed
knowledge of the bacterial response to exposed Martian-like conditions
Question How well did the bacteria, S. elongatus and B. Subtilis, survive the different simulations of Martian environment?
Experiment The experiment at JMMC (Jens Martin Mars Chamber), with independent exposure to UV, pressure, temperature and microgravity (Random Positioning Machine) have been assessed. The bacteria were exposed for different duration times shown in the table below. The exposure times in the pressure and temperature experiments were combined with several pressure and temperature values respectively. Thus, the cells were immediately analyzed with OD (Optical Density) and microscopy to observe their response on change in growth rate. The B. subtilis were grown on LB media whereas S. elongatus were grown on BG11 media. The experimental assessment were designed for plated bacteria thus investigated in liquid form for the OD.
NOTE: not all microscopy images and OD measurements for the different experimental values are provided here due to simplicity. Therefore, microscopy pictures and diagrams are chosen to be shown from different experimental observations to illustrate the broad assessment.
Results Generally, the S. elongatus and B. subtilis have survived the Martian conditions upon exposure even on long durations, which is demonstrated on the pictures and growth diagrams shown below. The overall results extracted from the experiments also indicates the decrease in growth rate in an amount dependent on exposure durations referring to drastic drop for the longest durations and slighter fall for shorter exposure times. In the case of UV exposures, Martian UV spectra and single wavelength 293 nm, demonstrated that intensities matter significantly. The intensity of Martian UV spectra is higher than that of single wavelength despite the fact that"

Search the Database & Adapt
We knew we wanted to encourage student discussion as a part of this program, however we weren't sure the best way to distribute information and spark conversation. We turned to the Database and found BostonU's 2016 forums which covered topics ranging from GMO foods and Genetically Engineered Mosquitoes to Editing the Human Germline and Martian Colonization. Their model gave participants a brief informational packet, and then had broad questions to spark conversation. The links for the Human Germline project and GMOs were both still in progress, but we used the questions under G.E. Mosquitoes and Martian Colonization as inspiration for the kinds of questions that would prompt good conversations. These questions include things like; what are the 3 greatest obstacles in implementing your plan? Who should be in charge and how should they go about the implementation of your plan? What ethical issues are evident in your plan? These questions encouraged students to dive into their readings and evaluate their own ideas without feeling like there was a right or wrong answer.
Implementation
On July 16th the medical explorers visited the lab and discussed DNA technologies and the medical uses of techniques like gel electrophoresis before completing a gel electrophoresis mystery. While the gel ran the team discussed techniques in gene editing, specifically transformation and CRISPR-cas before working with edited RFP and GFP E. Coli. After students plated their bacteria they each picked up a brief and straightforward article describing a synthetic biology application to prepare for the next day’s class.
On July 17th the medical explorers returned to view their bacterial art projects, and image and analyze their gels. We reviewed the techniques the students had learned the day before and discussed the articles students had selected. Conversations ranged from the feasibility of some synthetic biology projects, to the ethical implications of our work.
Reflect & Record
The students really enjoyed the first day of hands on activities! We got a ton of positive feedback from students and teachers about how excited they were to image their gels on day two. During day two it was challenging to get students to share with the larger groups about their article. When we broke into smaller groups of 4-5 students conversations flowed a lot better. Many students were interested in the bounds of this science. Many students identified the traditional hopes for synthetic biology like curing disease, but it was especially interesting and excited to hear students discussing the ecological and ethical implications they considered. We ended the session by asking students what"

The running of the study
To analyse the timing of plasmid expression in the DU-145 cell line, we realized a kinetic monitoring of the apoptosis induction by making an annexin V assay every 6 hours for 48 hours after the plasmid electroporation. By coupling apoptosis rate of the population control (blank electroporation) and the population assay (electroporation with plasmid) with their respective growth rate, we will be able to determine the p53wt impact on apoptosis induction. We use a control without the plasmid pcDNA3 CMV+p53wt to quatify the level of death cells causes by the electroporation and by the culture transfert.
Because we had not a continuous access to the cytometer, we grouped the all 48h analyses in 2 cytometry runs. Each time slot of the study is represented by a distinct cell population. So, we realized 14 electroporations corresponding to the 7 time slots: +6h, +12h, +18h, +24h, +30h, +36h and +48h (two by slot: population assay+ population control).
Here is the allocation planning of electroporations:
Three cell populations were respectively electropored 12h, 24h et 36h before the first cytometry run (in red, at 9 a.m, day 3), four others 6h, 18h, 30h and 48h before the second run (in green, at 4 p.m, day 3).
The first cytometric analyze allowed us to obtain data for the monitoring at +12h, +24h and +36h, while the second one, allowed us to obtain data for the monitoring at +6h, 18h, +30h and +48h.
By coupling all these data, we obtain a monitoring on 48h of the apoptosis induction after p53wt electroporation.

One liter of gas per minute was pumped through the one liter of culture. The spike in OD600 seen in the middle of the graph accompanies a malfunction in the machinery in which greater than 1% of the gas being used was air. This data shows that the fructose construct was capable of growth, albeit slow growth, under these stressful conditions that mimic that of the intended site of implementation, a landfill piping system.
Supplemental Data
Supplemental Figure 1
Overnight cultures of the fructose construct grown in LB were used to inoculate M9 media with .2% glucose and 0% methanol (n=2), 1% methanol (n=6), and 2% methanol (n=6). At three time intervals before OD600 reached 0.6, the OD600 values were recorded. Data shows that as methanol concentration increases, the average OD of the culture does not increase as quickly over time. After 5.5 hours, some cells were induced with IPTG to stimulate protein production (Figure 3). The continued trend of methanol inhibiting cell growth can still be seen in Figure 3.
Supplemental Figure 2
To measure our methanol concentrations we used a YSI2900. This biochemistry analyzer is able to use a membrane containing alcohol oxidase that turns methanol into hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is then electrochemically oxidized at a platinum anode producing a signal current that can then be measured. To use the machine, you must first calibrate it with a sample of methanol at a concentration of 1.00 g/L.
To get our measurements, we took samples from the bioreactor every hour after methanol was added. We transferred the sample into three 2mL microcentrifuge tubes, all filled with 2mL of the sample, and then spun them at 8000G for 5 minutes. After the samples were spun down, we transferred 200µL of the supernatant into a microcentrifuge tube with 1800µL of water to create a 1:10 dilution for each original tube. We took measurements of each diluted sample and recorded the results.

The fusion was loaded with sgRNAs designed to target the substrate DNA,  erythropoietin (EPO) coding DNA sequence (cds), at position 179 bp (from a total length of 623 bp). If the integration of DNA adapters was site-specific, two main products should be obtained: ~250 bp and ~470 bp (one from the forward and one from the reverse strand), schematically shown in figure 2. This integration was demonstrated and presented in figure 2.B, in which lanes 2 and 3 represent each one of the fragments described. These lanes can be compared to the negative control in lanes 4 and 5. These lanes represent integration in the absence of sgRNA, the component required from targeted integration.
Targeted Next generation sequencing
Not only did we demonstrate that our fusion protein is capable of targeted integration, but we used our protein in its designed application: targeted sequencing with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform. We used our fusion protein during library preparation to integrate sequencing adapters at the target site in the EPO cds, using the same sgRNA from the assay described above. The library reaction mixture had equimolar concentrations of two molecules:
Target DNA: EPO linear plasmid DNA containing a complimentary sgRNA target site.
Background DNA:Tn5 cds DNA containing no sgRNA compatible target sites.
After library preparation , we also added equimolar concentrations of randomly tagged reference DNA, as an internal control to verify the sequencing run. We sequenced the DNA molecules with an ONT MinION device. Sequencing results showed multiple reads of the reference DNA (internal control), 89 unique aligned reads of to the target DNA, EPO linear plasmid, and 0 unique aligned reads to Tn5 cds DNA, background DNA. Demonstrating a successful sequencing run and the target specificity of our fusion protein. Close analysis of one of the alignment reads demonstrates the precise site where the sequencing adapters were added. We could thus identify the exact distance from the binding of d"

Induction in mammalian cells
At the initiation of the project the host lab only had a tetracycline induction system. Induction systems with ecdysone and rapalogues were purchased (Agilent Technologies and Clontech Laboratories, respectively).
We thank Prof. Martin Fussenegger who kindly provided all the genetic components for establishing the erythromycin and pristinamycin induction systems.
All five induction systems were adapted for the project purposes by the addition of TAL regulators. Because of the MTA limitations the induction systems could not be deposited into the Registry.
TAL effectors
The 2010 Slovenian iGEM team prepared NicTAL, a TAL effector designed to bind to the teto1 operator, which however did not work as expected so the team performed experimental work using zinc finger proteins instead. This year's team discovered that a subdomain of TAL essential for the activity, which was not known at that time, was missing from NicTAL. The missing domain was added and NicTAL activator and repressor constructs were prepared and their functionality was demonstrated.
KRAB domain, VP16 domain and minimal promoter (Pmin) were contributed by the host lab.

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#Choice of Protein_-_-_TEXT.html," single domain antibody that might be easier to produce with our system and are as specific as the human one [8].  Being able to produce single domain antibody on space mission might be useful for research purposes and diagnosis. This would expand the toolbox that the astronauts could bring with them on missions to foreign desolated places. Some types of cancer medicine is based on antibodies [9], therefore being able to produce antibodies might also in the long term lead the way for production of cancer medicine in space.
Requirements for production with our Protein Printer system
Our Protein Printer allows for extremely pure protein to be obtained. However, the system has limitations with regards to the complexity of the proteins that can be produced. The optimal protein to produce with our system should therefore be as simple as possible, able to fold by itself, have a minimum number of post-translational modifications (PTM) and be relatively stable.
Limitations of our system:
1) Folding of the proteins: Once the protein of interest is secreted across the membrane it needs to be able to fold more or less by itself in the conditions of the buffer. This means that smaller and simpler proteins are better to produce with our system given that they are better at folding on their own. How big this folding challenge will be will become clearer when we have data on production of protein with our system. For now we have spoken with Michael Hecht at the European iGEM meetup who suggested we tried to produce his fusion proteins that were better at self-folding. If they work well we could try using his technique for protein production with our system and our protein of interest.
2) Posttranslational modifications: As we produce our proteins using E. coli we are not able to produce proteins with all kinds of posttranslational modifications (PTM). For instance, it is not possible to produce glycosylated proteins in E. coli. PTM is more characteristic for eukaryotic systems, and this fact further complicates protein production, since some PTMs, such as glycosylations, cannot be performed in prokaryotic cells.
Based on the limits of our Protein Printer we have looked at size and PTM's of the proteins we found biologically interesting and wish to produce with our system. This we have done in order to get an idea of the feasibility of producing each protein with our system.

Pittsburgh,2016,Team:Pittsburgh#Project Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," Switch signals the presence of metal ion with a color change mediated by LacZ. The substrate chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside is added to the cell-free extract so that LacZ can produce β-galactosidase as soon as it's made. Because LacZ is an enzyme, the degree of color change is limited by the amount of substrate available, not the amount of enzyme produced, which is advantageous for our in vitro system. Furthermore, because the Collins toehold switches already contained lacZ, it was easier to test the rest of the system using LacZ.
We decided to use a colorimetric signal to make the sensor amenable to home use. Colors, unlike fluorescence, can be detected without additional equipment. Although an abundant amount of GFP becomes visible to the naked eye, GFP's strength lies in its fluorescence, not its color. Additionally, a cell-free system may not be able to produce enough GFP to be visible within a reasonable amount of time. Our first choice was to use the chromoprotein amilCP from the iGEM distribution kit, developed by the 2012 Uppsala Sweden team. However, sequences of the assembled plasmid suggested we had CFP, not amilCP. No color was observed in vitro or in the cells.

Amplifier
The amplification system was inspired by the work of Wang, Barahona, and Buck . In our system, the toehold switch produces T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of the target metal. T3 then translates both LacZ and itself to amplify the signal. The self-propagating amplifier decreases the detection limit of the system.

Integrated Human Practices
This year, NUS Singapore-Sci has sought to find out the myths and misconceptions about gene editing ( #CasAsks ) among the public, to identify which aspect of gene editing we should focus on for our project. Through surveys and interviews with various stakeholders, we identified that the main concerns were the permanent nature of DNA editing and ethical considerations. This made us decide to focus on RNA editing as our project. We have also attempted to debunk the myths and misconceptions via school outreaches ( #CasTeaches ) and educational videos ( #CasTalks ) after speaking to scientists and people in the field. With all the knowledge on hand, we have summarized and compiled all the interviews into #CasWrites . You can hop over to our Human Practices to find out how all of these are integrated into our project!
Improve a Previous Part
We sought to improve BBa_K2083010 , a GFP with a mutated start codon from ATG to ACG through our own dual color reporter system BBa_K2807013 which is made up of mCherry and eGFP connected by a T2A linker containing a mutated start codon of ACG. It not only allows a robust OFF-TO-ON switch from the ACG mutant to wild type (ATG), but also demonstrates strong linear correlation between EGFP and mCherry fluorescence, allowing normalization of transfection and expression levels. More information can be found in here , detailing on how the improvements were made.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," possible outcomes when modern society continues to develop.
In Cohen’s typology, modern society is demarcated from pre-modern society with the start of the industrial revolution and the end of feudalism through the social reform that resulted from changes in the way the industrial economy was organised. The beginning of this new era was also marked by new hazards introduced by technologies that were not administered sufficiently. As a consequence, the ambition for material production caused considerable harm to the environment as side effect of cost-effective economic thinking. This changed, however, when values of environmental durability gained more importance as a social objective vis-à-vis the efforts achieved by industry. This marked the beginning of ecological modernisation, where growth remains part of a linear projection that builds on the economic rationales of modernity. In this instance, technology is a central element in the process of arriving at that ecologically-modern society. It is a tool to ensure that ecological responsibilities are embraced by society through a series of environmental reforms. The technologies which are used are hence a strong force for optimism in addressing the challenges put forward by environmental problems. However, these reforms also mean that all institutions, modes of behaviour and policies require structural adaptations so that the integrity of the environment can be maintained. These modifications are essential in order to create an ecologically-modern society that is able to guarantee ‘technological-environmental security’ (Cohen 1997: 111).
Although a society may choose to follow a certain path that fits into the process of ecological modernisation, it is not always presented with the conditions that would lead to such an outcome. According to Cohen (1997), the eco-modernist course can be confronted with an alternative trajectory that would lead to a risk society. This, according to risk society theorists such as Ulrich Beck and Anthony Giddens, is in fact the default pathway when the transition to the ecologically-modern society cannot be accomplished. Instead of the positive trend that ecological modernisation theorists prescribe through the transformative means of technology, the risk society becomes the result of industrial technology that is actually causing environmental hazards. These, in turn, engender insecurities among lay people who do not have the same knowledge about the technologies that are used in comparison with those who create and apply them. In the situation where the technology does not seem to be meet expectations set up by economic projections, insecurities appear to aggravate. Equally so, when institutions and their subsequent attempts for reform do not match the nature of the problems they need to tackle, responding to the ecological crisis will only have a marginal effect on the social system in which policies are formulated.

This part was used to make our E.coli resistant against the mazF toxin they should produce. For this reason the expressed the mazE antitoxin (BBa_K2142001). Further we used Anderson promoters and RBS to be sure our proteins are expressed constitutive. This was very important for the reason the Antitoxin has a really short half-life and the chromoprotein was used to detect the winner. At the end of the part we used a bidirectional double terminator, which also terminated the transcription of BBa_K2142005.
BBa_K2142005
In our project we used this composite part to let our E.coli attack with the mazF toxin (BBa_K2142003). Further this part contains a Dam methylase (BBa_K2142004) for the reason this protein leads due to over expression to an increased mutation rate. For the reason toxin production and mutation can cause problems during assembling and testing the expression of the proteins can be induced with IPTG. This part belongs to BBa_K2142000.

Future applications: Biosensors
An ever popular class of iGEM projects are those which create biosensors.  This year more teams than ever have dedicated their time to the development of biosensors, for example Peking are detecting heavy metals, Imperial identifying parasites and Sheffield recognising chlolera.
Real life isn't black and white
3D mock-up of a mass produced bioluminescent biosensor featuring the same technology as our E.glometer : a cuvette for loading sample, simple buttons for making readings, LCD screen for output.
In every application of a biosensor it is useful to know the amount of the factor being measured. There are a numerous existing reporters.  However to our knowledge there are none which are both affordable and quantitative.  Some teams attempt to solve this problem by using a series of wells sensitive to increasing concentrations of the substance.  But this requires a great deal of work to tune the sensors correctly and can add to their cost.
We have already shown that the amount of the light produced by a bacterial culture can be assayed affordably with our E.glometer .  Such devices could be mass produced lowering production costs further and distributed with the bacterial biosensors.
Co-reporters
It is often useful to have one cell measuring reporting two different outputs.  Light is an effective means of achieving this, since it has different wavelengths which can be easily separated by inexpensive filters.  The various coloured outputs that we have created would be useful tools for achieving this.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," requirement for our project. Our objective is the obtainment of a fully orthogonal import system by utilizing the two peroxins Pex5 and Pex7.
Engineering of Pex5 and PTS1
Designing our receptors
To achieve the engineering of an orthogonal import pathway, we followed two approaches regarding Pex5. The first is based on targeted mutagenesis based on educated guesses which is first verified by molecular dynamics and later experimentally in the laboratory.    The second approach is based on a recently published paper: We searched for literature dealing with the modification of the peroxisomal import machinery. During our research we came across a paper of Cross et al., published in 2017, in which they present a synthetic construct of the Pex5 protein, partly Arabidopsis thaliana and partly Physcomitrella patens. Compared to the wild type Pex5, this one shows different binding affinities since it interacts with a PTS1* variant that does not interact with the wild type Pex5 Cross et al. . Since the protein sequences of yeast's and plants's Pex5 differ quite a lot, we aligned both sequences to understand where the mutations were set.
Figure 1.1: Alignment of the Arabidopsis thaliana's Pex5 and Saccharomyces cerevisiaePex5
Figure 1.2: Alignment of the yeast’s Pex5 with the Pex5 variant R19
The alignment shows three red marked amino acids we changed in our receptor sequence. Interestingly, these mutations are located within the TPR motifs of our Pex5 protein and this persuaded us to try out this receptor, we call it R19. Due to lack of time we tested this Pex5 variant in silico and in vivo simultaneously. We started molecular dynamics simulations with a couple of PTS variants that we already tested with our previous designs − one of them was actually the variant they used in the paper (YQSYY). The details and results of our structural modeling can be found in the modeling section .
Furthermore, we synthesized this variant and together with two receptors we designed based on educated guesses we got three receptors for our experimental work.
Experimental design
Verification of peroxisomal protein import was performed  by tagging the fluorescent protein mTurquoise with our designed PTS variants. Additionally, a peroxisomal membrane protein was used to ensure peroxisomal localization. For that reason, we chose the transmembrane domain of Pex13 tagged with the fluorescent protein mRuby.

UCL_London,2011,Team:UCL London#HumanPractices#Debate_-_-_TEXT.html,"acking’ culture around synthetic biology, similar to the development of open-source software, and this has most likely contributed to the enthusiasm of hobby geneticists.
Is regulation around synthetic biology moving quickly enough?
A few of the attendees were fearful of the lack of regulation around synthetic biology outside the laboratory, explaining that it is easy to transport dangerous bacteria such as E. coli. One audience member argued that iGEM has an important role in publicising synthetic biology, making it clear that even undergraduate students can manipulate sequences of DNA. He explained that the competition allows people outside the laboratory to react and initiate further discussion about safety and regulation.
What is the purpose of iGEM?
Aside from the competition’s stated aims of expanding the BioBrick library for open-source use, attendees were curious about the workings of the competition, and whether it was a positive force in the field.
It was suggested that iGEM is primarily a exercise in innovation management.
A few attendees criticized the competitive element of iGEM; surely co-operative projects would be more in the spirit of open-source? The competition introduces an incentive for secrecy, and discourages inter-team collaboration. Another attendee explained that competitions are one of the most cost-effective methods of producing innovation, giving the example of the X-Prize for space travel. A comparison was made with the garage biology movement, where participants are motivated by the satisfaction of solving problems for the gain of the community. Ultimately the competition criteria compels teams to form well rounded business models.
It was also suggested that iGEM is simply a public relations stunt, attempting to pre-empt widespread fears about synthetic biology by presenting it as a field so safe that undergraduates can participate.
Have the benefits of synthetic biology been exaggerated?
Some attendees explained that exaggeration of these benefits has been and will be detrimental to the field. One attendee argued that excess hype has raised expectations among funding bodies and scientists and has lead to a wariness of the field in the UK. We discussed this in further detail with science portfolio advisers from the Wellcome Trust here .
To end the debate we presented to the audience the Freiburg oath. Attendees raised the point that historically oaths or conventions have acted as no more than ‘gentlemen's agreements’ where there is no real obligation to abide, particularly in times of war or unrest. One attendee mentioned that the sharing clauses are contrary to the competitive element of iGEM. Another attendee questioned the motivation for publicising such an oath.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#unnatural base pair#uptake and biosynthesis_-_-_TEXT.html," purine and pyrimidine bases can be recycled and converted into the corresponding nucleotides through salvage pathways. Adenine can be recycled through conversion into AMP, a reaction that is catalyzed by the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and requires PRPP . AMP can then be subsequently converted into ATP or dATP as described above. Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) catalyzes the recycling of guanosine, a reaction that also requires PRPP as a donor for a phosphate. HGPRT also catalyzes the conversion of hypoxanthine to IMP which again is a precursor of GMP and AMP. The recycling of thymine involves two steps: in the first step, thymine is converted to thymidine by the thymidine phosphorylase. In a second step, thymidine is converted to TMP by thymidine kinase. Cytosine can be recycled by conversion to uracil, a reaction that is catalyzed by cytosine deaminase. Following the conversion to UTP, CTP is produced by CTP synthase. The recycling of bases saves intracellular energy, since the de novo synthesis requires large amounts of ATP. Therefore, the recycling of bases through salvage pathways is usually favored by cells.
Adaptions of the purine pathway used in C. Tiglium for the production of iso-Guanosine
The ordinary form of Guanosine is produced within the purine pathway. Thus, it is likely that the production of iso-guanosine  is realised inbetween these reactions.

Medium Wave Transduction
Background
Introduction
We have proved the concept of the chemical signal transduction and some of the result shows that it works well. In addition, we want to try something  interesting and innovative——to transduct the signal to the Trichoderma atroviride directly by electromagnetic wave, such as medium wave.
From this summer, we have turned our focus into creating a direct contact between electronic signal and biologic response,which we name it Electrobiologic Interface. We select medium wave as our electronic signal. This kind of interface is independent on chemical compound and our signal can directly spread in space without considering the weather or other factors. And by adjusting the strength of transmission, we can control different range of our Trichoderma atroviride to generate a specific strength of response. Furthermore, it's really a fantastic idea to combine the electronic machine and biologic response with medium wave. We desperately tried to construct such a interface.
TRPV-Ferritin
TRPV
TRPV1, the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1, is a highly selective calcium channel,which can response to heat shock as well as capsaicin and finally results in calcium influx. And the calcium influx will result in the expression of downstream genes controlled by calmodulin and its associated protein Calcineurin. Calcineurin can activate relative nuclear transcription factors to open the target gene. [1]
ferritin
Ferritin, a kind of protein can be found in almost all organisms, can store and release iron to balance the content in cell. The ferritin we use is a fusion protein of ferritin light chain,a flexible linker peptide and ferritin heavy chain. This proteinbinding with iron can form nanoparticles which can be heated when exposed to medium radio frequencies(RF). [2][3]

Introduction
In the field of cheap protein-extraction, cellulose binding domains (CBD) have made themselves a name. A lot of publications are available providing capture of a protein from the cell-lysate with a CBD-tag as a cheap purification strategy. Also enhanced segregation with CBD-tagged proteins have been observed. In this project the idea is different, the binding of our self-produced proteins to cellulose via a protein-domain-tag is taking advantage of the binding capacity of binding domains not only for purification reasons (it is still a great benefit), but also as an immobilization procedure for our laccases for later application.
Figure 1: Graphical sequence-alignment of <partinfo>K392014</partinfo> and the xyn10A gene of C.josui
To make a purification and immobilization-tag out of a protein domain, there are a lot of decisions and characterizations to do.
Starting with the choice of the binding domain, the first limitation is accessibility. The first place to look at is of course the Partsregistry . A promising Cellulose binding motif of the C. josui xyn10A gene (<partinfo>BBa_K392014</partinfo>) was found and ordered for the project right from the spot. After some research concerning the sequence of that BioBrick, it turned out that the part is not the CBD of the Xylanase as it should be, but the glycosyl hydrolase domain of the protein (Figure 1). This result made the part useless for the project ( complete review ) and it was the only binding domain in the Partsregistry that fitted to the project.
Accessible organisms were searched via NC"

INTRODUCTION
“Synthetic biology or biotechnology in general is the world wide web of the last century. I believe it going to change the world.” This was claimed by Randy Rettberg, founder of the iGEM competition during The European Experience 2016 iGEM meeting. The world wide web changed the society into something unrecognizable and unlikely to humans living at the beginning of the last century and according to him, synthetic biology will change the world in the same extent. This is why he in the first place founded iGEM. “Universities need to get behind the projects and give their students the opportunity to be part of something revolutionary”. He thinks that students who participate in iGEM will be a part of a process that will revolutionary change the way we for example create chemicals, feed the world and cure diseases. He hopes that iGEM will contribute positively to this process (Reichman, 2013) .
iGEM officially began in 2003 as a study course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In this course students where challenged to develop biological devices to make cells blink. In the year 2004, instead of the normal course, a competition with five teams from various universities form the United States was held. A year later also teams from outside the United States took part in the competition (Community, 2015) . Years prior to 2006 had no specific winners and therefore it may can be said that the competition, as we know it today, began life in 2006. This means that the competition in its current format could have celebrated its tenth anniversary last year. Therefore, it is a good moment to draw up the balance and to analyze what the influence and impact of iGEM was over the past 10 years.
In this study we will analyze iGEM. The 9 facets of iGEM are used to do this. These facets are respectively technology, teamwork, entrepreneurship, sharing, education, safety and security, responsibility and community. With this report we think that iGEM can be improved even future. We believe that iGEM has already proven its volub"

We learned a lot about Alzheimer’s this summer and we wanted to pass the information on. To do this in the best feasible way we made a quiz (data and corrext answers available here to find out what the public knew about the disease. The questions in our quiz are covering a broad spectrum of the general knowledge about Alzheimer’s.  We thought that when we knew what the public already knew and what they didn´t know we would decide what kind of information we wanted to promote on our website. We lounged the quiz at the festival and the Linkoping dementia association helped us to spread the word and to get people to answer. Since then we have had the link to the quiz up on our website and we have promoted the quiz on our Facebook page.
International Alzheimer's Day
The international Alzheimer’s day falls on September 21 and to acknowledge this day we decided to visit one of our towns nursing homes specialized in elderly with Alzheimer’s disease. We did this to get a better view of how people with different dementia diseases live and to see their daily routine. Five of the members from our team met up and went to the nursing home. We were greeted by one of the coordinators for the elderly care in Linkoping and she took the time to show us around.
At this nursing home they had a spa were the elderly could take a bath, get their hair cut or get their nails cut and painted.
Since patients with Alzheimer’s tend to get a loss in apatite they worked extra with that at this home. They had a private cook who focused on making the food look extra tasty and putting some extra thought in how they presented the food on the plates. They also had a routine of having some simple gymnastics before lunch in the purpose of increasing the elderly’s apatite.
At Sandrinoparken the staff have a working approach called IBIC – Individual Need In Center (Individens behov i centrum in Swedish) – which is a systematic way of working with person centered care. They make sure to put the individual needs in center. The elderly staying here can decide what planned activities to attend or not and also make requests for individual activities such as walks or spa-time.

Here we find that the optimal scenario is n2=3 and n4=5. The trend which has developed in this table will be discussed at the end of scenario 4.
Scenario 4 – modified parameters 3
Percentages are maximised if we have 10000000 times more galactose than methionine. See Figure 4a and 4b.
a)
b)
Figure 4. a) The percentage of parameter combinations tested that will give us bistability for various combinations of Hill coefficients. b) Graphical representation of 4a.
An interesting trend is seen in scenarios 3 and 4. The percentages increase to a maximum at n2=2 and n4=5 (n2=3 and n4=5 in scenario 3) and then decrease, quite rapidly, towards Hill coefficients of n2=5 and n4=5. In the parameter space, there is a region where bistability is possible. For the smaller Hill coefficients, the randomly chosen parameters (as described above) would allow the nullclines to have a shape such that they would cross three or more times and bistability is achieved. The higher Hill coefficients, however, for the same range of parameters, would have nullclines which were shaped so that they did not cross three or more times – in parameter space, they fall outside the region of bistability.
Conclusions
The ideal scenario is to change the parameters to that in scenario 4 and have Hill coefficients of n2=2 and n4=5. Here 98.17% of the parameter combinations tested gave bistability. Contrary to our initial assumptions, depending on the range of parameters, higher Hill coefficients are not always better. The parameters will dictate the shape and position of the nullclines and whether or not bistability is possible.
It is possible to determine the optimal values of the parameters for an ideal working of the switch. However, to change the parameters in the experimental construct so much would require much more time than we had available.

Edinburgh_OG,2018,Team:Edinburgh OG#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"ynthetic pathway towards producing PHBV co-polymer
Based on these assumptions, a model was developed expanding on the work done by the Stanford-Brown 2015 iGEM team. Their model originally outlines the system using irreversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics for PHB biosynthesis. However, understanding that the catalytic activity of our encoded PHA enzymes can go both ways (for example, the β-ketothiolase can both form acetoacetyl-CoA from 2 acetyl-CoA molecules via a Claisen condensation or can degrade the acetoacetyl-CoA back in the reverse direction), we deemed it was more appropriate to represent the kinetics of the system with the reversible form of the Michaelis-Menten equation (Imperial and Centelles, 2014). This has been shown in past literature to be preferred for in vivo scenarios. This applied to the enzymes encoded by phaA, bktB and phaB; however, the phaC enzyme is excluded as literature has shown the synthase activity to be unidirectional. Another enzyme is responsible for the degradation of PHAs into usable subunits; however, since this element is not present in E. coli, we can effectively disregard this.
Defining the dynamic model using a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
The reactions regarding the condensation and reduction of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA are two-substrate reactions; thus, we decided to represent this mathematically with the corresponding formulae (Cornish-Bowden 1993) shown above. The Michaelis constants (Km) factor in the enzymes' relative affinity to each substrate. These are also considered in the enzyme's catalytic efficency (ks, kp). You may find further details on the chosen parameters in our Github repository .
In the case of PHA synthase, since it directly incorporates 1 equivalent of 3HB-CoA or 3HV-CoA into a PHBV polymer, we represented this using a traditional irreversible Michaelis-Menten equation. The aforementioned means to represent influx of material is derived also from the Stanford-Brown 2015 model. In their model, they incorporated an enzyme called acetate synthase (encoded by acs) that produces acetyl-CoA from acetate and coenzyme A. We adapted this formula to represent the assimilation of both acetate and propionate and their subsequent conversion into their CoA-ligated forms.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

And maybe if I’m with my best friend, or my lab-mates, we’ll let out “ugh how do people believe this, it’s ridiculous!”. But then is it ridiculous? It’s our fault that we don’t communicate our stuff properly. We are so stupid and naïve if we get mad at people for not understanding when we don’t share our info. Everything is behind a paywall in horrible jargon. I can barely understand it and I’ve been in science my whole life! I try not to get mad and always be very inclusive.

Directed Evolution – a (very) short overview
After decades of continuous methodological advancement and increasing understanding of biomolecule structure and functionality directed evolution nevertheless is still the most powerful method in protein or aptamer engineering. Classic in vitro strategies, however, require substantial effort in terms of lab work and time investment to perform several consecutive rounds of evolution1,2. In order to automate the laborious process scientists have tried to devise systems that traverse the four steps of Darwinian evolution (mutation, expression, selection, replication) in a continuous cycle in vivo (reviewed in 3). In the earliest approaches this was achieved by simply cloning the gene of interest into mutator E. coli strains4 showing reduced DNA replication fidelity or into E. coli strains carrying inducible mutator plasmids5. While these settings proved to be useful for the generation of complex multifactorial phenotypes like organic solvent tolerance5 they cannot provide the regional selectivity that is desired in single-gene protein evolution as globally enhanced mutagenesis leads to slow growth and reduced transformation efficiency6 in addition to obscured phenotypic expression due to unwanted off-target mutations7,8.
Therefore, the ideal system for in vivo directed evolution would avoid those side effects by subjecting the host organism to locally confined hypermutation. Such an arrangement would allow the researcher to rapidly mutate and evolve a defined single sequence or gene while leaving the rest of the genome unchanged. Several strategies to locally constrain enhanced mutation rates have been devised so far; including plasmids harboring regions with low replication fidelity9, elaborate phage-assisted systems confining the accumulation of mutations to the phage genome while keeping the overall mutational load in the cell population in a steady state10 or retrotransposon-based methods11. Although definitely representing a large step towards the right direction, still none of the designs mentioned allow the continuous mutation of a single copy of a single gene in vivo. With D.I.V.E.R.T. we want to build a system that does.

Stuttgart,2018,Team:Stuttgart#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"armstadt 2017 has already described. We exchanged the chitin deacetylase from NodB to COD. Prior to cloning by restriction and ligation, we added a His-tag to COD ( BBa_K2380043 ) by PCR. In addition to the C-terminal His-tag a BioBrick suffix compatible SpeI restriction site was added.
After successful PCR (Figure C.4), product was digested using XbaI and SpeI. BBa_K2380002 was again used as vector. After opening the vector by SpeI restriction digestion and dephosphorylation by using alkaline phosphatase, ligation of COD + His-tag into the vector was performed overnight. The COD fragment could be inserted in either orientation. Therefore, 16 colonies were picked and colonyRCA was performed for amplifying circular (plasmid) DNA. The correct orientation was approved by restriction digestion using MscI and agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure C.5)
Figure C.4: 1% agarose gel of His-tag PCR using BBa_K2380043 as template. Expected fragment size is 1522 bp as indicated by red arrow.
Figure C.5: 1% agarose gel of RCA reaction after restriction digestion with MscI to check correct orientation of the COD ORF. Expected fragments are 2590 bp, 2355 bp and 318 bp.
Expression of BBa_K2380043 and BBa_K2848001 was performed using a culture volume of 250 mL. Cells were disrupted in phosphate buffer by high pressure homogenization using an EmulsiFlex C5 (Avestin, ATA Scientific). Proteins were purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (HisTrap column, ÄKTA, GE Healthcare) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Figure C.6).
Figure C.6: 12.5 % SDS-PAGE after His-tag purification of cell lysates and elutions from BBa_K2848001 and BBa_K2380043. For both constructs two approaches were analyzed.
NodC (approximately 21 kDa) and COD (approximately 45.5 kDa) could not be detected by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Further experiments are necessary to evaluate the expression of NodC and COD in the plasmid BBa_K2848001. Culturing and purification of BBa_K2380043 acted as a negative control because the COD on this plasmid has no His-tag for purification"
