Cloning results
We transformed the yeast to express OVA1, DEC-205 or OVA1-DEC205 on surface. We used AGA1P co-expression and AGA2P C-terminal fusion to the protein in order to get membrane presentation.
Figure 2: Plasmids with the constructions : A) AGA1P  (B) AGA2P-OVA1-DEC205 (C) AGA2P-OVA1 (D) AGA2P-DEC205
Surface display results
Before displaying our tumor antigen fused to the scFv DEC205, we first cloned the fusion protein AGA2P-GFP in order to observe surface display of GFP with our without the coexpression AGA1P. We obtained a GFP signal located around the membrane only in presence of AGA1P coexpression.
Figure 3: GFP fused to AGA2P observed in fluorescence microscopy. A) without AGA1P (B) with AGA1P (C) with AGA1P with Z-scale on one single yeast.
Conclusion
We have transformed a yeast producing high levels of GFP and surface displaying the protein through AGA1P. Instead of GFP, this chassis is ready to produce a high antigen loading to induce the strongest immune response.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"4 thoracotomies for benign lesions performed. Compared to the control, the false positive rate was a 3.1 times larger and patients were 4 times as likely to have an unnecessary thoracotomy. [2] With the risks of complications from diagnostic procedures, radiation exposure and effect on quality of life, there are major downsides to such a screening method. [4]
There is a lack of compelling evidence to support LDCT screening for lung cancer - however screening represents one of the most realistic prospects to reduce NSCLC mortality rates aside from reducing the numbers of smokers. With frequency and length of screening optimized to reduce false positives, LDCT may yet prove effective. [5]
Screening is also effective in many other cancers. However, the biology of the cancer has a strong effect on whether screening is likely to be useful. Screening would be redundant for indolent cancers - and treatment-related morbidities may mean it has a net negative impact. Screening is also ineffective for cancers which develop very rapidly, as they they are likely to present between screens. Therefore, very frequent screening is needed for high risk population groups but preventative action is usually more beneficial. [6]
Screening has a bias to detect indolent cancers, leading to overdiagnosis - often cancers detected will never become symptomatic or their progression would be so slow that the patient will die of other causes first. [7] Depending on organ type, indolent cancers account for 15-75% of those detected. Therefore, it is vital that a new method of screening can differentiate between indolent and progressive cancers.
MiRNAs have the potential to achieve this - it has been shown that a combination of miRNAs can identify NSCLC in asymptomatic individuals with 80% accuracy and  differentiate benign nodules from NSCLC tumors. [8] This would avoid the problems that accompany unnecessary further testing. Even if diagnosis still took place using LDCT screening, an effective way of measuring the relevant miRNAs (that our sensor could potentially provide) would be vital to classify a tumor and reducing overdiagnosis.
Our screening method could produce massive increases in the detection of stage I cancers with far lower cost and greater objectivity than current methods. It also could reduce the rates of overdiagnosis. Furthermore, the results of our test could conclusively rule out the possibility of cancer in certain individuals preventing the need for further investigation.
Benefits of our system
The problems with current diagnostic methods were also identified by doctors who completed our survey. Many patients have to undergo these tests - as there is no other way to rule"

Nematode parasites cost the agricultural industry lots of money and grief each year due to the many consequences they cause. Among many we can find severe health issues and resistance development in the most commonly occurring family of strongyles. There are currently no easy methods for the diagnosis of these parasites. By reprogramming a smart bacteria to detect and report the presence of the parasites, we aim to develop a simple diagnostic method. This will provide the tools necessary to help farmers both to make decisions on whether to treat their animals and prevent infection.
Small Strongyles
Cyathostominae
Small Strongyles
Small Strongyles or Cyathostominae are among the most common equine parasites, with more than 52 species in their family [2]. The infectious stage of small strongyles is when they’ve developed into larvae while still lurking in the grass. While horses graze, they consume the worms and the small strongyles continue to develop in the horses’ intestines, forming cysts in the intestinal wall [1]. When further evolved, these small strongyles can burst out from their cysts during late winter or early spring, moving up towards the intestinal lumen where they become adult worms [1, 9].
Statistics Box:
In a study of 461 horses in Sweden, 53,7 % of all horses were discovered to be infected [1].                          From July to September the prevalence was estimated to 78,4% in the horse population, indicating a seasonal trend for infection rate [1]. Similar trends are seen in Europe and North America showing reported cases with 100% of horses showing small strongyle infection [2].
Symptoms
The release of larvae from cysts can lead to lesions, diarrhea, and potential weight loss. This condition is called cyathostominosis [1]. When untreated, the death tolI can reach number up to 50%. During the seasonal rupture of cysts,  millions of larvae can be released at the same time, which can result in severe and life-threatening consequences [6]. The infection of small strongyles is not one of presence, but one of quantity. They are not dangerous in small amounts and therefore it is difficult to tell whether a horse needs to be treated or not [10].
By providing a better diagnostic tool, farmers will be able to know when to treat the horse in the purpose of avoiding mass rupture and severe consequences.
Methods of Detection
Currently the only method for detection and counting of how many worms"

Checked for how to pick the colonies and grow in which tubes for biobrick amplification in order to assemble them. Found that the tubes were not autoclaved. So poured the medium in 24x5 ml tubes and given for autoclaving at 3PM.
Wow I got the autoclaved culture tubes at 4:30 PM, so with excitement I picked colonies (literally scooped) from 11 plates and grown in 11 antibiotic containing tubes (10 with 1xAmp and 1 with 1xKan) in shaker at 160 rpm at 37 °C.

The BBa_K145280 had one colony. other ones didnt. It is not reccomendable to use this super fast protocol as it is very unreliable. 30 ml of LB 1x amp. was inoculated with this colony and put in a shaking incubator at 37 degrees and 160 rpm at 10:15.
I transformed DH5a competent cells with B0032, K145015, K145201 biobricks. I used the standard transformation protocol. Cells were incubated for 1h45m. at 37 degrees (accidentally not shaken) in 200µl SOC medium. Then 250µl of each transformation mix was plated on amp plates and put in the 37 degrees stove at 16:45.

Hangzhou-H14Z,2015,Team:Hangzhou-H14Z#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," 960- A.D. 1279). Not only do those lithic relics represent the cutting edge of stone carving technology in contemporary time, but also they provide historians and archaeologists with solid historical evidence.
        There are three main types of lithic relics in Hangzhou; they are stone sculptures, stone towers also known as Dhavaja, and stone inscriptions. The stone sculptures are primarily represented by Feilai Peak (飞来峰), Ciyun Ridge (慈云岭), and Statue of Mahakala in Baocheng Temple (宝成寺麻曷葛剌). Stone Towers are primarily represented by White Tower (白塔). Stone inscriptions are primarily represented by Hetingwuhe Fubei on Lonely Mountain (孤山放鹤亭舞鹤赋碑).
        Plus, Feilai Peak and White Tower are National Key Historical Relics.      Most lithic relics encounter physical, chemical and biological interaction, resulting in weathering corrosion, pulverisation lesion, cracking, contamination, and colour mottling. Those phenomena jeopardise the value of lithic relics and even lithic relics themselves, and the lithic relics in Hangzhou are not of exceptions.
        In 2002, some of the classic lithic relics were inspected and it was found that the surface of Feilai Peak Sculpture was greatly ruined (Figure 1), and there is leaking on Ciyun Ridge Sculpture (Figure 2)..
    Meanwhile, Cultural Relics Department of China has been trying to maintain and recover the lithic relics. Since 2002, Cultural Relics Department of China mainly has been removing surface deposit, depleting pounding, strengthening crag, and changing flora; the government washed Feilai Peak Sculpture for many times (Figure 3).Government built a top above the Ciyun Peak Sculpture, this relic no longer had to expose to sun and rain henceforward (Figure 4).
    White Tower was comprehensively cleaned and strengthened by silicone by Zhejiang University of Technology (Figure 5).
     The power plants and railways were removed. During the washing, the staff intentionally left part of this tower intact, and made an contrast for further research of anti-contamination and anti-weathering (Figure 5-3, 5-4)
    However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage. Some even"

Tec-Chihuahua,2017,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," we propose that the SDS-PAGE shown in Figure 1, where the protein of interest is expressed, was carried out correctly because of the protein's function, which is quorum quenching; this affects the production of important components of its biofilm, which consequently leads to its deficient production. When reviewing the literature on this, not much was found, Erwinia amylovora is a poorly studied bacteria.
Nonetheless, a comparison was made with an SDS-PAGE that was executed using the same methodology, changing only the organism used, which was Erwinia amylovora transformed with BBa_K2471003. As BBa_C0060 is registered as being a putative N-Acyl homoserine lactonase aiiA, this new BioBrick contains the genetic circuitry to correctly express our protein, whose sequence (that has small changes compared to BBa_C0060, with a molecular weight of 29.45340 kDa) is confirmed to indeed code for a N-Acyl homoserine lactonase aiiA. This part is a new addition to the Parts Registry, more information about it can be found in the silver section of our results.
Figure 3. SDS-PAGE (12%) of Erwinia amylovora transformed with BBa_K2471003.
In the same way as Figure 1, Figure 3 shows an appreciable band present at the approximate weight of 30 kDa, starting from the fourth hour onwards; meaning that this band is indeed the enzyme aiiA. With this, we establish that we characterized BBa_C0060 by proving that Erwinia amylovora can indeed express this protein.
Team TecCEM's Collaboration
The collaboration made by team TecCEM consisted in us sending them two different types of transformed Erwinia amylovora, one with our composite aiiA BioBrick (BBa_K2471000) and the other one with our composite epsE BioBrick (BBa_K2471002), and then doing the exact same protocol that we carried out for the characterization of the biopart BBa_C0060 that is presented above. The results that they generated were useful for an interlaboratory validation of what we obtained. Although we differed in the fact that they reported that the epsE enzyme was expressed, they did not have the point of comparison and bibliographical revision that we had. The results they generated are shown below.

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get

Modeling played a pivotal role in our project . It helped us: (i) incorporate expert’s input in designing novel metabolic engineering strategies; (ii) consolidate our understanding of the photosynthetic host and its adaptive strategies to diurnal light fluctuations; and (iii) guide our experimental design and the mimicking of industrial conditions. We extended a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of Synechocystis such that it could simulate the behavior of different synthetic constructs. This model was analyzed using state-of-the-art constraint-based techniques with the goal of designing a synthetic organism in which fumarate production directly from CO 2 is aligned with microbial fitness. Mimicking of industrial light regimes in the lab was achieved by deducing sinusoidal functions coupled with algorithms that generate stochasticity resembling the one cells encounter in production scenarios. Our modelling efforts combined culminated in the first in silico photosynthetic cell factories that produce fumarate day and night. This design has been successfully validated in other modules of our project.
Model
Aligning biomass and product formation
We have been alerted by experts in biotechnology at the onset of this project that phenotypic stability can be a real hurdle in the scaling up of biotechnology processes. A clever way to stabilize a production trait is to align the anthropogenic needs (i.e. high level production) with those of the production host (i.e. fitness). Although previously attempted in chemoheterotrophs [1], and also in cyanobacteria [2], this is easier said than done. Particularly for the latter, as typically these strategies involve coupling product formation to the ability of a cell to regenerate energy and redox cofactors. The caveat for photoautotrophs is that their systems to capture the energy of photons into chemical bonds has evolved to contain a large set of safety valves for electrons - alternative electron flow pathways. Removing these in silico leads to stable growth coupling on the computer screen - but unfortunately, not in the lab - as these cells become very crippled and unable to deal with very small light variations [3].
A closer inspection of metabolic network maps reveals that, Although often neglected, anabolic pathways are in reality mined with reaction that produce side-products, in addition to the intermedi"

Fundraising help and advice
We have met difficulties in the fund raising part from our colleges due to the lack of experience. Consequently, the fees of experiments was by the source of Professor Wu’s research group and our personal expenditures was partly covered by our advisers Qijun Liu and Lingyun Zhu where the rest of it was paid by ourselves.
Lab support
We conducted all of our experiments in the lab of Research Center of Biological Information of the College of Science of NUDT.
Difficult techniques support
Our lab was newly established and is short of the equipment which is able to do the nucleotide sequence screening. In light of this, we bought the sequencing service from InvitrogenTM. Our devices and systems of parts was all verified there. InvitrogenTM is also the one who provided us the prime synthesize service.
Most of our regents such as enzyme were bought from TaKaRaTM and some other bio-tech companies.
Project adviser support
In the process, we got help from our teacher Qijun Liu, Xiaomin Wu and Yunlv Zhu. They gave us precious advice and experience. And Xiaomin Wu also helped us in experiments.
Wiki support
Our wiki is established by adviser Qijun Liu and our group member Xinyuan Qiu; thanks to their proficiency in page source codes which written in HTML. Miyang Li, Niaohao Xie and Chuyuan Zhang provide relevant materials.

Fundraising & Donation
We held multiple fundraising sales, selling small ice cream dots (resembling NPs!) and Oreo fudge during our lunch periods in school, and making “glitter slime” at our school’s annual spring fair (see Spring Fair in the Outreach section above). (Team activity)
In total, we raised over $500 USD, and donated the money to two organizations:
WaterisLife is an organization that provides clean drinking water, as well as sanitation and hygiene education programs to schools and communities in need. We donated to this organization in hopes that more people will have access to clean water. Click here to donate to WaterisLife .
Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU) is a local organization founded in 1987 to promote public awareness and participation to prevent pollution and damage to public resources. Visit TEPU here .
OUTREACH
In Outreach, we raised awareness of the beneficial qualities and harmful consequences associated with NPs. We also educated the general public about NP usage, synthetic biology, and science in general. Lastly, we communicated with other iGEM teams to share ideas and collaborate on experiments.

Dr. Terrence Collins, Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry
Dr. Terry Collins was the green chemist that gave us the idea for this iGEM project. His research group is at the forefront of remediating endocrine disruptors in water using a enzymatic catalyst that they have synthesized. This process has taken about 35 years to reach at a level where the catalyst is ready to be introduced to bodies of water. Of course, the amount of catalyst that can be applied to the water system cannot truly be determined just yet because there is no real-time measuring sensor for the amount of estrogenic compounds in the water. Collins explained to us how the origin of endocrine disruptor research began when a woman questioned how all of the pharmaceutical chemicals that are not absorbed into our body, but disposed into the waste system would affect fetal development in pregnant women. What started as an internet blog expanded to included an international team of scientists dedicated to research different type of endocrine disruptors since estrogen is just the tip of the iceberg. This team compiled a report dedicated to figuring out the different tiers of endocrine disruption. Clicking on the thumbnail below will take you to a video by Dr. Terrence Collins describing this tiered approach.

She explained to us about the Pittsburgh water records that Carnegie Mellon has been keeping track of for over 5 years, which explains the water levels and a multitude of variables at different locations around the streams and rivers. VanBriesen also explained about how estrogen is considered a “sticky” molecule, in the sense that it would be absorbed rater quickly into the container that the water sample is in.

But as the layout and navigation bar is identical for every page, it is useful to have these elements at one central place, rather than copying the same information on every single wiki page. For this purpose MediaWiki can handle so-called templates. These templates are wiki pages themselves and can be included into other wiki page. The import of a template into another wiki page is accomplished by placing the name of the template between and opening ""{{:"" and a closing ""}}"", for example {{:Team:xyz/Templates/Layout}} will import the wiki page ""Team:xyz/Templates/Layout"". When this page is requested by a browser, the MediaWiki software will replace {{:Team:xyz/Templates/Layout}} with the content of the page Team:xyz/Templates/Layout (Please note, that MediaWiki always treats names in a case-sensitive manner). Another handy aspect about templates are so-called parameters that can serve as a placeholder for content. The great advantage araises from the fact, that you can import one template several times but each time you tell MediaWiki to replace the placeholder with another content. A placeholder or parameter is inserted by using ""{{{"" and ""}}}"" with the name of the placeholder inbetween. For example, the template page ""Team:xyz/Templates/Layout"" containing the placeholder ""{{{text}}}"" can be imported using {{:Team:xyz/Templates/Layout | text=This will be put into the template}}, where the {{{text}}} will be replaced by ""This will be put into the template"".
By now we already have enough knowledge to implement the basic layout of the wiki. We will use the table layout descirbed above and, to provide an easy-to-use wiki, we will split this table into different template page. The figure summaries the basic structure of the wiki:

Succinate could help Respiration
J_exp31
During our meeting with iGem, Charlotte clarified that using succinate as a carbon source is meant to promote respiration in the cell. I want to note that prior to the meeting, I also ran FBA on our N2 model with both glucose and succinate as carbon sources. I found that my max biomass and max ATP figures were identical to my original nitrogen fixing figures (with glucose as the sole carbon source). However, increased respiration would not appear in FBA, so Maggie suggested running FVA and comparing flux ranges for reactions in the citric acid cycle. The citric acid cycle provides a pool of chemical energy from the oxidation of pyruvate, so changes in flux ranges for reactions associated with this subsystem would imply changes in cellular respiration. After running FVA with the addition of succinate, I found that a majority of reactions in this subsystem had altered flux ranges in comparison to their original flux values. However, these changes were incredibly slight- i.e. less than a factor of 1*10^-2.
- Experiments From Jul 29
Start working with OptKnock
J_exp32
Laura and I began editing a OptKnock template that Maggie provided us. Some of these edits included our reaction input files and our ATP and percent biolevel constraints. We initially encountered some issues with getting our code to run, but we quickly identified them and were able to generate a list of potential double knockouts, which consisted of roughly 400 couples. At first glance, all of the double knockouts had the same max biomass and reduced flavodoxin levels. We set our percent biolevel to .9, so each double knockout had a max biomass value of 0.409 (.9 of 0.4545- i.e. our original max biomass value). We wanted to double check and see what effect these knockouts would have on max biomass and ATP levels in our model by running them through an iteration. Laura wrote a python code that splits a reaction input file into a series of coupled-knockouts, given our previous OptKnock output file only lists the couples without pairing them. She originally had to generate this code to run her gene knockouts, so all we really had to do was substitute in our new input file. While Laura edited her python code, I went ahead and ran OptKnock"

Today is our 1st meeting. We are a team of 9 consisting of 2 junior year students and 7 sophomore year students.
Today we discussed about team organization and task allocation. Ting-Ting was given the chance to the team leader while Steven and Li-Yi are the in-charge of system designation. We also plan our schedule so that we could make it in time.
It was quite an awkward meeting because somehow it was like when we were small going to kindergarten the 1st week. Though we study in the same campus, but due to different courses, we barely know each other.  But it was very fun making new friends.

Today Prof. Ingrid from Dept. of  Molecular Biology and Human Genetics  want to interview us before she promise us to be our team advisor.

Summer is finally here! Weather is so hot and humid.
We had lunch together before we start our meeting. We were solving the problem of carbon dioxide produced by oxidation of carbon monoxide. The most ideal method is to use either plants or algae to convert the CO2 to biomass which is then processed to produce biofuels. However after long discussion with Professor Chen, we realized that we couldn’t reach that goal in such short period but we can design the host bacteria to use the Carbon Monoxide as one of the carbon source. It’s not a bad idea after all =D
2011.06.30
We all did some research on how Carbon Monoxide affects human body and what concentration level of CO is a concern. Carbon monoxide exposure levels are measured in parts per million or ppm. Steven and Joanne found out that different country has different standards. It was quite confusing because the figure is of big difference. However, after discussion with professor we knew that the risk allowance is also included in it, which is why the safety limits are not the same.  Therefore, we can know conclude that, the safety standard is affected by the ppm of carbon monoxide and also the risk allowance.

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," most. All results are plotted in percentages. Results from Basel are to be interpreted with care because of the small number of answers.
While the proportion of positive answers to the question “Does a sufficient interaction exist between the general public and scientists?” from Lausanne and Basel was very similar (around 25% of positive answers), highschool students were more categorical (less than ten percent of positive answers).This encouraged us to further investigate the issue of interaction in scientific research in our main article.
Since we believed to have observed a link between the question “Are you favourable to engineered wheat strains that easily adapt to climatic conditions ?” and the one asking “What is your opinion on GMOs ?” during our public survey in Lausanne, we decided to compare the overall answers to the two questions. The results from Basel and Lausanne underline the unpopularity of the acronym GMO. Opinions are more nuanced among highchool students, with half of them being favorable to the modified wheat strain. In addition, a majority of them were favorable to the use of GMOs, which was neither the case for the general public in Lausanne nor in Basel. An possible explanation to this discrepancy is the students' background in biology and chemistry students. However, we have to mention that many students left a comment next to the answer of the second question, stating that using GMOs requires caution both on a technical and economic level.
The collected opinions concerning the practical examples of organisms designed with synthetic biology were especially different among the three audiences we surveyed for the 3 applications seen below. While favorable opinions on “Bacterium that produces plastic”, “A minesweeper game made with bacteria” and the “Piece of art made with multicolored bacteria” were all above the fifty percent mark in Basel and Lausanne, the same ideas did not seduce the students. Their lack of enthusiasm with respect to the minesweeper game reminded us that we were 90s kids...
Our first conclusion to this series of surveys, is that there is a clear feeling among the general public that interaction between them and scientists is insufficient. We also noted the unpopularity of the word “GMO”, which contrats with the popularity of synthetic biology and most of its applications.         We discussed these main findings (along with the other results) with various specialists in our main article : Interaction and Communication in Scientific Research

Some even have distraction in main stone body. Meanwhile, there grows moss. Indoor stone inscriptions though are visible; there are obvious and irremovable cracks.
     Today, most preservation of lithic relics employ physical, chemical, or engineer approaches no matter where. It has been proven by reality that each of those approaches has fatal disadvantages for long-standing preservation of lithic relics, and those disadvantages would even lead to the ruin of lithic relics.
    Since forever, there are two categories of methods to preserve-- organic and inorganic. Organic materials cannot reach the standard of time to preserve relics such as epoxy resin, acrylic resin, silicone, etc.; inorganic materials would form hard shell that is not compatible or even react with the lithic relics, such as lime, barium hydroxide, and sulphuric acid.
     In conclusion, finding a long-standing, inexpensive, and efficient method to preserve lithic relics is an impending issue.

Principles of experiments
    The documents cited shows that even after natural weathering, biological decomposition, and acid rain erosion for a time period of time, some stone inscriptions, which are on rock surface containing calcium, remain in good condition because there is a thin layer of naturally formed semitransparent mineralised film that is hydrophilic and compact on such rock surface.
     In some part under the fine film, knife scratches on the stone from over a thousand years ago are still visible indistinctly. According to solid analysis, natural mineralised film is primarily composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate [Ca(COO)2·H2O] whose process of composition is interfered by microorganism.
     There are some advantages of calcium oxalate being a film as follows,
        1) In water, especially in acidulous water, the solubility of calcium oxalate is one order of magnitude smaller than normal calcium carbonate.
        2) Organically oriented calcium oxalate crystal's particles are fine and compact, which prevent the infiltration of toxic and harmful materials.
        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate rock and calcium"

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Oxford,2018,Team:Oxford#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"ATMP Classification
The classification of treatment is important in determining the right regulatory bodies you must go through. Our treatment would likely count as an Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) according to the European Medical Agency (EMA). The EMA’s Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) advise on whether a treatment would be considered an ATMP and what type it would be, such as a cell or gene therapy. We found a previous therapy involving modified Lactococcus lactis engineered to produce anti-TNF alpha antibody fragment for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis. From this we can assume our treatment would be classified as a gene therapy medicinal product. To confirm this we have submitted an application for ATMP classification with CAT from the EMA which we are waiting to hear back from. More information on reasons for this classification as well as our submitted form can be found on the product design section. We believe the form can be used as a reference for others seeking classification of new types of medicinal therapy in the EU.
Delivery
As a new type of medicinal product it is also important to determine how we can successfully deliver the device to the gut.We had been considering how our product would be delivered to the gut from early on the project. Our aim was to develop a 'friendlier' treatment but it is important to consider the possibilities for a probiotic in order to maximise the likelihood of colonisation in the gut. Further details on delivery can be found in product design.
Dr Nick Thomson
Quadram Institute, Norwich
Dr Thomson gave us an invaluable insight into the delivery mechanisms of probiotics and how to ensure the probiotic bacteria establish a niche within the microbiome. He gave us guidance on the types of strain to use in the probiotic product, introducing us to studies demonstrating that VSL#3 (a polybiotic solution containing many different probiotic bacterial strains) can be taken orally to improve Crohn’s disease. This gave us a useful direction for our research into probiotic strains and probiotic delivery. He also gave us useful ideas for areas of further research to test our product, such as using a model colon - with varying concentrations of oxygen and carbon, to test the bacteria in environments similar to the natural colon. He also praised our kill switch designs, again highlighting the importance of addressing the safety concerns associated with GM probioitcs.
Dr Chris Barnes

Dr Barnes provided useful information about the colonisation of probiotic bacteria in the gut, demonstrating the importance of choosing the right chassis. He also suggested that we should focus on controlling the bacterial population size"
UCAS,2016,Team:UCAS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," toxin 1204 and toxin 6249, all of which have RGP_Ptec promoter and are therefore regulated by tetracycline antibiotics. These plasmids are introduced into bacteria cells. We respectively measured the bacteria growth under different concentration of anhydrotetracycline(aTc), which induce the expression of toxin.

Fig. 3 shows the growth of bacteria with toxin 1204 plasmid. The big gap between $0.8{\rm{\;ug}}/{\rm{ml}}$ and $1.0{\rm{\;ug}}/{\rm{ml}}$ can be noticed at the first glance, and this switch phenomenon is analyzed later. We fit the data with methods that mentioned previously, toquantify how parameters in growth function change with toxin. The results are shown in Fig. 4

Effect of toxin on the parameters in growth equation. Parameter ${{\rm{N}}_{\rm{m}}},{{\rm{\mu }}_{\rm{m}}}\;{\rm{and}}\;q$  of bacteria with different toxin plasmids in different concentration of aTc are estimated by Runge-Kutta and PSO methods. GFP stands for the control group.
The switch phenomenon is merely a speculation so far; we need to carry out scientific examinations. The problem is equivalent to test the hypothesis that there is significant difference in the values of parameters ${{\rm{N}}_{\rm{m}}},{\mu _m},q$ between experimental groups and control groups. Since the measurements are not accurate, we think that a maximum difference of 5% is appropriate. The hypothesis we are going to test is as follows:
{{\rm{H}}_0}:\left| {{{\rm{N}}_{\rm{m}}}\left( {{\rm{toxin}}} \right) - {{\rm{N}}_{\rm{m}}}\left( {{\rm{RGP}}} \right)} \right| < 5{\rm{\% }}{{\rm{N}}_{\rm{m}}}\left( {{\rm{RGP}}} \right)

A ‘G’ or ‘C’ at position 1
At least five ‘T’ or ‘A’ residues from positions 13 to 19

Calculating silencing probability
Our software siRCon should report not only the sequences of potential effective siRNAs, but also rank them based on the probability with which they are effective. This is calculated with the help of Bayes’ theorem by calculating probabilities of dependent events. The following calculations and formulas are based on Takasaki (2009). TThe initial hypothesis is that the given siRNA effectively silences an mRNA. To perform the calculations, a prior probability is necessary. The prior probability for effective gene silencing of mammalian genes can be obtained from former siRNA experiments and is approximately "
ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," If the patient is also resistant to glucocorticoid, we add imuran(AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine(6-MP). Note that patients with severe lesions should use intravenous corticosteroid, and for nonresponder , we consider to use intravenous cyclosporine or to operate, which remove the whole colon and rectal mucous membrane. Some foreign countries use infliximab or adalimumab to induce and maintain remission. But this treatment is not widely used in our country.
Crohn's disease(CD) may involve the whole digestive tract, any place from oral cavity to crissum, typically at the terminal of small intestine, which is ileum and ileocecus. It is an inflammation covered the whole layer. The general pathology of CD is fissuring ulcers and changes in mucus pattern, which will make intestinal tract become narrow and induce the formation of internal/external fistula, characterized by bellyache, fever, abdominal mass and hematochezia/ melaena. We mainly use glucocorticoid to induce remission, supplemented with 5-ASA preparation. To maintain the remission, we mainly use AZA or 6-MP. If it is difficult for glucocorticoid to induce remission, we can try the methotrexate(MTX), cyclosporine(CsA) and infliximab. The latter applies more but there exists the primary/secondary drug resistance problems.
Ulcerative colitis is less difficult to treat relatively. Patients with poor therapeutic effect can choose to have a operation, which is considered to be a radical cure of disease. ( Of course, not every patient in our country will accept the fistulization at the end of ileum. However, PORCH operation is not spread widely currently. ) Patients who have had ulcerative colitis over 10 years has an increased risk of colon cancer. It is more difficult to treat Crohn's disease, because recurrence tendency always exists throughout one's life. Operation can only deal with the problem that intestinal tract become narrow, get block or bleeding. What’s more, it often brings up anastomotic recurrence, thus we mainly consider medicine as a treatment. However, many CD patients require to undergo surgery once or twice all their life, facing the risk of short bowel syndrome.
Actually I think that particular case is not the key point, and learning some common sense about the disease is more meaningful than individual cases.

In order to better understand what exactly was worrying the general public about the usage of synthetic biology, we asked the subject to pick his/her main concerns in the following list: ethics, environment, social, national security, religion and health. Several answers were allowed. The most chosen answer was “environment”. Again, we can observe this association between synthetic biology and environment. “Ethics” only differs by a few answers.
Also, we included a question coming from the Swiss Institute of Technology in Zürich (ETHZ) which intended to determine what was most important between sensitivity and specificity in cancer diagnosis. The results show mixed feelings, and people often took some time to think before answering.
The themes developed in this analysis are discussed in depth in our main article.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Specificity_-_-_TEXT.html," of protein in the 100 kDa bands and the control bands was significant, or whether the proteins were recognized as contaminants by the MaxQuant software.
Analysis of the LC-MS/MS results is shown in Figure 18, a volcano plot. The x-axis plots the protein abundance ratio between the 100 kDa band and its respective control band, while the y-axis plots the p-value of this difference in protein abundance. Therefore, a protein in the left half of the plot is more abundant in the control bands, while the opposite goes for proteins in the right half of the plot. The higher it is on the y-axis, the more significant this difference is.
Contaminations such as keratins and the trypsin used to digest the samples should not differ significantly between the samples. This is also shown in Figure 18, as most contaminants (the orange data points) are present in the bottom half of the volcano plot. The relative label-free quantification (LFQ) intensity of the significant proteins shown in Figure 18 was very low, in all cases lower than the LFQ intensity of trypsin. From a biological perspective, this makes sense; there is no reason for an organism to produce mass amounts of alanine tRNA ligase, which was one of the significant peptide matches.   However, this and the fact that only 3% of peptides could be matched indicates that the 100 kDa protein was not present in the prepared Lysinibacillus sequence database. Therefore, the peptides were also matched against a Bacillus database. If the 16s rRNA sequence was wrong, this could be a more suitable database. However, the expanded database yielded similar results. Genomic DNA was extracted from V82 and sent for sequencing so the LC-MS/MS data could be run against the isolate's own DNA. This genomic DNA was also analyzed with the Toxin Scanner .
We were able to isolate Bacillus-like strains from dead Varroa mites and we could show that one of them overexpressed a protein at a size of interest. This isolate was sent for genomic sequencing; analysis of the ~100 kDa proteins was performed with the Toxin Scanner.

CR and TA riboregulator system
Figure 1. Riboregulator Overview Diagram
Artificial cis-repressing and trans-activating riboregulator system was introduced to the iGEM community by Isaacs in 2005. The riboregulator system as a whole acts to regulate translation at the RNA level. One component of the system, crRNA, which contains a cis-repressing sequence at the 5' of the RBS, the RBS, and the gene of interest.
The cis-repressing sequence can form a loop form complementary base pairs with the RBS to prevent the recognition of RBS by ribosomes. The translation crRNA is also commonly described as a ""lock"" because it ""locks"" the RBS and prevent translation. The ""key"" to this system is the taRNA. taRNA can interact       (in trans) with the cis-repressing sequence to unlock the RBS and therefore activate translation (Figure 1.).
The benefits of this system, as described in Isaacs et al.'s paper, are leakage minimization, fast response time, tunability, independent      regulation of multiple genes etc.

The Illinois iGEM team has been working to engineer a decoder function within E. coli. Decoders are logic devices used frequently in low-level computer architecture. We are creating a 2 to 4 decoder, which takes two binary inputs to activate one of four outputs. Each output corresponds to a specific combination of the inputs. With the presence of lactose and arabinose, our Bacterial Decoder will express Green Fluorescent Protein. If only lactose is present, a different fluorescent protein will be expressed. This goes for the other two combinations as well (only arabinose, or neither sugars). To implement logic we use combinations of small non-coding RNAs and transcription factors. The system allows the next engineer to swap standard parts in and out to change the inputs and outputs. Our Bacterial Decoder can help sense for multiple environmental cues, having implications for medical diagnostics and environmental and water contaminant detection.
For a more detailed description of our project, please see our Project page .
Our team is also excited about the project that the Illinois Tools team has chosen.  Please visit their Wiki page to view their project.

Radioactive, explosive, chemical and biological agents

Satellite information
Although our system is highly versatile, it has two notable     drawbacks when it comes to transfer of confidential data. Synthesis     of DNA carrying the encrypted data is expensive and time-consuming,     and is currently the biggest bottleneck in our process (although     this is bound to change with advances in  DNA synthesis     technology). Furthermore, people do not want to share their secret     data with a third party that synthesizes the DNA. Both of these     issues can easily be overcome by having the third party only     synthesize the key, which is far shorter than the encrypted     information. This way, the user sends the secret data via     conventional means, and the key inside spores. This method of     secure data transfer is faster, cheaper and simpler than encoding     all of the data in DNA, but does not benefit from DNA’s incredibly     long shelf-life.
Data Archiving
Data archiving refers to the transfer of data that is not     actively used onto a separate storage medium for long-term storage.     Such data may be important for future reference (old email     messages, scientific data, medical records), or needs to be     preserved to comply with regulations (records of legal proceedings,     phone records). Data archiving is of vital importance to many     organizations, such as IT companies and legal firms, as improper     archiving can result in fines and legal sanctions, not to mention     expensive and time-consuming data discovery searches. Furthermore,     scientific data generated by institutions like CERN must be     preserved for years in order to verify future discoveries.
Although data archiving is often mistaken for making backup     copies of data, there is a  notable difference between the two.     Data backups are copies of data which allow the recovery of     information that has been destroyed or corrupted. Data archives, on     the other hand, preserve older data that does not need to be     accessed regularly, in order to reduce the use of the primary form     of data storage.
There are several forms of data archives, each with their own     benefits and disadvantages. Cloud-based data"

We found out that there are 2 options to insert the genes to the yeasts:
1. Plasmids, which will give us more enzymes in the cells but the difference between cells is high (10,000 times more enzymes between cells).
2. We can insert it to the yeast`s genome which will be more stable between cells but we will receive less enzymes in general.
- We need to decide how we want to insert the genes to the plasmids, using restriction enzymes or gibson technic.
- Restriction enzymes might cut inside the gene so we need to check all the different sequences that we want to use and maybe even change them a bit so it wont happen. Mosquna thinks that gibson technic might be easier because of that.
- We should check if we can use gibson technic for biobrick creation.

iGEM Japan Meet up 2013
On August, 25, we held the “iGEM Japan Meet up” in our university and invited the iGEM teams in Japan. In this year, these following 7 Japanese teams participated in this event.
UT-Tokyo
Kyoto
Tokyo_Tech
Tokyo-NoKoGen
HokkaidoU_Japan (They participated in Skype)
TUPLS-Tokyo (They are going to participate in the iGEM in 2014.)
TMU-Tokyo (Host)
We planned this event because we wanted to make the opportunity of information sharing among Japanese teams. Also we wanted to make the opportunity to communicate with other teams.
In this event, each team gave about 20 minutes presentation about their project. And after finish the presentation, we followed with a question and answer period. Many people asked positively a lot of questions to presenters and it was a good opportunity to get objective opinions for their projects.
After the all teams except TUPLS-Tokyo finish their presentation, we offered some foods, drinks, and snacks to them. We really enjoyed and had a good time to communicate with other teams. We believe that participants enjoyed too.
We’ll keep this connection with the other Japanese team as long as possible.
Contribution to ""TUPLS-Tokyo""
We have supported a new iGEM team from Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, “TUPLS-Tokyo”. This team was established     in 2013, and they are going to participate in the iGEM competition in 2014.
In June, we knew that some students of Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences established new iGEM team. In order to support the team, we held a meeting on June 30 and invited them to our university. Before this meeting, we received a lot of question about our team and our project from them. So we made the document which has the answers to their questions. We also guided our experiment space and let them show our laboratory instrument and experimental protocol. Additionally, We invited them to the iG"

Microplastics: Small and Deadly
Plastic pollution is something that we hear about often these days.  Increased global plastic production coupled with the fact that plastics can take centuries to biodegrade produces a major problem.  You might visualize the plastic pollution problem in terms of sea turtles with plastic bags over their heads, but these macroplastics—large plastic items such as bags and bottles—represent only one facet of the larger problem.  A second, often overlooked portion of the problem is pollution by microplastics.  Microplastics, like those in Figure 1, are defined as plastics less than 5 mm in diameter and can come either from degradation of larger plastic debris or products that directly use these small plastics.1 Microplastics are incredibly prevalent in our oceans, having been found to be four hundred times more prevalent than macroplastics, by weight.2
But, don’t take our word for it; listen as Brandis Friedman of WTTW Chicago reports on ""Tiny plastic microbeads pile up into a problem for the Great Lakes"".
We agree with David St. Pierre of the Metropolitan Water Treatment Plant of Greater Chicago “If we deal with [the issue of microbeads] on front end, we take care of it before it’s a problem by eliminating it as a pollutant source…[this would be a] very inexpensive way to deal with the problem.”4 However, facial scrubs and toothpastes are not the only products releasing microplastics into the environment.  They can also come from polystyrene packaging, discarded fishing line, and importantly, washing machine effluent.  Synthetic clothing is becoming increasingly common throughout the world, and these nylon, polyester, and acrylic fabrics release small fibers into the water during washing which are inadequately collected by the machine or water treatment plants, thus releasing them to the environment.  Sampling has shown that a single synthetic garment can release as many as 1900 fibers in a single wash, which amounts to a massive amount of pollution when one considers the millions of synthetic clothes that are washed on a daily basis. 5

The Yarowia lipolytica PO1f Δku70 pSB1A8YL:Proinsulin transformants and controls were observed under a YFP filter. No difference between the pSB1A8YL:Proinsulin and the control was observed. Although, it was noted that the pSB1A8YL:Proinsulin strain grew significantly slower both on the plates and in liquid media suggesting that there are some difference between the pSB1A8YL:Proinsulin and control strain.                                   3A assembly of pTEF, proinsulin, GFP, proinsulin:GFP and the entire gBlock into pSB1C3.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," to further explore human (patient-related) issues in continued development of SMITe - Health
Teaching:
This educational programme of case studies gave our students the basic knowledge to understand important concepts and applications in synthetic biology.
In the final months we introduced the science underpinning SMITe- which we hoped was now accessible to their understanding - and asked them to reflect on how the problem of long term wounds and the need for repeated antibiotic prescriptions are affecting us all on a global scale.
This work culminated the in addition to our Wiki of a student designed antibiotic resistance warning campaign.
Evolving:
Bio Makers: Our first public presentation of the SMITe concept occurred early in the iGEM calendar. We communicated our idea to a biology-curious cohort of members of the public at the swedish Bio-makers conference, and had the opportunity for a critique of our basic plans.  This was a test of how acceptable and understandable our concept really was and gave us the valuable opportunity to seek feedback on barriers to future implementation.
Questions we were presented with included:
Where does SMITe go once it has broken down the biofilm? Does it make the wound more wet or offensive to look at or smell bad? (or good?)
Are there actual spiders in the wound!? (This was a concerning issue for many people)
Can it be used for any wound and if not, why?
Does it hurt when it is put on open wounds?
Of course, for many of these questions we are still not far along enough in our research to be able to answer. However, it certainly gave us food for thought and made a big impact on how we communicated the concept more broadly...to avoid the worry of actual spiders being involved!
We even incorporated this into our crowdfunding campaign video...to make the issue crystal clear!
Community
Primary school:  Through our workshop based education programme, we introduced the concept of SMITe to young children at school (aged 9-11). Constituting another level of public engagement about the principles of this project, we set the task of thinking about what other purposes spider silk could serve in order to improve our daily lives. We challenged them to be as innovative and futuristic as possible... but as always when working with children, the results were surprising: several examples are shown below. (The final part of the web resource was a short video about a scientist who had trialed human skin samples reinforced with spider silk and demonstrated they could be bullet proof...I think this struck a cord with the students!)

So we brainstormed a work-around. Why not have students go out and collect water samples from their local environment as a pre-activity assignment? Not only did this circumvent the difficulty of organizing a field trip, this also gave students a sense of ownership - a sense of individual responsibility that we had previously identified as an important factor in a successful civic engagement initiative.
The second obstacle Ms. Moriarty mentioned are the constraints imposed by teaching to a curriculum. However we identified the following AP Biology standards that the lesson plan could fulfill, allowing our lesson plan to be more easily integrated into an AP Biology curriculum:
Essential Knowledge: 4.B.1 - Interactions between molecules affect their structure and function
Science Practice: 5.1 - The student can analyze data to identify patterns or relationships
Learning Objective: 4.17 - The student is able to analyze data to identify how molecular interactions affect structure and function
In regards to improving our lesson plan for wider acceptance, Ms. Moriarty made the following four suggestions:
Providing a teacher’s guide with detailed background information about the project because teachers have to fully understand the project before they can teach it,
Providing an outline of how to carry out the lesson with suggested prompts and a sense of timing,
Providing a deck of powerpoint slides to show to the class, and
Providing assessment questions/worksheets
Through collaborating with CRS and talking with Ms. Ann Moriarty, we gained an appreciation for the depth of thought required in developing an engaging and implementable lesson plan. This appreciation was deepened through our conversation with Dr. Chris Pagliarulo, Associate Director of Instruction & Assessment at the Office of Undergraduate Education at UC Davis.
Dr. Pagliarulo talked about how designing an educational activity is a process by which you identify objectives and criteria for success, come up with a prototype, test it, evaluate it based on criteria, and iteratively refine it.  This sounded just like the engineering design cycle! We were engineering an educational plan.
Lesson Plan Engineering
As in any other engineering process, Dr. Pagliarulo highlighted the importance of defining lesson plan objectives (design goals or objectives) to more easily assess whether the lesson plan achieved its goal.  We identified several design objectives for the lesson plan:
The lesson plan must help an instructor teach or reinforce one or more of the Next Generation Science Standards and"

Overnight cultures of ParC3, MutS, MutH2, DnaE, DinB1, MutY7, MutD5, and MutD8 miniprepped. Made additional overnight cultures of the above for glycerol stocks. mutY quikchange plates from 8/19 show a few colonies on the 2-step mutagenesis samples; these colonies have been used to inoculate overnight cultures. Ran 2-step quikchange protocol on DnaE, ParC, and mutH containing plasmids. Transformed yesterday’s IPTG+GFP+Umu’C/mutL ligation products as well as just IPTG+GFP into XL1Blue cells. paroF and TyrR were PCRed from genomic DNA and fragment isolated. paroF was digested and ligated into the mCherry plasmid, and TyrR into the promoter plasmid and the ligation products transfomed into XL1Blue. Mutation rate assay: 1 rif-resistant colony observed across 16 XL1Blue selective plates (plated on 8/19): likely a function of low plated cfu concentration. Significant growth on 2 rif80 plates platedwith  rif-resistant bacteria from 8/19 further confirming that rif concentration is not an issue. Plated yesterday’s Dam 200ul culture aliquots on selective media as well as non-selective test plates (10^6,10^7,10^8 dilutions for three cultures).

After incubation according to the DNA fragment size (5 minutes at room temperature (15–25°C) for ≤4 kb; 5 minutes at 50°C for 4–10 kb; 10 minutes at 50°C for >10 kb), samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds. Supernatant, which contained the purified DNA, was pipetted into a clean tube.
Ligation
For ligation of DNA fragments, the mixture was prepared as follows:
... µl DNA (=<200ng in total-> 20-70ng Backbone)
2 µl buffer
1 µl ligase (T4)
... µl water
=> 20 µl in total
After an incubation for 2 minutes at room temperature, or for 1h or over night at 4°C, the product was loaded on an gel for electrophoretic separation of the DNA fragments.
Nucleotide Removal
For removal of excess nucleotides after enzymatic reactions, the QIAquick® Nucleotide Removal Kit (QIAGEN) was used. All solutions were prepared as recommended by the manufacturer. Ten volumes of Buffer PNI were added to 1 volume of the sample and mixed. The QIAquick spin column was placed in a provided 2 ml collection tube and sample decanted to it. The tube was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 1 minute. Flow-through was discarded and the column placed back into the collection tube. Afterwards, 750 μl Buffer PE were added, incubated for 2-3 minutes and centrifuged for 1 min at 3800 x g (6000 rpm). Flow-through was discarded and the column placed back into the collection tube. The column was centrifuged for an additional 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm) to remove residual buffer. Finally, the column was put into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and 20-30 μl water (55°C) was added to the center. After 1 minute incubation the sample was centrifuged for 1 minute at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm). The 1.5 ml tube now contained the eluted and purified DNA.

British_Columbia,2011,Team:British Columbia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," will leave the dying tree and move on to the next host tree. And in the upcoming years following the attack, the tree will turn gray with very little foliage left on the tree. Throughout this entire process, most wood is unsalvageable, due to the bluish-black stain left behind on the wood by the fungi and consequently the degrading value of the wood. With vast amount of pines being killed, this has also become a fire hazard for B.C forest. The mountain pine beetle has always been present in nature and has never been a problem until the beginning of this century. Recent climate changes has resulted in warmer than usual winters which has permitted the survival of these beetles during the winter. Therefore, its population has grown substantially over the past 15 years. The government of Canada and B.C.’s Ministry of Forestry has already committed over $956 million dollars to mitigate the spread of the MPB to more pine trees in B.C. However, no permanent solution has been found so far.
Despite not finding a solution to the MPB infestation, a lot of research and time has already been invested in studying the genetics and molecular systems of the three players involved: the pine tree, the mountain pine beetle, and the blue stain fungus. Interestingly, it was noted that not all pine trees in outbreak area are infested with the MPB. This begs the question: why do not all pine trees get attacked or infested by the pine beetle? Researchers have explored this question and in genomic studies comparing attacked pines to those left unharmed, a greater expression of genes related to monoterpene production, were observed in unharmed trees relative to the genetic expression in attacked trees. In nature, these monoterpenes (molecular formula C10H16), a class within the family of terpeniods, are synthesized and secreted by trees as a defence mechanism against insect and fungi infestation within the tree. Despite this finding, the bluestain fungus has also adapted itself very well to the tree’s natural defenses by metabolizing these terpenoids and removing it from its system; and hence is able to survive under these toxic conditions. However, researchers have postulated that the blue stain fungus is able to evade these conditions only by attacking stressed trees, where levels of monoterpenes produced are less than normal and thus more susceptible to attacks.
Objectives
The 2011 UBC iGEM team aims to address both aspects by engineering and validating yeast that produce monoterpenes with high yield at low cost as a potential system for identifying anti-fungal monoterpenes"

VISIT SOME AUTHORITATIVE CORPORATIONS
When several constructions of gene had been finished and tests had been carried out, the COFCO which is the one of the top 500 corporations and the most advanced food suppliers in China became our next interviewee.Some of the managers showed up to welcome us and  they are the principal of innovating new product—Mrs.Zhao, the one of vice chairmen of the company—Mr.Huang and the doctor who is responsible for the manipulating of electronic tongue technique—Mr.Liu.We had a long but meaningful chat about the current device used by most of the  food producing companies, which made us realize that the generally used machine’s range is so limited that it is hard to measure the sweetness conveniently as well as some devices like electronic tongue technique would only be efficient after the association with the assessment given by workers, which results in the humongous uncertainty.Therefore, an innovative bio system which relies on Synthetic Biology to observe and select new types of sweeteners will have a non-negligible contribution to the society.Finally, we accept the advice which came from COFCO and what they suggest is to let us start with some classical and conventional sweeteners like stevia rebaudiana,  liquorice and Momordica grosvenori.
COOPERATION WITH OTHER UNIVERSITIES
At the latter phases of our project, we organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University etcetera to make a big chat about what we had done so far and held three scientific speeches to introduce the development and the common use of sweeteners in our daily life, which contributed to the increase of popularity of iGEM as well as Synthetic Biology.Ultimately, we collected the critical advice from the audiences in time and accept one"

Gene-technology article selection:
An article is not considered to be gene-technology related if it doesn’t contain at least one of the following word: gene(基因), genetically-modified(基改), sequence(定序), DNA.
An article is not considered to be gene-technology related if it is a discovery of new gene.
Attitude analysis
The attitude of an article is considered to be positive if it contains positive wording, including ‘happy’, ‘look forward to’, ‘promising’. And that sentence doesn’t mean to sarcasm or any other way to express other than positive feelings.
The attitude of an article is considered to be negative if it contains negative wording, including ‘opposed’, ‘ban’ and other words that mean to bring negative effect to the audience.
Research Approach
In examining the reporting practices, social scientists apply sufficiency and understandability to make the research a qualitative one[1][2].
Sufficiency is the most important part of science communication, no statement can be made without sufficient information, and only by presenting adequate information to the audience is the audience able to make rational decision and choice. On the other hand, article with low sufficiency of information is not what scientists, journalist and those engaged in science communication hope to compose. Science news often focus on latest research, and put less attention on presenting multiple viewpoints[3] which may resulting in impartial reports leading audience astray. In addition, attribution of responsibility is also important for helping the audience recognize and conceive an issue with different aspects, while many correspondents tend to display only one attribution. Though it may give the audience with quick access to an issue, it would help less to build the basis for further science communication. And as additional reading is given, those who are interested can search for more information right away, decreasing the difficulty and time consumption in out reaching. In the part of sufficiency, we would consider if"

NAWI_Graz,2017,Team:NAWI Graz#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," Projects at Universities of Graz
Since donations to non-official associations can be difficult for many companies, we decided to found an official association called “NAWiGEM - association to support the projects of the Graz iGEM team” under the auspices of the DIY electro- and biohacker scene in Graz, the Realraum3 and the Open BioLab - Graz Austria .
To increase the degree of popularity of iGEM and everything connected to it, we promoted all iGEM related topics at our events. We constantly received new inquiries from interested students on how to participate in the competition. Through the interviews with various experts, we were able to increase our awareness in different institutes. This made it possible for us to appeal to students from different fields.         The first meetings with the new participants already showed a huge interest of engineering students for the competition."

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," ultimate goal completely, we have successfully developed a MoDeL-based, automatic modeling and simulation software. Our program falls into 3 major components. The first component is User Interface . Users could give their assembling of parts by drag-and-drop function and setup initial conditions as well. System behavior as output will also be shown there. The second component is database written in MoDeL , which is the kernel of our automatic modeling idea. The last component is our designed to support MoDeL language. It functions as a driver: completing system network based on users' input and data stored in our database to give dynamic analysis as output.

User Interface
== Welcome to the world of creation and imagination! ==
As the world enters upon an age of human nature destructions, of resource starvation and the ignorance of ecological balance, the earth is more and more under the control of human beings, there is less room for the survival of animals, various kinds of microorganism are being killed and regenerated circulatory in laboratory.
However, there exsits a special kind of bacterial, who is too diligent to be willing to be controlled by human, they use their magic power to learn certain skills to being survived successfully. Reviewing their developmental history, their ancestors made great contribution to the world under successive human experiments. They show us the meaning of Biobrick, they grasp the ability to adapt themselves better to the outside world, they know how to realize their value furthest and greatly, they are the E.COLI!
Now let us begin the E.COLI magical mystery tour~~
Input
In order to give users a clear and definite goal on input. The whole input process is divided into two main steps: Compartment Construction and Plasmid Construction. In the first step, users only need to focus on the input of environmental condition, compartment, spatial structure of compartments, and the species contained in each compartment. In the second step, only plasmids are editable, and users can click on each of them to assemble biobricks into functional device. Of course, useful tips will be given along with your input process.
We here give a design of our user interface of input. It is under construction.
Step#1 Compartment Construction
Left:
When you enter in our interface,the first step is to choose the environment of our system . A flask is like a container , all the  reactions are happening in it . After that you may pick a appropriate condition for our lovely E.Coli . One E.Coli isn't enough for some specific problem , so you have to decide how many you will pick up . Small molecule is"

CB bottom miniprep
Today we performed a miniprep on the 4 tubes of CB bottom bacteria with 4 ml of culture in each tube.  6 ml of culture were eventually consolidated into a single spin tube during the miniprep, so this would be the equivalent of 4 minipreps in one tube.  Of note, after lysis (during addition of buffer P2), the tubes turned extremely blue, darker blue than we had ever seen before.  This would seem to indicate that the lysis step occurred very successfully.  However, even after consolidating four minipreps into one tube, we still got terrible concentration results for our samples, displayed below:
DNA concentrations after miniprep
We will thus seed more LB/spec culture with CB bottom bacteria tomorrow, and perform the miniprep on Monday with TF supervision to hopefully troubleshoot some of the problems with low yield.
Also of note is that the bacteria were left on the shaker for approximately 23 hours at the time of miniprep, which is longer than the ideal 12-14 hours.

Primer tag test two
On Friday, we repeated the PCR to test for sub-pool specificity of our primer oligo tags for the chip, using the same PCR protocol.  Today, we ran a gel to see if the results were any different, but alas, they were the same.  It seems that the primers for CB bottom also amplify out the control sequences, which means that our primer tags are not as specific as we thought they were.  The gel can be seen below, with the lanes arranged as follows: CB primer + CB DNA, control primer + CB DNA, control primer + control DNA, and control primer + CB DNA.  We would ideally expect bands in lanes 1 and 3 and no bands in lanes 2 and 4.  However, this was not the case:

NAWI_Graz,2018,Team:NAWI Graz#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," purchase it from suppliers in Europe. Only the bigger producers purchase their material from suppliers outside of Europe. Palm oil can normally not be used for candle production directly. The candle producers can only use certain fractions of it that are obtained after physical and/or chemical processes. This cannot be done by the candle manufacturers themselves, and so they typically purchase the required grades from refineries directly or from distributors. I cannot tell from where those get their supplies.
Do you know RSPO? What is your attitude regarding this issue?
Absolutely!
Sure I know RSPO. As a matter of fact, many of our members are also members of RSPO. Of course the concept of RSPO is not bare of criticism and it is frequently criticised in the media. Their criteria for certification of sustainable palm are rather clear and positive, but what is frequently criticised is their inconsequential punishment of violations. On the other hand, RSPO is the only, or at least the only well-known effort to make palm oil more sustainable. Therefore, many of our members are RSPO members and use certified material. The big problem is that palm cannot be used directly for candle production. You either have to fractionate it or harden it or, in the case of stearin on palm base, split it up. In the worst case, you can only use 10% of the palm for candle production, but if you want that being certified sustainable, you would have to pay the premium for the full volume – which can make the extra costs for certified material for candle use very expensive. Not all customers are willing to pay these considerable extra costs. Nonetheless, some candle manufacturers use certified sustainable palm oil and palm products in their candles. But unless consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable palm in their candles, the breakthrough can only come once imports of RSPO certified to Europe become the rule and not the exception. Once this tipping points is reached, it will be much easier to purchase sustainable palm products on the market. Offering only candles made of sustainable palm at this point of time would be financial suicide for many manufacturers.
How do you think this would influence the evolution of the candle industry?
It will certainly depend on the costs. Additionally, the technical characteristics are very important. There have been many promising approaches to obtain raw materials from alternative resources, e.g. synthetic paraffin wax from waste material. But so far, it has always proofed difficult to replace the existing raw materials with such alternatives. But I certainly hope that it will be different with your project. A short-term objective could be to use it as a blend with other raw materials. If you are able to"
LMU-Munich,2014,Team:LMU-Munich#Project#Bakillus_-_-_TEXT.html,"-pro-lysostaphin consists of a signal peptide to mediate the export, 15 tandem repeats of 13 amino acids length and two protein domains: the peptidase-domain and the C-terminal targeting domain. The signal peptide is cleaved during the export, the tandem repeats are cleaved by an additionally secreted cysteine protease. This repeats are not necessary for correct protein folding or maturation of the protein, they just inhibit protein activity. Once cleaved off, the maturated protein is 4.5 fold more active. [B1 ]
Because of its promising attributes, the utilization of lysostaphin as a coating for implants [B3 ] and treatment of S. aureus in the nasal area via cream [B4 ] is currently in the focus of medical research.
Dispersin
DispersinB (DspB) is a biofilm-dissolving enzyme, specifically a 1,6-beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase. It is produced by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a pathogen which causes aggressive forms of Parodontitis. [B5 ] In its natural habitat, A. actinomycetecombitans uses this enzyme to release single cells from the biofilm in order to colonize new habitats. [B6 ] DspB is specific towards its substrate, PNAG, (PGA in E. coli), which is an important component of the extracellular matrix and which can make up to 90% of the dry weight of a biofilm. [B7 ] The process of dissolving biofilms is accomplished by cleaving monosaccharide-residues from the polysaccharide, beginning at the non-reducing end of the PNAG. [B6 ] This glycosamin-hydrolase has a typical TIM-barrel-structure, consisting of 8α- and 8β-barrels, with a large cavity in the middle, which is considered to be the substrate-binding pocket. [B5 ]
Proposed mechanism of reaction [B8
The currently proposed mechanism of reaction suggests a substrate assisted nucleophilic attack (see chart below) [B8 ]
Barrel structure of DspB [B6
DspB is active against many bacteria, both gram-positive and gram-negative, and shows some very promising features for its use in medical devices. It can prevent the growth of biofilms in coated catheters if used in combination with triclosan, and can be used to clear medical devices of biofilms."

Failed to load tracking. JS is probably not enabled
Background
To maximize the specificity in targeting Yersinia enterocolitica, we wanted to design a construct consisting of a membrane protein complex that would bind to the surface of the pathogen. This could be done by fusing an anchor protein with the colicin Fy that aimed at the membrane of Y. enterocolitica. This complex would be expressed on the surface of our probiotic, making it adhere to its target.
System design
We made two constructs, using a synthesized gene coding for pgsA. In the first one we fused pgsA with colicin Fy and added a promoter aswell as a RBS called B0034. In the other, BFP was put instead of colicin Fy to test the expression of pgsA.
Result
Mutagenesis of B0034-BFP into RFC25 was successful, verified by sequencing. All other constructs were not successful. Mainly because we had trouble with the RFC25-assemblies. The removal of TACTAG was also not successful.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#Conclusion_-_-_TEXT.html," in the receiver
As a first proof of principle for our project, we wanted to use the FecA protein as the message. FecA is an outer membrane protein implied in ferric citrate uptake and in signal transduction leading to the expression of the fecABCED operon. The idea is here to have a sender population producing and exporting fecA into vesicles, and a receiver population deleted for fecA. In this manner, only the receiver cells having fused with vesicles would transduce a signal leading to the expression of the pFec promoter controlling a reporter gene.
We cloned the pFec promoter into a plasmid carying the mRFP1 fluorescent protein . This allowed us to caracterize it, showing that pFec is efficiently activated when ferric citrate is present in the medium.
Overnight cultures of  were diluted 1/100 in LB or M9 medium supplemented with varying amount of FeNO3 and Na Citrate. Fluorescence and OD were assessed in a Tecan plate reader. Fluorescence divided by OD is plotted. The low Fluo/OD at high FeNO3 concentration can be explained by the toxicity of FeNO3. Note that the best response to Na Citrate is obtained with 1mM FeNO3.
microscopy :
pFec in BBa_J61002 was transforme into DH5alpha and after growing O.N , we diluted the culture at 1:500 in 5 ml of LB in three falcon tube, (without sodium citrate and ferric nitrate , with sodium citrate , with sodium citrate and ferric nitrate which are suppose to form a stable complexe : ferric citrate at a concentration of 30 mM)
On LB : the fec operon is slightly expressed
On LB + sodium citrate 30mM :
On LB + ferric citrate (ferric nitrate + sodium citrate ratio : 1:50) at the final concentration of 30 mM :
Conclusion :
We have detected a considerable change in the fluorescence, adding ferric citrate or sodium citrate in the medium increase the fluorescence, but we can assume that the LB contains  Fe3+ so adding sodium citrate to the medium would chelate the Fe3+ and simulate a ferric citrate induction.

Procedure:
Gel separation:
Fragments of mutated pdCas9 and pSB1C3 (digested with EcoRI and PstI overnight) were separated on gel green. The desired segments were cut out and isolated from the gel by following after the same procedures from 02.07.2018.
Fragments of L2 (incubated from yesterday – 21.09.2018) were digested with AlwNI and EcoRI, separated and visualized on gel red.
Revive competent cells with mutated pdCas9:
Cells with PC1 stored at -80 ℃ were inoculated in LB medium with CM and incubated overnight at 37 ℃ with shaking.
We were running out of plasmids with mutated pdCas9, so it’s necessary to isolate the them from the cells again…
Restriction digest mutated pdCas9 (PC2) and linear pSB1C3:
PC2: 10 μL DNA, 2 μL 2.1 buffer, 0.5 μL EcoRI, 0.5 μL PstI, 7 μL ddH2O
pSB1C3: 10 μL DNA, 2 μL 2.1 buffer, 0.5 μL EcoRI, 0.5 μL PstI, 7 μL ddH2O
The samples were incubated overnight at 37 ℃
Results:
The concentrations of the desired fragments of pdCas9 and pSB1C3 were too low to be detected. New samples of mutated pdCas9 and pSB1C3 were incubated with EcoRI and PstI overnight

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Model#microtubule_-_-_TEXT.html," only Tu-GTP molecules can assemble onto the end of a microtubule. For the “+” end, there are two different cases.
\[   M_nTuGTP+TuGTP\xrightarrow{k_{ptp}}M_{n+1}TuGTP   \]   \[   M_nTuGDP+TuGTP\xrightarrow{k_{pdp}}M_{n}TuGDP{\sim}TuGTP   \]
where $k_{ptp}$ and $k_{pdp}$ are the corresponding polymerization rate constants for GTP cap and GDP cap. The “-” end is similar to the “+” end, and we denote its corresponding rate constants for GTP cap and GDP cap as $k_{stm}$ and $k_{sdm}$.
Both Tu-GTP and Tu-GDP can depolymerize from microtubules. For the “+” end we have
\[   M_nTuGTP\xrightarrow{k_{stp}}M_n+TuGTP   \]   \[   M_nTuGDP\xrightarrow{k_{sdp}}M_n+TuGDP   \]
where $k_{stp}$ and $k_{sdp}$ are the corresponding rate constants for GTP cap and GDP cap. The “-” end is similar to the “+” end, and we denote its corresponding rate constants for GTP cap and GDP cap as $k_{stm}$ and $k_{sdm}$.
For the hydrolysis of GTP, we use an uncoupled hydrolysis model. Hydrolysis is a first-order reaction, and if we assume that only the Tu-GTP on microtubules can hydrolyze, and that all Tu-GTP on microtubules have the same hydrolysis rate constant $k_h$, we have
\[   TuGTP\xrightarrow{k_{h}}TuGDP+Pi+H^+   \]
Tu-GTP can regenerate in the solution, which is considered to be the main cause of the periodic fluctuations of the lengths of microtubules. The transformation from Tu-GDP to Tu-GTP is a relatively slow process. We describe this process with a first-order reaction with rate constant $k_{dt}$:
\[   TuGDP\xrightarrow{k_{dt}}TuGTP   \]
Thus all of the major reactions in the microtubule polymerization process have been considered. Recall that the macroscopic rate constants ($k$) in the model above can be transformed into microscopic probabilities ($"

The standard iron core of ferritin, however, is not very suitable for catalyzing this process due to the lack of catalytic ferrous ions. The catalytic activity of ferritin can be increased by synthesizing ferritin with a magnetite core (Zhang et al., 2010). The synthesis of this ”magnetoferritin” however is time consuming and inefficient due to the procedure being prone to oxidation.
Figure 2. Chemical equation for the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen radical species using iron as a catalyst; Fenton chemistry.
An alternative to increasing the catalytic activity of ferritin would be to provide the necessary ferrous ions for the Fenton chemistry via the iron complex Prussian blue. This compound could act as a surface modification agent to give the ferritin core a Prussian blue surface. Prussian blue has previously been shown to have high catalytic activity and is believed to act as a source of negative charge at appropriate pH levels to yield an affinity with positively charged peroxidase substrates such as TMB (Zhang et al., 2010).
Synthesizing Prussian Blue Ferritin
The creation of Prussian blue ferritin is a relatively simple process that involves the surface modification of the iron core of normal ferritin. To accomplish this, purified ferritin is combined with the compound potassium ferrocyanide under acidic conditions to produce the iron complex Prussian blue (Zhang et al., 2013). This chemical reaction is shown below:
Figure 3. Chemical equation for the synthesis of Prussian blue ferritin using potassium ferrocyanide.
The chemical reaction can easily be observed as there is a visible change from the colour of ferritin to the blue colour of Prussian blue ferritin (Figure 4). This reaction takes place overnight and then the Prussian blue ferritin is collected via dialysis. For this process, we made use of commercial horse spleen ferritin purchased from the commercial supplier Sigma-Aldrich . This commercial ferritin is structurally very similar to the human ferritin we will be producing in our bacteria, which we anticipate would display very similar properties to one another, making use of the commercial reagent a good starting point to demonstrate our concept.

Collaborations
Here at the UCLA iGEM Team, we firmly believe that the basis of all progress is teamwork and collaboration. This year, we have formed a number of collaborations with not only local California teams, but teams across the world. We hope through our collaborations that our impact and influence on the iGEM and synthetic biology community worldwide will lead to great advancements and success in the field of science.
Second Annual Southern California iGEM Meetup
The UCLA iGEM Team was proud to host the Second Annual Southern California iGEM Meetup at UCLA on July 20, 2016. Team members and advisors from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), University of La Verne, Alverno High School, and the University of Marburg attended the meet-up at the Molecular Biology Institute at UCLA. Each team was able to discuss their ongoing projects and receive feedback and advice on aspects such as experimental design, while learning about what other teams in the iGEM community was working on with the potential to form new collaborations. We also discussed pertinent issues for all iGEM teams in terms of logistics, team organization, fundraising, and project design. Additionally, we discussed the current state of iGEM and synthetic biology as a rapidly emerging biotechnology field in the United States, especially in the context of developing scientific communications to combat rising negative publicity and misinformation toward the use and safety of genetically modified organisms. Through our meet up, we hope to spur not only a collaborative experience in local teams to work together in solving synthetic biology problems, but also a space where teams can discuss the maintenance and sustained success of an iGEM team. Through our meet-up, we hope to facilitate greater collaborations among Southern California teams as well as foster the general iGEM and synthetic biology community.

Nonribosomal peptides have important anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, and immunosuppressive biological activities. They are synthesized by modular, high molecular weight enzymes that assemble more than 500 different amino acid substrates in an assembly line manner. For this reason, synthetic biologists have tried to engineer these proteins and to switch modules to create analogs and novel natural products, but with little success. Despite being modular, the interactions between modules have evolved to be highly specific, making synthetic Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthases (NRPS) a challenge to engineer. Instead of switching modules we introduced a recombination system targeting oligo integration in Bacillus subtilis. We used the recombineering system to alter the active sites determining substrate specificity, thereby creating variants of antibiotics. Our focus was the tyrocidine antibiotic, which cannot be used intravenously due to its toxicity. Our goal is to create new analogs through multiplex automated genome engineering to reduce toxicity.

iGEM is a generally scientific competition and most of the participants are therefore scientists. This is why probably every team spends a big part of their time on experimenting and receiving results, that are to be presented to other scientists. Having in mind that the projects are supposed to not only be scientific fun but really have a purpose and a vision behind, it is of very high importance to also get the rest of the world on board.
Information works best against frightful and misleading sciolism, hence we decided to invest much of our time in bringing our project close to non-scientific people. To give some examples: in schools we gave presentations to pupils and discussed contemporary topics, on the Potsdam Day of Science (a public street event in our area) we tried best to get in touch with people of all ages and we never missed an opportunity to spread enthusiasm about our hobby:  science.
The thoughts and worries of the people we talked to have been discussed in detail and later incorporated into the project design, if it was something we had not considered before. To give an example, someone approached us with the question if we knew how much plastic waste was produced in a lab and if we were planning to reduce this. It has been a fortunate coincidence that we were asked to take part in ""iGEM goes green"" , a program arranged by iGEM Dresden.
A second thought that we had already planned for reasons of safety was to use inducible promoters. This way it would not be possible for our modified organisms to produce the substances whose genetic code we inserted into the genome in the outside world.     Besides to this face-to-face work outside we also investigated what"

UFAM-UEA_Brazil,2016,Team:UFAM-UEA Brazil#Project#MerOperon_-_-_TEXT.html," mutagenesis studies have ruled out this hypothesis.  The role of N-terminal in general enzyme function was unclear until very  recently. It facilitates the delivery of Hg(II) into the active site through its pair of  cysteines. The reduction process is the enzyme’s main mechanism, and it uses  a NADPH molecule bound to mercuric ion reductase as ion source. At the core  site, FAD mediates the electron transfer between NADPH and Hg(II); primarily  NADPH is oxidized to NADP + while FAD is reduced to FADH - , then FADH -  reduces ionic mercury Hg(II) to Hg0. Finally, as a volatile vapor, mercury leaves  the core of mercuric ion reductase and flows to the outside through the cell  membrane.

The three major naturally occurring forms of mercury- elemental, ionic, and organic are  widely distributed throughout the biosphere. All three forms are constantly  interconverted by a variety of abiotic and biological mechanisms. Microbial  mechanisms dominate the conversion of ionic mercury to organic mercury compounds,  especially methyl mercury. Some microorganisms"
