SVA-NYC,2015,Team:SVA-NYC#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the power of hurricane Sandy.  The house is located far inland from the ocean.  Apparently the storm surge of Sandy traveled across the bridge a half-mile down from her house and flooded her yard.  The saltwater damaged her yard and her plants.  The power of Mother Nature and her ability to push a large mass of ocean water that far inland is surprising and alarming.
#09 - Forbidden garden
In the urban sprawl of Manhattan, green space is valuable resource.  Hidden behind the facades of stone and brick, lush vegetation can be found.  Having these spaces set aside from the public can make one have a sense of privacy.  The city can be loud, obnoxious, and very public and not having a place of peace can be unnerving.  I found one of these hideaways hidden in Chelsea behind a building housing a woman’s sewing studio, and the area set aside is still loved by the owner.  Due to recent health issue the one thing she cherished, her garden, became forbidden to her interact with.  She developed an immune disease and is currently unable to touch soil.  One of her passions has been taken away by forces outside her control.
#12 - Farm nostalgia
Being a melting pot, most inhabitants in NYC were are not born, nor bred in the city. Immigrants, whose life has been transplanted, are the norm and urban life can be stressful to them. Having fresh air and nature so close at hand is priceless commodity to most city dwellers, especially to a model I met who grew up in a farm in Oregon.  In order to be active in her profession, she had to make the difficult decision to live in Manhattan and give up nature. Her urban green space was used for mental clarity and remembrance of a past life, life on the farm.
#13 - Flatlands
I rode my bike to what is termed the Flatlands, arriving at an unusual place in Brooklyn.   There were rows of small houses on both sides of the street that looked like a suburban community not native to New York City. The participant’s yard was covered in construction debris - stones, concrete slabs, and things of unknown origin. A peculiar old water pump of unknown origin was sitting in the middle of the yard.  The collection of the sample was a challenge, but I was successful in obtaining a significant soil sample.

This  beautiful garden is  secretly located in the heart of Clinton Hill. The owner of the garden has been working on it for 25 years. An experienced gardener, he gave me a brief  overview"

“Of course we hope to win gold in Boston. Last year we got bronze, and this year we believe that we can make it a lot further.“
Nordic iGEM meeting
This year, our instructor Mike took the initiative to arrange a Nordic iGEM mini conference! Sadly, none of the Swedish teams were able to come, so in the end it was only us and the team from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). We came to them and had some great lunch before we presented our respective projects. At the time, their presentation was vastly better than our own, but luckily we had time to change that!
After a very long but productive day, we were awarded with an abundance of delicious Chinese food and we spent a very pleasant evening in their company.
We've been awfully busy over the summer!

Kingsborough_NY,2017,Team:Kingsborough NY#RFP_-_-_TEXT.html," with various strains - different variants of RFP in strains that have (left) or lack (right) tmRNA. The labels refer to the different types of ssrA tags on the RFP.
Another representative image illustrates the same effect, as well as the difference in expression in these variants between normal LB miller (with 1% NaCl - top two plates) and high salt media (LB supplemented with 3% NaCl - bottom two plates). It also illustrates the effect tmRNA has on how the lac promoter is regulated - without tmRNA, expression is less leaky. This is evident from comparing the plates on the left (No induction, 0mM IPTG) with those on the right (strong induction, 1mM IPTG). This result is consistent with previous observations (basically, that the lacI regulator is a normal target of tmRNA tagging and degradation), but illustrates the effect in a way not previously observed (i.e. was not thought to prevent leaky expression to this extent).
Our results suggest that the presence or absence of other ssrA tagged proteins does effect the degradation rate of a tagged reporter protein. Further experiments are necessary to confirm this result and rule out other explanations - for example, perhaps the decreased amount of RFP is simply reflective of a diminished capacity for translation in the cell. Complementing these cells with a tmRNA variant that adds a tag not recognized well by the proteases (such as tmRNA-DD or tmRNA-H6) would help test this idea.
The image above was a representative result, and was analyzed using ImageJ (see our Methods page for more details). The result of this analysis is shown below:"

Aim:
To know how the number of immunized dogs changes over time.
Steps:
1. Define the cellular automaton;
2. Determine the related parameters of cellular automaton;
3. Determine the rules of cellular automaton;
4. Analyze the results of the model.
Background:
Cellular automata are discrete dynamical systems that can simulate complex behaviors by animating cells on a lattice based on simple, local rules. There are numerous applications of cellular automata, such as simulating traffic flows, network transmission and digital music. In our project, cellular automata are used for modeling the spread of immunity in stray dogs.
Definition of the cellular automaton:
Cell: An individual stray dog.
Cellular Space: A collection of cells distributed in a 2-dimentional space. The cellular space is divided into square lattice. Suppose the size of the cellular space is N = m*m where m is the number of rows (columns) and 100 in our model.
Cellular State: Assume that the state variable of the cell is Sij(t) where i and j indicate row i and column j in the cellular space and t is time. S has 3 values of {0, 1, 2} where 0 represents a dog without immunity and 1 represents that a dog is in the process of obtaining immunity and 2 represents a state that a dog has been immunized to the rabies virus.
Neighbor: In our model, the dimension of the cellular space is two. Around each cell, there are eight cells as neighbors. So the current states of the present cell and its "

Figure 2.3.2: PCR product of the terminator BBa_B0015 with the correct size of 150 bp amplified out its standard plasmid.
Figure 2.3.3: Control digestion to proof that the ligation of the coding chloramphenicol resistance sequence inclduding its promotor and ribosome binding site (see figure 2.3.1) with the terminator BBa_B0015 (see figure2.3.2) was successful.
Figure 2.3.4: PCR product of the complete chloramphenicol resistance cassette with standard prefix and suffix.
Figure 2.3.5: Control digestion of the complete unmutated chloramphenicol resistance cassette in the standard plasmid pSB1A2 with EcoRI and PstI. An EcoRI restriction site within the cassette, which isn't allowed by BioBrick standard, yields to three instead of the two expected bands. The 2 kb band represents the pSB1A2 backbone.
Figure 2.3.6: Control digestion of the complete mutated chloramphenicol resistance cassette in the standard plasmid pSB1A2 with EcoRI and PstI. The EcoRI restricition site, led to the unwanted third band in figure 2.3.5 was removed by mutagenesis PCR. The sizes of the insert (~1kb) as well as the pSB1A2 backbone (~2kb) are correct.

phage cloning strategy two
For this second strategy the end product of strategy one (the insert in pBluescript II, see 2.1) as well as the finalized chloramphenicol resistance cassette (CmR) (see 2.3) were used. The difference between cloning strategy one and two is the control of the CmR and GFP cassette. In strategy one these two parts are bicistronic under control of one promotor whereas in strategy two they are designed as two distinct protein generators. For succeeding in this strategy first one unwanted KpnI restriction site in the pBluescript vector including the insert from strategy one had to be removed by mutagenesis PCR. The success of this mutagenesis can be seen in figure 2"

The Goal of this presentation
As we thought, through this presentation, we could impart some fundamentally knowledge of synthetic biology to the high school students and make them feel familiar with the IGEM Competition. Also, we want to make a brief introduction of good examples of excellent project to attract more excellent students to join the team of IGEM and synthetic biology. To make sure our preliminary goal of this presentation, we choose one of the most famous senior High Schools in China—the Seventh Senior High School.
What we have done in this presentation
In the very beginning of this presentation, our team members introduced “what’s the synthetic biology” and “how is it going” to high school students. And then, we spent quiet a lot of time to tell them “the origin and progress of the IGEM Competition” and some good projects (the project of university of Washington in 2010; /////)which got the golden medal. Finally, we made a brief introduction of what we have done in last year.
The achievement of this presentation
Honestly speaking, we got a great success in this presentation. In detail, first, we make more students become familiar with synthetic biology and IGEM Competition. And what makes us surprise is that they showed a great interest in the synthetic biology and some of the high school students plan to join us to participate in the college competition. In addition, some of them are trying to contact the headmaster to join the competition of high school level. Secondly, when we shared some good examples to them, they asked a whole lot of inspired questions. Some of the questions even could apply in our project.

  XCode also provides lots of libraries and classes, users can use a large sum of ready-made functions to program. These libraries and classes are contained in frameworks. Users can add different frameworks to the program to use different functions. Frameworks are conductive to the communication between programs, because these functions are the same. They are universal and reusable, which make them to be very convenient.
  XCode help page is really beneficial, too. Users can look up for many functions and classes. It also provides many example codes for users to download and study.

The main highlight was the presentation of our research project and genetic circuit designed for iGEM 2014, “The Kidney Sensing”, which illustrated for the audience how students are able to make cutting edge science since their first years in the University.
iGEM presentation at Biothecnology course stand in order to explain Synthetic Biology for society.
iGEM reaching the high school
     On August 28th,2014, a total of 239 high school students (from 14 to 17 years old) of  Mafra city (located in Santa Catarina State, Brazil) had the opportunity to hear about   Synthetic Biology for the first time in their lives. Guilherme Kundlatsch (member of   Brasil-SP Team) presented 4 lectures, each lasting 90 minutes. To succeed in his talk,   Guilherme first taught about the flow of genetic information (from DNA to proteins),   history of molecular biology, recombinant DNA techniques (and concepts such as   restriction enzyme, ligation enzyme, and bacterial plasmid transformation were also   discussed). Great job! Students were ready to begin a journey through Synthetic   Biology. Guilherme started talking about some of the past iGEM projects such as: 1 -   The Food Warden (Groningen Team, 2012), a system which allows the costumer to   detect meat spoilage easily; 2 - E. chromi (Cambridge Team, 2009), a set of parts that   allows generation of a rainbow of color pigments in E. coli which permits the use of a   engineered bacterium for coloring the poop as biosensor for the human gastro-intestinal   tract; 3 - Detecthol (USP Team, 2013), a bioengineered sensor, which is able to detect   levels of methanol above 2% in common alcoholic drinks. Finally, he explained the   Brasil-SP project, the “Kidney Sensing”. The excitement of the students was   remarkable, and it was observed especially at the time they asked questions about   ethical concepts, more details about some techniques and predictions for the future.   Curiously, at the beginning of each lecture Guilherme always asked students to raise   their hands up who knew anything about the subject... and no one did it. We are   convinced that at the end of each lecture, everyone understood at least the basics of  "

Week 21 (18th of September - 24th of September)
Tested the inhibitory capacity of CpxP-Aff fusions using the new protocol in M9 medium. Results showed that variants were able to suppress the Cpx system like native CpxP (except Aff-CpxP-His). Started on Wiki design.
October
Week 22 (25th of September - 1st of October)
Tested whether inducer MalE31 could active Cpx system by dissociating CpxP(-Aff) from CpxA, results indicated that this did not work. Dropped this experiment due to time constraints. Tested the spheroplast protocol, microscopy showed that cells were spheroplasted. More Wiki design.
Week 23 (2nd of October - 8th of October)
Transformed the MalE24-1-CpxP-Aff fusion constructs to E. coli CpxP knock-out strain. Tested the inhibitory capacity of the MalE24-1-CpxP-Aff fusions in spheroplasted cells, results indicated that some of the fusions could suppress the Cpx system. Repeated with replicates to obtain more reliable results. Even more Wiki design.
Week 24 (9th of October - 15th of October)
Did two more measurements on spheroplasted cells, changed the protocol a bit, resulting in better data. Started cloning the ptac+MalE24-1-CpxP-Aff and “-Aff-CpxP constructs to a pSB3T5 backbone for integration of my project with project of Bart.  Guess what? Wiki design.
Week 25 (16th of October - 22nd of October)
Continued backbone change for integration with Bart. Did the final measurement on the designed system to see if IgG could induce the Cpx system by binding the membrane tethered CpxP-Aff fusions. Results are inconclusive for reasons unclear. Needs additional verification.
Week 26 (23rd of October - 29th of October)
Biobricks were prepared and shipped. Wiki page for my result was written.

SDU-Denmark,2014,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour34_-_-_TEXT.html," avoid this, we think that in the future these genes could be transferred into a plasmid  developed in our university, which contains the proteins needed to make ribosomes and use E. coli knocked down  for these genes. In this way the bacteria is completely dependent of the plasmid in order to survive, which can be  used as an alternative method of selection.
Dual use
If the product was to be misused by individuals, groups or countries, they could potentially use this bacterium to  induce the right combination of mutations, in order to get a plant-destruction weapon. We evaluate that the risk  involved in the misuse of our project is actually smaller than the misuse of the cellulase biobrick itself (because  of the kill switch, need of mutation of the promoter, etc.)
The misuse of our protein might be aimed at mutating the protein to make it harmful. We consider, though, that if the aim is to create a harmful protein there are other easier ways, such as starting with a pathogenic protein  or simply designing a protein.
The best way to fight dual use is to try to prevent it by taking biosecurity measures in consideration, like limited  access to laboratories and tracking of orders of gene synthesis.
Risk perspectives: including others
It is our conviction that a good synthetic biologist (and scientist) is one that, besides evaluating the safety of his projects, can include the general public into the discussion. Public opinion has an enormous effect on the feasibility  of a project to succeed, both because the acceptance of the general public can make it easier to receive funding,  but also because of the valuable feedback that can come as a result of the interaction between the general public  and the synthetic biologist. Therefore it is important to communicate effectively and considerate, what might be perceived as a risk factor. In our case, bacteria and GMOs are often considered as hazardous and not as a food  resource. The fact that many people are not familiar with bacteria and GMO could make the risk perception very high.  To cope with this issue we made our interactive video adventure as an attempt to share the message, inform the  general public and, hopefully, reduce the risk perception of our project.
All in all, we believe that, even though there could potentially be some risks related to our project, it is safe enough to continue with our project, especially in the light of the potential and more probable benefits.

1.5mL of each cell resuspension was transferred to two 35mm petri dishes; before starting UV exposure, 2*10uL of each strain were transferred to wells on a 96-well PCR plate w/ 90uL of PBS pr. well. The petri dishes were then placed on the horizontal reflector under the UV lights, and the timer was started. At intervals of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 mins, the petri dishes were removed from the box, and 2*10uL samples from each dish were transferred to wells on the dilution plates. The dishes were then returned to the UV box for further exposure.
From the exposed samples, a dilution series (10-1, 10-2, 10-3,10-4, and 10-5) were created. For each of the 100- to 100000-fold dilutions, 6 drops of 2uL were spotted onto one quadrant of a petri plate (LB agar; arabinose added for HB101+pGLO) using a 10uL multichannel pipette; plates were then incubated for approx. 20hrs at 37oC, and colonies were counted.

Moss… in space!
SpaceMoss is an interdisciplinary project that combines two fields of science leading the way into the future: Space Physics and Synthetic Biology. Space Physics and human curiosity are propelling martian colonisation. However, technologies to make astronauts self-sufficient on Mars, so we can live there for a long time, is still an unsolved problem. This is where Synthetic Biology could provide a solution by creating  genetically modified organisms that can produce needed components for astronaut survival.
The focus areas of our project are displayed in our Vision chart below. Click on one of our visions to read more about it.
.
Proof of Concept: Moss can be Designed for Space Exploration
The idea is to introduce genes into the moss that will allow the moss to express key components for long duration missions to Mars. Our mission is to show that: ""moss can be designed to better sustain harsh conditions on Mars AND produce compounds usefull for astronauts on long duration missions"". We have chosen - as a proof of concept - to focus on 1) expression of an antifreeze protein and 2) the biosynthesis of Resveratrol. We have inserted an 'anti-freeze' gene from a spruce budworm into moss cells which will hopefully help moss to survive the low temperatures found on Mars. Resveratrol is an antioxidant that would be useful as a medical supplement to astronauts demonstrating the potential of using Synthetic Biology to produce compounds, which are useful to astronauts.

Research on Moss in Mars Conditions
In the beginning of our project we gained access to the Mars Environmental Chamber at the Niels Bohr Institute. By simulating martian living conditions, such as low pressure, intense radiation and high carbon dioxide atmosphere can examine moss’s ability to survive on Mars. However, our main interest was to complement the experiments done in Green Lab. As these were focused on making the moss more resistant to cold (and this is not a variable we can change in the Mars Chamber) we needed to build our own experient. We build a prototype that enables us to measure the effect of different"

We would like to thank everyone who has had a contributing role in the completion of our iGEM project. From the initial inception, through development and and at each apparent dead-end, we’ve been lucky enough to have a range of fantastic support and guidance. We also want to give thanks to everyone at iGEM for granting us this unique opportunity.
Special thanks to:
Dr. George Wadhams
For being a guidance to all 14 members of the Oxford iGEM team throughout the summer, and being incredibly patient with us in the wet lab! As our main supervisor, he has been the cornerstone of our project, providing invaluable assistance on construct design and experimental approach, as well as advice on the Wiki and presentation.
Dr. Chris Jones
For supervising our project and providing day to day contact for experimental troubleshooting. He has been a brilliant supervisor, explaining many complex protocols to us in an easily-understandable manner. We have learnt a great deal from him, especially in relation to microscopy and data analysis.
Professor Judy Armitage
For letting us come into her lab to complete the project under her supervision.
Professor Anthony Watts
Provided support and contact on behalf of the biochemistry department, specifically in relation to securing facilities such as lab space and access to equipment.
Professor Antonis Papachristodoulou
For providing us with guidance throughout the project. He helped us steer the modelling section as well as teaching us new techniques. We learnt a great deal because of his support.
Andreas Harris
For helping us set the course for our modelling section and explaining concepts to us when we were lost.
Professor James Malone-Lee
For giving his honest,  professional opinion on our project and its place in medicine. For giving us access to his clinic to speak with Doctors and patients as  much as we needed to. Perhaps most importantly for inspiring team member George to continue work on urinary infections through his generous internship scheme.
Dr. Sheela Swamy
For replying to our queries in under an hour without fail, for welcoming George into her consultations to talk to patients,"
Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Integrated Practices#lab_-_-_TEXT.html," ).
We then interviewed Professor Richard Titball, leader of the Microbes and Disease research group at Exeter University. We asked him about potential applications of kill switches. He talked about how physical containment methods traditionally used in microbiology may have limitations when applied to vaccines, an area of his research, as they are administered to the population. He thought that if triggered by a specific environmental condition, a kill switch could be an elegant bio-containment solution as it is a system that can be finely tuned. In practice however he was skeptical that kill switches could be made reliable. Interestingly when we discussed the public perception of synthetic DNA and its potential release into the environment, Prof Titball believed that it was an issue that shouldn't be discussed by the scientific community alone, but that the public should be involved in the risk/benefit assessment of the use of genetically modified organisms. This prompted us to find ways to engage the public in order to better their understanding of synthetic biology and include them in the debate. You can see our interview with Prof Titball below.
Due to time restraints with our project we decided to focus on providing significant analysis on the kill switches individually, however advice from Markus Geshater of Synthase Limited indicating that multiple kill switches in one system would be unfeasible and the different systems would need to be truly orthogonal to be effective. He explained that if in an industrial setting your synthetic system is producing a protein, then having one or multiple kill switches that are reliant on protein production would reduce the efficiency of production of your desired protein. Furthermore these kill switches could potentially be circumvented by the overexpression of a useful enzyme that is being commercially produced.  Consequently, we felt assured in dropping the idea for a multiple kill switch system because our kill switches relied heavily on protein production and thus would reduce the efficiency of the product in an industrial setting. Instead of looking at multiple kill switches in the same system we looked to design three distinct kill switches to test and compare the efficiency of enzymatic, metabolic and DNA degrading mechanisms

Today we made quantifications using spectrophotometer of all biobricks that will be submitted for the competition (BB_Bioremediation, BB_Essential, BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation, BB_Essential + BB_E0840 and BB_Essential + BB_K346004).
Meanwhile we also prepared mercury solutions to be used tomorrow to do the calibration curve for mercury quantification of our experiment with the bioaccumulation construction (BB_Essential + K346004).
It will be made two calibration curves to obtain a pattern. The first on using LM liquid medium as matrix, and the second using buffer TN (Tris HCl 10mM and NaCl 0,15M). The pattern dots will be concentrations of 0.001 µg/ml, 0.005 µg/ml, 0.01 µg/ml, 0.05 µg/ml, 0.1 µg/ml and 0.5 µg/ml

What we hope to see from this experiment is whether the G1/G2 construct will stop expression of GFP when transformed into the 421 strain, as this strain produces the repressor which will act on the pR promoter. We also expect the antirepressor to de-repres the repressor in the GR1/GR2 construct, thereby starting expression of GFP. The 413 strain is used as a control.
05-10-2010 Annemi Depressor group!!!
Did a PCR of the mini-preps from October 2nd and 4th (see labbook for further detail) but this time diluted 100 fold in water.
However this resulted in yet another depressing empty gel-picture:(
Sebastien suggested that we let the terminator group do a PCR on some of our mini-preps and some of their own (which have been giving nice gel-pictures in the past).
We will do the same PCRs to see if none in the repressor group are able to do a PCR.
Did a PCR clean-up of the restrictions Lisa did yesterday of the backbones: 4A5 and 1C3 and the new biobricks GR1, GR2, Z1, Z2 and RFP. All were digested with E and P.
It looked good on the gel, so we are ready to do some ligations tomorrow.
Maybe the depressor group will have a succes in the nearest future. A girl can dream...

We put the A4 small paper written words in the control bacteria liquid and the fermentation liquid with Alkaline cellulase, to judge by doing so if there is obvious effect of Alkaline cellulase to deink, so it can be applied to actual production
In contrast to the picture in the control bacteria liquid, the picture in fermentation liquid with Alkaline cellulase has a strong degradation.So the pictures tell us Alkaline cellulase studied by SZU-iGEM has a good deinking ability,and it will have a good application prospect.

This part collection is designed to allow all teams with this part collection to conduct ICA to rapidly and controllably assemble repetitive spider silk gene constructs.  All parts necessary for MaSp1/2 ligation and sequencing are located in this collection, and will allow any team to perform ICA without resorting to gBlocks synthesis or cloning manipulation of the monomeric parts.  We have generated excellent documentation for teams to use this set, not only from our wiki project page and parts page, but in a cloning guide found in our collaborations page with TU Eindhoven containing detailed troubleshooting and FAQs, which teams can use to completely conduct ICA on spider silk genes.  This collection has shown to be completely functional to design a wide variety of genes in terms of length and MaSP1/2 ratios, as indicated by our project page."

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," first iGEM Team in Marburg, nor the first one to collaborate with the School for the blind and visually impaired.
The main service they provide for students is to know regulations and, even more importantly, the people in the different departments responsible for their implementation. Consequently, it is their job to provide disabled students contacts and guidance while being not directly involved. But they had a lot of useful information for us. For example, about state-funded aids for students who need assistance or additional time during exams. They also told us that the Philipps-University is the center of higher education in Germany with the highest quota of visually impaired students. We found out that the people responsible for how visually impaired students were dealt with in actuality were the same that also coordinated the whole education program in the departments.
Thinking back to our own time as newcomers at the university, knowing whom to contact is a valuable thing. Since we now knew the contact details interesting to the students, we put them together in one comprehensive list, which we provided them with. To further encourage the pupils to choose their path without fear that they stood no chance, we arranged interviews with visually impaired researchers in the middle of a Natural Science course, or that have successfully obtained a degree in their respective field. We had a bioinformatic student present, that was eager to answer questions of interested pupils.
We hope those measures will prove helpful in diminishing their concerns, since such personal reports are a bit more compelling than just our word for it. Some of us bonded with our aspiring researchers and we became personal contacts for future questions and study subjects. We hope that our efforts will start their respective science careers and that we remain a source they can rely on. Our initiative lay the groundwork for a lasting, sustainable interaction of future iGEM Teams with new generations of BLISTA pupils.
Integrated Human Practices
We acquired information from all three pillars that built the foundation of research - Society, Academia, and Industry - to step up our game and bring our iGEM project to the next level. We believe that our efforts and achievement reflect the interdisciplinary nature of our project and benefit the real-world applicability and future viability of Vibrio natriegens and the iGEM competition results.

Standardization of MoDeL
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. Knowing the importance, USTC_Software puts a lot of effort on the standardization of MoDeL. We have requested BBF RFC55 for MoDeL, and constructed a beta version of XML schema to describe the XML structure of MoDeL.
BBF RFC55
BBF RFC55: Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language (MoDeL) mainly describes the detailed language specifications of MoDeL with concrete examples, which provides enough information for serious database constructors to build up a database on his own. As a highlight of MoDeL, the concept and the syntax of Chain-Node Model are described in detail. The content of document is currently arranged as follows:
Figure 1: Draft document of RFC55 - Table of Contents
The document of RFC55 has already been submitted. You can find it on the webpage of The BioBricks Foundation:RFC . Following are some more previews at the draft document.
Figure 2: Preview at draft document of RFC55
Figure 3: Preview at draft document of RFC55
XML Schema
XML Schemas express shared vocabularies and allow machines to carry out rules made by people. They provide a means for defining the structure, content and semantics of XML documents. Being written in XML fashion, a Schema is perfect for MoDeL to allow software to perform check on syntax. Following is the preview of the beta version of XML Schema for MoDeL. The Schema can be downloaded at iGaME project page on SourceForge.

Cornell,2018,Team:Cornell#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"Professor Swingle is interested in developing methods to advance the genetic analysis of Pseudomonas syringae. This work has led him to create a recombination-mediated genetic engineering system for efficient manipulation of the P. syringae genome. With his expertise, he noted that the activity of hrpRS would ramp up quickly in our system. To provide tangible parameters in our testing, he suggested that we set up reporter systems to test the activity. Additionally, he recommended that we use an HRP inducing media and attach an RNA thermometer connected to a reporter to measure the time it takes to induce hrpRS.
Implementation
To verify that our circuit works, we tested each component of the high- and low- pass filter separately.
It is important to consider delay time and minimize the energy needed to implement the circuit to have faster components. This informed our selection of our RNA Thermometer and sfGFP for the components of our circuit.
We used fluorescence plate readers for the real-time and rapid measurement of the fluorescence of individual cells.
To measure the time it takes to induce hrpRS, we set up reporter systems with the RNA thermometer connected to a reporter to provide tangible parameters in our testing.
Understanding Applications
Understanding the Purpose of Our Project
When we first started our project back in March, we knew that there would be many applications for our project, but we weren’t sure where to start looking. We first turned to professors performing research in areas such as engineering physics and bioengineering to get their opinions on how to steer our project in a direction that would make the most significant impact on society. With the goal of creating something that could be useful not only in the lab, but also in our day-to-day lives, we then further delved into the possible applications with our team.
Integrating Findings from Human Practices
When we interviewed Professor Lambert, he suggested we look towards co-culturing and how that might be used to regulate the microbiome. Co-cultures are difficult to maintain, but if each culture of bacteria responds to a different frequency, it would be possible to make some populations grow more while others grow less. This could apply to the human microbiome, increasing the concentration of beneficial bacteria to outnumber harmful ones. If the microbiome could respond to frequency, then perhaps it could also provide more information about our daily lives. Many people take pills, such as birth control, vitamins, or cholesterol medication, once a day. If we forgot to take our pill at the frequency of once a day, the microbiome could report to us and remind us when that frequency is off.

Splicing: The New Alternative
The 2010 Washington University iGEM team is designing a synthetic alternative splicing system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in order to create a new tool synthetic biologists can use in their scientific endeavors. A single definitive locus and only one other potential locus within the S. cerevisiae genome have shown alternative splicing capabilities (Juneau, 2009). This lack of complex splicing activity within S. cerevisiae limits how synthetic biologists utilize splicing in their projects. The 2010 WashU iGEM team strives to overcome this issue by expressing Sex-Lethal (SxL), a Drosophila Melanogaster splicing regulatory gene, in S. cerevisiae and attempting to use it to control alternative splicing events.
The designed construct employs two 3’ splice sites to select for cyan or yellow fluorescent proteins. By altering the presence of SxL within the cell, the preference between the proximal and distal 3' splice sites can be modulated. This results in varying ratios of CFP and YFP, allowing us to show the creation of a synthetically designed alternative splicing mechanism in S. cerevisiae.
The alternative splicing machine can be applied to isoform engineering, showing the unique benefits of this mechanism. A more complex construct is designed in which the 5' end of a flourscent protein is always included in mRNA. However, different 3' ends are alternatively spliced on, creating different isoforms of a protein. This construct simplistically mirrors the much more complex examples of alternative splicing in nature, as in the avian cochlea. Avian cochlear cells alternatively splice as many as 576 different isoforms of the same gene, helping to create a gradient that is necessary to hear a wide spectrum of sound (Black, 1998). Another possible advantage to alternative splicing is that it allows a combinatorial approach to problem solving, like the one used by the 2006 Davidson iGEM team. Instead of using recombinases to modify DNA, splicing, which only"
Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," already established low-throughput measuring methods. Then, with CAT-Seq, we can also measure the activities of those mutants in high-throughput, which can then be compared to our previous measurements to confirm that CAT-Seq system is working as intended and can precisely discriminate different mutant activities.
After acquiring the esterase enzyme and its mutants, regulatory sequences - RNA polymerase promoter and ribosome binding site -  were added to each of the library members. Then, the fragments were circularized for the MDA and RCT reactions.
After acquiring the initial esterase for building CAT-Seq, why were the mutations added manually and not randomly?
The goal of the in-silico modelling of the esterase was to determine mutants that would have different catalytic activities. If we had a randomized library of esterase mutants, it would have been difficult to precisely tune CAT-Seq parts as we would not be sure what output of the system we should expect. In contrast, having mutants with precisely measured catalytic activities beforehand using well-established and precise low-throughput methods enables us to recognise how well our system is performing.
For example, if mutant A was determined to be a little bit more active then mutant B, CAT-Seq would have to be sensitive enough to discriminate the difference and also precise enough to determine that mutant A is indeed more active then mutant B.
2. Library encapsulation into droplets
General description
For the precise measurement of multiple biomolecule’s catalytic activities they need to be physically separated. For example, if we would want to measure the activities of two mutants, we probably would not mix them together - we would measure them in separate tubes. The same logic applies with bigger libraries. Droplet microfluidics offers a way to quickly parallelize billions of reactions by physically separating reactants in pico- to nano-liter water droplets.
Using a microfluidic device chip whole DNA library can be encapsulated into the droplets, together with specific reaction reagents. Water phase flows through the microfluidic device channels with the help of pressure created by special pumps.
As water passes through oil flow, it breaks into defined size droplets. Their size depends on dimensions of the device, water and oil flow rates. On average, 300 000 of droplets can be generated in under 10 minutes. Generated droplets are collected into a simple 1.5mL tube and can be incubated at a required temperature or stored in a fridge.
In CAT-Seq, multiple of things must be encapsulated into the droplets:

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP."

Our team finished the inter-lab with the ASTWS-China and WorldShaper-XSHS. In this inter-lab activity, they gave us some really effective help. For instance, they provided substrates to us in the case that we did not make enough substrates, which helps us save time in the experiment. In return, we assisted some materials to WorldShaper-XSHS. After the Inter-lab experiment, we exchanged our data with the other teams, which made the data more accurate.Furthermore, because of laboratory located the same building with ZJU-China in July then we moved to another building which ASTWS-China and Worldshaper-XSHS located in August, we have many collaboration for the project experiments, such as discussion on difficult technique problem or lent experimental materials.

When choosing what simple parts to make for our project we had two main goals: 1) to improve the quality of parts already in the registry by making them more accessible to all users and 2) to augment the current set of yeast-compatible biobricks to harness the power of this synthetic biology-friendly model organism. Incorporating these goals with the 'Quality not Quantity' mantra, we decided to focus our efforts on certain areas of advancement that we believe future researchers will like to see in the registry.
1. To improve parts already in the registry by lessening the constrictions on their use and making them more adaptable.
36bp LoxP site: the LoxP site is the naturally-occurring substrate for the Cre recombinase. In nature (and in previous biobricks) it is a palindromic sequence 34 base pairs long. Because this is not a multiple of three, when used inside a transcribed ORF the 34bp LoxP site can throw off the frame of the translated parts. To get around this, previous teams had to either add or take away bases from surrounding parts to keep their systems in frame (painstakingly and sometimes unsuccessfully). To get around this restriction, we designed and Biobricked a 36bp LoxP site that Registry users can include in transcribed regions without worrying about keeping everything in frame.
pGAL-RBS: This promoter is induced by the presence of galactose and repressed by the presence of glucose. Because most future projects will involve fusing a Ribosome Binding Site to the promoter we decided to simplify things and submit this construct to the Registry.
pTEF-RBS: This promoter is a medium-strength constitutive promoter. We submitted the part fused to the RBS.
lexOpCYC-RBS: This pCYC promoter has a very limited amount of constitutive transcription. Just upstream is the lex operator to which the LexA DNA binding domain will bind. This can be useful for a number of constructs including our yeast two-hybrid screen. Again, we submitted this part with the RBS attached.
2. Yeast strains are more rarely used in iGEM projects but contain certain parameters that are ideal"
Michigan,2012,Team:Michigan#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"quantitative data on recombinase activity at the DNA level.  Using the digestible reporters, we determined that FimE has a low inversion activity. We demonstrated that hbiF as submitted to the Registry is functional.  DH5α transformed with hbiF has a fimbriated phenotype, suggesting HbiF activity on the native fimS.
Native recombinase activity in E. coli is augmented by DNA-bending proteins. As inversion is accomplished through a Holliday junction intermediate, the invertible regions must at some point be in close proximity with each other. The simplicity of our system likely contributes to the lower efficiency of the recombinases. Co-expression of the recombinase system with DNA-bending proteins, such as leucine-responsive regulatory proteins and integration host factor protein, will increase the probability that the invertible regions are at a distance preferred for higher recombinase activity.
Production and degradation rates of each recombinase within the system can be further optimized by investigating combinations of promoters and RBSs, and the use of degradation tags. Imprecise regulation of recombinase expression can also be compensated by preventing the leaky gene expression from forming proteins, or counteracting the effects of leaky protein expression. Although the system is more complicated than what we envisioned, it continues to be a viable and interesting way of manipulating genetic information, and have the potential to become increasingly complex and robust with additional components.

HUMAN PRACTICE
Getting the public engaged and educated about synthetic biology is one of iGEM's core values and goal. The following are things the Columbia NYC iGEM Team did to go about achieving this goal:
Surveying the Land
The team wanted to get a preview of how our idea would be perceived by the general public. To this end, we created an online survey, the goal of which was to get a better understanding of what the general public knows about GMOs and probiotics. The survey was structured to gradually give more information about GMOs and probiotics, measure initial comfort levels with these concepts, and measure their willingness to support them afterwards. The people who took the survey ranged from 18 to 50+ years old and had an education background ranging from high school to advanced profession degrees. The survey can be found here. Please feel free to continue to contribute to it and expand our dataset! In addition, we acknowledge the fact that our sample size may be skewed towards people who are already interested in synthetic biology based on how we advertised it (through the team and personal forms of social media), but the information gleaned from the data we collected is still rather useful.
So, what exactly did we find out from our survey? Well for one, as the graph to the right shows, on a scale from 1-5 with 5 being the most comfortable, 58.3% of people have a comfort level less than or equal to 3. This confirms our suspicion that most people are not all too comfortable with the idea of GMOs. From here, we tell the survey taker that genetically modified bacteria are used to produce insulin and a range of antibiotics to demonstrate a useful function.      With this, as the pie chart to the left reveals, 14.5% of people stated that they are more supportive of GMOs, but for the most part (79% of the sample size),
people's opinion remained the same and 6% of the people were more opposed to it afterwards. This tells us that it is going to take much more than the fact that GMOs already have some useful functions in society to have them support new applications of synthetic biology. Thus, it is important in the future to consider what synthetic biologists should do to garner more support for their cause and to"

We have investigated this in silver human practices - those with a positive result would go onto have a CT scan and move onto the standard NICE diagnostic and treatment pathway (in the case of NSCLC). [11]
The distribution of test values in the target population should be known and a suitable cut-off level defined and agreed.
There should be evidence from high quality randomized controlled trials that the screening programme is effective in reducing mortality or morbidity or evidence from high quality trials that the test accurately measures risk when helping a patient make an “informed choice”
Hennessey et al.’s cohort was not large enough for this to be conclusively known. [3] Further validation with a larger data set is required. The same is true for the links between miRNAs and disease more widely. However, preliminary results are promising. Our test would also need to undergo clinical trials - to test the efficacy of the toehold switches in measuring miRNA levels.
There should be evidence that the complete screening programme (test, diagnostic procedures, treatment/ intervention) is clinically, socially and ethically acceptable to health professionals and the public
To be clinically acceptable our test would need to to undergo large scale clinical trials. This would validate our research showing that it would be specific and cost effective. Socially and ethically, there should be no issues, for the same reasons as above.
The benefit gained should outweigh any harms from screening such as overdiagnosis, overtreatment, false positives, false reassurance, uncertain findings and complications.
The NLST showed 20% reduction in mortality with high risk screening for NSCLC using LDCT. Screening is therefore recommended in the US to high risk population groups. However, our test could prevent unnecessary further testing in many - and overdiagnosis could be reduced by examining the miRNA signature of the tumor. Furthermore, as mentioned in silver human practices , our test would not be offered as a conclusive diagnosis - only to rule out cancer in some and refer the others for further testing. There would also be psychological benefit using our test compared to existing methods in that a possible cancer could be ruled out far more quickly.
The screening programme should be economically balanced in relation to expenditure on medical care with regard to evidence from cost benefit and/or cost effectiveness analyses
We have created a cost effectiveness model - that works out who we should screen for the sensor to be cost effective and result in the cost per QALY being within NICE’s guidelines.
Clinical management of the condition should be optimized in health-care providers prior to participation in the screening programme.
There should be a plan for managing and monitoring the screening"

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.

None of the biobrick colonies from Friday grew.
Additional colonies grown from original TSH gblock plates miniprepped before PCR.
Previous colony PCR’s unsuccessful due to base insertions. . Alternative strategy to miniprep before PCR procedures no working so hoping minipreps will help the PCR.
Carried out the luciferin experiment again and carried out the data analysis of it.
Transformed the level 1 ligation mix that was left over the weekend in the fridge. The bacteria were spread over 5 agar plates (kan,IPTG,X-gal) to give a better chance of growth. These plates were left overnight in the 37.

Screened for blue/white colonies on PDF, PR, GST, P19 and Luc plates. 9, 5, 1, 1 and 0 white colonies, respectively. Picked these cells and grown in 5ml of Chl broth instead of colony PCR due to the low results.
Performed colony PCRs of the 12 white WRKY colonies. Used the same colony twice with 58 and 59 primers and also with the WRKY-specific primers.
Transformed WRKY cells and grew on Chl, X-gal, IPTG plates.
Gel produced from miniprep PCR from 7/08 promising. Regrew remaining colonies overnight (7th/8th).
Mini-prepped these colonies for PCR.
PCR performed on the mini preps and then a gel was run using the PCR products.
White colonies were observed over the 5 level 1 plates that were left to grow overnight (approximately 30 individual white colonies).
Set up a colony PCR however the primers used were not correct. So 10 colonies were inoculated to grow overnight.

Finding Resources
""The only source of knowledge is experience."" - Albert Einstein
In the world of biology there are approximately sixty million peer-reviewed articles and the number is growing exponentially every year. That’s an avalanche of information that can be overwhelming to look through. But what if you were dealing with a new topic? What if the information is very difficult to find or there is very minimal out there?
It is best to do the literature research before you even step foot into the lab, this way you will be more prepared and know what your doing and dealing with. Another helpful tip:
Divide the searching among your team. This way more ground will be covered and you will be able to obtain more information on your topic.
Make sure your team members have access to the articles you have already found this way you all won’t end up finding the same article over and over again.
Articles are out there for everyone to read, they are the proof of the work done by researchers. It is all done to move us forward in the world of knowledge and to grow our imaginations for more things that were once consider impossible in the past. We all have access to them. We just need to know where to look. The more information we can gather the better
The TEAM
The kind of people in your team can either make or break your project. Our team was lucky in that the majority of us already were acquainted with one another and those who were not meshed extremely well with the rest of the group. Additionally, our team had another great advantage: diversity. Our knowledge and experience encompasses a wide range of topics from Nanotechnology to Biological Sciences and even to Mechanical Engineering. Because of this diversity, we were able to work on many aspects of the project at once and truly use every drop of our potential. Take inspiration from the iGEM competition itself – not only does iGEM focus on synthetic biology but it also emphasizes the importance of other topics like social sciences and entrepreneurship. If you can find a team that is as diverse as the iGEM competition, then you are gold!
When interviewing a potential candidate for your team, also look for “people skills” and the ability to communicate well. As mentioned before, human practices and the social sciences is a huge part of iGEM! Being able to think “beyond the bench” and beyond the technical skills will be a huge asset to your team. Having multiple perspectives when solving problems or"

√ This summer, we helped WHU team constructing a standardized plasmid C1-pSB1C3 when they met difficulties. And we helped WHU-China team and HZAU-China lyophilize the samples before shipment as their lyophilizer cannot handle the 96well plate.
√ We found two SpeI illegal sites in Part BBa_K191007, so we removed that by site-directed mutagenesis and created 3 different mutants of Part BBa_K191007. We inserted RBS + GFP for test and verify, but unfortunately we can’t get the competitive inhibitor of tryptophan in the formation of the specific Apo repressor. Moreover, we also documented the Pgal1 promoter (BBa_K1144001) and Gal4 binding domain (BBa_K801032).

Stakeholders
To obtain more insight in the feasibility of our idea, we talked to many experts within different fields. Among the people we approached are doctors, researchers, students, but also people working in non-academic fields such as at ministeries and professional advisors. Each of them was invited to give their perspectives on our work. We also wondered if they could see the benefits of our device within our application scenarios and if they had any other suggestions for usage. Moreover, we gave them space to criticize our idea, and thereby advise us about aspects of our design that could be perfected. With their involvement, we could further develop our ideas. A short overview of each talk is given below.
General
RIVM & Rathenau
RIVM is the national institute involved in regulation of safety and environment. The Rathenau Institute is involved in the consideration of technological advancements and their role in society. Both institutes regularly experience the clash that occurs when technological novelties are presented to a poorly informed public. To promote dialogue between society and technological researches the RIVM and Rathenau Institute together organized a symposium about synthetic biology and its role in society.
The iGEM-teams of the Netherlands had an active role in the organization of the symposium and were given an opportunity to present their projects to a diverse audience (consisting of amongst others employees of the RIVM and Rathenau and ministries). The presentation was followed by a discussion about societal problems that play a role when considering synthetic biology. Read more on this event here:
The RIVM is the government body responsible for improving public health and providing a clean and safe environment.
We presented our project to policymakers attending the SynBio convention and held a discussion afterwards.

In the presence of blue light, YcgF dimerizes and now it has a great affinity for YcgE, clearing the promoter and allowing transcription to proceed.
It is reported that the response of this promoter is weak in comparison to some others standard strong promoters registered in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.

Red Emission
Description
Red Emission is composed of mainly two enzymes. Our first enzyme (Luciferase) is a mutated form of the wild type enzyme found in Photinus pyralis. Our mutant is expected to glow red instead of the wild type blue-green. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation reaction that yields light. The substrate for this reaction (Luciferin) is a most complicated molecule, and to our knowledge no one has ever managed to produce it within an E. coli chassis. Therefore, we need to inoculate the medium with luciferin to enable the reactions. However, recently a new enzyme was discovered (LRE) that recycles luciferin. We thus need only an initial inoculation with luciferin and from there on, the system is sufficiently autonomous.
We plan on using Luciferase as a reporter gene, while having LRE expressed constitutively.

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Comparison_-_-_TEXT.html," Synthetic Biology is widespread in South America is the companies related to this field. Biotechnology is closely related to Synthetic Biology and the most part of companies which develop biotech may develop SynBio as well. We can observe in the Figure 3, below, that all countries have this kind of company. Peru has the smallest number of Biotec Companies compared to the other countries involved in this research, and for this reason, it doesn’t have any survey study about it. For the rest of these countries, they have survey studies and we could get the right number of companies. Brazil is the leader with 237 companies working in Biotech field right now. This is expected since Amazon represents the greatest biodiversity in the world and the most part of it is situated in Brazil. Then, we have Chile with 200 companies, Colombia with 138 and Argentina with 120. Uruguay is still with a modest number of 32 in Biotech Companies.
Synthetic Biology Regulation in South America
In general, countries/regions in South America do not have specific regulations that address bio-safety issues regarding synthetic biology. The following table summarizes the current regulation imposed on synthetic biology activities in South America countries.
The laws instead enforce pre-existing guidelines that were originally formulated for the regulation of genetically engineered or genetically modified organisms or even use of biodiversity and biotechnology. These regulations were developed in the early 1990s and late-2000s. Scientists in Brazil argue that new specific regulations for synthetic biology by the government are necessary for the safe development of the field in these countries. In other hand, this regulation requires detailed analysis because it can prevent the synthetic biology development. (< a href=""http://www.interacademies.net/File.aspx?id=25059"" target=""_blank"">Read more)
Currently, no countries in this region have proposed initiating the development of such regulations. Even in United States, they have only the National institutes of health guidelines for research involving recombinant DNA molecules, revised on 2013 but it is not specific for synthetic biology. Actually, in 2010, United States, a leading country in synthetic biology, announced that new regulation or modification of existing regulations that govern synthetic biology is not necessary. The Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues of the United States explained that instead of coming up with stringent regulation, they will “choose a middle course” to maximize the potential benefit of synthetic biology. It instead recommended self-regulation by synthetic biologists (Wadman, 2010).
In summary, countries in South America are still beginners in developing synthetic biology. There is still need revision for their legislation to include synthetic"

We started with our brainstorming and project design stage where we thought through various directions we could take our idea, and then we moved into the experimental design stage where we outlined the things we wanted to accomplish over our project's duration.
Brainstorming

Experimental
Stage
Brainstorming Stage
Using synthetic biology to reduce methane emissions from cattle was a well-accepted project idea from the beginning. The team’s first hurdle was figuring out how to go about pursuing this goal. One of the earliest ideas was to inhibit methyl coenzyme M reductase, one of the final enzymes in methanogenesis. The far most appealing inhibitor was 3-nitrooxypropanol with one study finding it decreased methane production by 71.5% (Romero-Pérez et al., 2016). However, we could not pursue this method because a biosynthetic pathway for 3-NOP is not known and the compound falls under patent protection for the specific use of decreasing methane production in ruminants, Patent No. WO 2012084629 A1.
A short-lived idea was to design E. coli to be a methanotroph, having methane be its one and only carbon source to counteract methanogenesis. Unfortunately, information on methanotrophy inside bovine rumina is lacking (Attwood & McSweeney, 2008). Dr. Niu, one of our advisors, along with Dr. Fernando from UNL’s Animal Science Department recommended that we look elsewhere as this would be a difficult undertaking.
Our last pitch incorporates the idea to redirect the flow of hydrogen away from methanogens (Satyanagalakshmi et al., 2015), since the removal of hydrogen is essential for cofactors to be reoxidised and for ruminal fermentation to be maintained (Attwood & McSweeney, 2008). Our team researched this route and initially found sulfate-reducing bacteria to be a prime candidate for reducing methanogenesis. However, hydrogen sulfide is a product of sulfate reduction and can cause serious neurological damage to organisms (Drewnoski et al., 2011).
As a team, we decided to pursue the two most plausible options for our project . The first solution we decided on"

To avoid interference from upstream coding arac, we set a terminator BBa_B0015 before PT7, and a Ribo J after PT7[22]. RiboJ is a section of functional RNA which comprises the sTRSV- ribozyme which can excise its upstream fragment to reduce noise, and an additional 23-nt hairpin immediately downstream to help expose the RBS. It can be used to buffer synthetic circuits from genetic context[23].

Before construction, we measured efficiency of different PT7.
Here’s the result(Fig.22):

Before construction, we tested the best induction concentration of PBAD.

This SEG is to fill the gap between PBAD and T7 RNA polymerase, and fuse a UmnD degradation tag.

After the construction of T7 expression platform, we digested the platform using the native restriction site Nru I and Mfe I, with the remaining part of T7 RNAP overlapping sequences for Gibson Assembly. We amplified N-T7 and C-T7 divided from selected locus by PCR, and amplified intein with 20bp overlapping sequences with the flanking N-T7 and C-T7 by PCR.

1. Plasmid Isolation
The Pqrr4+I13500 plasmid was isolated from TOP10 cells in order for them to be verified via Restriction digest. This would then be made competent in order to transform mutants in.
2. Restriction Digest
The Pqrr4+I13500 isolated plasmid was digested with XbaI and PstI enzymes, then ran on 1% gel at 100V. The following gel was obtained.
As one can see, the upper bands of the colonies 4, 5, and 6 match the upper band in the pSB2K3 size control, meaning the plasmid switch to pSB2K3 seems to have been successful. Also, the bottom bands of the colonies 4, 5, and 6 match the one in the Pqrr4+I13500 in pSB1AC3 lane, meaning that the construction seems to have worked. These two lower bands might look as if they do not match; however, if you consider the slanting of the ladders at right compared to the left, it seems that the two match.
3. Sequencing
Yesterday's sequencing of Pqrr4+B0034+K082003 had been received and analyzed. The forward sequencing did not work; however, the reverse did, and an unusual problem was noticed. K082003 had matched 100% with the sequence provided by the parts registry, and Pqrr4 matched 99%, which made sense because the Pqrr4 is almost at the 1000bp region starting from behind and polymerase often reads inaccurately after reading about 1kb, but the part in the middle, B0034, was not present. This is unusual because I have sequenced the Pqrr4+B0034 construct before constructing K082003 behind. An explanation might be that the scar did not form between Pqrr4+B0034 which caused the B0034 part to be cut out. Another reason that may explain this result may be that I simply used a non-verified isolated plasmid of Pqrr4+B0034. Either way, I would have to carry out the construction procedure from the start.
Actual matching of the sequences is soon to come, as now the sequencing website is down.

Methods
On this page, you can find all the methods and protocols used in the lab to obtain our results. For some techniques we included some basic theory since it is a prerequisite to get acquainted with the details behind these techniques before using them. To learn more about them click the titles below.
P1 transduction
Theory
To be able to create patterns, two different cell types called A and B will have to interact with each other. In order to achieve the desired behavior, the cells used in the experiments were derived from K12 Escherichia coli strains with introduction of specific knockouts. Cell type A has a deletion of tar and tsr genes, whereas in cell type B both tar and cheZ genes are knocked out. The Keio collection is composed of a set of precisely defined single-gene deletion mutants of all non-essential genes in E. coli K-12. The targeted genes were replaced by a kanamycin resistance cassette. The kanamycin cassette is enclosed between two FRT sites making excision possible using FLP recombinase (reference 1). FLP recombinase triggers an intramolecular recombination between FRT repeats in the chromosome. Since both the antibiotic resistance gene and the plasmid replication region are surrounded by two FRT sites, both are to be eliminated (Figure 1, step 1).
A genetic procedure for moving selectable mutations of interest, called the P1 transduction, was used. Since the packaging of the bacteriophage P1 is rather inaccurate, it will on occasion package the DNA of its bacterial host instead of its own phage chromosome. This implies that the lysate will contain either packaged phage or bacterial DNA. After infection of a second host with this lysate, a transfer of parts of the chromosome from the donor strain into the receiver strain will take place. Those DNA pieces can then recombine using the FRT sites and hereby be incorporated permanently into the chromosome of the new strain. Here, the recombination was triggered by selection on kanamycin. (reference 2)
In general, we used three steps to obtain the double knock-outs (Figure 1). In the first step, the kanamycin cassette of the tar knock-out strain was removed by flippase, coded on plasmid PCP20. Afterwards, the temperature sensitive plasmid was removed"

Accordingly, we designed a simple BioBrick to contain the ftsz gene under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter. This allows us to tune FtsZ production to achieve optimal minicell production. We are developing a model that relates the amount of IPTG added to the final concentration of minicells that are produced and purified.
2. Further Enhancing the Safety of a Minicell Chassis
To take advantage of the minicell’s innate potential as a safer biological chassis, we focused on three safety precautions to enhance suitability for the human body. First we used the lpxM strain to reduce the risks of recognition via dendritic cells and toll-like receptors (TLR-4). Secondly, we used the Ail protein and polysialic acid (PSA) to address the manifold risks posed by complement activation, a significant part of innate immunity.
A. Reduce the Risks of TLR-4 Mediated Inflammatory Response. High concentrations of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on bacterial cell surfaces can induce dangerous inflammatory responses that can lead to septic shock-  and even death. To prevent this, we chose to work with a safer background strain. Inspired by the work of the 2007 UC Berkeley iGEM team, we worked with an lpxM deletion-insertion E. coli strain, which elicits a significantly reduced immune response. This sharp decrease in endotoxicity is due to a modification to lipid A, which acts as a hydrophobic anchor for LPS. The deletion-insertion to the lpxM gene prevents the biosynthesis of the most toxic hexa-acylated form of lipid A, instead resulting in a non-myristolated form of LPS with lower immunogenicity and a reduced capacity to activate monocyte-derived dendritic cells (as measured by a reduction in cytokines such as IL-8 and TNF-α) as well as the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), which is the main signal transducing receptor for extracellular LPS. [4] Using this safer strain, we could thus mitigate the risks of a harmful inflammatory response by the innate immune system.
