Tianjin,2012,Team:Tianjin#Modeling#Propagation_-_-_TEXT.html,"If V0 are very small, this means the genetic pollution related problem is difficult to gain public attention. However, the potential dangers hidden beside will be destructive if there is not enough public attention and related precautionary measure. As a result, we also call the small speed under such condition the dangerous speed. We can conclude from equation (8) that the less V(t) is, the more significant the PSA are. The function of average social welfare can also be derivate.
If the advertising propagation begins at t1=0, the average social welfare
The curve of this function is shown in Fig. 2, and we can also conclude from the figure that the t1=0is the optimum beginning time of the propagation.
Figure 2. The difference of curves with and without immediate advertisement when the initial propaganda speed is small (from TJU iGEM Team 2012)
Model 2
If the value of V0 is so large, so it can avoid the danger of lacking enough public attention, we can call it the safe speed. Even if, with more and more people get to know it, the propagation speed will also decrease, spending a lot of money on advertisement immediately is not wise. To save the money and to gain better propagation effects, we had better do some advertisement after a short while when the propagation speed are enough small. If we assume V1 is the initial propaganda speed which is larger than the critical speed of the propagation.
We can have the profit function which is the relationship between Q(t), V1 and t1.
While,
Within equation (10), β, b, k, ω are coefficients that are known to us, they are obtained from the problem itself and the mental factors which will be decided case by case.
This equation can be solved through software. If different V0, V1, a and T are obtained from the actual conditions. Through comparison, we can conclude the different beginning timet1 and related maximum social welfare Q(t).
What we can conclude from the Figure 3 (tendency curve) is that the optimum beginning time is not when t1=0.

Model Evaluation
Our model have the following advantages:
Easy to popularize into any advertising propagation of various social problems. The idea of the model is very clever which can accurately predict the optimum beginning time of advertisement;
The applied range is so wide that it can be used in almost any advertising propagation of newly emerged problem;

We also see that the cells remained in Q3  even after arabinose induction. The bimodal distribution indicate that some cells got induced while other cells were in repressed state.
Figure 2.  Forward scatter intensity (FSC) versus GFP graphs for samples with PBAD promoter regulating GFP generator.
All samples were inoculated in M9 minimal salt medium overnight in various arabinose concentrations (%w/v). The samples were        diluted around 10 fold the next day. Sample were fixed and the fluorescence was measured using flow cytometer. The graphs were plotted for the control        constructs, pSB3K3- BBa_E0240 (-) and pSB3K3- BBa_I20260 ( BBa_J23101 ) in the absence of arabinose. FSC versus GFP graphs for pSB3K3- BBa_I0500 - BBa_E0240 ( BBa_I0500 ) in 0, 0.2 and 1.0% arabinose concentration were plotted.         Each set of graphs were obtained for three different cell strains, DH10B, DH5α and BW25113.
The distribution can also give us some idea of PBAD promoter leakage in different cells strain. If the data points are on or near the boundary between Q3 and Q4,  we know that the promoter is leaky. The results indicate that the promoter is relatively more leaky in DH10B compared to other cell strains.
The percentages of cells in each Q3 and Q4 are highlighted in Figure 2. After addition of arabinose, we clearly see more percentage in Q4. Around 80% of the cells for DH10B  and BW25113 are in Q4. Relatively lower percentage of cells in Q4 is observed for DH5α. Only around 60 to 70% of cells were in Q4 after arabinose induction. The shift in the  distribution from Q3 to Q4 also corresponded to the increase of RPU across different arabinose concentration. At 0% arabinose concentration, for all three strain, higher percentage  of cells are in Q3 and therefore the RPU is low. After arabinose induction, more cells are in Q4 and RPU is high. The percentage of cells in Q4 levels off for arabinose concentration  that we have tested. The trend was observed for RPU measurement.
We can also conclude that even after maximum period of"

Lab-on-a-disc Screening
The results we have described so far have focused on developing libraries of nonribosomal peptides (NRP), but we have not yet described how these libraries may be screened. High throughput screening is essential to couple MAGE to improved drug design. In the laboratory, we have worked with tyrocidine and surfactins. They are NRP antibiotics, which are cytotoxic to red blood cells [1][2][3]. In our first generation screening experiments, we tested if we could use this property to screen NRP libraries for reduced cytotoxicity.
Achievements
UV-Vis absorbance spectra proved that red blood cells are lysed in the presence of certain NRPs. However, the experiments should be repeated with fresh blood cells. This means lab-on-disk experiments are feasible for screening mutated NRPs.
Background
Certain groups of nonribosomal peptides, including the commonly used antibiotic tyrocidine as well as surfactin, display non-specific cytotoxicity [1][2][3]. For this reason, these antibiotics are commonly used topically, as intravascular injection causes hemolysis of red blood cells [1]. Low concentrations of NRP antibiotics have been found to be fatal to animal models, which further supports the need for an in-vitro screening. Through UV-Vis spectrophotometry, we are able to analyze the amount of light absorbed in a solution with the addition of our compounds of interest. The absorbance spectra of red blood cells from 300-800 nm changes depending on the state of the red blood cells "
UNOTT,2017,Team:UNOTT#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," of varying repression efficiencies has generated a greater range of expression profiles.
The proof-of-concept of CRISPR interference demonstrated here allows us to envision its permanent incorporation in the Key. coli system, which could even include a further expansion of the sgRNA pool.
3. Random plasmid assembly via ligation is a feasible strategy
The degree of randomness that can be achieved from a ligation reaction was put to the test in order to assess the suitability of this technique for the large scale generation of keys.
A strong and weak promoter was combined with all three fluorescent reporters: GFP, RFP and CFP. Ligations were carried out with controlled use of the DCBA restriction system, with the positions that each reporter could assume being predetermined. In theory, under this design, 23 possible versions of a ligated plasmid could be obtained. From a sample size of 12 colonies, 6/8 combinations were encountered with comparable distribution frequencies. It is logical to assume that upon screening a larger colony sample, all possible combinations could be encountered.
The above results provide strong evidence that assembly via ligation can generate a truly random combination set, thus being a suitable method for key generation in the future. Scaling-up the random ligation process would be possible with larger part pools, supported by the increasing availability of robotic platforms and relevant high-throughput, automated protocols for plasmid assembly, bacterial transformation, colony picking and screening.
4. Freeze-drying is a suitable storage method that allows reproducible revival and expression output
Two engineered E. coli strains expressing RFP under strong or weak promoters were cultured, aliquoted and freeze-dried. These aliquots were then split in three subgroups relative to their storage environment: -80°C, 4°C and room temperature (RT). At frequent and regular times, cells were revived in liquid medium. OD and fluorescence measurements were performed to assess the growth and fluorescence profile for each sample.
The results show that storage temperature does not have a significant impact on revival quality up to 2 weeks of storage. At 3 weeks however, the expression profile of samples stored at RT begins to deviate. Longer-term experiments would be able to provide more accurate information.
Based on the current data, -20oC would be a suitable storage temperature for the Key. coli device ensuring consistency of the expression output. Most importantly, this temperature is easily achieved using a conventional freezer.
Expression output is identifiable from 2-hrs onwards, implying that the system can also be used with a very small time delay, in cases where time is of essence. However, for more accurate use, we recommend that"

pCusC, PpcoA sequencing and promoter test
Author：Tian Liu
1. Experimental Background：
iGEM encourages the communication between teams and help others. So, when we heard HUST-China has something wrong about their promoter, we decided to give a hand. The one problem they had is they tried many times but failed to sequence those promoters in pET28a, and the other is they put mRFP under the promoter to do a promoter test but didn’t get result. So we got pCusC & PpcoA promoters with mRFP from them.
2. Proposes:
2.1 pCusC & PpcoA promoters sequencing
2.2 pCusC & PpcoA promoters test
3. Materials and equipment:
pCusC & PpcoA promoters with mRFP in pET28a plasmid LB medium Kanamycin Multifunctional microplate reader Shaking incubator
4. Method:
4.1 Sequencing
We designed the 5’-agatcgggctcgccacttcg-3’ as the reverse primer to sequence the promoters. And Tsing Ke Biology Technology Company helped us synthetize the primer and sequence those plasmids.
Analyzed the sample pCusC’s sequencing result, we found that the T7 promoter has not be digested , there is no pCusC in the plasmid, but mRFP has successful ligated. So the red color we observed was the red fluorescent protein expressed by the"

At first, all the readings came out as zero. After analysing our device we located the bug in Denver Biolabs' code and wrote a short solution. We later also removed some redundant sections.
You can download the fixed code from Github , however we recommend you use our far superior design using instructions below .
Our fluorometer and densitometer
We significantly improved Aachen and Denver Biolabs' design, having redone the most of the wiring and parts of the software. But we wanted to go further; we made our own combined fluorometer and densitometer, keeping only Aachen's cuvette holder design and their measuring principle.
Here we document the design decisions we made, how we built and tested it, and Judd-UK’s input to the design.
For the measurements, check out the measurement page .
Components
Our design uses only off-the-shelf components except for the cuvette holder, for which we couldn’t find an alternative. Aachen 2014’s design was good for this so we used theirs.
The key component is the Digispark, a USB-based development board similar to an Arduino except much cheaper, and with the ability to communicate with a host computer by mimicking keyboard events. It acts as a bridge between the light sensor and our interpreter app.
The device plugs in via USB so is compatible with almost anything, including desktop computers, laptops, phones and tablets. We created an interpreter application to be used on the device it is plugged into that can save the readings and convert them into common units transmittance percentage.
Our design is completely open-source by OSI standards [1]
Our code for both the device and the interpreter is licensed under the GPLv3 license
Our circuit design is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0

Preface
When a new scientific field is just budding, outreach organisations and events are key to bringing in new minds and catalysing expansion. Synthetic biology is no different, and the iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machine) competition initiated by Tom Knight, Drew Endy and Randy Rettberg is arguably the biggest outreach effort that has ever been launched in this area. The annual competition encourages students to dedicate a single summer vacation to learning and applying the basic principles of synthetic biology to create a genetically engineered organism that can be ‘useful’ to society. iGEM has grown exponentially since its humble beginnings as an IAP at MIT in 2003 to become an international community with thousands of participants from all over the world. Many iGEM teams from around the world have conducted their own outreach events, introducing synthetic biology to an even wider audience including children who have not even left primary school.
One question strikes us, however - just how effective has iGEM been as means to engage more scientists to work in synthetic biology? What has its effect been on its participants, and the field as a whole? By making some advances to answer this question, valuable insight can be made into what similar outreach programmes can work to achieve, and what they can do to improve their effectiveness.
To this end, a short online questionnaire was designed and distributed by the Cambridge iGEM team in 2011, with"

In every speech, we mainly introduced the history of iGEM, and how creative the match is—lots of innovation are originated from this match. Then, we introduced our project—how to effectively decompose the kitchen waste with low osmotic pressure (high salinity) osmotic pressure. We basically talked about the factors which can affect the efficiency or the ability of yeasts which are used to decompose the kitchen waste, and our own solution.
Sponsor
We found some donors to raise the funds. We wrote an article on the internet to describe what synthetic biology and iGEM are, and to introduce our own project.  Our team members also introduced our project in the real life: they visited some companies which are related to biology and explained our project to them. We got the funding from Nanjing Zhengbeicehui Equipment Inc., Hunan Tianxingjian Project Management Inc., Shanghai Songyuan Cork Foam Inc., Beijing Shiyuan Business Inc., Kanglihua Company and Beijing Huaxiafengxing Advertisement Inc, etc. Through this practice, we not only challenged ourselves in negotiating with adults, especially the managers of some enterprises, but also expanded our influence in the society such as the marketplace. We played a role in promoting the influence of the synthetic biology and iGEM to the society.
Impact
Environmental impact
Our product can help the environment in three ways. First of all, with our modified yeast, food waste decomposition rate will be greatly increased, and then we no longer need to worry about the soil pollution which is brought by traditional kitchen waste digestion-landfill. As the amount of kitchen waste that is digested by landfill decline, salt and other toxicant will gradually stop entering into the soil. Secondly, after decomposition by our genetically modified yeast, some of the useless kitchen waste might be efficiently changed into biological fertilizers. This type of biological fertilizer not only enhances crop production, but also can help the soil maintain a high fertility.  Last but not least, burning of kitchen waste can be replaced by our decomposition method, which will effectively relieve the current unpleasant situation of air pollution.
Economic impact
Our project is aimed to increase the tolerance of yeast in hypertonic environments during food waste decomposition. With our modified yeast, survivability of yeast and their decomposing efficiency can be greatly increased. Currently, most of the companies have to add new yeast periodically to keep the decomposition rate. With the help of our yeast, the companies can save more costs by reducing the needs of large amount of yeast and"

We have established the collaborative relationship with Jilin_China, LanZhou and ZJU_China during the competition. We have made effective communication in terms of experimental condition control and results                                         testing, and we helped each other so that our projects progress more smoothly. We                                         are very grateful to these teams mentioned above for help.
HELPING SECTION
With Jilin_China
We had a lot of discussion with Jilin University about interlab such as experimental                                         conditions control and operation practices. During our human practice, we want to                                         see how the public react to their own health status, to our project, so we did a random survey online and we also went out onto the street to send out some of the                                         questionnaires and we want to thank Jilin University for helping us to send our questionnaires                                         in their city. This makes our findings more convincing.
Jilin_China wanted to get more opinions of their project, so we helped them interview associated professor Peiyong Liu, vice Dean of college of life and health sciences Northeastern University. We told her what Geneguard is, and discussed with her. Peiyong Liu thought the usage of Geneguard system was an innovative idea and it was feasible to control the engineered bacteria in the environment. She thought Jilin_China 's project is meaningful, and it is a nice attempt to solve this problem by using synthetic biology methods.
Here is the link to their Wiki.
EXPERIMENT SECTION
With LanZhou
The ecdysone receptor (ECR) plays an important role in the molting, metabolism, development                                         and reproduction of insects. They tried to build an RNAi system to silence the ECR                                         gene.ECR silencing can effectively reduce the expression of these key genes, thereby                                         reducing the survival rate of insects and reproduction rate.
In their project, they need various functional vectors for dsRNA production, but                                         the gene sequence complementarity will cause secondary structure, which is impossible                                         to synthsize gene for one time. The task of constructing vectors is heavy. We helped                                         them to construct hpRNA producing vector ecrL, which sped up their vectors construction                                         progress.

As nobody at the TU Munich works with the moss Physcomitrella patens, we looked for an expert and found Prof. Reski who occupies a professorship at Freiburg University. We were very happy to gain him as an advisor during our project. For the use of Physcomitrella patens in iGEM we created a strong constitutive promoter ( BBa_K1159306 ), a plant terminator ( BBa_K1159307 ) and an antibiotic selection marker ( BBa_K1159308 ), which were all used to transform and select 21 different transgenic moss lines.
Localization of effector proteins
Figure 1: Cytosolic protein expression and our modularized receptor for Physcomitrella work as expected.
The actual remediation of pollutants is accomplished by effector proteins which function with significantly different mechanisms. Thus it was important to enable the localization of effector proteins at different cellular sites. Cytosolic effector proteins are easily expressed, whereas for secretion a signal peptide BioBrick is cloned ahead of the effector protein. Several receptor signal peptides from Physcomitrella patens and other organisms were analyzed by using bioinformatics tools . The signal peptide of the Somatic Embryogenesis Receptor-like Kinase (SERK) from Physcomitrella patens and the IgK signal peptide from Mus musculus, which is described in literature to function in Physcomitrella, were chosen. The secretion of a newly introduced luciferase with both of these signal peptides was investigated for 8 clones each. No detectable secretion for the IgKappa, but a high secretion rate for the SERK signal peptide was shown. Successful secretion could be achieved using the SERK signal peptide . Because the secreted effector proteins are not attached to the moss cell, they diffuse into the water, which could be suboptimal, for example if you want to remove pollutants by simply binding them. Therefore we designed a modular receptor for Physcomitrella, which can carry effector proteins at the outer side of the cell membrane. For this purpose bioinformatics methods were used again and the SERK transmembrane domain was chosen to be the best one. A receptor composed of (1) the SERK signal peptide, (2) an extracellularly located effector protein, (3) a linker"

Our Project
The Problem:
The world these days has turned into a junkyard. Today greenhouse gases such as NOx and SOx pose a grave challenge to our environment and sustainability – a problem that needs urgent solutions.
Being greenhouse gases, both NOx and SOx play a critical role in Global Warming. Considering the present rate of rise in temperatures, we are certainly on path of self-destruction.
These oxides increase the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere, which is responsible for the photochemical production of ozone in the lower layers of the atmosphere causing detrimental effects on humans and environment.
SOx or Sulfur Oxides are responsible for phenomenon of acid rains and acidified soils. It results in huge economic losses every year due to destruction of farm crops, buildings and environment. Additionally, SOx aggravates respiratory diseases such as asthma and pneumonia, thus affecting human health.
Approach:
Our team, iGEM IIT Delhi, took up the challenge to combat catastrophic effects of pollution and assumed the role of a ‘Pollution Crusader’. Using our previous years’ work our aim was to replace Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and build a prototype that can clean the exhaust of all pollutants including NOx, SOx, CO, CO2, and soot.
Our approach was to first synthetically construct a strain of E.coli bacteria which can"

        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate rock and calcium oxalate film.
        So, this research project has chosen E. coli that has been transcribed with lipase to clean some stone relics that are covered with oil; then, we use E. coli, with transcription, that can secrete oxalate acid upon the stone relics. Therefore, there forms calcium oxalate to be protection film in order to preserve lithic relics.
        If we use chemical methods to generate calcium oxalate, we have to immerse the lithic relics in the chemical liquid; however, it is not suitable for the preservation of large-scale outdoor lithic relics. In fact, the natural existing calcium oxalate comes from the reaction of oxalate acid generated by microorganism and calcium compound on the surface of stone. This research project will utilise genetic engineering methods to ""graft"" the gene that generates calcium oxalate into Escherichia coli (E. coil).
    Then oxalate acid reacts with calcium lithic relics to generate calcium oxalate, which stimulates its natural formation process. Finally, there forms a fine layer to protect the lithic relics.

The 2010 and 2011 Panama iGEM teams have worked on creating BioBricks for the P. aeruginosa enzymes needed for rhamnolipid production23. We will examine the commercial viability of biologically producing rhamnolipid for EOR by first optimizing the expression of RhlA and RhlB in E. coli and quantifying the extent of rhamnolipid production through established assays16. The ability of rhamnolipid to act as a biosurfactant in the presence and absence of acetic acid will be tested to assess the effectiveness of rhamnolipid for EOR.

We will use a constitutively expressing promoter (J023100) linked to a high expressing (34%) ribosomal binding sites (B0034) to control expression of the proteins YF1 and FixJ. When exposed to light at 470 nm, YF1 and FixJ will dimerize around the promoter region pFixK, and prevent the transcription of ClpXP, ClpP and RecA24. In the absence of light at 470 nm, the expression of the protease ClpP, the protease specific enhancing factor ClpXP, and the recombinase RecA will no longer be repressed. These proteins act to degrade essential cellular proteins and DNA, resulting in cell death. ClpXP is able to degrade proteins through identification of a protein tag conserved across species so will be a useful module in both of our chasses25. Additionally, S. elongatus can use 470 nm light for growth, making this an ideal expression system for CAB extraction. The expression system will be tested by monitoring cell viability in"

Breakdown of Cellulose
Project Overview
Several experiments were conducted to showcase our bacterium’s ability to grow on cellulose as the only carbon source, including Congo red screening assays and growth experiments. In addition, we performed Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE to visualise the expression of the cellulose degrading enzymes cep94A, cex and cenA.
The results showed that cep94A , which expresses cellobiose phosphorylase, was functioning as expected. However, we were unable to detect any traces of the desired endoglucanase (cenA) and exoglucanase (cex) secreted by the type I secretion system.
Detection of Cellulase Secreted by Type I Secretion System was Inconclusive
To assess our cellulose degrading strains of E. coli, we performed a screening with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) Congo red agar plates. Congo red binds to cellulose molecules, thus making it possible to visualise the breakdown of the Congo red bound cellulose. Consequently, if the cellulose molecules are degraded the red color will fade. As seen in Figure 20 the experiment did not show any visible difference between the bacteria containing cellulase secreting BioBricks and the controls, suggesting that the type I secretion system is not working as intended.

Worldshaper-XSHS had problem in the E.coli transformation and then they came to us for help. After a brief introduction of their project, we analyzed and pointed out that it was the invalid homemade E.coli receptive state was to be blame. Hence, they did experiments in our lab by utilizing our commercial E.coli strain BL21 with a good receptive state. This attempt provided enough opportunities for them to discuss the difference between the experiments, which exerted great advantage for them to solve such problems in the nest phase. We hope they can achieve their project and take a good grade home!

Although Agrobacterium is capable of integrating DNA into a wide range of eukaryotic species, the competence for transformation into the Arabidopsis thaliana genome has been demonstrated and used routinely for research                             since the late 70s
. Transformation of the plant's female gametes is accomplished simply by dipping the plant into a solution of Agrobacterium cells containing an appropriate plasmid (pCAMBIA) with the sequences to be integrated
. Seeds from the treated plants are sown and allowed to germinate in selective medium that screens for successful transformants - mature transgenic plants can be attained within a mere 3 months
. As the prototypical plant model organism, Arabidopsis has a fast life cycle, is prolific, easy to grow, and has a relatively small well annotated genome sequence
. In addition, its interaction with the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) -- famous for the widespread use of its 35s promoter for transgenic expression in plants -- has been well characterized in the literature
.
Results
There are three different ways we sought to express Cas9 from Arabidopsis plant cells: floral dip, agroinfiltration, and protoplast transformation. For both floral dip and agroinfiltration, the Cas9 and its corresponding anti-CaMV sgRNAs             had to be cloned into pCAMBIA since each of those methods relied on the action of Agrobacterium.
Since we were originally attempting an ambitious assembly to put this together (six fragments, two of which were >5kb), none of these original attempts worked. Thankfully, the homologous ends that each fragment was designed to have lent themselves to             other forms of cloning which were not necessarily Gibson-based. PCR overlap extension, a technique suggested by the University of Ottawa iGEM team, provided us with a possible route to success. By joining together some of the smaller sgRNA             fragments into clusters, we sought to increase the probably of Gibson Assembly working by reducing the number of fragments. Two fragments of the less ambitious five-fragment Gibson Assembly plan were successfully joined by PCR overlap extension             before another Gibson reaction was attempted. The now four-fragment reaction produced colonies that produced promising PCR diagnostic results (pictured gel electrophoresis image), but inconclusive sequencing results. Since plants take time             to grow, after the integration of our construct into the Arabidopsis genome by Agrobacterium-mediated floral dip we'll need to wait approximately 1-2 months for mature CRISPR-Arabidopsis plants to be in a testable            "

Part:BBa_K346004: Experience
Just as what we have done to construct the mercury Metal Binding Peptide, the entire coding region of the MBP for standard part was amplified by PCR from full length MerR with two pairs of primers. Two of these primers encoded a three-residue bridge, SSG, which does not occur in MerR and was added to afford some flexibility in the loop connecting the two dimerization helix. The two PCR products were digested with EcoR I / BamH I, or BamH I / Pst I and cloned into EcoR I / Pst I -digested pSB1K3 in one step (fig), which was verified by DNA sequencing.Then the RBS and terminator is added.
Based on the same strategy, MBP-His6 was constructed by using two different pairs of primers, which is used for MBP expression test by western blot. The two PCR products were digested with Nde I / BamH I, or BamH I / Xho"

Toronto,2015,Team:Toronto#TechnoMoral-Scenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," to resist the tides that surround us, which has swept many of our people in, we must remember our ways - remember how to live as our people lived. The fish and the animals returned, we can now fish, hunt, and trap on our land again. The things we do shape who we know ourselves to be. Many from our community returned to our old ways, and are prosperous. Do you still remember all that I taught you when you were young?
S: I remember well and one day I will teach my son all that I remember. Sometimes it is best to move with the tide and not swim against it. Is it our people’s ways that you fear to lose?
F: Son, knowledge is lost without practice. By the time your son grows old, your memory will fade. Perhaps your knowledge of who you are will be lost in time. How can you teach what you not know? Stay with me son, so you and your child can live as our traditions teach.
S: The time has changed more than this land - our people have changed as well. The world is very different, compared to the world of our ancestors. It is true, the settlers seem to be learning to use our land without destroying it and the wildlife returned. Nothing ever stands still, as much as you would like it to. We are passengers on the current of time and need not look behind us into the past to know where we are. But we must not return to our old ways just because we can. The new job opportunities at CanOil’s bio-remediation facility can do great things for our community!
F: Son, do you not know of the past and the many promises that they have made?  Promises that turned to be false. When they came, they talked about peace and prosperity and had cursed us with dead lands. As my grandfather once said “the settlers walk with flowers in hand, and a knife behind their backs”.Yes, their material wealth cannot be matched by ours. But they have no spiritual wealth. We take care of our own, while they praise individual autonomy in success and failure. We live by the grace of the land, while they seek to tame it. We trust each other, while they are suspicious of all. Do not fool yourself into believing that they will ever accept you, or your son, to be truly one of them - the past has taught us that they do not see beyond the color of our skin. Is that the person you imagine your son to become?

pCMMCD 105
Plasmid consisting of ComR (BBa_K2341000), the p1655 promoter (containing the ComR box, BBa_K2341001), GusA and an erythromycin resistance.
GusA encodes the beta-glucuronidase gene from E. coli. This is a popular reporter gene that uses glucuronides as substrates, the most common of which are X-gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl glucuronide) and para-nitrophenyl glucuronide.
Here, it is under the control of the ComRS pathway and uses the ComS peptide from S. thermophilius (LPYFAGGL).

Unfortunately at 50% and 75% substitution, the reaction did not work at all, this is most likely due to a lack of ATP - the isothermal PCR buffer contains ATP necessary for recombinase activity, at higher substitutions of blood PCR mix the buffer was not used or was not enough in regards to the amount of ATP present.
We are also working on determining the sensitivity of our amplification. Results will be judged by visualization on agarose gel, if no other means of detection of DNA amplicons are available.
Week 17: Sept 15 - 19
This week we began the process of preparing our synthesized genes for submission to the iGEM registry. We started with the 15 previously successful transformed parts and made overnights of two colonies from each construct. We did this twice for the parts that failed on the first try, with the second time using different colonies than the first. I mini-prepped all successful overnight cultures. There were 3 parts that failed growing in overnight cultures twice so we will come back to those later and try again. With the remaining 12 successful constructs (refer to column 3 or 4 of Table 1), we did a restriction digest. On Monday we will run these samples on a 1% gel and then cut out the correct band, either the part we want (insert) or the vector. This week we also tested the competent E.coli that we made last week and by sent lacZ for sequencing.
Week 18: Sept 22 - 26
This week we continued using the parts we digested last week. We started by doing a gel extraction of the digested samples. We then did a ligation of each sample insert with each of two vectors. We did colony PCR to verify that each colony contained the ligated product that was previously made. The first time we did this only 6 out of 66 colonies that we chose contained the ligated product. We tried a second attempt and another 6 colonies appeared to be successful. We sent 6/12 samples for sequencing so far. Next week we'll be sending the remaining 6 samples for sequencing. So far there are 6 parts total that have been mini-prepped to the step 9. Once the sequencing results are back next week we will have confirmation that these BioBricks are correct and ready to be submitted to the iGEM registry. Next week in addition to sending the remaining 6 samples for sequencing, we will be trying the process all over again to get as many more synthesized genes"

We can now select nodes to display images just like we could in Cytoscape.js (more about this at meeting).
This will allow us to click on devices to view them in greater detail. Next week I might try to display images in the table instead, so that if you select multiple nodes you can see multiple images. I’ll also try running the CyNetShare graph on JSON files provided by Fernando to see if the format is correct.
Today’s tasks include pushing web dev files to the master branch so that the home page of our website runs normally again (if you try to run it with the files currently in master branch, the CSS appears to be broken as we’re missing a few files).

We provided plasmids synthesized by ourselves, E coli and IPTG for NYU-Shanghai to support their experiment. The two kinds of functional plasmids were synthesized by us. One was the plasmid of FwYellow chromoprotein, noted for BBa _K1033910. Another was that of Aeblue chromoprotein, noted for BBa_K864401. We also supplied 5000uL of BL21 competent cell for them to create new type of E. coli. For inducing the expression of chromoproteins, we gave them IPTG as inducer. All these biology materials were packaged hermetically and Victor Zhou sent them to teammates in NYU-Shanghai in person in order to prevent any separation during transport. They want to use arabinose to stimulate transcription but with no color, we suggested that use different concentration of arabinose might find the best concentration to show the color. Because they use arabinose to stimulate transcription, we suggested that IPTG should be the better choice. At that time, we use IPTG inducible plasmid PET21a respectively with blue chromoprotein and yellow chromoprotein in BL21 (DE3), both of them showing the color. Therefore, three week ago, they used our donation and made more samples.  They thanked us a lot"

Abstract
iGEM is not only a scientific competition which provides a stage for us undergraduates to display our work done at the laboratory but also a driving force to popularize synthetic biology to the public. Furthermore, considering the theme of Asia division this year is system biology & society, we organized a series of activities related to society and the public.
From July 16th to 17th, We held a lecture entitled ""Contemporary introduction to synthetic biology"" with corresponding campus fair and exhibition in order to help high school students make a better understanding of synthetic biology, genetic engineering and biosafety. Thanks to the summer camp hosted by Xiamen University, thousands of high school students from Fujian Province took part in our activities related to our theme. On the one hand, we let the high school students have a better understanding of our project and iGEM via the lecture. On the other hand, we expected our elucidation to express how much genetic engineering contributes to our daily life in food, energy, material and so on. These students are just like seeds we sow to help synthetic biology and genetic engineering well understood by the public, which is really important and meaningful to the popularization of synthetic biology and iGEM.
In addition, before the lecture we made a survey about popularization of synthetic biology & iGEM in high school students from all over Fujian Province. It is not only to get some important and cogent data about popularization of synthetic biology & iGEM but also to get some feedback about the effect of our lecture via comparing their attitude and reaction to our questions before and after the lecture. What’s more, we designed a special series of cards with the theme of synthetic biology for the campus fair.
We plotted and organized the whole HP together with XMU_software, another iGEM team from our university. And we assisted XMU_software to finish the theme fresco on Furong Tunnel. We thought some good ideas when brainstorming human practice together and everyone tried his best to achieve our goal.
In a word, we did a series of various but clear-thematic activities this year which not only improved our project greatly but also an alternative popularization of synthetic biology.

Discussion
The Salkowski assay is a suitable and relatively inexpensive tool to determine the concentration of IAA when it is pure in solution. Our Salkowski assay standard curve for IAA concentration generated an R2 value of 0.994. Unfortunately our results using IaaM and IaaH expressing bacterial cell pellets and supernatant were inconclusive due to contamination of the control sample (Figures 4 and 5). Further Salkowski assays to determine how readily purified enzyme IaaH converted IAM to IAA showed us that the Salkowski reagent is not able to differentiate between the two molecules (Figure 6). From this, we learnt that a more precise assay was required and so we opted to perform HPLC.
HPLC analysis produced far more accurate standard curves for IAA (R2 = 0.999), and very accurate curves for IAM (R2 = 1.000) and tryptophan (R2 = 1.000). HPLC allowed analysis of all three intermediates with one analysis, and has the potential to measure a changing concentration of these intermediates. Given the high quality and accuracy of standard results produced in the initial HPLC standards, more accurate analysis would provide little benefit as an assay for IAA.
Future direction
Further analysis of the changing concentration of IAA in IaaM/IaaH expressing cells incubated with tryptophan by HPLC could verify the potential of the enzymes to produce IAA from tryptophan. HPLC could then be used again, on scaffolded IaaM/IaaH incubated in the same conditions to determine any effect scaffolding these enzymes has on changing the rate of overall reaction in the IAA synthesis pathway."

Here you can find how we constructed our BioBricks and other plasmids which were used during our project, next you can find protocols which we followed during our experiments and finally you can see our primer list with every primer used.
Plasmid construction
The following plasmids were constructed mainly during summer/autumn 2016.
Key sequence in pDR111
The key sequence was ordered as a gBlock from IDT to construct the key B.   subtilis strain. In a first approach this was done with the pDR111 B.   subtilis integration plasmid, which can also be amplified by E. coli.   Therefore the first step was to clone the key sequence into the pDR111 in E. coli. pDR111 is an integration plasmid which can be integrated into the B. subtilis genome.   It replaces amyE gene by double cross-over, which is necessary for production of alpha-amylase   (see Subtiwiki.uni-goettingen.de )       with desired insert which is located between amyE front flanking region and amyE back flanking region. See the plasmid map below. We used this plasmid for integration of our key sequence into the B. subtilis 168 sub+. The other approach made use of the BioBrick integration plasmid BBa_K823023 (Key sequence in BBa_K823023) .
PCR
Experiment:
31/08/16: Amplification of the key sequence from the gBlock from IDT (see gBlocks protocol) with the primers F key only amplify and R key only amplify (see primer list) was done. The correct size of the     key PCR product of 144 bp was checked with DNA electrophoresis.
PCR mixture:
50 μl PCR assay was performed according to the following protocol .
DNA Electrophoresis:
For detailed information on how to prepare and run agarose gels see    following protocol .

The fish feeding on the zooplankton will then receive a good source of vitamin for its growth. To do this, we can engineer Bacillus bacteria to act as a vector which can deliver vitamin to the cytoplasms of zooplankton which is a phagocytic eukaryote. Essentially, this project allows us to not only clear up the pollutant PAH, but it also provides a source of nutrients for the fish. In addition, the waste product of the fish can also be used by the Bacillus to provide nutrients for the fish.
Filling in the green gap
-plants absorb light wavelength from 400-500nm and then 600-700nm however between 500 - 600nm, plants do not have any light accepting compounds in that light range
-there are two possible ways of solving the problem:
1.introduce lightharvesting pigments from red algae and couple them to plant photosystems
2.use any fluorophore which accepts light in the green gap and emits the light in wavelength higher than 600nm, localise it on the membrane on chloroplast and therefore transfer wavelength between 500-600nm to a wavelength higher than 600nm so plant phytochromes can accept it
-it appears that red algae combine the two methods in phycobilisomes, where they use pigments which emit wavelengths a bit higher than the emmited wavelength until chlorophyll is capable of accepting light
-possbility of introducing phycobilisomes or only specific phycobiliproteins, which accept (500-600nm) and re-emit it in 600-700nm
-problem: does not seem to be a single protein for accepting and re-emitting of the corresponding wavelengths
-problem: do not know the number of phycobiliproteins neccessary to significantly contribute towards excitation of plant phytochromes
-problem: plant might be losing energy by synthesising extra pigment proteins (if it needs a lot of them) even though these proteins would contribute to produce more energy in the plant
Auxin-Secreting Bacteria
The project intends to enhance the ability of plants to grow roots towards specific locations. For example, this could be used to allow plants to quickly locate the nutrients they need with minimal energy expenditure.  Another example is to increase the speed at which roots grow, in order to hold down soil that is in danger of being eroded.
This would be done using a two bacteria system, so that one strain of"

Isoguanine & 5-methyl isocytosine in Nanopore Sequencing
Nanopore Sequencing
Oxford Nanopore Technology's (ONT) sequencing technology offers a great potential as a tool for the detection of unnatural bases in DNA. In ONT sequencing, protein nanopores are distributed inside a synthetic membrane of high electrical resistance. When applying an electrical field across this membrane, an ionic current passes through each nanopore which is being measured and recorded. If a biomolecule, such as proteins, RNA or DNA are located inside the Nanopore, the ionic current is influenced. These characteristic changes can be measured and used to identify which molecule is passing through the nanopore. (Feng et al., 2015) This way, an algorithm called the ""basecaller"" is able to predict the nucleotide sequence of a single stranded DNA or RNA molecule based on the raw data that is recorded when it is pulled through the nanopore. Since the commercial availability of the portable sequencer MinION in 2015 (Check Hayden, 2015), strong improvements have been made in terms of increasing the bascalling accuracy. Even though the error rate is still high compared to other sequencing techniques, the advantage of having long reads of several kilobases is often preferential regarding sequencing of DNA containing repetitive sequences or mobile genetic elements like transposable elements (Debladis et al., 2017) More recently, efforts have been made towards the analysis of epigenetic information based on the identification of modified bases in nucleic acids with nanopore sequencing. For example, methylated cytosine was shown to be distinguishable from unmodified cytosine by training a hidden Markov model (Simpson et al., 2017).
Compared to other sequencing technologies, nanopore sequencing offers several advantages regarding the detection of unnatural bases. Most importantly, no PCR amplification of the DNA sample is needed in the process of library preparation. This way, no information gets lost prior to sequencing due to potentially lower PCR amplification fidelity of the unnatural base pair. Another big advantage is that no additional chemistry is needed in the process of sequencing. Other sequencing technologies such as 454, Sanger, Illumina and PacBio are based on polymerases that synthesize a DNA strand complement to a template being sequenced. When a specially labeled nucleotide is incorporated, a detectable signal is emitted. This is problematic regarding sequencing of DNA containing unnatural bases, as additional labeled nucleotides"

Treponema primitia, a spirochete bacteria.
Treponema primitia, a spirochete, is an ectosymbiont of Trichonympha; “symbiont” because both organisms benefit the other with their mutual existence, in a way that if one of them are missing, the other will die, and “ecto”, because one of them lives in the surface of the other, in this case, the spirochete. This bacteria is in charge of giving the protozoa the characteristic appearance that grants the motility of Trichonympha. Without them, the protozoa loses its shape and cannot survive (5) .
Synthetic Biology: how to get rid of the bacteria
How to kill the bacteria
When the target is defined, the next problem is: how to kill the spirochetes? The idea of phages appears easily. They are great at killing specific bacteria, and with a cocktail of diverse phages they can be very effective fighting against bacteria. The problem that this option has is how the phages would reach the gut of the termite. They would probably need a vector, and this complicates and slows the procedure. Also, phages can be very delicate, the reason why they failed as a medicine when D’Herelle discovered them in the 1900’s and tried to distribute them around the world, so they are not a good option to deal with T. primitia (6) .
Colicins
Partregistry.org offers a solution for this problem:  In 2008, Team Heidelberg (7) created two biobricks related with the production of Colicins. These are toxins produced by Escherichia coli that act against related strains or species.
The biobricks contains: one of the two kinds of toxic colicins, the pore-forming or the nuclease, and two other types needed for the effectiveness of the colicins, the immunity protein, that protects the host from the nuclease effect of the colicins by a protein-protein interaction; and the lysis protein, that lysis the host in order to release the colicins.
In its natural state, the colicins genes are contained inside the plasmids pCOL and controlled by the promoter PSOS that responds to a variety of agents such as UV-light, physical agents and stress.

High School talks
We have talked several times before an audience composed of high school students.
BioOL
Our first attempt was the Danish participants for the International Biology Olympiad . They were the perfect audience, asking a lot of critical questions, which made us think twice about how we made our presentation. We altered to make it less focused on what iGEM is and more foused on the community aspect and the problem of antibiotic resistance.
KOLD College and Odense Tekniske Gymnasium
We also had the pleasure of presenting our presentation and a talk about bioethics for two technical high schools in Odense: Odense Technical High School (OTG) and KOLD College . At KOLD College we had an entire theme day where we helped the students in the laboratory and entertained them in between with details of our project. This included the preliminary presentation, which we will bring to Boston and theory about the experiments they had to do in the laboratory. We also had our movie, which explains our project with us as well as a collective brainstorm for the prospects of our project.
Us at KOLD college, teaching their students.
The two classes at OTG.
Academy for Talented Youth
At the end of the summer we had the opportunity to be a part of another event at the university, as SDU was visited by the Academy for Talented Youth . We presented our presentation and had an extra focus on bioethics - and we had a really good discussion with them. We then supervised them in the laboratory.
Other talks
Symposion
As a good way of getting more feedback we held a presentation at Symposion - a philosophical association at SDU . The audience were composed of professors in philosophy, students from philosophy and other students who found it interesting. There were an almost hour long discussion with lots of good constructive critique and advices for our human practices. Their ideas and arguments had a big influence on our writings on bioethics and philosophy of science. They gave us ideas to other forms of arguments in bioethics, e.g. the religious arguments. They also gave us the idea of ""Track-record"" for a way of handeling the Precautionary Principle.

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2012,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Project#project2.2_-_-_TEXT.html,"yl-ACP and the release of free fatty acids into cytoplasm. We suppose TesA anchored on membrane could effectively increase the concentration of fatty acids near membrane, which in turn, facilitates the transmembrane transportation of fatty acids. Higher level of fatty acids in the culture media makes it easier to obtain and purify product and more suitable for industrialized production. On the other hand, TesA removes fatty acyl-ACP from the reaction and thus, according to Le Châtlier principle, shifts the chemical equilibrium to accelerate and to accumulate more fatty acids.
To identify and to evaluate the priority of products to exportation, controlled experiments were designed and conducted. Wild type E.coli and E.coli overexpressing diffusing cytoplasmic TesA were used as control groups. TesA fused with Lgt was expressed in experimental group.
Fig.4 shows the construction details of membrane anchored TestA
The Refinement of Interaction
Fig.5 shows how membrane could serve to refine and stabilize the interaction upon which enzymes aggregate and cooperate.
Enzymes fused with membrane anchors will be directed to the membrane as expected right after their translation. Thus, the distribution of enzymes is restricted to the 2D membrane rather than diffusing randomly throughout the cytoplasm. Due to spatial restriction, each membrane anchor is more easily to interact with each other. Moreover, the interaction could be stabilized by phospholipid around transmembrane domain. We believe a tandem of enzymes involved in sequential reactions could be organized on the membrane swiftly and orderly in Membrane Accelerator.
To testify and to assess the refinement of interaction, controlled experiments were designed and conducted. Four enzymes are selected based on previous study. We express thioesterase(TesA) and full complement of reductive enzymes(FabG, FabZ and FabI) because previous studies showed moderate overexpression of TesA in E.coli gave rise to elevated fatty acid productivity and overexpression of reductive enzymes could lead to 50% increase in fatty acid turnover. Wild type E.coli and E.coli overexpressing diffusing TesA, FabG, FabZ and FabI were used as control groups. In experimental group, TesA, FabG, FabZ and FabI were linked to orderly organized Membrane Anchors, aligning with corresponding reactions occurring in sequence. All four fusion Membrane Anchors were co-expressed in one cell.

We decided to chose 5 dilutions, from 10^(-2) to 10^(-6). Instead of only plating at the end of the 3 liquid cultivation, we decided to plate 100 μL of medium just after inoculation and at the end of each cultivation. The goal of this experiment is to know the dilution needed and to test the impact of the several liquid medium cultivation steps.
We decided to chose 4 different medium (for broth and plate).
-M9 : a medium with salts but no carbon source, this is our negative control medium, if something grows on that medium, it means that there is a carbon contamination.
-M9 glucose (M9 G) : M9 salts plus 1g/L glucose, this medium is our positive control, if nothing grows on it, it means that there were no bacteria in the medium.
-M9 quercetin (M9 Q): M9 salts plus 1g/L quercetin (similar condition than in Church's article), this is the medium where we want to isolate bacterias.
-M9 glucose quercetin (M9 GQ) : this medium is necessary to test if quercetin is toxic for microorganisms. Indeed if we have less growth than in M9 glucose it could mean that quercetin is toxic.
As it is done in church's protocol the incubation time between each cultivation step is 7 days.
Week 25th - 31th July
Quercetin medium preparation
As soon as the quercetin was purchased from Sigma®, we decided to start the assay. However it was found that unlike anthocyanin, quercetin was mostly insoluble in water. This is a major issue for medium preparation as the organisms could not be able to degrade an insoluble molecule in a liquid broth.
But it as also a problem for quercitin quantification, as we thought at the beggining that we could measure the degradation of quercetin with the absorbance, which is not possible if quercitin isn't soluble.
We tried to solubilize quercetin at different concentration in water and ethanol : 1g/L, 0.1g/L, 0.01g/L and 0.001g/L . We did not succeed in dissolving totally the quercetin, so an absorbance assay was impossible.
However, even at 1g/L the liquid"

TALE
The first system studied utilizes the TALE repressor and specifically the                     TALEsp1 or TALEsp2 sequence.
The kinetic reactions that make up the system are described by mass action                     kinetics for the transcription, translation and degradation of molecules,                     and by Hill kinetics described as mass action kinetics in two possible                     states for binding and dissociating the TALE repressor at the binding site                     of promoter P.
The TALE gene is replicated at a constant rate from each plasmid c and then                     translated into the TALE protein. This protein then binds to the promoter                     of sfGFP (G), whose gene is on the same plasmid as TALE. It is associated                     with dissociation constant kD = koff / kon and cooperativity n and produces                     the final output of the gene of interest, which in our case is sfGFP.                     This system has been studied and proved experimentally [1]. Our work on                     this model aims to better study its parameters and their characterization,                     as well as to reply to wet lab questions about the system and its possible                     extensions.
We started by describing the kinetic reactions that the model works with:
As the model follows the IFFL's network motif, what we expect is the                     stabilization of sfGFP at a specific level, regardless of changes in the                     number of plasmids (copy number, c). The analytical solution of the                     differential equations resulting from the above kinetic reactions at steady                     state, associates the concentration of sfGFP protein with the copy number                     through the following ratio:
where n is the cooperativity between the TALE repressor and the operator                     site of DNA. So, easily, we can conclude that in order to isolate the                     output from the plurality of plasmids, n should be equal to 1.                     After studying and approximating the system parameters, which are described                     in detail in the section of parameter estimations, we ended up with the                     final featured model, which we used to get results and insights for the                     system.
Specifically, we run the simulation of differential equations for a copy                     number of 5 to 100. For every copy number, the system was simulated for                     1000 min and we noticed, that the steady state was reached after                     approximately 400 min.

From figure 2, we can conclude that the system responds to our                     expectations"

Achievements:
We made advances on our cloning of the constructs for both projects. We completed a LIMS system on a Google spreadsheet that would be used to manage our increasingly overwhelming primers box as well as fixing our minipreps and glycerol stock LIMS and retroactively adding samples. We performed a new induction experiment, inducing our cultures with aTc.
WEEK 9
Aug 1 2013 - Aug 7 2013
Goals:
We wanted to make advances toward generating our device for the quorum sensing project. We wanted to better budget our remaining resources and stock up on supplies that we would need throughout the rest of the summer. We also wanted to use our zinc finger clone in an induction experiment, similar to the ones we had performed earlier for the quorum sensing project. Additionally, we aimed to generate a growth curve and see how the zinc finger cells would respond to induction.
Achievements:
We met with various professors at the University and made contacts who had knowledge about areas in both projects. We ordered more reagents and created the abstract for our project. We designed primers to attempt to Gibson assemble the Cas construct that had been giving us trouble during USER cloning. We hoped that the new cloning strategy would yield better results. We aliquoted our antibiotics, making boxes full of Kan, Chlor, and Amp to last us the entire summer and well into the year.
WEEK 10
Aug 8 2013 - Aug 14 2013
Goals:
We wanted to use our restriction digest-based test to analyze how our constructs were working with regards to methylation. We needed to decide on which project we were going to pursue as soon as possible, and we decided this week would be the deadline. We wanted to perform our first SDS Page, which had been in the brainstorming stage for a while. Additionally, we wanted to consult experts about designing better primers and see how we could improve our protocols.
Achievements:
We finally decided to fully pursue the project of constructing targeted methyltransferase fusions. While it was a hard decision, it was necessary to commit our efforts to one project. We also finished our TALE clone and began the induction experiment for testing the methyltransferase fusion. We consulted with designers from the School of Design about making our website and better presentations. We began transforming promoters for an additional screen for methyltransferases that we had envisioned, with the belief that methyltransferases could silence promoters"

Colicins have different modes of action, including enzymatic activity such as DNase (DNA cleaving) activity, and pore-forming activity. Colicins have three domains, the N-terminal domain functions in translocation through the membrane, the central domain is involved in binding to the OM receptor, and the C-terminal domain contains active (lethal) protein region [1]. We have taken advantage of the modularity of the colicin domains, generating a synthetic import domain that will allow for new and exciting forms of communication in E.coli.
Kleanthous C Nature Reviews Microbiology 2010 8, 843-848
For our project we have selected Colicin E2, which has enzymatic DNase activity. Colicin E2 is ideal because it not only kills sensitive cells on a population level, but also destroys genomic material, preventing the spread of genetically modified parts via horizontal gene transfer.
In natural systems colicin operons are regulated under the SOS promoter (Stress response). Group A colicins contain type I plasmids. These plasmids are generally 6-10 kb, found in  about 20 copies per cell, and can be amplified and mobilized in the presence of a conjugative plasmid. The first gene of the colicin operon is the activity protein, named  Colicin X activity (i.e. cea for Colicin E2) . This is followed by the immunity protein, named Colicin X immunity (cei),  which, like the activity protein, is regulated by the LexA promoter, but also  has its own constitutive promoter. This separate promoter is located with in the coding sequence of the cea and allows for constant overproduction of the cei, thereby protecting the producing cell. The last gene codes for the lysis protein, named colicin X lysis protein (cel), which causes the release of colicin into medium and is responsible for the cell death of the producer. The SOS promoter can be induced by UV light, chemicals, and stress conditions[1].
We would like to clone the cea and cei of Colicin E2 onto two separate plasmids, creating toxin and antitoxin plasmids.

Where km1 and km2 are integration parameters. As transcription and translation processes could enter steady state in a short period of time, here we directly considered steady state of mRNA, mRNA-rib and RFP, where
Finally, we calculated fluorescence:
The equation demonstrated the connection between fluorescence and lactic acid, thus, the concentration of lactic acid could be measured by fluorescence through the system. We set km1=10 and use promoter J23100, then results showed how these different substances changed with the lactic acid concentration. (Fig. 9)
Fig.9 Concentration of P170, mRNA, mRNA-rib and fluorescence change with the lactic acid.
Fine tuning:
As RcfB plays a key role in induction of P170 promoter, we firstly conducted constitutive promoter fine-tuning. Different constitutive promoters were constructed with downstream RcfB. We built up models to compare the function of these promoters (Fig.10). Results showed that J23100 had the highest effectiveness.

Basic circuits contain two subsystems: resistance subsystem and regulation subsystem. Models of these two subsystems were constructed separately.
Main processes include induction of the promoters, transcription and translation of function genes, catalysis of enzymes and acid or alkali production led by enzymes. ODE is used for modeling to describe concentration as function of time. Factors considered are production and degradation, combination and disaggregation and reversible reaction.
Resistance subsystem consists of constitutive promoter J23119, function genes glsA, NhaA and NhaB. J23119 is not influenced by environmental pH, and will lead enzymes production continuously.

Our model mainly focused on functional genes and enzymes. Assumptions we made are:
(1) enzymes will only work in proper pH range and are not activated at other pH level.
(2) To prove function of our device, initial intracellular pH is set to ideal value.    For acid resistance device (Fig. 1), description of reaction processes are:

Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," ToxAssay. Three proteins were needed. These were the LCwt, LCmut and SNAP25.
SNAP25
Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) is a t-SNARE protein. It is account for the specificity of membrane fusion in neuronal cells by forming the SNARE complex. It is almost exclusively formed in brain tissues and executes fusion by forming a tight complex that brings the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes together.
The SNAP25 protein was provided with a Strep-Tag to obtain optimal results in purification. The other proteins (LCwt and LCmut) were each modified with a His-Tag. The reason for this is the Western-Blot Assay, which should show by means of Strep-Tag binding antibodies how the SNAP25 is degraded. However, this assay was rejected due to poorly binding antibodies.
The following ÄKTApurifier data were generated during purification:
Fig.8 ÄKTA_SNAP25
The graph shows airborne noise at 25mL and SNAP25 peak at 77mL, since strep-tag bound proteins can be eluted very specifically.
LCwt
The wild-type light chain is a zinc endopeptidase that can cleave various proteins of the vesicle fusion apparatus (SNARE complex) and prevents exocytosis of the vesicles.
The LCwt was modified with a His tag. The hisTag may not be as specific as the Strep tag due to the presence of other histidine-rich proteins, but for this reason some washing steps were performed to elute non-specifically bound proteins as can be seen in the ÄKTApurifier data.
The following ÄKTApurifier data were generated during purification:
Fig.9 ÄKTA_LCwt
As can be seen in the graph, nonspecifically bound proteins were first removed by minimal addition of elution buffer (at 30mL and 42mL) and the LCwt was collected at 72mL in the fractions. This is a 4mL protein solution.
LCmut
The mutated light chain of botulinum neurotoxin C was mutated as follows: E446>A; H449>G; Y591>A. The resulting enzyme construct has no functional properties or enzyme activity and should not exhibit SNAP25 cleavage in the later ToxAssay.
The LCmut is tagged with a Polyhistidin-Tag for the same reasons as under point LCwt.
The following ÄKTApurifier data were generated during purification:

About Frontend Framework
​ To make it easy to build applications with the web, we use advanced frontend framework Angular6 which is an open source framework maintained by Google. It is based on the Model View Controller (MVC) Architecture which ordinarily utilized for planning rich web applications. Angular6 combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end-to-end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. It helps developers to build cross-platform applications that live on the web, mobile, and desktop across Mac, Windows, and Linux.                         ​ Angular6 makes our web pages extremely high performance. It turns templates into code that's highly optimized for today's JavaScript virtual machines, giving us all the benefits of hand-written code with the productivity of a framework. And Angular apps load quickly with the new Component Router, which delivers automatic code-splitting so users only load code required to render the view they request.                         ​ Thanks to Angular popular, many well-known code editing products support Angular, like Visual Studio Code, Sublime text and WebStorm. We choose WebStorm as our IDE to makes code easily and spend less time.                         ​ When setting up our development environment, Angular CLI plays an important role. Angular CLI is a command line tool which makes build, add components and test faster. It has become one of the most essential tools for Angular.                         ​ We use Angular6 modularity system and component system to work together more easily and efficiently. The modularity system differentiates and combines the same and different functions and the component system can use less code to do a good job. Benefiting from Angular6’s performance and rendering mechanism which are better than most current mainstream frameworks,  including Vue and React, our web pages has faster response and more comfortable experience. With Karma for unit tests, our codes become stronger.                         ​ One of the important reasons we choose Angular6 is the issue of network security. Angular6 has built-in protections against common web-application vulnerabilities and attacks such as cross-site scripting attacks. To systematically block XSS bugs, Angular treats all values as untrusted by default. When a value is inserted into the DOM from a template"

BC Property Testing
Overview
After the experiments above, we processed the bacterial cellulose film formed by the co-culture of the modified E. coli and G.xylinus, we would like to know whether this culture method of mixed bacteria will change the microstructure of BC? Therefore, we observed the morphological characteristics of the bacterial cellulose produced by the co-culture of the bacteria by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and atomic force. The results are as below: :
1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
We first used a scanning electron microscope to observe the formation of bacterial cellulose samples under different electric field strength. The results are shown in the figure
The microstructure, fiber detail and fiber width of the bacterial cellulose samples can be analyzed by scanning electron microscopy after freeze-drying. We found no significant difference between them.
2.Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
The use of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy can help us understand the chemical structure of cellulose. Bacterial cellulose has an absorption peak for a particular wavelength of infrared, so that the composition of its chemical group can be analyzed.
Respectively, we analyzed BC film under the two conditions after the natural drying by the infrared spectrum scan, the results shown in Figure. The absorption peak at about 1060 cm-1 reflects the vibration of the C-O-C group, which is the characteristic absorption peak of the cellulose. The absorption peak at 1428 cm-1 is caused by the bending vibration of the C-H bond, and the depth is related to the crystallinity of the cellulose. Although the infrared spectrum is a simple method, it can only give a relative value, it can show whether is a crystalline phase or non-crystalline phase at one time. It can be seen that the BC film produced under these two conditions are not much different in the composition of the structure.
3. For the quality of wound dressings
Bacterial cellulose is well suited for wound dressings due to its"

After reading through the protocols and laying out a plan of attack, the students had the wait since the lab was going under routine inspection. The students spent the rest of the day designing more graphics and made wiki edits.
Packaging: The morning began with running a gel on the results of the gel extraction. While the gel was solidifying, the team determined the concentrations of the samples with the Nanodrop. After the gel confirmed the pBAD, csgA fragment, and dCBD fragment, the RXers performed a ligation in order to clone the csgA gene into the pBAD plasmid.

Hardware: Bio-pool
Introduction: Activated sludge process
Activated sludge process is now a widely used aerobic biological waste water treatment method. It could remove organic pollutants from water, which can be consumed by microorganism. It was invented by Clark and Gage in the UK in 1912.
In the early 20th century, waste water treatment was still a headache for cities, especially for big cities like London. At that time, people happened to discover that some sludge sediment appeared in the stagnant water, and the water above became clear!
In fact, the sludge is a biological floc composed of bacteria and protozoa which feed on the organic pollutants, and could oxidize the carbonaceous and nitrogenous matter in the waste water when oxygen presents.
Nowadays this principal has developed into various mature industrial processes and bio-reactors. And the basic work-flow is shown in Fig 1.

Our Device
Overview
We designed and assembled a hardware(shown in Fig. 2&3 and the Hardware Operation Demonstration Video) imitating the biochemical pools in waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) at the ratio of 1:50, including handmade microporous tube aerators and flux control and monitor equipment for air and water, which could be used for the experiments of variable aerobic biological treatment methods in laboratory, and the working capacity tests for new types of engineered microorganism under the real conditions in WWTPs.
On top of the traditional biochemical pool construction, we adopted pitched V-shaped bottom and vertical water inlet, and added partitions with holes in the pool, which could improved the practical performance of the working organism.

Notebook – Protocol – 12. Honey glucose meter measurement
1. Glucose dissolved in distilled water to a concentrations of 100 mM was used as stock. From that stock, various concentration of glucose were prepared by dilution. The concentrations were 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 mM.
2. Those glucose stocks were measured its mg/dl value by a glucose meter. The values then plotted as y axis, against the concentration as x axis. Linear standard curve was obtained and the formula was used to calculate the concentration of unknown sample.
3. Honey in 1.5 ml polypropylene tube was warmed at 60 oC for 10 minutes, then transferred 100 ul to a new tube which contained 900 ul distilled water to obtain 1/10 dilution.
4. This sample was used for measurement of glucose concentration by glucose meter, and its glucose concentration was calculated using standard curve obtained before.
5. When the mg/dl value still exceeded the linear curve, dilution rate was increased.

Laboratory Safety
In our project, we used BL1 materials E. coli for cloning and BL2 materials Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells for transfection. All students in our team are well-trained. Students who worked with BL2 material received blood-borne pathogens training besides usual lab training. Before our experiment, we made a detailed protocol and communicated with our instructor to ensure that we met the criterion in laboratory. When doing experiment, we wore lab coat, gloves and gauze mask to protect ourselves and all the experiments of BL2 materials were handled in biosafety cabinets. In accordance with MSDS, after finishing experiment, we handled carefully all laboratory chemicals, especially BL2 materials, which were handled with decontamination bleach mixture under ultraviolet rays for 24 hours.
Biological Parts
We constructed 2 basic parts that encoding internal protein in human body and designed 3 scilencing devices . The most hazardous biological parts in our parts are the scilencing devices since they encode the hairpin RNA that do not exsist in human body and they may cause potential risks. We transfected the scilencing devices into HEK293 to scilence the PDE5A gene. To make our parts safer, we designed a hypoxia responsive switch, only under hypoxia situation the down stream parts will work. In our experiment we used lentivirus to packaged our plasmids so that all the transfection experiments were handled in II biological safety cabinet.
Bio-safety of lentivirus vectors
The lentiviral vectors we used in our project are self-inactivating virus, which means that after infecting target cells， virus will not infect other cells, and will not  produce new virus.Although we minimized the risk by modifying the vector design, insertional mutagenesis caused by lentiverus still cause unknowm risks. Quantitative assays have demonstrated that the risk of insertional up regulation of proto-oncogenes is directly related to the strength of the enhancer sequences contained in the vector. Thus before we use lentivirus vectors for clinical purpose, a series of cells and animals experiment should be done to evaluated the safety of lentivirus vectors."

Barcamp
Barcamp is the an ""unconference"" event where anyone can share and learn in an open environment. Maker, tech, and DIY enthusiasts from all over Shanghai came to NYU Shanghai to experience Barcamp. We gave a presentation on the future of Synthetic Biology, and had a lot of great questions about the role of bio-error and bio-terror in the future of synthesized organisms.
Workshop for MakeforKids
We gave a DNA Visualization workshop to kids and parents attending MakeForKids Saturday lessons. We were scared we would have to answer the question, ""What is DNA?"" but we were surprised to find that most kids already had a grasp on the concept of DNA. Both parents and children were quite delighted to see the results of the DNA extraction from their cheek cells.

Human Practices Handbook
Overview
Our team recognizes that the progress of synthetic biology and of science doesn't just come from one source. Interdisciplinary work and collaborations play a huge part in the advancement of our field. We formed partnerships with other iGEM teams to utilize different resources and gain insights that simply cannot be done by a single team. We gained an understanding of the perception of synthetic biology in different geographic locations through a joint human practices effort. Furthermore, we also mentored other teams and helped contribute to a human practices handbook.
Public Perceptions Survey
Synthetic biology is more powerful when we work together. For our collaboration, we worked with Stony Brook iGEM to understand people’s attitudes about synthetic biology in different parts of New York. Together, we wrote a survey to administer near our respective universities - us, in Ithaca and upstate New York, and them, in Long Island and New York City. We held weekly meetings over Skype to discuss where we wanted to go with our collaboration, focusing on using the strengths of both of our teams. We also developed skills in survey writing and distribution. We learned to ask questions that would improve the knowledge-base of our teams, and researched what we could uniquely investigate that could not be found online.
Through reflection, reviewing literature, and thoughtful dialogue, we chose to focus on the comparison of perceptions of synthetic biology in different geographic locations. As student researchers from STEM backgrounds, we recognized the bubble we could potentially be in. Conducting this survey helped us pop that bubble. Together, both of our teams went through several iterations of survey drafts which we constructed together. We tested our surveys on small sample populations, and brought back feedback to clarify or rephrase our questions. When the questions were finalized, both teams went out to collect responses.
Cornell iGEM visited the Ithaca Farmers’ Market as well as the Ithaca Commons during our annual Apple Harvest Festival to collect survey responses."

By exploiting a natural NdeI site (CA\TATG) occurring right after the modified sequence, we insert BBa_K2319006 comprising a HindIII site (for insertion into the T7 expression backbone), a start codon (ATG), and a 6xHis-tag (for easy Ni-NTA column-based protein purification), and the modified sequence preceding the hidden translation start site.
Our Second Modification — SpyTag Linker
Using another oligo, we insert BBa_K2319008 comprising a BamHI site (for insertion after the mCherry sequence), a GSGGGGS linker (for independent folding) and the SpyTag peptide sequence AHIVMVDAYKPTK. By doing this, we add SpyTag functionality to the mCherry protein, allowing it to bind to our sfGFP-SpyCatcher.
GvpC fusion
After assembling our sfGFP-SpyCatcher and mCherry-SpyTag fusion proteins, we have to express them on the gas vesicle surface: this is where our AgeI sites come in handy — by using HindIII and AgeI, we can insert the gvpC sequence into this expression backbone to make the GvpC fusion proteins. Our project involves gas vesicles extracted from Anabaena flos-aquae and Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 — we need the gvpC genes from both these organisms, but as always, there are design considerations to keep in mind.
Our Modification — GvpC of Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1
H. salinarum is a halophile that tolerates hypersaline environments with ease — using a ""salt-in"" strategy, its cellular environment has evolved to be hypersaline itself! The vast majority of proteins synthesized by H. salinarum have negatively-charged acidic side chains and require 4-5 M salt concentrations to function. GvpC is one such protein. GvpC contains seven internal repeats of the domain that interlocks between GvpA ""ribs"" and strengthens the gas vesicle, followed by an acidic tail at the C-terminus which stabilizes the protein through effective solvation.

Learned how to use snapgene and put together the Lisbon plasmids into a plasmid map (with fragment inserted into the plasmid the way they did it). Simulated gel of CotA (laccase) and it seems we got the right thing there.
Went to Institute of Making and printed out Azoreductase. I found a way to make it print, now we have the two monomers, I need to finish polishing them and then find a really cool printer and some money to get a really good one printed.
Also tried to print the bioreactor BUT met mike (biochemeng postdoc) and just using a jar is just so much better to have an easily deployable bioreactor, then we can print some of the specific pieces. @Joy

Debugged and got the homepage HTML, CSS, and JS reading for the introduction of graphics. Super psyched I got this done. Consolidated all of the designs for the new site. Began studying genetic algorithms, cause I felt like it. At this point I had a discussion with the other team members and we are going to make sure the other sites are perfect to give us some more buffer time to get the final site done and pretty. Also began talks with Edo about setting up a blog/diary.

Introduction
Calculating Optimal pmols of Each Insert
Equation: pmols = (1000×weight in ng) / (length in bp×650 Da)
50ng of 5000bp dsDNA is about 0.015pmols
Online Tools: NEBioCalculator
NEB recommendation:
0.02–0.5 pmols when 1-2 inserts are being assembled into a vector (or 2-3 fragments are being assembled)
0.2–1.0 pmoles when 3–5 inserts are being assembled into a vector (or 4-6 fragments are being assembled)

One of the most interesting questions on how much Synthetic Biology will change our lives has also been answered very well (Cf. Figure 4), and it is particularly interesting that 31% have a negative view of establishing newly developed products or processes.For our lecture series this means that we not only had supporters in the audience, but also critics.

Heine meets Huxley
On the 16th of July we took part in the first event of  “Heine meets Huxley” - a project brought into the world by the Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf based on the dystopian novel “Brave New World” written by Aldous Huxley.  During the introductional event “Brave New World - cloned babies and super plants” aspects of genetic engineering were introduced and discussed which was a great opportunity for us to educate people about iGEM, synthetic biology and to still unfounded fears.
In his novel Huxley describes an utopian world in 2054, where baby clones are being genetically modified and assigned into classes based on their intelligence and labour.  Written in 1931 and published one year after, Huxley expected huge scientific advances in the future society but also a big downside to them.
Already in the first chapter - which was read to the filled room - we were introduced to a world of artificial wombs, excessive cloning and the manipulation of intelligence through different oxygen concentrations given to fetuses depending on their classes. A quite scary beginning.
The first talk given by Prof. Dr. Maria von Korff Schmising underlined different methods of genetic modifications used in plants and the effects - a bigger variety in foods - on the market.  After that Prof. Dr. Jan-Steffen Krüssel explained in vitro fertilization works nowadays and gave information about where Huxley had been wrong: For example, using less oxygen is not correlated with lesser intelligence but rather a natural environment in the oviduct of women.
Next was our turn. We prepared information booths to four topics: green biotechnology - the genetic manipulation of plants; red biotechnology - advances"

At a higher level, modeling may be used to describe the functioning of a tissue, organ, or even an entire organism. At still higher levels, models can be used to describe the behavior and time evolution of populations of individual organisms.
The first issue to confront when embarking on a modeling project is to describe on exactly which features to include in the model, and in particular, the level of detail model is intended to capture. Interacting with other cells and/or its environment, the cell realizes four key functions: growth, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. The processes that realize these functions of a cell can be further organized into three processes levels: gene regulation, signaltransduction and metabolism. So, a model of an entire organism is unlikely to describe the detailed functioning of every individual cell, but a model of a cell is likely to include a variety of very detailed description of key cellular processes. Even then, however, a model of a cell is unlikely to contain details of every single gene and protein.
Indeed, really accurate modeling of the process would require a model far more detailed and complex than most biologists would be comfortable with, using molecular dynamic simulations that explicitly manage the position and momentum of every molecule in the system.
The ""art"" of building a good model is to capture the essential features of the biology without burdening the model with non-essential details. Every model is to some extent a  simplification of the biology, but models are valuable because they take ideas that might have been expressed verbally or diagrammatically and make them more explicit, so that they can begin to be understood in a quantitative rather than purely qualitative way.
Aims of modeling
The features of a model depend very much on the aims of the modeling exercise. We therefore need to consider why people model and what they hope to achieve by so doing. Often the most basic aim is to make clear the current state of knowledge regarding a particular system, by attempting to be precise about the elements involved and the interactions between them. Doing this can be a particularly effective way of highlighting gaps in understanding. In addition, having a detailed model of a system allows people to test that their understanding of a system is correct, by seeing if the implications of their models are consistent with observed experimental data. In practice, this model validation stage is central to the systems biology approach. However this work will often represent only the initial stage of the modeling process. Once people have a model they are happy with, they often want to use their models predictively, by conducting ""virtual experiments"
