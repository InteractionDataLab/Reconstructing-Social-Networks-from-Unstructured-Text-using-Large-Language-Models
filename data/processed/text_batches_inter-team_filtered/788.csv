Eighth meeting - Technical functionality: solution
We decided to work with two different theories of functions in order to encounter the abovementioned overdetermination problem. On the one hand we studied the ICE-theory for the ascription of technical functions by agents ([19],[20]). On the other hand we studied the organisational account of biological functions ([21],[22],[23]). By the products of synthetic biology both ascriptions of functions are possible – although we noticed that the technical function ascription applies imperfectly. Through the analysis of specific situations and counterexamples we showed that the technical function ascription is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the products of synthetic biology per se. The explanation based on biological functions makes a closure, due to the circular causality of living systems, which makes every reference to human intentionality dispensable. To make this account clear, we can examine the following example:
The hidden entities
In a fictive secret part of our world a civilisation of human beings with an impressive scientific knowledge existed. They constructed impressive machine-like entities, which were capable of moving around and do things, but not to (re)produce, maintain and organize themselves. Using artificial organic materials they also constructed some bacteria-like living entities, which were able to absolve self-production, self-maintenance and self-organisation. This civilisation was destroyed without leaving anything but these two kinds of entities. We now find these entities, without knowledge of the past civilisation, and try to explain them.
The explanation of the machine-like entities is ad-hoc not possible at all. One could try to explain them under the terms of their physical structures, but certainly without luck. One would probably make an ‘inference to the best explanation’ and, because these functioning machine-like entities cannot (re)produce, maintain and organise themselves, conclude that they were made by intentional beings. In contrast, no reference to human intentionality is needed by the explanation of the bacteria-like entities. A sufficient explanation of these entities can be given by just referring to the circular causality they own. The ahistorical circular causality makes any external cause unnecessary. These considerations show that in the moment in which we are capable of ascribing biological functions to an entity, all references to an ‘intelligent designer’ to explain this entity in itself is dispensable. Therefore, we conclude that the ascription of technical functions to the products of synthetic biology is only possible regarding a human context, but not if we want to describe what they are in themselves. Thus, it is not warranted to say that the synthetic entities follow"

We also pursue to accomplish a project, which in the contrast comes from the nature and may finally go back admirably and peacefully, becoming a part of the nature. Just like that the artificial heart or prosthetic devices, being a part of the flesh and blood fused in the body, are unceasingly driving and propelling the entirety, the idea “from nature, for nature” is somehow lying in this way.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," Through talks with other biosensor developers (for example, Chris French), and after reviewing legislation regarding the use of synthetic biology outside of the lab environment, the importance of CFPS systems as a chassis was highlighted. Despite its importance, CFPS systems can still suffer from some issues such as lower total protein synthesis than whole cells. By standardising and characterising a GFP variant which has been modified to have enhanced expression in these systems, it is hoped that CFPS will become a more attractive option for researchers. The aims for this section of the project were: (i) to standardise deGFP as a BioBrick and submit it to the iGEM repository, (ii) to demonstrate expression of deGFP in commercially available cell-free systems, and (iii) to characterise expression of deGFP in E. coli cells.
Background Information
deGFP is a modified variant of eGFP developed by Shin and Noireaux which is more efficiently translated in CFPS systems. It was designed by truncating the N-terminal sequence and introducing silent mutations which removed internal ribosome binding like sequences. The C-terminal sequence is also truncated as this has been shown to not be necessary for maximal fluorescence (Li et al. 1997). By removing ribosome binding like sequences, Shin and Noireaux have reduced the amount of incorrect ribosome binding events and hence increased translation efficiency. The length of the protein also contributes to enhanced translation efficiency by reducing the time and resources required for this process to reach completion.
Design Stage
The deGFP sequence was taken from the Addgene database (Plasmid #40019). The sequence was found to have no illegal restriction sites (i.e. no EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, or PstI sites). A strong, standard Anderson promoter (J23100) and RBS (B0034) was added before the deGFP sequence with biobrick scar sites between each part. A double terminator (B0015) was added after the deGFP sequence. The entire construct was flanked by 30 bp overhangs with the pSB1C3 plasmid, such that the construct could be Gibson assembled into a pSB1C3 plasmid digested with XbaI and SpeI (Figure 1). Extra bases were added between the overhangs and the construct so that once the part was assembled into the plasmid, the XbaI and SpeI sites could be regenerated and the biobrick prefix and suffix restored. This construct (J23100-deGFP) with the overhang"

Aix-Marseille,2018,Team:Aix-Marseille#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," of modeling particularly efficient for complex system modeling.
Agent-based modeling allows us to define the behaviour of the agents (the diffusing molecules, the bed bugs,...) by defining the interactions between those agents.  With the NetLogo language, those agents are patches, representing the environment where other agents are interacting. The turtles are mobile agents who can move through the world made by patches and interact with other agents (patches or turtles). Those agents allowed us to build our current program. Thanks to this, it's easier to model systems with multiples agents interacted with every other agents is simpler.
What did we Model ?
Modeling Diffusion
When we begin the development of our project, we first searched on the iGEM's database, in order to find if any teams had already worked on pheromone diffusion.  After a few research among the previous iGEM's teams, we found out that the Valencia team of 2014 had also worked on pheromone diffusion and had modeled it using NetLogo. [1]
Because of the similarity between their work and ours, we inspired ourselves with the design of their modeling of diffusion when we model this aspect.
Fick's law of diffusion, mathematical model
As the 2014 Valencia team already found out, there is many ways to model diffusion.  Here, we will use the Fick's law of diffusion to model it because of its simplicity and the amount of documentation about it we have access to.  But there could be an impact of diffusion within a fluid in motion, the effect of drafts on diffusion. This can be modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations but since the nonlinearity of this equation make it a very complex (if not impossible) equation to solve, we choose to not use it and hypothesize a room without drafts.
How the equation is used in our model
The most well known form of the Fick's law of diffusion is described as it follows :
\begin{equation} \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = {\nabla(D,c)} \end{equation}
It is a partial differential equation with D being the diffusion coefficient, c being the pheromone concentration and \(\nabla\) being the gradient operator.  Since we consider our diffusion coefficient as constant, the equation can be set as:
\begin{equation} \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = D\times\nabla^2 c = D\times\Delta c \end{equation}
With \(\Delta\) being the Laplacian operator. This equation"

Eppure siamo, oggi piu’ che mai, ancora alla ricerca di soluzioni non solo per far si’ che gli individui vivano in salute e il piu´a lungo possibile, ma anche per rimendiare ai disastri ecologici che noi stessi andiamo creando nel corso della modernizazzione. Contrariamente al passato, oggi crediamo di non dover piu’ cercare sostanze magiche nascoste nella Natura, piuttosto dobbiamo lasciarcene inspirare e creare nuovi mezzi per risolvere in modo attivo le sfide della nostra moderna societa´.
Lasciati giudare attraverso un viaggio in cui incontrerai una nuova classe di molecole che ha tutte le carte per rivoluzionare la biologia sintetica: le sintetasi peptidiche. Ti insegneremo a rilasciare il loro enorme potenziale per la generazione di peptidi interamente sintetici con varie funzioni che possono essere scelte da te, come ad esempio riciclare oro dai rifiuti elettronici.
Non lasciarti sfuggire l’occasione!

We created a common association, called iGEM ESOC (European Symposium Organisation Committee), and are hoping that in next years some teams will choose to organize it again ! This structure will aim to provide a frame to the event. This would also give us the ability to efficiently plan (or help planning) any following edition of the European Experience in the future. Though we don’t think that the event has to be in France, if it is, some of the paperwork will already be done.

UNC-Chapel_Hill,2015,Team:UNC-Chapel Hill#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," characteristics: the strength of the promoter associated with the MLC region and the placement of the MLC region. Using the iGEM parts registry, the two promoters selected were BBa_J23112 (weak) and BBa_J23100 (strong) and one MLC binding region was placed either prior or after (post) the promoter (strong and weak refer to the relative frequency to which the promoters actually transcription, with strong being more frequent than weak). The appropriate BioBrick restriction sites will also be included (prefixes and suffixes so that 3A assembly protocol can be used for the MLC promoters). Also primer sequences were synthesized around the promoters so that the promoter could undergo PCR. The sequences for the MLC promoters and the primer are shown below (Figure 2).
MLC Mechanism Expanded
The MLC protein was first discovered by overproducing it in E. coli cells. This caused a reduction in the uptake of glucose, resulting in a decrease in colony size.3 As stated previously, MLC is a repressor involved in the transcription regulation of many proteins involved in PTS, this is why MLC is known as a global repressor.4
As stated before, MLC binds to palindromic DNA sequences and blocks transcription, but what stops the action of MLC? Why it is associated with an increase in glucose concentration? Sung‐Jae Lee et al, discovered that the active transport of glucose across the cell membrane (into the cell) results in a phosphorylation cascade that causes certain domains of enzyme IICB to bind to the MLC protein and sequester it to the cell membrane. Recall that enzyme IICB is a transmembrane glucose permease (it is interesting to note that in the presence of glucose IICB sequesters MLC to the plasma membrane, boosting its own transcription).4
Sung‐Jae Lee et al discovered that when dephosphorylated, the IIB domain of enzyme IICB sequestered MLC to the membrane and that the IIC domain, which is the membrane spanning portion of the protein, is also necessary for the sequestration to occur (see Figure 3). This causes more enzyme IICB to be expressed (gene ptsG), which will cause the sequestration of even more MLC. This positive feedback loop results in the vamping up of enzyme IICB on the cell membrane and maximizes the amount of glucose transported into the cell. There have also been additional research that has identified another protein-protein interaction that MLC participates in. It has been shown"

28 Juli - 3 August
The CP promoters in pSB1C3, that were isolated in the week of 14 - 20 Juli, were tested on their insert size. For this, a PCR was done on the plasmid using the primers VF2 (BBa_G00100) and VR (BBa_G00101) were used. The insert size corresponded to the expected size.
A touchdown PCR was done on the genes of the nisin operon and the  sfGFP(Bs) gene. In this PCR the annealing temperature dropped from 55 °C to  45 °C, lowering the temperature with 1 &degC each cycle. This  unfortunately resulted in a PCR program of just 10 cycles, instead of the intended 30. The remaining steps of the program were finished the next morning. Only the genes NisA, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs) were amplified this way, see figure 1. Therefore, the PCR was repeated, this time with a complete cycle. No additional genes were amplified this way.
Another attempt was made for amplification of the remaining genes. This time, the most ideal annealing temperature for each gene was used by using a gradient PCR and placing the tubes at the optimal temperature. This still did not amplify the remaining genes. Also, a PCR with a general annealing temperature of 50 &degC was done. This also did not amplify the remaining genes.
The genes that were amplified in the first PCR (NisA, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs)) were purified using the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit from Thermo Scientific. The purified products were digested with the enzymes EcoRI  and PstI, using 2 &mul of the product. These purified and restricted products were loaded on gel, see figure 2. It was then discovered that the genes were barely visible on gel. The restricted genes were purified with the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit and the concentration was measured with the NanoDrop 1000."

Further perspectives
We have attained two milestones as far as the applications of our project is concerned. First, the identification of peptides with an affinity to a specific fungal surface molecule and second, is the  proof of principle that our selection scheme can be used to generate peptides with affinity to a molecule under scrutiny. Both milestones hold promise but before that, we would like to elaborate on the future scope of the first milestone since it bears relevance to medicine and healthcare.
Applications in Diagnostics
Lowering costs
The attachment of a chemical moiety that emits a quantifiable signal (a   fluorescent, enzymatic or luminiscent moiety) to our peptides can lead to an   alternative diagnostic method to antibody and antibody fragments with the added   benefit of the relative low cost of production and modification of small peptides. This cost reduction may   help to spread this diagnostic tool to the markets of the developing world, where   fungal infections have the largest mortality rates and where health care is   largely affected by economic constraints. Moreover, if the peptides prove to have a high species-specificity, the diagnosis based on them may give more information for a proper therapy choice, potentially reducing the toxicity risks associated with the use of broad spectrum antimycotics.
In vivo diagnosis and the potential of artificial selection
Short peptides are currently being used as diagnostic tools for certain kind   of cancers. These peptides are naturally produced by humans   and have their natural binding proteins in the surface of cells; however, they   have been optimized to increase their half-life and their affinity towards their   natural target, and they also have been modified with radionuclides that make it   possible to detect the location of tumors cells where their binding proteins are   overrepresented with PET or SECT imaging.
The most common isotopically labelled peptide used for diagnosisis a"

Aim: Activation of astrocytes was performed to confirm that our C8D30 astrocyte cell line can accurately model resting and reactive astrocytes for our experimental design.
Importance:Our project is based on the assumption that reactive astrocytes are a main factor in ALS and therefore our product is designed to specifically disarm them. Without a “reactive astrocyte” experimental group, we can not test the efficiency and specificity of our product in reactive astrocytes when compared to other cells in the system.

Theoretical background:
Reactive astrocytes are found in several forms, including forms called A1 and A2. Gene expression analysis in reactive astrocytes has shown that reactive astrocytes type A1 express many genes that are detrimental to synapses (such as complement cascade genes)1. Studies show that A1 reactive astrocytes are produced as a result of an NFkB protein signal. A process termed nuclear factor kappa light- chain enhancer of activated B cells2.  Reactive astrocytes type A2 over-express neurotropic factors, which promote synapse repair. Meaning A1 reactive astrocytes are harmful while A2 reactive astrocytes are helpful to the central nervous system (CNS) and brain1.
Recently, researchers have developed a model of exclusively A1 reactive astrocytes in cell culture which allows for targeted research. In this model, researchers quickly extract astrocytes from brain tissue which has not yet been damaged. Then these astrocytes are grown in tissue culture with the relevant medium. Finally, a cocktail of cytokines, taken from the medium of activated microglia, is added to the astrocyte culture. At this point, the astrocytes exhibit an A1 reactive astrocytes phenotype1.
Microglia can be activated in vivo by inducing chronic CNS damage or by injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Activated microglia secrete three cytokines which induce A1 reactive astrocytes: interleukin 1 alpha (IL1a), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), and complement component 1q (C1q). Adding LPS or these three cytokines in vitro produces A1 reactive astrocytes with a genetic profile very similar to A1 reactive astrocytes in vivo.1
Experiments on this model have shown that A1 reactive astrocytes lose almost all functions displayed by resting astrocytes. A1"

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," These risks differ from other times because ""(1) they are undetectable by direct human sensory perception; (2) they are capable of transcending generations; (3) they exceed the capacity of current mechanisms for compensating victims"" (Cohen 1997: 107)  a systematic way of dealing with hazards and insecurities induced and introduced by modernisation itself.
Self-governance and self-regulation: A people or group that is able to autonomously exercise all of the necessary functions of power without intervention from any other authority. This bottom-up approach excludes other social actors from controlling future scientific practices, which motivates the criticism that self-governance goes against democratic principles.
Socialisation: The process of learning throughout life in which norms, values, customs and ideologies are inherited and disseminated so that individuals acquire the necessary skills and habits to participate in society. The result is that socialisation makes sure that there is contuinity in the cultural and social configurations of a society.
Sociology: The study of the origins, development, structure, functioning and organisation of social relationships and institutions in society. It is a scientific attempt to understand social agency in order to make (causal) explanations about social order and the effects of and changes in social relationships using empirical research methods and critical analysis.
Subpolitics: Expression of political modernisation where new stakeholders emerge and take on roles of leadership to drive institutional reform. This is especially the case in environmental governance where environmental movements, non-governmental organisations, businesses, and other stakeholders are increasingly present in political decision-making of environmental policy.
Tacit knowledge: Knowledge that is highly implicit when transferring it from one person to another, making it more difficult to acquire this knowledge. It cannot just be learned by written or verbal communication, but often requires (intensive) practice and/or talent. In the case of synthetic biology, it usually requires years of training to use a certain skill to complete a complex task in molecular biology or biotechnology. Because of the deskilling trend, the necessary tacit knowledge is considerably reduced making it more accessible for non-experts.
Technologies of hubris: The over-reliance on science and technology in the innovation policy agenda where aspects of uncertainty are excluded from analysis. This concept is in contrast with technologies of humility where unforeseeable consequences and social implications are taken into account (Maynard 2008).
Transnationalism: The contemporary evolution of greater interconnectivity between nations of people accompanied by the receding significance of nation states on a economic and social level.
Uncertainty: ""A situation in which, given current knowledge, there are multiple possible"

Naringenin Operon Assembly Results
Introduction Operon Design Experiments Conclusions
Results
Introduction
Guided by the successful chemotaxis results , proving that 50 µM naringenin attracts the nitrogen-fixing bacteria Azospirillum brasilense and Herbospirillum seropedicae, we aimed to engineer a naturally colonising endophyte Pseudomonas sp. (CT 364) to produce naringenin. For proof of concept the production of naringenin would first need to be demonstrated in E. coli before being tested in Pseudomonas sp., our final chassis organism.
Naringenin biosynthesis is achieved through the expression of an operon containing four genes encoding the enzymes that constitute the naringenin biosynthetic pathway (Figure 1). This operon was previously assembled and submitted to the iGEM Registry by the TU Darmstadt 2014 iGEM team BBa_K1497016 and is a composite of the following four genes, each with the strong ribosome binding site (RBS) BBa_B0034 :
4-Coumaryl ligase - 4CL BBa_K1033001
Tyrosine ammonia lyase - TAL BBa_K1033000
Chalcone isomerase - CHI BBa_K1497000
Chalcone synthase - CHS BBa_K1497001
Figure 1. The naringenin synthesis pathway from L-tyrosine.
We were required to optimise the sequence for the enzyme tyrosine ammonia lyase by reducing the G/C content so that it could be synthesised by IDT BBa_K2797014 . The entire operon was synthesised in four separate parts referred to as gBlocks that were subsequently used for Gibson assembly, as this was"

We  also talked about the ethics of synthetic biology and why the public has been so opposed to its use in the past. Examples such as the burning of GM crops in the early 1990s and 2000s shows how synthetic biology, if badly managed, can result in a public and media backlash. However, we explained how the current applications of synthetic biology, which are numerous, are only the tip of the iceberg. This led onto an explanation of our project and the IGEM competition which hopefully encouraged younger students to start their own teams in the senior part of the school.
Modelling Presentation: Chemistry Society
In another talk given in Chemistry society, the modelling team went through the derivation of our mathematical model to the upper school. This explained the benefits of using a mathematical model in chemical processes and how we it in our project and was an opportunity to educate our peers about a specific aspect of our iGEM work.

While our project was still in its infancy, we began constructing a website on our school system (which is called frog). It gives information covering what the IGEM competition entails as well as all aspects of our project. Each part of the project, for example human practices, has its own page which we began filling with content as a log of the team’s progress.  The website had a number of functions. Firstly, from a human practices point of view, the website was great for educating the rest of our school and the public about synthetic biology , IGEM and our project. It also helped us record all of our progress and also provided us with a form a practice for the creation of our own wiki page.

Control tank 2 contained tap water consisting of 0.1 mg Hg2+ and the fish were fed normal feed. The fish in the experimental tanks were fed feed containing a mixture of engineered E. coli and filled with tap water containing 0.1 mg Hg2+. The experiment was carried out for 30 days in duplicates and the fish were fed twice daily. Approximately 50% of the water was exchanged every day. Mortality, external signs, and growth conditions of the fish were recorded daily (Abraham et al., 2008). Detection of mercury in fish was carried out according to “Determination of total mercury and organic-mercury in foods” (GB/T 5009.17-2003).
Bacterial community composition determined by sequencing
After 30 days of feeding, sampled fish were dissected using sterile scissors. Samples of intestines were examined utilizing methods described by Shangong Wu. DNA was extracted using TIANamp Stool DNA kit (TIANGENBIOTECH，BEIJING). Universal primer 515F and 909R with 12 nt unique barcode was used to amplify the V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene for pyrosequencing using Miseq sequencer. The purified library was diluted, denatured, re-diluted, and mixed with PhiX (equal to 30% of final DNA amount) in accordance with the Illumina library preparation protocols, and then applied to an Illumina Miseq system for sequencing with the Reagent Kit v2 2 × 250 bp according to the manufacturer’s manual. The sequence data were processed using QIIME Pipeline–Version 1.7.0 (http://qiime.org/).

When the                                         medium have prepared well, turn on the switch a and switch b for replacing                                         medium in bioreactor, while the switch c will be turned off.
We also consider the process of raw materials, especially                                         xylose, which is the key source of our pathway. Since xylose is one of the                                         products of agricultural waste degradation, we visited the 2018                                             Tainan Biotechnology and Green Energy Expo to consulted with                                         researchers from National Energy Program-Phase II, whose projects was biofuel                                         and biodegradable plastic production via agricultural waste. They had developed                                         technique that degrade cellulose and semi-cellulose by ion solution.
Besides, we have opportunity to collaborate with UESTC-Chian                                             team . They work for degrading straw with synthetic biology and convert                                         the product into bio-fuel. One of the product from straw degradation is xylose.                                         These techniques are eco-friendly and low-energy-require. Therefore, the                                         process development of xylose production will be a low-carbon-emission process.

We will discharge 90% of the used medium in the bioreactor one                                         hour before new medium flows in. Which means that we let 10% of the culture                                         remain in the bioreactor as seed culture. The effluent medium will be                                         sterilized and filtered in the downstream clean-up tank. At this step, we                                         harvest the bacteria and extracting the by-product such as amino acids,                                         proteins, medicine or bio-fuel. Different extracting process designed depends                                         on different by-product.
Besides, we try to reuse the waste heat of factories for                                         sterilizing. The waste water can be recycled as well through removing toxins                                         and adjusting pH value the effluent could return to the medium tank. As for                                         energy require for this system, renewable energy helps us to reach near -zero                                         carbon emission process.
Furthermore, we would like to set up membrane bioreactor (MBR)                                         system, which use a hollow filter membrane that is able to filter most of                                         bacteria in the sewage sludge. We use the system to concentrate the used medium                                         before extracting by-product. And the water went through the system is able to                                         recycle back to the medium tank.

. Of note, strategies for applying both, positive and negative selection pressure during evolution in PACE have also been explored
Carlson.2014
. Encouraged by the aforementioned, exciting work by others, we wanted to set up PACE in our lab to harness its power for directed evolution of proteins for human benefit. However, PACE turned out to be more difficult to run than anticipated initially. This was mainly due to the required, complex bioreactor setup. In fact, before we ran our first (and so far only) successful PACE experiment, we had already performed a high number of unsuccessful PACE runs (see the “Troubleshooting PACE” section further below) . The major failure points for us were
Cross-contamination with phages very well propagating on the used AP
Quick phage wash out due to insufficient phage propagation in the lagoon
Problems to reliably control cell density in the turbidostat
In this work, we aimed at evolving a split T7 polymerase toward improved auto-reassembly. As we were still troubleshooting our PACE setup when this project began, we initially planned to employ our PREDCEL protocol to for directed in vivo evolution of the split T7. That is why you will find parts of our results also in the protein interaction subpage . However, we gained confidence in using PACE just when the corresponding split T7 encoding phages and APs were ready. Therefore, we decided to give it a try and – luckily – we were successful (read on).

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#AlbertoNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," that this issue was caused by using DNA ladder without diluting it first. Once we mixed the DNA ladder and water with 1:4 ratio, the bands on the gel fluoresced with the same intensity, allowing us to clearly verify their relative position according to the DNA ladder.
Progressing to the next step, we found numerous problems with the ligation and we then tried to isolate the error sources systematically. We realized that we had ignored the number of base pairs for the insert and vector ratio calculation. This mean that the unexpected band size from the GFP + Terminator composite part could possibly result from bad ligation. I did ligation again with this new formula, but nothing grew. We then tried using the improved calculation method, where the vector mass were kept constant and as close to 50 ng as possible. In the meantime, Margaux successfully did the ligation, which could be verified by the red tinted colonies. From her experiment, we found out that the amount of ligase enzyme did not matter. Kyle also did ligation and found out that two ligation incubation protocols did not yield different result. Nevertheless the yield was extremely small as only 1 or 2 plates show bacterial growth. In addition, there was at most 1 or 2 colonies found on each of those plates.
We then tried to do ligation with different protocol, where the ligation reaction will be incubated in 16 degrees overnight, using the 5 samples prepared with the revised calculation. One of these samples, Bba_R2000_E0240 (Promoter+GFP Composite), underwent ethanol precipitation to increase its concentration. While the concentration of its individual part was very small, ethanol precipitation can create a significantly small sample with high concentration. We expected this approach to allow a better attachment between the sticky parts, even though the small volume prohibit us from mixing the parts based on the previously established ratio. The result were transformed on Sunday and we expected the plates to be ready by next Tuesday.

M9
M9+Glucose
M9+CS (catechu+slaked lime stock)
M9+CS (catechu+slaked lime stock)
The samples were processed (passed through bacterial proof filters of 0.22µ) before inoculation so as to eliminate chances of growth due to presence of existent carbon source in the collected sample.
Hence, a flask with M9 medium was also inoculated and checked for growth so as to ensure that the bacteria are not growing due to the carbon source in the sample but are using the carbon source provided in the medium.The choice of minimal medium was also made keeping in mind the single carbon source utilisation by the organisms.
Growth was observed in all the flasks, except the flasks containing only M9 medium without any carbon source, in less than 72 hours of shaking incubation at room temperature.
No growth/turbidity in the flasks containing only M9 medium proves that the carbon source from sample was successfully filtered & thus has proven to be an efficient negative control.
Moreover, reduction in the intensity of the red colour (due to catechu extract in the medium) was observed after 24 hours.

The flow of the continuous phase here was fixed, so the Capillary number could be         considered as a constant. Thus, only the flow rate of disperse IA phase was varied and the effect of flow rate         ratio (Q = QIA/QOA) could be assessed.         The simulation was run with a set of different IA phase flow velocity values (Tab. 4) and results are         presented in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10.

Fig. 9 Sphere radius dependency on flow rate ratio Q. It should be noted that x-axis doesn’t start     from zero in order to distinguish between first three values. In comparison with λ, Q seems to affect liposome     radius at a greater magnitude. In our simulated range of parameters the radius varies from 6.05 µm to 8.56 µm.
Fig. 10 Sphere diameter dependency on flow rate ratio Q. Simplified graph shows that liposome     diameter variation range is 5.5 µm in our configurations, which can be considered good enough for fine-tuning.
Relying on the results we can safely assume, that liposome size depends directly on IA phase flow rate. However         studies suggest that this dependency is not linearly proportional because the droplet formation process is also         affected by the surface tension force and the dynamic energy equilibrium1. This seems to be true         considering given data.
In contrary to dynamic viscosity ratio variation, flow rate ratio can be experimentally modified in a broad         range of values, meaning we can effectively synthesize liposomes from 12 µm to around 17 µm with our current         set-up. Nevertheless, we have found that"

The insolubility of quercetin didn't seem to be a real problem for the microorganisms, both in liquid and solid medium. However, it was still a problem for the degradation  quantification.
Another problem was the separation between the cells and the quercetin. We tried to filter a sample of water with quercetin with a 0.22 um² filter. All the pigment stayed fixed to filter. The pores were much bigger than the quercetin. It seemed that the quercetin has a strong affinity to the membrane.
As the quercetin is mostly insoluble in water, a centrifugation was a way to remove the cells and the pigment from the broth. All we needed, then, was a medium were the quercetin was soluble, preferably not an expensive and toxic organic solvent.
Week 15th-21th August
Fungal strains collection
We had all we needed to work with filamentous fungi. We isolated the identified strains and inoculated them in Sabouraud Dextrose Agar, a common plate for filamentous fungi culture.
After 4 days the plates were covered of mycelium. Then, we inoculated them on M9Q agar Plate and in M9 plates.
Test in liquid medium
The isolated fungi were tested in 3 liquid medium :
M9
M9 + 1g/L quercetin
M9 + 1g/L quercetin + 1g/L glucose
There was also a blank without fungi
Quercitin analysis
We wanted to see if the disappearance of the color in plates could be due to a pH modification. So we took 1g/L of quercetin and changed the pH with hydrochloric acid. There was no color change at a pH of 1.5.
Then we added base and there was a change. Around a pH of 12 we could see a solubilization of quercetin. After a pH of 12.5, quercetin was completely solubilized. The color was orange instead of yellow. There was no color change between a pH of 12.5 and 13.5.
We had solubilized quercetin. We managed to solubilize up to 50g/L of quercetin in alkaline water.
We measured the absorbance spectrum and we could see that the maximum of absorbance was at 315nm.

The Birth of Our Project
Finding a proper project is always a long and frustrating experience. We all felt that we had learned too little, and hard to transfer our thoughts into feasible ideas. Hoping to get some help, we decided to visit a cohort of experts.
Hsinchu Food Industry Research and Development Institute(FIRDI) --The skill of experiment and project design
Initially, we have two project ideas. The first topic is about the detection of brown root rot in trees. Since brown root rot is usually very serious once it is discovered, we hope to design an Escherichia coli. This E. coli will release the signal when it detects brown root bacteria, allowing us to detect Phellinus noxius early. The second topic is about the preservation of food. Food spoilage is usually caused by microorganisms, so we want to use the characteristics of bacterial quorum sensing to inhibit the reproduction of bacteria.
We went to FIRDI in January twenty-first. Visiting three experts, research scientist Guey-Yuh Liou, senior research scientist Hing-Yuen Chan, and associated research scientist Li-Wen Yu, and discussing with ideas and topics we generated. Since it is not convenient to use trees as experimental objects, it takes a long time to perform experiments related to shelf life, so the feasibility of these two topics is not high. They taught us some potential projects. Though we still did not know which project to choose, this special journey let us have confidence in project design.
Red Imported Fire Ants(RIFAs) with Professor Chin-Cheng Yang --Safety of the experiment
With so many candidate topics, RIFAs became one of the most possible projects. RIFAs have already threatened many people in different area, so we wanted to eliminate this problem through synthetic biology.
We visited professor Yang, whose profession is relevant to the topic, in Kyoto through skype on April 13th. He generously shared with us knowledge related to RIFAs and potential direction. However, he also told us about the importance of safety,"

** Add components in order of decreasing volume for maximum ease-of-pipetting.
*** When reaction mixture is being made up, all components as well as the mixture itself are to be kept on ice, as the Master Mix is a high-fidelity polymerase that will recognize the primers as being incorrectly base-paired and be able to hydrolyse the primers if kept at room temperature.
**** Use Q5 enzyme in the cold room to avoid defrosting and freezing the original stock of Q5 enzyme. This could decrease the activity of Q5 enzyme. Bring ice bucket to the cold room to bring Q5 into the bench.
***** Make sure that the primer and small amounts of DNA and primer doesn’t stick onto the side of the tube or the tip.

Bioethics
- A Philosopher’s Guide to the Future
“The facts of life... to make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised once it's been established.”
Tyrell, Bladerunner
Synthetic biology and the iGEM competition are aimed to help solve societal issues, issues such as agriculture, medical research, and environmental resource management, the last of which has been our motivation throughout our project. However, while synthetic biology offers many new exciting possibilities, several concerns have to be met when dealing with living organisms. Against, the excitement of the iGEM community, skeptics have pointed to the uncertainty and potentiality for unwanted consequences that might arise from working with synthetic biology. We as a team decided to give these concerns some serious thought! We have had several conversations on topics such as meta ethics, applied ethics, sustainability, GMO, and so on. Furthermore, we established an open and honest mode of discourse to use when engaging with other teams and the public. We held a workshop in bioethics in relation to our Danish Meetup. This workshop consisted of a historical insight into the history of GMO provided by our very own historian, as well as a hefty, kind-hearted debate, supervised by our own philosopher.
All of these considerations, debates, and results led our philosopher Lene to write a longer guidebook entailing an overview of the various bioethical arguments often made for and against the use of synthetic biology. The guidebook is mainly an insight into the most important ethical considerations made by our team, e.g. how they shaped our product, but it also offers a personal and clear overview of arguments and principles meant to help future teams to get a conversation on ethics started!
Make sure to give this guidebook a read, it is definitely worth it!"

WHAT ARE WE WORKING ON ?
This year HUST-China focuses on the enrichment of rare earth elements. By designing and constructing the genetic circuits we can recycle the rare earth ions and purify waste water. Our final goal is to build a highly intelligent & efficient engineering circuit including specific peptides.
WHY WE FOCUS ON THIS ?
The rare-earth elements (REE) has aroused more and more public attention due to the roles it plays in different fields—permanent magnets, catalysts, rechargeable batteries and other high tech products[1]. However, processes like mining, refining, and recycling of rare earth elements do serious harm to the environment if not properly managed. For instance, toxic acids are produced during the refining process and they are particular to be transfered into the general water supply[2]. So we want to figure out a way through which we can not only enrich rare earth elements, but also be environmentally friendly. That’s why we turn to synthetic biology to solve the environmental problem.
HOW WE ACHIEVE OUR GOAL ?
Our system has been divided into sensing part and capture part. We use lanthanide binding peptide and surface display system to recycle rare earth ions. The sensing part is based on the PmrA-B-C system which is discovered from salmonella. We also take 2015 HUST-China project as reference to help us recollect our bacterial. Further explanation will be shown in the description part.
WHAT HAVE WE ACHIEVED ?
It was a memorable year that we recruited new team members in November 2016 and told the story of our project to the iGEMers all over the world in November 2017. iGEM was not only a litmus test that picked those who have a passion for synthetic biology, but also a window that gave us a chance to enjoy the charming scenery of synthetic biology. In the end, HUST-China won the Gold Medal with the efforts of all its team members.

Besides, we're also working with some of the other planned constructions, and we're doing everything in duplicate to try different protocols in line. We're running out of time,and the electrophoresis machinery is smoking. We're using two different competent cells, kipping the ligationsat different temperatures at different times...We have to try everything!
We're taking turns to get some sleep, but the floor is not exactly comfortable, and the cleaners come at 6 a.m... At least we have enough food to survive, a coffee machine and 4 litres of Coca-Cola. What a long weekend...

From the experimental data, it can be given that \(\theta_2\) meets                         the requirements when it reaches 0.5~0.7. Under the preconditions, relation (8) and Fig. 4 can                         be derived:

Fig.4 The relationship between the optimal ratio of antibody                                 antigen concentration and θ2
There are then two scenarios. Scheme 1: immobilized antigen, test substance and antibody mixed                         detection. Scheme 2: After the antigen is fixed and the excess antibody is added, the test                         substance is added for competitive reaction. These two options need to be compared.
At present, the gray scale model and the dynamic model are discussed in the first scheme.
When determining the residual antigen concentration and time relationship when immobilizing an                         antigen and the residual antibody concentration and time relationship when the antibody is                         attached, the model can be used to give an optimal concentration ratio of the immobilized                         antigen and the antibody by combining given \(θ\) and \(θ_2\).
At the same time, it can be concluded that the proportional relationship is closely related to                         the expected \(θ_2\) and has no obvious relationship with the expected \(θ\).
The relationship between the Grayscale value and the reaction time of the liquid to be                     tested
When inspecting the finished product, it is desirable to obtain the shortest test time to                         determine the credibility of the test results.

After verifying that our PCR amplified flanking sequences had the right sequence, we wanted to test them. The flanking sequences were tested by ligating them to a vector backbone, with a Kanamycin resistance insert between the two flanking sequences. The resulting plasmid had the following parts, in order:
Left flank
Kanamycin resistance
Right flank
Backbone
This plasmid was transformed into Synechocystis, and the transformed cells were cultured in BG11 growth medium containing kanamycin. Growth of Synechocystis cells in this medium, along with band shift colony PCR (See figure below), confirmed to us that the plasmid had been successfully taken up and integrated into the host genome through homologous recombination.
We wanted to see if transforming the gene glucose oxidase into Synechocystis would lead to an increased rate of carbon fixation pr. growth rate.
To achieve this we constructed a plasmid with eight parts:
""Right flank"" sequence
Constitutionally active promoter + RBS
LacI repressor gene
Kanamycin resistance
LacI inducible promoter + RBS
Glucose Oxidase
""Left flank"" sequence
Plasmid backbone
As growth in Synechocystis is very slow, we did not have time to test this plasmid, and so it will not be submitted as a composite BioBrick.
Instead, the plasmid was split up into several BioBricks, so that each BioBrick contains one part of the composite plasmid. The BioBricks are as follows:
Right flank (Cloned from Synechocystis)
Left flank (Cloned from Synechocystis)
LacI inducible promoter + Ribosomal Binding Site (Codon optimized for Synechocystis)
Kanamycin resistance gene (Cloned from Synechocystis )
Glucose Oxidase gene (Synthesized by GenScript, codon optimized for Synechocystis.)
Right flank + Kanamycin resistance + Right flank
These BioBricks should provide teams with the means to use Synechocystis as a chassis in future iGEM competitions.
Future efforts
Our candiate gene for increasing CO2 the fixation rate is glucose oxidase, which is not originally present in Synechocystis. This gene encodes the enzyme Glucose Oxidase, which essentially reduces the oxygen concentration inside the cell. RuBisCO, the CO"

In the end, we came to few conclusions :
I. Analysis
After a whole day of investigation, we listed 4 main problems required to be solved before our device hits the market:
1. Cost
Pest traps are actually pretty low at price on the market. If we still use acrylic material, the entire device might not be as economical as we had predicted. Farmers suggested us switching to another kind of material such as PET or PP that are easier to make this device more competitive on the market.
2. Technical Training
The working theory of our device is similar to pheromone traps.However, not every farmer has related experience. It’s necessary to simplify the steps to operate device.
3. Safety of Genetically Modified Products
Although we are not growing GMO, some farmers still can’t hold a positive attitude toward our device since they reluctant to touch anything about gene modifying technique. So it’s not for sure whether our device would be accepted by the market in the future.
4. Efficiency
Wonderful as the idea may seem, our device still has to be more powerful than other pest traps on the market.
II. Achievements
One of the farmers indicated willingness to provide us with the targeted insects. Also many welcome us to test our device efficiency on their farmlands. For them, as long as our device does not contain any hazard pesticide or harm the environment, our project would be another good choice for them to solve pest plague.

Few weeks after the iGEM conference, some researchers of the Seoul National University came to visit us at the NCTU. We delivered a short presentation of our project and showed them our lab settings. As they have not yet established an iGEM team, they appeared intrigued by our demonstrations and were very keen to set up a team next year. Therefore, we made a further introduction of synthetic biology to them, and shared them with our experiences in establishing an iGEM team.

Continued with yeast transformations.  Had optical density readings of 0.259 for W303_1alpha and 0.188 for W303_1a from the overnight cultures.  This corresponds roughly to cell concentrations on the order of 10^7 cells per mL (Note that our Nanodrop seems to report OD values one order of magnitude lower than they actually are, so that ).  One possible reason for this low density was the lack of adenine in the media, which requires the cells to produce their own.  Decided to put all 5 mL of W303_1a into the pre-warmed 50 mL of YPD.  This addition made for roughly 1.3 x 10^8 cells by our estimates, which should account for about half the required cells in the protocol.  This should not matter too greatly seeing as we will be growing them up again during the 4 hour incubation period.  However, low cell count may indicate low transformation efficiency.  The flask used was an Erlenmeyer flask covered with tin foil.  The incubator was set to 210 rpm.

null repressor + Gli1 repressor reporter (Z0411 + Z0510)
Zif268-HIV activator + Zif268-HIV activable reporter (Z0267 + Z0637).
The reason for choosing the first three parts is because they serve as a good point of comparison between parts with the same binding"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,". In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes"

High Fidelity PCR
The dxCas9 coding sequence contains forbidden restriction sites to be RFC compatible. Therefore, Gblocks were ordered at IDT. The dxCas9 is to large to order as one Gblock. Therefore I ordered two Gblocks, also incorporating Linker-Tn5 coding sequences (Gblock 1 and 2). To be able to construct also a different variant of the fusion protein, two Gblocks were ordered in the order Tn5-Linker-dxCas9 (Gblock 3 and 4).
To amplify the Gblocks 3 and 4 as well as the pACYCDuet-1 backbone, high fidelity PCR was done. The template DNA are the Gblocks 1 (primerset 045 & 046) and 2 (primerset 047 & 048) and pACYCDuet-1 (primerset 049 & 050). Additionally, we use the templates Gblocks 3 (primerset 079 & 080) and 4 (primerset 081 & 082) and pACYCDuet-1 (primerset 083 & 084). Multiple 50µL PCR mixtures were prepared, according to the High Fidelity PCR protocol .

Caltech,2008,Team:Caltech#Biosafety_-_-_TEXT.html,"Phage lysogeny can often induce pathogenesis in otherwise harmless species by carrying virulence genes in the phage genome (Vibrio cholerae is a classic example). We can avoid this problem by switching to phage variants which are only lysogenic in our engineered host.
Lactose Intolerance
Synthetic LacY/Z Plasmid: There are no known safety concerns regarding this plasmid. The only foreign enzyme not present in humans that is expressed is β-Galactosidase, which simply acts as a lactase. Several lactase preparations are formally 'Generally Recognized as Safe' by the FDA [2] and we expect no difficulties in finding a suitable lactase.
Lysis Cassette Plasmid: We expect little effect of this plasmid, as there would be a strong selective pressure against lateral transmission. However, bacterial lysis can lead to undesirable side effects as described above.
Vitamin Production
Overexpression of Folate in the Gut: While an excess of folate (Vitamin B9) in the colon would need further testing, the risk of toxicity from overdose is very low, since folate is water-soluble [3] . The tolerable upper intake level for folate is around 1 mg, and many cereals contain 100% of the recommended daily dose [4] .
Folate biosynthesis plasmids: While these plasmids are constitutively high copy, these plasmids produce intermediates for folate, which again, has a very low risk of toxicity.
pABA biosynthesis plasmids para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) is also an intermediate for folate that is commonly used in sunscreen to absorb UV radiation. There are no known serious toxic effects of pABA overdose, though there has also not been extensive testing [5] .
Population Variation
The current constructs are regulatory in nature and present few safety concerns aside from those involved in the treatment subprojects. Minor concerns are discussed below:
In the simple FimE constructs, when the promoter starts in the configuration pointing upstream, DNA upstream of the constructs may be transcribed by the cell.
In the final design, the terminator that sits in the population variation generator may not be 100% efficient. Thus, the efficiency of the terminator should be tested before genes that are hazardous when co-expressed are placed into the system.
The engineered FimE system may interfere with natural fimbriae expression in Nissle 1917 or other gut flora. Since fimbriae are important for intestinal colonization, this could affect the intestinal"

First, we examined our working hypothesis to “Flavorator” that farnesol can show either the antibacterial or bacteriostatic activity in a box like “KOZOKO”. The results clearly showed that farnesol had antibacterial properties. In the literatures, farnesol have antibacterial volatiles. Farnesol is produced after complicated pathways, so for their syntheses, various enzymes are required. In E.coli, farnesol may be synthesized. In this context, we designed our system for establishing the concept of “Flavorator” to build up a brand-new biosynthetic pathways, in which farnesol is produced in the E.coli. In doing so, we transfered the three types of genes listed below to create the hyper-producer E.coli of"

Tartu_TUIT,2018,Team:Tartu TUIT#Human Practices#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," MAAs, so I don't think it is easy (or possible) to predict           individual yields purely on genetics. Trying different substrates is worth a try.
In your opinion, do we need to add some additional compounds to our sunscreens to increase photostability of MAAs. If yes, what compounds we can use?
That is a very tricky one as reports about MAA           stability are not in agreement at the moment. We did some           experiments on it at King's roughly a year ago and our data suggests           that MAAs are highly photostable; this is in agreement with early           reports from different groups and it makes sense from biological           perspective (I would expect selective pressure towards evolution of s           table sunscreen because it doesn't do much if it is unstable). Some of our            collaborators, however, claim the that MAAs are not photo-stable,           so there is convincing evidence for both sides. It might be the effect           of formulation, so I think it is impossible to tell without further testing.           Personally I tend to be on the 'MAAs are photostable' side, but assuming           stability is a problem, playing with solvents (formulation for human           application will probably involve some combination of oils and water plus           maybe tiny bit of ethanol; most of lab testing is done in methanol + water,            so results might be misleading). Adding antioxidants might help as well - ascorbic acid            is good one to try. Photostability aside, water solubility of MAAs is a major problem            for use of MAAs as sunscreens - MAAs readily dissolve in water and that is major           problem for sunscreen. Animals get around the problem by concentrating them inside           tissues, but compound which gets inside the skin will almost certainly never get approved            for human use (due to safety concerns; this is another problem for practical use of            MAAs - they do seem to go into the skin). Clever formulation might be able to solve           these problems - perhaps encapsulation of MAAs in liposomes or some other type of            carrier or perhaps use of MAAs with better properties. Unfortunately I don't do any            formulation work, so can't help much there.
How do you think, is the combination of Shinorine and Porphyra-334 reasonable for sunscreens?
Ideally you would want to mix MAAs with very different absorbance maxima (high wavelength absorbing MAA such as Palythene or Euthalothece with low maxima absorbing such as Palythine); Shinorine and Porphyra have virtually"

I looked at the protein database sequence of the protein cage and brainstormed sites that were void of any secondary structure. From here the different sites were visualized on Pymol to check for any steric hindrance that might not allow for the ligation to happen.

Our Tetracycline biosensor can detect the tetracycline residues in agricultural products (such as: meat, eggs, milk, etc.). By using the approach of synthetic biology, our Tetracycline biosensor provides a new way to detect tetracycline. Click here to see the complete achievement.
Background
Currently, the overuse of antibiotics has not been effectively regulated in China. A survey from 4152 Internet users of 31 provinces and autonomous regions in China shows that 74% investigation families have been or have equipped with antibiotics. Moreover, the application rate of antibiotics in hospitalized patients is 80% in China, far more than the international standards (30%).
Many problem stems are from overuse and misuse of antimicrobial agents in human medicine, however, large-scale use of antimicrobials in agriculture also contributes to the crisis. For treatment, prevention of diseases and the need of promoting animal growth, some of the farmers use antibiotics extensively which cause the rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Yonghong Xiao, professor of Clinical Pharmacology Research Institute of Peking University, pointed out that the annual production of raw materials antibiotics close to 210,000 tons, while 97,000 tons antibiotics is used in livestock breeding industry, which accounted for 46.1% of the total production.
Motivation and Innovation
The misuse of antibiotics is endangering human health and ecological balance. In terms of medicine use, we can develop standards to use antibiotics reasonably. But agricultural uses of antibiotics produce environmental exposures in a variety of reservoirs, which are impossible to be guarded against. Our group hopes to use synthetic biology method to provide a simple, reliable and efficient method for detecting the antibiotics.
After investigation, we choose tetracycline as the research object because of its extensive existence in animal husbandry. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics of tetracycline class may make these drugs residues in edible animal, which will cause a damage in human liver, kidney and digestive tract. A long-term residue will also make the bacteria microbial tolerance, which may cause a double infection.
Whereas，Currently antibiotics (including tetracycline) detection methods are more complex. Not only the instruments"

Safety Questions
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety,
public safety, or
environmental safety?
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry?
Answers to Questions
None of our project ideas or materials raise safety issues since we did not use any biological materials, only proof-of-principle colored dyes to demonstrate that the robot works. In the future, this would change since DNA and possibly cells would be used. There is a biosafety group at our university, but since we only used Lego parts and other non-biological materials, safety was not an issue.

Tsinghua,2012,Team:Tsinghua#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"  result and share it with each other . Together , we debugged and modified our  report . Finally , we finished a wonderful report including the background ,  significance, experiment design of the project .
Select project
After the spring holiday ,we hold a meeting for each group to present their idea . Considering the opinion of the students’ and the guide-teachers’ , we whittle down all ideas to there that got  most votes. Some people can’t persist any longer, so they quit midway.  After four projects was left , we divided left team member to four big groups .Each group did a detailed project plan .,containing primary experiment design . Then ,together, we vote to value each project . Finally ,we decided a final project.
Week 11
It’s the first week of new term , we all had  kind of sundries to deal with . So we did nothing this week .
Week 12
We hold a meeting to decide our final project  . We invited all instruct teachers and advisers to the meeting . First each  team was given 20 minutes to present their idea and 10 minutes to reply  questions . Then ,the teacher comment on every project . At last ,we voted for  the most interesting project .
Week 13
We calculated the voting result and published  the result .
Week 14
Considering the lab space and funds , we can’t  all participate iGEM ,so the team leader talked to everyone to decided who can  stay in the team . it cost one week to decide the team numbers.
Design wet experiment
Since the topic is decided , we start to design wet experiment . First ,we design different models and parts. Then we referred to iGEM kit and different paper to see what we already have and what need to do . After that ,we consult the lab manager to see what we can do . According to the condition ,we altered our design .     preliminary experiment
To test if our design is feasible or not ,we did some preliminary experiment ,which increased our confidence . We decided to continue our designed wet experiment .
Week 15 to  week 18
During the four weeks , we designed the  detailed experiment such as the part ,plasmid ,primer and so on . Then we referred to iGEM kit and different paper  to see what we already have and what need to do . After that ,we consult the  lab manager to see what we can do . According to the condition ,we altered our  design again and again .

Genome editing--adding Pahp ahead of gltAB and adding a terminater ahead of Pahp to eliminate the effect of intrinsic"
Tsinghua,2011,Team:Tsinghua#modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," no accumulation of cells can be seen. Rather, only a small increase in the concentration of bacteria on the right seems visible in this simulation.
Our experimental results verified this point, as no obvious enrichment of bacteria can be seen in the media. However, when we measure OD600 of the two ends of our tubes, we did observe a significant difference.
Alternative thinking
What if E. Coli ""knows"" the direction of gradient and arbitrarily migrates towards the place with higher attractant concentration?
Tsinghua-A Team helped us built this model. In this model, they assume that each cell has the equal probability of swimming or tumbling, but the direction it finally chooses will be subject to normal distribution with the mean value towards the higher concentration.
The simulation is obviously distinct from the experimental results. When all the cells start from the same point and move in a gradient, a circle not an eclipse is formed.
Simulated E. Coli movement after 500 steps. The blue circle shows the approximate shape of colony formed.
Furthermore, when cells are uniformly distributed in the solution at the beginning, they will migrate towards the target and accumulate at the other end.
Simulate movement in liquid. A total of 100,000 cells are evenly distributed at the beginning. The figures show the distribution after 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 steps. An obvious accumulation can be seen in this simulation, but not in our experiments. Cells which reach the end of the region in the simulation are forced to take a direction at random. All the cells which reach the end at least once is counted.
The cells which reach the end for at least once are counted and listed in the table below.

Although accumulation of cells is obvious, the actual number of cells which reach the end decrease compared to the previous model.
This set of results are what most people hope to see, but untrue. It's critical to be objective and rational during modeling, or the result might come out weird.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," without (Figure 31a). However, when the same experiments were repeated with SAHS 33020 instead (Figure 31b), Cas13a remained active after being dried and rehydrated, and the fluorescence intensity observed in the presence of the target and crRNA was clearly higher than in its absence. This indicates that SAHS 33020 can preserve Cas13a activity after desiccation and rehydration, thus keeping the protein functional and opening the possibility of the storage of Cas13a with TDPs.
In view of the unexpected results observed for CAHS94205 and the fact that iGEM  Munich 2017 was also working with Cas13a and similar fluorescence assays, we sent them a newly purified batch of CAHS 94205, to determine whether the same phenomenon would be observed in experiments under the same conditions (see Figure 32).
Figure 32: Cas13a activity with CAHS 94205 in RNase Alert Assay by iGEM  Munich 2017 . Fluorescence intensities over time triggered by RNase activity of Cas13a after drying with the TDP CAHS 94205, with and without crRNA and target RNA. Data from iGEM Munich 2017 .
The results of iGEM Munich 2017 also showed the unexpected RNase activity of Cas13a. We therefore hypothesize, that the conformational change in Cas13a, normally caused by the binding of the crRNA with the target, is induced as a result of an interaction between CAHS 94205 and Cas13a upon drying and resuspension. Consequently, CAHS 94205 was ruled out as a potential desiccation tolerance mediator for Cas13a.
Conclusions
After receiving gene fragments for the four chosen TDPs and promoters, we assembled the fragments into a pSB1C3 backbone with the T7 promoter and transformed the resulting plasmids into the protein expression strain BL21(DE3). Their successful production was confirmed by both SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry.
From the different drying assays we performed, it was concluded that LDH activity was remarkably well preserved after 18 days in the samples containing LDH dried with SAHS 33020. Furthermore, we discovered that while both CAHS 94205 and SAHS 33020 preserved Cas13a’s RNase-like activity after drying, CAHS 94205 could not preserve its specificity; Cas13a dried with the latter CAHS showed RNase activity even in the absence of the target RNA. This was corroborated by iGEM Munich "
Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#test bild_-_-_TEXT.html," affinity to the molecule of interest will be selected. Sequencing the genetic information of these phages has allowed us to construct multiple peptide suggestions that may bind to our nematodes’ surface proteins.  This would allow the biosensor to aggregate at the detection sites and create a stronger signal.
In our project, phage display has been used in a whole new way. Performing phage display on a whole organism is an unconventional and unpublished procedure. By creating a working protocol for the purpose of finding a specific binder for strongyles we have applied this Nobel-prize winning method in a new way.
Figure 4: Flowchart representing the phage display outline.
3. Reporter System
After receiving the results from either the transcriptomics or the phage display, they need to be combined with a reported to get a functioning diagnostic tool (Worm Buster).  We have adapted and troubleshot the expression of a fluorescent chromoprotein, UnaG, to be able to detect our worms in both the intestines and in feces. This would enable a relatively simple and quantitative way for ranchers to detect the worms of interest, using a cheap UV lamp, a dark room, and a camera!
In order to make this a viable reporter system, we wanted to make sure the original biobrick part was functional.  We show how we tweaked this part in order to study if it works properly so that it could be potentially used in future studies.
Figure 5: We would be able to detect the wormd in feces with this method.
4. Modeling
Optimization of the Time Between Treatments
To make sure the unnecessary use of anthelmintics is minimized we have created a model that compares regular and optimized usage of anthelmintics. When referring to the optimized use of anthelmintics, this means that the horse only receives treatment when the amount of parasites exceeds a certain threshold. Our model calculates given the initial amount of worms on the pasture and in the horse. Ideally, the information could be used with the worm buster to get a better overall result of our project. Our solution will not only be able to tell how large the treatments should be but also when they should be administered. This would guarantee the lowest amount of anthelmintics usage, and hopefully help combat the issue of growing resistance. Due to this fact, our model constitutes a large improvement on the potential implementation of our project since it directly brings us closer to our ultimate goal, which is the decrease in resistance development and the improved physical health of horses.

MODELING: INTRODUCTION
How many times have you gone to do something, put your heart and soul into it and then found out it hasn't worked? Your hours of laborious effort turned all for nothing? Us too and this year, we set out to avoid this very dilemma, or at least to try and minimize its effects on our project.
The modeling process was used to gain an understanding of what we expected from the wet lab work. The principle behind design was to troubleshoot and optimize the engineered components through simulations to identify mistakes within the theoretical space before using time and resources in the lab.
This preliminary design can be divided into two components: modeling a circular AFP and scaffold design.
MODELING A CIRCULAR AFP
Icefinity
Figure 1. Crystal structure of the Type III Ocean Pout.This protein is represented by the PDB file 1AME. The distance between the two termini was found using Pymol 1.
After research different antifreeze proteins, we decided to work with Type III AFP, from the ocean pout. Relatively active in antifreeeze activity, it serves as an ideal AFP for use in industrial purposes. Furthermore, its termini are only 19.8 angstroms apart, making it easier to circularize using a smaller linker (Figure 1).
The modeling process for the circularization of an antifreeze protein can be explained by a three-step approach to protein design (seen below).
Linker Design & Spatial Fitting
Approach 1: The idea for this project was meant to be a continuation of the work of team Heidelberg 2014 and validation of their parts. Using their intein BioBrick we wanted to circularize our own protein, a Type III AFP. Using the CRAUT software , we ran our protein through the program. After fixing syntax errors, the following linkers were suggested:
Sequence 1:GGAEAAAKAARGKCWE
Sequence 2:GGXXX RGKCWE
The sequences in red represent the extein sequences (scars that will be left after the intein reaction), and the sequences in purple represent a secondary structure (alpha-helix). Preliminary spatial evaluation using PyMOL suggested these were not ideal for linking the termini of our protein of interest. For the purpose of progression, we adapted"

Plasmid construction
The following plasmids were constructed mainly during summer/autumn 2016.
Key sequence in pDR111
The key sequence was ordered as a gBlock from IDT to construct the key B.   subtilis strain. In a first approach this was done with the pDR111 B.   subtilis integration plasmid, which can also be amplified by E. coli.   Therefore the first step was to clone the key sequence into the pDR111 in E. coli. pDR111 is an integration plasmid which can be integrated into the B. subtilis genome.   It replaces amyE gene by double cross-over, which is necessary for production of alpha-amylase   (see Subtiwiki.uni-goettingen.de )       with desired insert which is located between amyE front flanking region and amyE back flanking region. See the plasmid map below. We used this plasmid for integration of our key sequence into the B. subtilis 168 sub+. The other approach made use of the BioBrick integration plasmid BBa_K823023 (Key sequence in BBa_K823023) .
PCR
Experiment:
31/08/16: Amplification of the key sequence from the gBlock from IDT (see gBlocks protocol) with the primers F key only amplify and R key only amplify (see primer list) was done. The correct size of the     key PCR product of 144 bp was checked with DNA electrophoresis.
PCR mixture:
50 μl PCR assay was performed according to the following protocol .
DNA Electrophoresis:
For detailed information on how to prepare and run agarose gels see    following protocol .
Figure 1. DNA electrophoresis of the key PCR product     sample 1-3. The correct size is 144 bp.
Conclusion:
PCR of the key sequence from the IDT gBlock was successful. We could see the correct band size which was 144 bp.
Procedure after gel validation:
PCR product was subsequently cleaned with the kit (PCR Purification Kit – Jena Bioscience) .

We believe that collaborations between iGEM teams should be encouraged. Firstly, this strengthens the reliability of the registry, since the more evaluations and characterisation the BioBrick has, the more reliable and applicable it is. Secondly, such collaborations allow for an exchange of ideas, giving us the insight and opportunity to learn from alternative culturing and characterisation techniques of other groups. Finally, this collaboration has allowed us to build links between the two universities.
German Modelling Collaborations
LMU Munich: Modelling Workshop
LMU Munich invited us to the CAS Conference on Synthetic Biology at their beautiful campus outside of Munich city centre.   We met up with the team after the conference had ended and spent a morning going through their project and looking at areas where modelling would be most helpful to their project.  Ideas we came up with included using software e.g. COBRA to model the effect of gene knockouts on their systems, and using software called FPMOD to look at possible rotations of GFP.  We also gave a short presentation to act as an introduction to biological modelling, covering MATLAB, ODEs, Kappa and CellDesigner.
TU Darmstadt: Ocean Model
We chatted with their modeller Henrick about how we could improve our ocean model, as he is working on similar models related to fluid motion and dynamics. He proposed a couple of different approaches and suggested some software, YASARA, that would be helpful to us.

We had the opportunity to visit Paris where we kindly hosted by Claire Mayer from iGEM Paris Bettencourt team. Philipp was invited as a judge for their debate on the environmental release of genetically modified bacteria . During our two days in Paris, we attended a DIY class for the CRI undergraduate students, which we found very pertinent to our collaboration with the London Hackspace. We also had the chance to brainstorm with the iGEM team a number of potential future projects for our partnership with the Hackspace - one of our favourites was the idea of evolving bacterial art.
Plastic Republic Speed Debate
In August, we hosted an evening of speed debating to deliberate the question “Should synthetic organisms be released in the ocean to combat plastic pollution?”. We targeted the interest in our project to achieve a bottom-up collection of ideas to feed back into our work.

We then discovered that typhoid fever has very similar symptoms to malaria such as high fever, headache, stomach pain, and loss of appetite and is often confused in diagnosis due to lack of lab resources and high rates of co-infection.  Due to regular cases of this co-infection of malaria and typhoid fever, patients are often given antimalarial drugs with antibiotics to treat the typhoid fever.  This presents two issues of both increasing unnecessary economic costs as well as the issue of antibiotic resistant bacteria.  If lab resources are not available, physicians often diagnose based on clinical symptoms and the location the patient is coming from. Additionally we discussed the existing diagnostic technologies  and both the economic aspects of the device as well as the accuracy of implementation.  A rapid diagnostic tests for malaria cost less than $1,  and in order to ensure economic success of mass production of a diagnostic device for another infectious disease, it is incredibly important to factor in cost.  The device needs to be able to withstand room temperature as freezers  and other lab conditions for storage might be unavailable.   This device needs to be robust and able to withstand transport and storage before the test itself is administered.  The time it takes to administer the test and receive in a result was advised to be approximately an hour for multiple diseases.  Although the potential for overnight diagnosis for multiple diseases would be useful,  Dr. Bayih presented the scenario in which immediate decisions must be made without time for any test to be administered.  Dr. Bayih was very receptive and enthusiastic regarding the idea of having an inexpensive version of the diagnostic test for home-use, field use, and for use in the hospitals with no lab equipment available as well as a digitalized more expensive version for the hospitals with available lab equipment .  This meeting confirmed that the issue of misdiagnosis combined with overdiagnosis are a pressing issue in developing countries and  multi diagnostic device with different cost models would be extremely useful and provide early diagnosis reducing the mortality rate for these diseases.  We continued to research statistics regarding misdiagnosis and finalize our target diseases for the project. Infectious diseases such as typhoid, malaria and meningitis are commonly misdiagnosed due to overlap in clinical manifestations. A recent study done in Tanzania examined the hospitalization of 500 children with fever. 62% of the patients were treated for Malaria, while only 2% were actually tested positive (D"

Deeper look at ProteinGAN
Introducton
After seeing multiple successful applications of GAN (generative adversarial networks) in numerous of fields, we have decided to apply them to the field of synthetic biology for the creation of novel biological parts with useful functions. More specifically, we were interest in world’s cleanest and environmentally friendly catalyzers - enzymes. For many important reactions used in research or industry we don’t have the appropriate enzymes to catalyze them, and have not other option but to use chemical catalyzers.
Thus, we have decided to build the world’s first Protein sequence Generative Adversarial Network (ProteinGAN) which would be capable to learn “what makes protein a protein”. We have started by acquiring and standardizing large number of protein sequences from public databases, which all had a specific class attributed to them.
After in-depth literature analysis and a large number of in-silico prototypes we have built the appropriate GAN architecture for protein work. Finally - we have trained the neural networks with specific classes of enzymes. We have hoped they would learn how to generate the class of enzymes they were trained for, yet also deliver unique protein sequences for that class.
All important technical details, architectural choices and detailed explanation of how ProteinGAN works can be found at the end of the page.
In addition to that, we also provided a short guide on how to build and train your own ProteinGAN !
Gathering the Protein Sequence data
As an initial sequence database we used the full (reviewed + unreviewed) UniProtKB database. We selected the sequences which had a full EC number associated and filtered out the sequences which had been known to form heteromeric complexes. The resulting dataset was relatively sparse for our purpose, therefore we decided to upsample using the NCBI RefSeq non-redundant protein database ("

Directivity
All the four constructed graphs build for BioGuide are directed graphs.     So that, for every edge there must be a single source and a target.     There is no single edge which is bidirectional. In mathematical form     this can be represented as:
If an edge e has node v as source and node w as target then the edge     can be expressed as
For a directed graph the combination (v, w) is totally different     from (w, v). Therefore,
The direction of the edges has been represented with the arrows,     as explained in Figure 2.
Connectivity
The nodes forming their own sub-graphs disconnected from the rest     of the nodes have been recognized, which showed us the presence of incompatibility     between few regulators and promoters of the devices. We have observed     this disconnection in all four of our graphs. The basis of the disconnection     has been shown in Figure 3, where the two sub-graphs without any edge     that connects them to the main graph has been presented on the right     hand side of the diagram. These features classify our graphs as disconnected     graphs [1].
Fig. 3: A zoomed in screenshot showing two sub-graphs within     the disconnected graph.
""Semi-Simplicity""
A simple graph is a graph in which no more than one edge contains     the same set of nodes. So, in a simple graph it is not possible to find     more than one edge with the same source and the same target. Additionally,     an edge with the same source and target, forming a loop is not allowed.     But, in synthetic biology it is possible to construct a device consisting     of devices or bio bricks of the same species or type. Accordingly, our     graphs are simple graphs with an exception of possible self-containing     loops, where the edge starts from and ends on the same node. Our graphs     have an exception of having loops and due to this permitted flexibility     our graphs are ""semi-simple"".

About iGEM Lighters!
As a social focus of our project, we did an effort to create a community of all the iGEM teams working with light induction systems.
In order to make communication and cooperation between teams easier, we created a Facebook group. It was called ""iGEM Lighters"" , and by this media we invited all the ""light-teams"" to join us.
The contacted teams that became part of the ""iGEM Lighters"" community were: Freiburg , Uppsala , Cornell , McGill and Uppen , with whom contact was maintained during the summer.
We believe this was a great way of collaboration, as well as a good example to others teams that may inspire them to create networks with common objectives. The same way, this was an opportunity for us to be known by researchers that could help us out with some of our doubts and problems; such as Dr. Jeff Tabor (well known by most of you, pioneer on this matters), who was aware there were several teams working with light induction and had always been pleased to help us.
