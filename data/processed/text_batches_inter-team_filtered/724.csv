Hong_Kong_HKU,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#human practice#safety and ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," to handle environmental problems for which the later generation will try hard to further work on.”
On the question of ethical questionability of synthetic biology, Prof. Lam explained that it depends on how we discern ethical from unethical. If, being ethical meant bringing “good for the people” or to “help people,” then synthetic biology can be deemed ethical, he conveyed. However, he also acknowledged that some people would disagree and express the view that genetic manipulation is against the way God has created all living things. Then Prof. Lam wittily suggested that synthetic biologists “just make use of the gene that is created by God”. However, we cannot play deaf to questions concerning the actual impacts of synthetic biology: ultimately, does the good outweigh the bad? Additionally, he has enlightened us that the nature of science, especially the new fields in science inevitably carries risks, but we “should not stop any new science merely because of risks.” He carried on to introduce some regulation measures with handling biological materials, which naturally flowed into our next question.
An important part of iGEM is to recognize the potential dangers of laboratory work and that of synthetic biology. Prof. Lam emphasized that regulation measures are important to ensure that the entire procedures is kept under control, and that minimizing the negative impact is also a part of science. He mentioned the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as the universal guidelines for all research labs to follow.
We further extended our discussion to some of the concepts, applications and safety issues regarding our main project. He emphasized that we should consider issues of how the core mechanism of our project can be distinct or superior from the existing technologies.  He also provided professional opinion regarding the daily application of the project. He suggested some alternatives to the application aspect, which is to use a small bottle or a container with agar that contains the culture of engineered bacteria. The saliva from the potential patients is then inserted into the bottle to give either positive or negative results.
If it is decided that the project were to be used for charity purposes, Prof. Lam told us to consider how the targeted users would treat the manufactured device. Our targeted patients are those in the undeveloped countries in the world such as Africa, and where Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.P.) infection is more widespread. The lack of sanitization and the lack of knowledge on how use the kit and how to dispose of the finished product in the targeted area could potentially trigger infection from our own diagnosis kit once it has been used.

The team appreciated our recommendation and focused their lab work more on the COD. We were especially curious how they would solve the inclusion body problem and many other issues we had encountered the year prior.
It was a great pleasure to collaborate with iGEM Stuttgart and we hope we were able to help them with their project.
iGEM Marburg
This year, the iGEM team of Marburg tries to establish the organism Vibrio natriegens as a new biological chassis for the iGEM community. They reached out to various other teams in an effort to standardize V. natriegens for labs all around the world.
In context of standardization of V. natriegens we repeated the InterLab study for iGEM Marburg with V. natriegens as chassis.
Here, cultures of the transformed V. natriegens showed decreased growth rates upon induction of protein synthesis but no fluorescence could be detected. Decreased growth rates indicate metabolic stress probably caused by protein synthesis. However, since no fluorescence could be detected no matured functional fluorogenic protein were built.
Yet, the organism shows many interesting features. We were especially fascinated by their incredibly fast growth rate of V. natriegens revealing a great opportunity for scientists to save time and work more efficiently.
It was a pleasure to work with this novel organism and share our obtained data. We were thankful for the opportunity to try out a new powerful organism and we are very interested in implementing V. natriegens in our everyday laboratory life.
iGEM NCHU Taichung
Yu-Hsuan from the iGEM team NCHU Taichung contacted us in June. She was in Darmstadt for a semester abroad. For her team it is the first year participating in the iGEM competition. Thus, we arranged a meeting to exchange project ideas and share our experiences over the years. Since our team was inspired to restructure after visiting iGEM Stockholm last year, we wanted to pass on our experiences on how to organize a team, how to choose a project and lots of other important structures they should be aware of.
During Yu-Hsuan’s visit we talked about how we run our laboratory and which positions we have, e.g. our lab leader, who mainly organizes the lab and takes care of the orders, and our lab group leaders. The lab group leaders in turn are the ones who organize four to five members and work together"

Description
This part is composed by J23100-B0034-β-glucosidase-B0015. When this part is expressed in bacteria, they become able to metabolize cellobiose converting it in two molecules of glucose.
This part is an improvement of part BBa_K392008 that was used by UNITS_Trieste 2011 Team.
Assembly
This composite part is developed from previous work by UNITS iGEM team 2011 and Edinburgh team 2011. They discovered that BBa_K392008 (Osaka 2010), coding for a Cellumonas fimi β-glucosidase, possess an apparent frameshift near the start of the coding sequence. The coding sequence has now been determined to start from an ATG located 220 bp downstream of the reported one. We therefore decided to correct the Bba_K392008 in order to have the correct coding sequence. In order to do this we made a PCR on Bba_K392008 by using the following primers:
β-Glucosidase_Fw
GCATGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGATGACCACCACGCGCCCCTC
β-Glucosidase_Rev
GCATCTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTATCAGGGCTGGTAGGTCGCGG
Results
The new Cellulomonas fimi β-Glucosidase was sequenced and then assembled in a transcriptional unit together with J23100, B0034 and B0015.
E.coli cells expressing the β-Glucosidase were able to grow in M9 minimal medium supplemented with cellobiose 1% as the only C source while E.coli without this composite part are not able to grow.

Week 6 (21st of August - 27th of August)
Miniprepped and transformed ⅔ of all constructs to Rosetta strain. Sequencing original template, compared it to sequence of constructs, looked okay, mutations were already there. Re-made the ISG75 construct in DH5a, because if failed the first times, succeeded this time.
September
Week 7 (28th of August - 3rd of September)
Sequenced the ISG75 construct and original template, looked shitty so decided to drop that one.  Miniprep and PCR - checked the other two constructs that were transformed into Rosetta.  Tested protein expression (induction of promoter, and if the protein is soluble).
Week 8 (4th of September - 10th of September)
Checked protein expression on SDS, looked fine. Scaled up and did the protein expression and purification protocol.
Week 9 (11th of September - 17th of September)
Checked the purification with Nanodrop, ran it on a SDS-gel and did the protein quantitation assay. Expression of rISG65 seemed very low, checked the construct by sequencing to make sure there is no error in the sequence. Sequence looked fine. Ordered primers for BioBrick formation.
Week 10 (18th of September - 24th of September)
Started to make biobricks from my sequences. Did PCR to add the prefix and suffix to my insert, and cloned it into the linearized pSB1C3 backbone. Ligation was checked on gel. Colonies were checked with cPCR.
October
Week 11 (25th of September - 1st of October)
Colonies that looked fine on cPCR were grown overnight, miniprepped and sent for sequencing. The sequence was correct, hence I finished making the BioBricks.
Week 12 (2nd of October - 8th of October)
Performed the serum experiment to demonstrate that E. coli cells can survive in (horse) serum. Also started testing the BioBricks of TUDelft  by transforming it to competent BL21(DE3).
Week 13 (9th of October - 15th of October)
Finished testing the BioBricks from TUDelft. Did another batch of ISG64 protein expression and purification. This time, the cell lysate was incubated together with the beads for one hour, and only part of the beads were eluted. The rest was stored at 4 degrees for later use.

They were left in the incubator at 37 C overnight.      6/18/14: (Devora)  We started by looking at the HSP+pACYC184 plates and the pUC19 control plates that we made using the DH5Alpha I and DH5Alpha II cells. There were weird colonies on the DH5Alpha I plate that had the HSP+pACYC184 and 4 colonies on the plate with pUC19 and DH5Alpha II. The other two had no colonies and were left in the incubator.  We also re-ligated the HSP+pACYC184 with Dionne's method of combining all of the usual ingredients in the usual amount but instead of ligating overnight at 16 C we ligated for an hour at room temperature (left it on the bench).  We transformed that ligation following the transformation protocol except that we heat shocked for 50 sec as opposed to 40 sec and put on on a chlor 150 plate and in the incubator.   We then looked at the eight plates that were streaked yesterday: DH5alpha control, DH5alpha UV shocked, UV+pACYC184 control, UV+pACYC184 UV shocked, GFP+pBR322 control, GFP+pBR322 UV shocked, UV/GFP+pACYC184/pBR322 control (3 colonies), UV/GFP+pACYC184/pBR322 UV shocked (3 colonies). We took 500uL of PBS and added some cells from each plate/colony to the PBS. This was vortexed, centrifuged, liquid was taken out, 500uL PBS added, and vortexed. Then, we put 200uL in the plate reader and measured fluorescence and concentration. Normalized fluorescence was calculated. See ""GFP Fluorescence Reading on the co-transformed plates #3"" for results. BASICALLY, WE ROCK!!!!  As another way of checking that everything was working as we planned in our system, we had sent our primered G-blocks from within the plasmids that we ligated them into to Genewiz to get in sequenced.

You may think that synthetic biology has no resemblance with neurobiology but i love how synthetic biology works. I was amazed when i hear some projects from previous years like Stanford’s “Hell Cell” or Kyoto’s “Emerging The Titanic”. Thinking outside the box and applying these thoughts on real life world is amazing. As i said, synthetic biology is fun. Maybe one day, we can make synthetic neurological pathways, neuron cell networks or an entire brain. On that day, the resemblance will be unraveled.
Sibel Karaman: Hi, I’m Sibel, my third year in department of Molecular Biology and Genetics in ITU and as my team mates, my first year in iGEM team. In our team, I take part in wet lab. In my opinion, it is important to learn the experimental fields in molecular biology. iGEM provides the opportunity to get experience in molecular biology. It is a good feeling that being part of a team and studying together, so, I learn as well as have fun in the laboratory. And finally, I think iGEM provides me a big opportunity to have sufficient experience on synthetic biology.

Aim: In this experiment we wanted to validate our synthetic engineered system that should induce apoptotic death by the activation of the synthetic minimal adenovirus major late promoter (pMLPm) via dCas9-VP64-gRNA complex.
Importance: In our project, one of our goals is to engineera dCas9-VP64-gRNA system that could activate the pMLPm promoter to induce apoptotic death by the expression of exogenous reverse caspas3. Since we are using staphylococcus aureus dCas9-VP64-gRNA, we made changes in the pMLPm Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM), hence we had to verify pMLPm regulating activity trough the expression of the mCherry fluorophore. We would also like to verify the programmed apoptosis of the exogenous reverse caspas3 that is used in our project.
Theoretical background:
The synthetic promoter minimal adenovirus major late promoter (pMLPm) contains three repetitions of the ""a1"" sequence, which is complementary to the gRNA sequence, enabling dCas9-VP64-gRNA complex to target the pMLPm synthetic promoter1. When the transcription factor VP64 (an engineered tetramer of the herpes simplex  virus VP16 transcriptional activator domain)  is fused to dCas9 enzyme it can be guided to a specific location in the genome, in this manner we can exploit it to promote downstream translation2.
The dCas9-VP64-gRNA complex will target the pMLPm synthetic promoter and promote the expression of exogenous reverse caspase3, that in contrast to the endogenous caspas3 will be activated after transcription due to its autocatalytic processing, meaning this enzyme will trigger an apoptotic signal that will lead to apoptotic death  (caspase3 is responsible for chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation)3.
mCherry reporter protein is also expressed by the pMLPm promoter, it is fused to the exogenous reverse caspase3 with Thoseaasigna virus 2A (T2A) peptide that is cleaved during translation4.
In order to activate pMLPm promoter and to induce apoptotic death we used 2 plasmids:
Lenti-viral plasmid: CMV dCas9 VP64 – in this plasmid the CMV promoter regulates the expression of dCas9 enzyme which is fused to the transcription factor VP64.
pSynt CMV – in this plasmid"

Took out culture plates at 2:35 PM, after about 16 hours.
All plates have good colonies but the (-) control!  Hard to distinguish between the positive control that had been microwaved and the one that had not, but both seemed to yield a high density of cells.  Decided to put them into fridge until later tonight, when we will innoculate colonies from these plates for use in glycerol stocks and, if we have enough media, minipreps.
Making LB:
10.0082g + 10.0074g  Lennox Base
1 L water
Making ampicillin stock solution:
Collected information about ampicillin - Typical concentrations of ampicillin are 50 ug/mL for low copy plasmids and 100 ug/mL for high copy plasmids.  Stock solutions are usually in 100 mg/mL.  Ampicillin will last about 4-6 months or 1 year (according to different sources) when stored in dH2O at -20 degrees C.  It will only last about 3 days at 37 degrees C.   We will begin to use 100 mg of ampicillin per liter of LB, as opposed to what we used in the past, which was only 10 mg per L.  Our concentration for plates was already 100 mg/L, so this will remain unchanged.
1.0001g of ampicillin dissolved in 10 mL.  This yields a concentration of approximately 100 mg/mL.  Solution was extremely frothy and difficult to manage, so we attempted to continue dissolving into 100 mL instead.  However, this also resulted in a fair amount of undissolved ampicillin.  Read online that sometimes with ampicillin trihydrate powder it is easier to dissolve if one adds 10 M NaOH to the solution.  We had 5 N NaOH, so we added 20 uL.  This appeared to work, so we added an additional 80 uL.  The mixture was a little cloudy still, so we decided to simply add powdered ampicillin to some of the freshly autoclaved LB.  This should work for a while until we get our stock solution.
Note that the transformation protocol from the Silver Lab indicates a minimum DNA concentration of 250 ng/u"

How do You evaluate the complexity of the iGEM competition (financial support, organisation, and public relations)?
iGEM teams have more or less to act like a biotech start up company which has to develop and to market their own development to finance their challenging activities and thereby establishing their organization, public relations and fundraising. The complexity of the iGEM competition and the limited time for idea development makes iGEM a highly complex and challenging endeavor.
What do You think about this years iGEM team Aachen and its project ideas?
In one word: GREAT. Light switchable proteins are a very promising and challenging topic in biotechnology and in material science and will emerge in the future as a hot topic in national research agenda on bioeconomy in Germany.
Please name three terms that describe the iGEM teams in Aachen and their work?
The three terms that come directly to my mind to describe RWTH’s iGEM team Aachen are “international”, ”interdisciplinary” and ” innovative” (triple i work).
Could You please tell us something about the previous work of the iGEM teams in Aachen?
The past two iGEM teams from Aachen were SENSATIONAL. They won several gold medals and awards as best newcomers. I am very proud of our students!
How do You feel to be a part of the iGEM team Aachen 2016?
It is fun to discuss with them and it is my pleasure to support these excellent young scientists with experience/infrastructure and to see them to grow with their challenges and success.
Interview with Our Supervisor Prof. Blank
How do You evaluate the iGEM competition in general and the influence which the former iGEM teams from Aachen had?
The iGEM competition allows self-organized research. The aspect of bringing engineering into biology is fitting very well to the RWTH Aachen University and the Jülich Research Center. The three teams competing as the iGEM teams Aachen paved the way for synthetic biology at RWTH Aachen.
How do You think: Can iGEM support the education of the students?
iGEM can support the education because the students work self-motivated. Moreover the concept of research-based teaching intensifies the teaching experience. That the newest synthetic biology technologies can be applied is lifting the teaching in Aachen on a different level.. After their iGEM time many members have accelerate expertise and working skills. For sure, the softskills were practiced, working in a group of about 15 people. Students have the chance to develop new skills,"

Collaborations
Team TJUSLS_China
As a team with relatively insufficient experience, we have been actively seeking collaboration with other iGEM teams to discuss our projects and learn from their experience. Particularly, we have worked in close cooperation with iGEM 2015 Gold Medal team TJUSLS_China. Team TJUSLS_China is an iGEM team from College of Life Science, Tianjin University and it has been a team with outstanding performance They won one single gold award and two single nominations last year. Moreover, the campus of Tianjin University is adjacent to the campus of Nankai University, which made TJUSLS_China the team that we had the closest cooperation with.
During this summer, we had several meetings to discuss our projects and share the problems that we had encountered. We had learnt a lot from each of those meetings and we believe that the projects of both parties have been promoted through the enthusiastic discussions.
Meanwhile, we have provided them with fluorescence microscopy as well as necessary training and instructions according to the requirements of their experiment. They obtained delicate pictures and further confirmed their results using the microscopy that we provided.
Team Tianjin
iGEM team Tianjin comes from School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University. Their project this year aims to solve the problem of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) pollution using biodegradation method by express an enzyme that is capable of efficiently degrade PET in various species of model microorganisms. Besides Escherichia coli and yeast, they also asked as for strains of Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and corresponding expression vectors, expecting to express the PET degradation enzyme in more chassis organisms. We provided the strains and materials they asked for as well as necessary instructions.
Team HFUT-China & SJTU_China
This year, we also helped iGEM Teams HFUT-China and SJTU_China test their software.                 Team HFUT-China designed a piece of software used for construction of synthetic biology devices and analysis of gene relationship. The functions of this software are relatively simple yet practical. However, we have still discovered some obvious bugs by actually using this software. For example, the scroll bar could not function properly. Also,"

** The conjugation period row is noteworthy because of the somewhat significant discrepancy between the model value we chose and sample values found in literature. We chose to use a value of 10 hours per conjugation event because it was a suitable order of magnitude to display conjugation occurring within a 24 hour simulation. We welcome input regarding experimental conjugation rates, as there seems to be a lack of applicable literature, and the experimental values we did find are surprisingly large.
Results
By specifying a grid size (n) and a simulation time (T), our model is able to output time-series data and images at of the grid during each step of time.

PDE Model
Overview
We seek an alternative to the agent-based model which can verify its results and run simulations on an even larger scale. To do this we developed a PDE model which tracks three species of cells through time: donors, recipients, and transconjugants. The silencing system itself is able to move by being carried by diffusion as the donors move and then the plasmid spreads locally through conjugation. d is the diffusivity, P is the population of interest, N is the total concentration of cells. The reason it looks so strange is that we are using diffusion to approximate vegetative growth of the cell. The outward growth of one population of cells - for example the donors - will depend on the total population of cells surrounding it and not just the surrounding donors. As such we take the Laplacian of N and then normalize it by multiplying by the fraction in that population.
Next, each of the populations will undergo logistic growth so we add a logistic growth term to each DE. We assume that each cell has the same growth rate r and that interspecific and intraspecific competition are the same.
Finally, the recipient cells will be converted to transconjugants over time, so we introduce a conjugation term that will allow donors and transconjugants to convert recipients to transconjugants. This term comes directly from"

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#EvelynNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"  However, the buffers we were given were not consistent and as BFP did not cut completely when Buffer 2 was used for 1 hour I decided to test different combinations.   The combinations were:
1. Buffer 4 for 2 hours 2. Buffer 4 for 4 hours 3. Buffer EcoRI for 1 hour 4. Buffer 2 for 2 hours
Restriction digest on BFP with different Buffers
1. BFP.1 uncut     2. BFP.1 Buffer 4, 2 hours  3. BFP.1 Buffer 4, 2 hours  4. BFP.1 Buffer 4, 4 hours  5. BFP.1 Buffer 4, 4 hours  6. BFP.1 EcoRI Buffer, 1 hour  7. BFP.1 EcoRI Buffer, 1 hour  8.

BFP.2 EcoRI Buffer, 1 hour 16. BFP.2 EcoRI Buffer, 1 hour 17. BFP.2 Buffer 2, 2 hours 18. BFP.2 Buffer 2, 2 hours
It can be seen that all the buffers allowed for the BFP insert to be cut however, EcoRI Buffer had three bands as it did both a single and double cut.  Therefore, 1 hour is not sufficient to properly cut the BFP.  For the first BFP concentration had its brightest band for Buffer 2.  However, for the BFP with the higher concentration had the brightest band for Buffer 4 at 2 hours. Afterwards, I did a gel extraction and found the concentration values.  Unfortunately the values were very low so I decided to mix together the BFPs.

Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#project#drylab#modeling#deployment_-_-_TEXT.html," we need to define what $k$ and $l$ are. If we want to know how far downstream the chemicals will be mixed horizontally across the river ($L_Y$) then $l$ = $w$ and $k$ = 0.6 [1]. If we want to know how far downstream the chemicals will be mixed vertically in the river ($L_Z$) then $l$ = $h$ and $k$ = 0.067 [1]. The larger of these $L$ values will determine where we need to place our biosensor for a giver river. This gives us the following two equations       $$L_Y=  \frac{Qw}{0.6h^2\sqrt{ghs}}$$      $$L_Z=  \frac{Q}{0.067w\sqrt{ghs}}$$
Calculation of Biosensor Placement
Assuming the above set of equations are accurate, they can be used to determine how far downstream from a chemical source S.A.F.E.B.E.T. need to be placed in order to detect the chemical.Every river has different parameters to contribute to the equations - height, width, slope and the volumetric flow rate. The Alberta Government [2] and the Regional Monitoring Aquatics Program (RAMP) [3] have been conducting hydrologic tests on the Alberta Oil Sands for over a decade. Thanks to their efferts, calculating LY and LZ for several rivers in the Alberta Oil Sands has been made possible. The placement of these biosensors can be seen on the map below. In addition to these biosensors we’ve also marked on the map potential locations for our biosensors for rivers where we couldn’t get data on but are important nonetheless for quantifying the release of toxins into the Athabasca Oil Sands. These sites were chosen based on their proximity to tailing ponds and their similarity to the rivers for which we have data on. The determined locations are marked in green and the potential locations are marked in red.

International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM)
iGEM[1] is an international undergraduate 'synthetic biology'[2] competition. Participants are teams that represent one or multiple universities. Each team aims to develop genetically modified cells that contribute to science and/or society. The process touches all the activities that are required in a 'real' project: brainstorming for ideas, turning ideas to practice, acquirement of sponsorships and human outreach.
Each team is obliged to present their project on a wiki site, which will be judged between the 26th of September and the start of the regional jamborees. 5 regional jamborees are held at the beginning of October[3] where each team will have a poster about their project and hold a presentation in front of the other team and the judges. The highest scoring teams will go on to the finals in Boston hosted by MIT at the beginning of November.
This years (and last years) European Jamboree is held at the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam. Organized by the universities of all participating Dutch teams (Amsterdam, Groningen, Delft, Wageningen, Eindhoven).
Team UvA/VU
Amsterdam is represented by a joint team of the Vrije Universiteit and the Universiteit van Amsterdam. The team itself consists of six undergraduate (MSc) students that span the following studies: Biomoleculair Sciences, Systems Biology, Bioinformatics.

Structuring your text
HTML knows some structuring elements. This section will tell you something about headings and paragraphs.
In HTML it is fairly easy to create a header. You can use the <h1> tags, where <h1> creates the biggest header, and <h6> is the smallest.
For creating line breaks simply use </br> - no opening tag is needed!
As in every scientific publiction you should not use too many line breaks. If you start a new paragraph, open a new paragraph instead.
Paragraphs, as in continuous text, should be within the <p> ... </p> tag.
Therefore a section in HTML could look like:
<h1>Big Header</h1> <h4>Small header (subcaption)</h4> <p> Introduction text ... </p> <p> Some other, unrelated text. </p> <!-- TEXT ENDS HERE -->
Including Floats into your text
Including floats (figures, tables, etc.) into HTML unfortunately is not as straight forward as, for instance, in \LaTeX. Let's start with the least complicated stuff, and then get more involved. Therefore first we're linking websites, then including images, then tables and figures.
Linking (other) websites
In HTML there's no distinction between linking to some place on your own website, or to a foreign website. Everything uses the same construct (thank god!) which starts with <a ...></a>.
<a href=""address"">text</a>
The address is either the name of an object (header, paragraph, block, ...) or the URL of a website, for instance https://2014.igem.org/Team:Aachen/. If you link to any of our sub-pages, please use the full URL. The text within the tag is the clickable link. You should keep that as short as possible, but as long as necessary!
Therefore a link to our start page would look like:
<a href=""https://2014.igem.org/Team:Aachen/"">link</a>
If you would like to specify the destination of the link, eg. loading in the same frame/windows/tab or in a new tab/window, you can choose between _blank for a new tab/window or _self for the current frame/window/tab.

Warwick,2016,Team:Warwick#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," not cost more than 0.50 USD per sensor, in order to successfully target the developing world. When estimating manufacturing costs, David recommended considering pre-treatment requirements, such as purification of the RNA and the freeze-drying process, as well as any hardware needed. His general guide figure of the overall cost of production was less than 30% of the resale price. He also proposed additional applications for our sensors, including testing mine runoff and domestic wells in developed countries.
David identified numerous issues that FredSense determined may affect the success of biosensors. Illiteracy and poor governmental structure may prevent success in developing countries, while lack of available treatment may render identifying health hazards potentially pointless. To tackle these problems, the team proposed a colorimetric sensing system that could be supplied to charities and governmental aid associations. However, he did warn that colour is subjective, and so for application within more developed areas, such as supplying environmental consultancies, we determined that a more quantitative measurement would be more helpful. We also considered further developing our product by combining the sensor with a water purification treatment.
After more detailed discussion, the team gained a greater insight into the potential interference resulting from other metal ions present in the sensing solution – potassium for example, interferes with the detection of lead. FredSense found they had to take preventative measures to reduce the effects of arsenic on antimony detection in particular, an interaction which we had not previously considered. Following this, we decided to combat any potential interference issues we may have by treating sample water with 18-crown-6 ether. This reagent specifically binds and masks potassium and sodium ions in solution, preventing their interaction with our sensor and reducing the chance of false positives.
Lyme Disease Conference
This year, two members of the Warwick iGEM team attended the annual Lyme Disease Association conference was held at Murray Edwards College, Cambridge University. The theme of the conference was ‘Moving Forward’, and focused on the progress that Lyme disease research has made. The first speaker was Dr Norma O’Flynn from the National Guideline Centre, elaborating upon the procedure applied by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, when determining management processes to improve health and social care. She discussed the different factors considered before a policy can be issued, and how this procedure is currently being applied to Lyme disease.
Dr Sandra Pearson, Lyme Disease Action, tackled the issue of Borrelia persistence, followed by Dr Monica Embers, from the Tulane National Primate Research Centre, who had modelled the changes in immune response over the course of infection and post treatment using rhesus macaques. Dr Em"

Results of ultramer touchdown PCR
We ran an e-gel on the product of our touchdown PCR. Once again we have our band at 344 bp. It is still slighly streaky, but much less than our earlier PCR reaction . There are some faint bands smaller than our expected product, which are likely the ultramers we used in the reaction. We'll use the product for our isothermal assembly later today.
Gel of our ultramer touchdown PCR product
Isothermal assembly and transformation of expression plasmids
We followed our protocol for isothermal assembly, using the following recipe:
0.63 ul backbone (at 157.4 ng/ul to get 100 ng)
0.13 ul omega+linker (at 120.5 ng/ul)
0.50 ul ultramer (~30 ng/ul)
1.24 ul water
7.5 ul isothermal assembly solution
The sizes of the pieces we put together were the following:
Backbone: 2.2 kb
omega+linker: 352 bp
ultramer: 344 bp
Note: We also made a negative control of the isothermal assembly, only putting in the spec backbone without omega+linker or ultramer.
We then performed transformations to insert our isothermal assembly products into E. coli, following our usual protocol . However, we ran out of electrocompetent cells, so only samples 78 - 82 were done with electroporation while 77, 83-85, and the negative control were done with chemical transformation, using these protocols (the samples are named after the reverse ultramer ID in the primer index that were used to generate the ultramer sequences).
We then plated 1 ul of the cells on spec plates and left them overnight at 37*. Because we ran out of our own spec plates, we also had to use LB plates that had spec added to it, and spec plates that were made in April.

TU_Dresden,2017,Team:TU Dresden#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"We took the great opportunity at the German-wide Meetup to share our vision about green labwork.
We informed and involved nine teams from Germany in an interactive workshop .
The Teams from CCA-iGEM (San Diego, USA) and the iGEM Team Lund (Sweden) came up with great ideas to extend our GoGreenGuide .
We also developed a Carbon Footprint Calculation Tool , where teams can easily determine the environmental impact of their laboratory work. Our team from TU Dresden, the iGEM Team of SDU-Denmark , Team Potsdam and Team Aachen have calculated their Carbon Footprint using this tool.
As a symbolic act of sustainability, we asked all teams to plant trees. Here, the Teams of iGEM SDU-Denmark , iGEM Peshawar , and CCA iGEM got involved, too.
However, many more iGEM Teams participated by saving consumables and energy in the lab, biked to work or even became active in environmental projects.
See more on our iGEM goes green collaborations page.
German-wide Meetup
All participants of the German-wide Meetup
The Idea
The concept of the German-wide Meetup was as to gather all the teams to network and set up collaborations for the iGEM Giant Jamboree.
In the beginning of October, the team was a small group of Bachelor’s and Master’s students with very little diversity. By November, the team doubled in size and included members from many departments: CRTD, BIOTEC and the Biology Department at the TU Dresden. We became a truly international iGEM team, covering many disciplines and nationalities. With the resources we had pulled together now, we thought we can plan something big, a German-wide Meetup.  We could host the meetup, using the whole of Dresden and be able to accommodate all the German iGEM teams. Out of the 13 that were invited, 9 came to the assembly, with a total of 50 people attending. The goals of the meetup were:
Sharing our iGEM experience so far
Getting to know the projects and visions of all attending teams
Train the pitch and presentation skills in order to prepare for the Giant Jamboree
Finding collaborations and strengthen the bonds between the teams
Increasing the general knowledge about Synthetic Biology through conferences and events
Having a fun weekend together
Preparation
To prepare for the meetup, a team was assembled to manage and organize the scheduling, food costs, designs and logos, accommodation, etc. Sponsors had to be found and boxes had to be checked to"

How we worked
We were glad to be hosted at the LIBST, Louvain Institute of Biomolecular Science and Technologies, more precisely in the BBGM (Biochemistry, Biophysics and Genetics of Microorganisms) lab of our home university: a leading lab in research           in           Belgium with high safety standards and professional personnel that was alware ready to help us throughout our adventure!           The lab is under the supervision of our 3 PIs: Bernard Hallet, Patrice Soumillion and Charles Hachez.

Respecting safety standards when working in a laboratory is very important to protect us and the others workers too. During our project, we worked in a L2 safety laboratory. Each team member who worked in the lab received a guided tour by           a           lab technician and a training to safety standards to follow in a L2 biosafety laboratory.
This level covers laboratories that use sometimes with pathogenic or infections organisms which pose a moderate health hazard. As we worked with biological materials, we learned all we needed to know about waste management, sterilization,           personal protective equipment (lab coat, gloves…), hand washing, how to work with BET (ethidium bromide) and all the lab's internal facilities put in place for workers safety such as laminar flow hoods, emergency exits, fire safety, eye           showers, pictograms, containment doors… This lab has a room only for centrifuges too and another room only for BET.

Department of Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering, IIT Delhi"
St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#switch_-_-_TEXT.html," GFP is too large (26.9 kDa) to be exported naturally from the cell, and therefore served as both a molecule of the right size (a drug that could be naturally exported would not require a kill switch to be delivered) and one that would be easily viewable and quantitatively assessed.
Not only that, but we fully intended to attach a his-tag to our final GFP molecule by adding the appropriate DNA into the biobrick sequence.  This was to be completed via PCR-ing the Registry part I20260 using customized primers that contained the his-tag DNA sequence. However, this posed a problem, as the act of PCR-ing halfway into the I20260 biobrick remove the terminator in the process. We would solve this problem by performing a single-enzyme digestion of part B0015 and subsequently ligating the entire J23101 + B00032 + E0040 + his-tag sequence into it.  Once transformed, this would give us a new biobrick that would serve as the subject in our experimental protocol below.
Drug Delivery Proof-of-Concept Experiment Protocol
Unfortunately, due to the constraints of the 10 week iGEM period, we were unable to proceed past the PCR stage of our drug delivery biobrick creation.  With the protocol drawn up, primers in our freezer, and cells in glycerol stocks, we plan to continue with this effort before the International Jamboree in November.
Experiment Results and Characterization
Success!
Figure 1 - This graph shows fluorescence readings at 600 nm (485 nm exciting) of K628006-transformed E. coli in solutions of various arabinose concentrations.
The above graph measures the fluorescence readings of E. coli transformed with K628006 across multiple arabinose concentrations.  The y-axis represents the scale of the fluorescent output of each E. coli population, while the x-axis denotes the time of each reading.  The graph doesn't look very aesthetically pleasing, and in fact, may lead some to believe that our readings of fluorescence decreased over time, and subsequently, so did cell death.
However, this is due to the fact that the dye used to stain the cells reduced in fluorescing power over time, resulting in what looked like decreasing cell death.  In order to show the relationship between the effects of various arabinose concentrations on fluorescence, we decided to subtract the fluorescent value of our control  (E. coli transformed with K628006 in a 0 uM solution) from the rest of our values at every reading.  This would remove the focus from the decreasing values,"

Naringenin Operon
Week commencing - 06/08/18
A four-gene operon coding for naringenin biosynthesis was designed using Benchling, this was based on the parts used by the 2014 TU Darmstadt iGEM team. For synthesis by IDT, manual codon optimisation was required for the TAL gene to lower the G/C content. Following this, 4 gBlocks were ordered from IDT. These gBlocks and the primers designed for detection of the assembled operon arrived, therefore lab work could commence. The pSB1C3 backbone for naringenin biosynthesis was amplified using PCR. As the plasmid came at a stock concentration of 25 ng/µl and the PCR reaction requires between 1 pg – 1 ng the plasmid was diluted by X50. A negative control with 1 µl H2O instead of plasmid DNA was made up. An annealing temperature of 71 °C was used, determined by the NEB TM Calculator. Conditions for PCR are shown in the table below. Agarose gel electrophoresis was used for detection of the 2 kb amplified band, this was then purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, however, it resulted in a very low concentration of DNA around 3.58 µg/ml. Therefore, it was planned to conduct this PCR again to increase the concentration. An overnight culture of DH5α cells was inoculated to make more competent cells for subsequent transformations. These cells were grown in a 37 °C shaking incubator until the OD reaches 0.2 – 0.3, followed by additions of 75 mM MgCl, 75 mM CaCl and 15"
IIT_Delhi,2017,Team:IIT Delhi#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," simple illustrations and some hands-on experience for them such as Plasmid isolation, Gel electrophoresis, Inoculation, streaking, etc. We further encouraged the school students to make a team of their own and participate in iGEM and assured full support from our side. Finally, we took the feedback and conducted a small survey based on general awareness. The workshops were successful as we could see students really getting excited about the entire idea of iGEM and seemed to be enthusiastic for the competition. In Fact, we received a letter of Appreciation ( https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/b/b8/T--IIT_Delhi--Certificate_DAV.pdf ) from one of the school (DAV Public School Sector-14, Gurgaon, Delhi).
Feedback obtained from the students: 9.35/10 (Total No of students:196)

Open House (2017, April 22):
Open house is an annual event in IIT Delhi that is being conducted for the past 13 consecutive years, it aims to provide an insight into path-breaking research work and student projects in IIT Delhi. This year it was conducted on 22nd April. ‘iGEM IIT Delhi’ has been participating since the past four years and this time it was a real treat to the eyes of the connoisseurs. We presented our project to technology enthusiasts, students and colleagues from other technical Institutes, school children, industries and the general public. We also introduced them to synthetic biology and iGEM. It was a great motivation and encouragement to the students,  colleagues, and school students to develop a greater interest in the field of Synthetic Biology. Especially school students were excited to participate in iGEM as a ‘High School’ team from India.
Tour of stalls:(2017, July 21-22):
Tour of Stalls is IIT Delhi’s annual club orientation, which has an annual footfall of nearly 1000 students. This orientation was attended by the first year students and high school students. We ensured proper exposure of first-year students to synthetic biology and its multi-disciplinary aspects by setting up a stall at the Tour of Stalls. The students were also shown the team video, which excited them for joining the club.

Just received access to the wiki!  Today was the first day of coding, and for me it was mostly re-familiarizing myself with Java and Swing components.  We're making good progress, and if we can keep this up this amount of effort, I think we'll have something really neat to share.

Measure/test the OD of the culture beforehand to know the required amount of bacteria to create a lawn of E. Coli.
Procedure
1. Pre-warm the premade nutrient agar plates.
2. Melt soft agar by microwaving.
3. Aliquot/pipette 2mL into each polypropylene tube.
4. Cool the melted soft agar to 45C. This can be done by placing the polypropylene tubes into a water bath.
5. Creating the solution
Pipette the required substances
Pipette the required amount of bacteria culture
Vortex!
6. Pour soft agar solution onto premade agar plates . For an even lawn, tilt, tilt, tilt! It takes practice.
Purpose
To create an even lawn of E. Coli on a nutrient agar plate.

She is taking a bachelor in mathematics and travels the world in her spare time (and sometimes her ""not-so-much"" spare time). Somehow she still manages to be the one who's keeping track of the money and is supposebly best friends with all the university secretaries by now. Beside that, she is also the creative part of outreach, a green-lab-minion, HTML-rookie, co-writer of the upcoming article in ROOM, the meeting coordinater and possibly the most important thing - she tries to keep everyone happy and somewhat sane.

Aim: To familiarize with miniprep, nanodrop, restriction digest and gel electrophoresis.
Methods:
We transfer colonies of bacteria into LB and extracted the plasmids via the miniprep protocol , and checked the concentration of plasmids through the use of nanodrop spectrophotometry . We then prepared a 1% Agarose gel and performed a single digest with XbaI and PstI and a double digest with both restriction enzymes. We loaded our samples to the gel with the DNA ladder and control (Figure 1).
Results:

Day Overview
The group started thinking about their cloning strategies for each theme of the project. We also discussed ideas for human practices and came up with the idea of making an educational game based on synthetic biology. At the end of the day we had a group meeting to discuss our progress and our ideas for the modelling workshop for the UCL meet up.
BioGame
Work began on the BioGame . Largely contained to simply choosing the best method of implementation for the game. The following options were considered:
Android SDK (with no game engine/plug ins)
LibGDX
OpenGL
LWJGL
Ultimately the choice was made to use LibGDX due to the documentation available on it, the ease at which games can be developed and the consistent structure it provides with standard gaming development."
Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," the organisms difficult to treat and eradicate from hospital environment. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii containing these types of elements are good example of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens circulating in many hospitals, including our hospital here in Kuwait.
Question: How could the risk of future (infectious) outbreaks be reduced? Could we prevent this from happening?
Answer: Overuse and misuse of antibiotics help to exert selective pressure for these MDR bacteria. To eradicate the existing MDR organisms from the hospital environment all possible selective pressures must be avoided by judicious prescription and use of antibiotics and excluding the antibiotics to which the bacteria are resistant from susceptibility reports. The Hospital Infection Control (ICC) Unit of any hospital has an important role to play in the prevention of outbreaks. For successful prevention and control the infection control doctor/nurses must be very active and liaise regularly with the microbiology laboratory so as to be able to identify any potential outbreak early before it festers. We have an ICC in the hospital that meets every month or every 2 months and an infection control team (ICT) charged with the tasks of carrying out the day-to-day duties of the ICC. Education of healthcare providers on antibiotic stewardship, resistance surveillance and periodic publication of local antibiogram by the microbiology laboratory are also important.
Question: Are there any other therapeutic options except new or higher potency antibiotics to help in the battle against MDR organisms?
Answer: We have limited options for the treatment of infections caused by MDR bacteria. Unfortunately, the prospects of developing new anti-infective agents is very dim. The pipe-line is dry, as they say. The cost of production of antibiotics is extremely high and very few pharmaceutical companies are willing to take on the task. We are left with previously abandoned drugs like colistin, because of it's toxicity, to treat many MDR infections. Even then, recent reports have emerged describing plasmid-mediated colistin resistance in Escherichia coli. This is not good news as the prospect of colistin resistance spreading among the Enterobacteriaceae will be dangerous. It means you are going to have more pan-resistant organisms causing infections in the future and more and more patients will die as a result. So we need new antibiotics to help the few that we have right now.
Question: Your studies in the microbiology of diabetic foot ulcers were intriguing; the fact that you found the most common agents isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus is of particular interest in our project. We have aimed to target"

3.1. Campus Campaign
The news of diphtheria outbreak that lately happened in Indonesia, especially in West Java, is widely spread over the country. Our team considers that the solution of it—which is our project, Finding Diphthy—has to work the same, widely spread. Campus campaign as a start of our public engagement is aiming to raise public awareness about our project and also gaining public opinion about Finding Diphthy.
Campus campaign was held in Faculty of Public Health, Universitas Indonesia in February 2018 and was attended by the faculty students. This target is considered suitable for our project since they are located in the exact place where the outbreak happened, which is Depok City. Meanwhile, the age of the students are still considered as a risk population of this outbreak.

The Crowd
Respondents filling questionnaire
In this campaign, our team brings up the diphtheria outbreak case and also our project: how it works, how we make it, how it would impact the outbreak and society, and also the comparison to previous diagnostic method. We purposely give a deep explanation about Finding Diphthy to the students so that they—as public and a risk population—can understand the solution and criticize our project. In the end of the session, we held a mini survey by giving them a questionnaire according to our project and their opinion and advice about it. This campaign and mini survey is used to direct our project based on the society needs and views, for our project will also impact the society too.
CAMPUS CAMPAIGN QUESTIONNAIRE RESULT
The respondents of the survey about our project are second year students of Environmental Health Department, Faculty of Public Health, Universitas Indonesia (in total 40 students). Respondents were interviewed about their opinion and knowledge towards genetic engineering, diphtheria, and our project Finding Diphthy after socialization was given.

BNDS_China,2017,Team:BNDS China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," the constructed plasmid was higher than the positive control and negative control. Since gadA was closer to the promoter compared to GFP, it was expected to express more than GFP.
Amino Acid Analyzer
Fig. 8 yield of GABA of E. coli Nissle with part Bba_K2326004 (M9 broth)
The same experimental condition was used in the amino acid analyzing process. Fig. 8 shows the yield of GABA by E. coli Nissle with the constructed plasmid in M9. However, there were still no peaks during 48 min to 49 min in the two figures, indicating that GABA was not produced.
Problems
There were two possible reasons of our failure to produce GABA. First, there might be a strong ribosomal binding side presented on the upstream of GFP, making most of the ribosomes bind with GFP but not gadA. Thus, gadA was not fully expressed. Second, evidence showed that GABA permease, 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, and 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase presented in E. coli can degrade GABA to glutamate and flow back into TCA cycle, so GABA maybe have been degraded prior to analysis (Vo & Hong).
Our culture conditions during induction had deficiencies as well. According to Lü et.al., the yield of GABA of L. sakei B2-16 after incubating for 4 days in MRS medium containing 3% MSG was 165 mM. Since we only incubated the bacterial culture for 12 hours and the concentration of MSG was 1%, E. coli Nissle might not have enough time and enough substrate to produce GABA. Moreover, the GAD activity of Lactobacillus brevis NCL912 is the highest when pH of MSG medium ranges from 4.0 – 5.0
(Huang et.al.)
. However, the pH of LB medium is about 7, so GAD might not function well in such a basic environment. Therefore, the yield of GABA may have been low.
We developed Bba_K2326005 and following experiment to eliminate these problems.
LacI-pTac-gadA-Linker-GFP & LacI-pTac-gadA-His-tag

3.Interview with the Science Magazine Newton
On June 17th, we were interviewed by the graphic science magazine Newton. Newton is one of the most popular science magazines originated in Japan. Despite its scientific focus, easy-to-understand contents and catchy photos are used, so it is read by many people regardless of age and gender.    In the article, the history and requirements of iGEM were described, along with what our team has done in preparing for the Jamboree. The article is shown below (Figure 6-3-1).

Fig. 6-1-10. Our member speaking at MUSE TALK
On September 1st,  we gave a presentation at a workshop called “MUSE TALK”. Managers, executives and technicians working in IT company participated in this event to learn about things outside their specialty. The contents of the presentation are listed below.
    • What is iGEM?
    • The trend in synthetic biology  (The trend in iGEM 2013)
    • The project of Team Tokyo_Tech 2013
    • The development of technique  that supports iGEM
     (BioBrick, database related to synthetic biology, MATLAB,  etc.)
    • Introduction of Team  Tokyo_Tech
    • What Team Tokyo_Tech 2014 has  been doing since the new team was organized
In the presentation, we used many pictures and figures in the slide to make it easier to image synthetic biology, which is a completely new field for them.
Fig. 6-1-11. Our members explaining the iGEM database and BioBrick
After the presentation, we were able to get opinions from the audience. Hearing from people working in a different field was a great opportunity for us. Some people gave us ideas of a new product which we never thought of. Also, there were people who asked questions related to safety. All the people with those questions had things in common; they all thought it would be a big business chance if genetically engineered"

Phytohormone
As mentioned above, interactions can be formed not only by inducers such as rapamycin, but also spontaneously, just as SUMO and SIM. So can we combine these two ways of interactions? To solve this problem, we did further studies about phytohormone and found ABA. Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important phytohormone that regulates plant stress responses. Proteins from the PYR-PYL-PCAR family were identified as ABA receptors[6]. Upon binding to ABA, a PYL protein associates with type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) such as ABI1 and ABI2, inhibiting their activity[7]. Previous structural and biochemical observations have provided insight into PYL-mediated ABA signaling and given rise to a working model. In the absence of ABA signaling, PP2Cs are fully active and PYLs exist as inactive homodimers in cells, unable to bind or inhibit PP2Cs, mainly due to the incompatible conformation of CL2loop[7]. In response to ABA binding, the CL2 loop undergoes a conformational rearrangement to close onto the ABA-bound pocket, then, the interaction between PYLs and PP2Cs can be formed. Here we chose PYL1 and ABI1 as a pair of interaction modules. Then, we assembled them onto yeast plasmid as the same as the construction of FKBP and Frb and transformed them into yeast. Based on the interaction of PYL1 and ABI1, we can get a wonderful scene: In the absence of ABA, the synthetic organelles composed only of PYL1 appear, because of the homodimers of PYL1. And after we add ABA into yeast, ABI1 can enter the organelles with the interaction of ABI1 and PYL1, and we can see red droplets colocalize with green droplets in cells through fluorescence microscope. In this way, new components can enter the original organelles and the time of occurrence can"

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Modeling#Construct2_-_-_TEXT.html,"able. For this, a number of assumptions and approximations have been made:
Cph8 and LovTAP are conserved. This translates to a model not explicitly accounting for photoreceptor expression/degradation, as this will be the case for most systems in steady state anyway. Biological optimisation will instead focus on choosing the optimal ratio of promoter strength kP to degradation rate kdeg of the photoreceptors that effectively equal the steady state concentration of Cph8 and LovTAP.
All photoconversion processes are modelled as 2-state processes.
Degradation rates are identical for all proteins. While this obviously does not resemble biological reality, setting a degradation rate for every protein species individually is practically impossible, as such rate parameters are not ubiquitous in literature.
The negative feedback has not been modelled explicitly here, as it has been accounted for in the previous simpler UVR8-TetRDBD model. As no oscillations are possible, the negative feedback loop merely reduces the dynamic range of the switching.
Basal expression as fraction of complete induction is the same for all promoters (= 5% in our case).
ODEs
With the previous assumptions, the coupled system boils down to:
Find the parameters we used on our parameter page . For the optimisation of the promoter expression strengths, we have targeted steady-state repressor concentrations whose KM values equals the geometric mean of the steady-state concentrations between separating conditions, i.e. given a repressor concentration of conditions that are closest together, their steady-state values should yield a geometric mean equal to the repressor's respective KM values.
Results
With 5% basal expression, a satisfactory separation can be achieved. Importantly, the expression of the violet pigment indicates a 2-fold induction when the system is induced both with blue and red light. Note that only these steady-state concentrations have a meaning - dynamics of the system might temporarily lift some pigment concentrations above the indicated values - they will eventually drop to the steady state. The separation between conditions is smaller than that of the UVR8-TetRDBD-system: this is due to the worse separation of Cph8, which only yields a 2.4 fold induction, compared to a near perfect separation for UVR8-TetRDBD.
Biological implications
The system has been tuned manually to maximise the dynamic range between conditions. This has resulted in promoter expression parameters that constrain the model:
This in effect requires the same promoter strengths to be employed in-vivo. Coming from a bioinformatics background, we propose a trial-and-error inspection for finding the correct promoter by using a binary-logarithmic """

played around with the new dialysis clips. Loaded a dialysis bag with red food coloring solution to visualize leaks.
some things we learned:
apply the clips so that they clamp down on the flat part of the fold
have ample length of tubing folded over for the clips
going up to 3 folds for the tubing is ok. The fold will still be held by the clips.
started a new dialysis, using the Snakeskin dialysis tubing and dialysis clips.
we cut 15 mm of tubing for 10 mL of silk solution. This was waaaaay too big. The dialysis clips allow us to be a bit more conservative on how much tubing we use per mL solution.

In order to evaluate the situation throughout Germany, we initiated a nationwide survey in the period from June 21st to July 10th about the topics Dual Use and Dual Use Research of Concern and their treatment at university. The results clearly show that the level of knowledge of German scientists as well as the enlightenment at universities about DURC is not sufficient.
Key data of the German survey:
-119 participants -26 different universities -10 iGEM Teams
Remarkable Data and Major Problems – Germany
62%: do not know the definition of Research of Concern 51%: do not know the definition of Dual Use 80%: do not know a contact person to ask for questions and concerns 94%: criticize an indifferent or very poor degree of information at their universities 71%: want a more pronounced education as part of their university education

Week 1
My first week of work in the lab has just ended up, my first approach to work in Fernan’s lab.  My function in the team is learning how the basic toggle switch works, for later improvement of its performance. We obtained the toggle switch from a biobrick, that need to be introduced in a lacI-deficient E. coli strain to work correctly. Before that task, we need to check that the biobricks that the Headquarters sent us were the right ones.
I made inocula from all the pieces that were sent, and then extract the plasmid from all of them. At the same time, I took out from the lab collection a lacI-deficient E. coli strain, called MC4100 and set an inoculums for this strain too. This way, I’ll have the strain ready to be transformed with the plasmid that contains the toggle switch.
To confirm the identity of the biobricks, I set a digestion reaction with to enzymes: EcoRI and PstI. This will separate the biobrick from the plasmid backbone, so we can check their sizes in an electrophoresis gel. I carried out this experiment twice, most of the pieces were confirmed, being the toggle switch among them.
Finally, I made the transformation reaction to introduce the toggle switch into the strain MC4100. Next week, I will check how this device works by fluorescence assays.

Groningen,2015,Team:Groningen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," biobrick BBa_K1597004 in the thrC locus.
Combining pathway 1 and 2
So now the repression of the biofilm operons of pathway 1 has been deactivated by knocking out the abrB gene. Also the repression of biofilm operons through pathway 2 has been deactivated by overexpressing the repressor of the biofilm operon repressing pathway 2 as seen in figure 3d.
Combining top down approach and bottom up approach
So via the bottom up approach specific biofilm genes were overexpressed by a salt inducible promoter. This bottom up construct was placed in the amyE locus via the K823023 backbone from Munich 2012.  This was combined with the top down approach where genetic pathways resulting in biofilm behaviour were derepressed. The top down approach construct was placed in the thrC locus via the K1597001 backbone we created. See figure 4b. This combination resulted in B.subtilis specifically forming a biofilm and the biofilm formed proved to be robust. However to generate energy, the biofilm had to be more ion selective.
Selectivity
So after a robust biofilm was engineered via the top down and bottom up approach, secreted proteins should be engineered to make the biofilm layer ion selective. Specifically cation selective in our case. In literature we found the biofilm matrix could function as a molecular sieve, sequestering away cations, anions and apolar materials from the water (Flemming, H.-C. & Leis,  in Encyclopedia of Environmental Microbiology (ed. Bitton, G.) 2958–2967 (Wiley, New York, 2002).). It is shown that cations from the water can form ionic bonds with negative groups in the biofilm. So we decided to engineer the secretion of negative molecules into the biofilm. We selected the highly negative poly-γ-glutamic acid (PGA), which is already present in the Bacillus subtilis natto strain. To prove that PGA can be cation selective in a layer, its interactions in water with positive and negative ions were modelled  with Molecular Dynamics. The pgsBCA genes from were designed to be behind salt inducible promoter K1597000 we created. Since the amyE locus already had a construct in it, this would fit in the thrC with the slrR by using our integration vector. The  pgsBCA genes, which form PGA, are secreted into the biofilm like in figure 2 c"

The Problem
The current method used for hormonal detection uses monoclonal antibodies. These tests only detect the hormones and the corresponding levels of each hormone at the point in time in which the sample was taken. This limits the amount of information about the condition of the test subject gained by a researcher or diagnostician to that one point in time. The information is stagnant. These tests can be quite costly; researchers will commonly spend $500-$1100 per ELISA plate. Costs increase form this as researchers need sample preparation materials, storage equipment and lab technicians to carry out their research.
Our Solution
BEAR is a low cost, modular device that will allow scientists to detect hormones in real time. This is a simple schematic of our hormone detection device. The sample containing the hormone in question will interact with the hormone-specific detector. This will stimulate a signal which we will be able to identify.
Modular components of BEAR allow for detection of multiple hormones. The hormone-detecting apparatuses are designed to specifically detect a single hormone. These are one-time-use pieces that can be exchanged from the BEAR device in order to detect a different hormone, depending on the researcher’s needs. Eventually, BEAR will have the capacity to use multiple modular components at once, giving a researcher the ability to monitor a collection of hormones simultaneously.
BEAR is different from the monoclonal system because it provides a real-time assay. This will give neuroscientists, medical and livestock agricultural researchers and diagnosticians the ability to observe hormonal changes over a period of time and watch a subject’s internal response to a stimulus. These results are immediate, as opposed to a wait of hours or days for results from monoclonal antibodies.

3 restriction enzyme digestion
select suitable enzymes and buffer.  Analyse the system using NEB cutter in case of double digestion. NEB cutter finder . 37℃ water bath for 2~3h, 4h is preferable
4 ligation
The key to a successful ligation according to our experience is avoiding high temperature. After a gel extraction with 32ul elution buffer, a approximately 20ul product is obtained. Then mixed with 20ul Buffer 1(Takara Ligation Kit). Reaction at 16℃  water bath is widely recommended, and time for ligation we use is 2h or more.
5 transformation
Add 10ul ligation product into 100ul competence cells(Top10 or others) and keep it in 4℃ refrigeratory for 30min. After a hotshock of 45sec(for chemical competent) or 90sec(for CaCl2 competent), the cells are placed in the 4℃ refrigeratory again for 3-5min. Then add 600~800ul SOC to hotshock cells and incubate in 37℃ shaking table for 1h(160rpm-180rpm). At last the cells are palced on petri dishes with relative antibiotics at appropriate concentration. Then place in 37℃(temperature accords to the properties of different hosts and plasmids),incubate for 12h or more.
Special protocol
To obtain some genes, we often have to use bacteria chromosome or large size plasmid as template in which high GC% content and complex secondary structures are seriously hampering PCR and thus leading to complete failure. To solve this problem, we have developed a special protocol-- hot start method combined with additive(sole or mixed)-- which is most helpful .
Simplified Hot Start PCR
Hot start method is to prevent primer dimer and low specified product yield. In our experiment, We use common taq polymerase to replace commercial high-priced hot-start polymerase.
After a 5min 95℃ pre-heat step, DNA polymerase is  added to each PCR tube before the PCR cycling begin. After that, the regular PCR cycling could begin.
Explanation
When reaction components are mixed at room temperature, reaction set up below the optimal primer annealing temperature, which permits nonspecific primer annealing and extention.Undesired, non"

Conclusion and overview
Reflecting on the interviews, it would have been useful to hold a focus group in order to get a discussion between the two ‘factions’ that seemed to emerge. It was decided early on that the interviews would remain fairly structured and so questions outside those that had been decided were used only to clarify points. I felt it would have been beneficial to have some of these ideas contradicted, mainly between those that felt the technology needed to be developed first and then regulation and public opinion would fall into place, and those who felt that the discussions needed to take place before lab work was started. In this, GM was often used as an example to justify both opinions.
This research will feed into further work by Sheffield iGEM team. Knowledge about public concerns for the technology has meant they can tailor their project design  and they aim to visit schools to discuss the emerging technology with younger people.

Introduction to Microfluidics | Dinithi
In order to effectively use the MARS system, users need to have a fundamental understanding of microfluidics. With this in mind, we created an introduction to microfluidics that teaches users the basics of microfluidics. This educational component of project MARS consists of an introduction to microfluidic chips as well as a guide to the various primitives used in our microfluidic designs.
Video Tutorials | Sarah and Dinithi
In order to make the microfluidic chips we designed accessible to synthetic biologists we developed four fully-narrated tutorial videos. These videos go step by step through the process of manufacturing, assembling, and testing a microfluidic device. The four videos created teach uses how to mill a microfluidic chip, how to make PDMS, how to assemble a microfluidic chip, and how to clean a microfluidic chip. Each of these videos is accompanied by a detailed written protocol as well.
Mars Repository
In order to make microfluidics a practical field for synthetic biologists, we created the MARS microfluidic chip repository. This repository hosts nine microfluidic chips that each perform a fundamental synthetic biological protocol. These nine protocols were determined after reaching out to synthetic biologists in the Boston University and iGEM communities. Each chip comes with all the required design files and documentation so that a synthetic biologist could download, manufacture, and test any chip in the repository. The nine chips in the MARS repository are as follows:
Cellular Lysis | Dylan
DNA Digestion | Dinithi
Cell Sorting | Dinithi
Ligation | Sarah
Transformation | Sarah
PCR | Sarah
Antibiotic Resistance | Dylan
Fluorescence Testing | Dinithi
Cell Culturing | Dylan
For more information regarding each chip, please see our

Fluid Functionality
In order to verify whether or not a microfluidic device is functional, a grading system was developed: the Fluid Functionality Checklist. This fluid functionality system was broken up into two portions: a qualitative checklist and a quantitative analysis.

Expert’s opinion regarding the safety of our project
The opinion of experts on the field of bacterial cancer therapies was a very valuable input during the designing of our treatment. For this reason, we came in contact with T3-pharmaceuticals , a spin-off company that is currently developing novel bacterial anti-cancer treatments exploiting the powerful bacterial T3 secretion system, to deliver their anti-cancer payload to the cells. [5] According to Dr. Simon J. Ittig , CEO of T3-pharmaceuticals, people suffering from advanced stages of cancer are willing to take the risks that come along with a bacterial cancer treatment, especially because the potential side-effects are so minimal in comparison with other treatment options .
On the other hand, in our correspondence with Prof. Polšek , an expert in bioethics, we were encouraged to think about this from a different perspective and to always keep in mind that ""Despair is not the viable justification for granting a judicious informed consent"".
Safety of our final project design
The final goal of our project is to engineer E. coli Nissle 1917 to specifically deliver an anti-cancer peptide against malignant tumors. The administration of the treatment would be done by trained medical personnel, in a hospital environment. There are several safety risks, which we need to consider in the design of our genetic circuit and the application of the treatment.
Risk of sepsis
The treatment starts by intravenous administration of our engineered bacteria. The bacterial dose administered should be high enough to allow the bacteria to initially survive the human immune response, and allow colonization to take place. However, high concentrations of bacteria in the bloodstream can induce             acute response of the immune system leading to sepsis and finally to a septic shock. For this reason, thorough investigation of the bacterial treatment administration is mandatory, in order to determine the dosage that can be administered without compromising the patient’s health. Important to mention, however, is that even in the worst case of bacteria initiating a septic response, there is the  possibility to administer antibiotics at any point during the treatment, as soon as any suspicious symptoms are present (e.g. fever).
Risk of off-target colonization
After administration, the bacteria will take advantage of their inherent ability to specifically colonize tumors , as they provide the immunosuppressed and nutrient-rich microenvironment necessary for bacterial growth. However, bacterial colonization in healthy tissues (off-target) is still a possibility,"

Modelling Comes to Life
Introduction
Objectives
Intracellular Spatial Effects
Graphical User Interface
Conclusion
Give it a Go!
Introduction
NetLogo is “an agent-based programming language and integrated modelling environment” and we used it to develop simulations to see the effects of space within the cell for the PQS and BDSF systems.  NetLogo is an easy-to-implement tool and is part of the class of individual-based models (IBMs). The video below is an example run of the one of the PQS simulations.
Objectives
We wished to use the NetLogo IBM for two main purposes: (i) an investigation of potential intracellular spatial effects in the signalling pathways and (ii) the development of an easily accessible graphical user interface for the modelling component of the project.
Intracellular Spatial Effects
We discuss the results pertaining to the PQS system.  Similar results were obtained for the other systems. The NetLogo model represents a cross-section of our E. coli chassis.
The spatially extended stochastic simulations generated by NetLogo  exhibited broadly similar general trends as predicted by the other mathematical tools that we used.   For example in Fig 1, we can see that increasing the number of signalling molecules increases the number of fluorescent molecules produced.  Although we could not achieve close quantitative  agreement with our other predictions, NetLogo did allow us to better visualise the effects of changing the number of signalling molecules, receptors and promoters on the expression"
UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Judging Criteria_-_-_TEXT.html,"We have improved the function of the existing BioBrick Device BBa_K177038 which works as a Flip-Flop system by designing an improved Flip-Flop which includes translational and proteolysis control besides of transcriptional control of the preexisting Flip-Flop. We have entered the information of the two new devices which make the improved Flip-Flop ( BBa_K510019 , BBa_K510036 ) in the Registry.
About Human Practice issues, we have carried out several approaches for spreading the basis of Synthetic Biology. We have launched the first blog about Synthetic Biology in Spanish, Tornillos y Genes , with 13.000 visitors by now. This blog will allow an easier dissemination of Synthetic Biology among Spanish-speaking people, and will engage in SB more people from different backgrounds. We have developed a SB spreading program in High schools of Spain, consisting of talks given by the student members of the team. Moreover, we have taken part in two science fairs for all public: Sevilla Science Fair and the Week of Science of Pablo de Olavide University .

Tokyo_Tech,2016,Team:Tokyo Tech#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," PGI enzyme,        (d) Concentrations inhibiting both G6PD and PGI enzymes,        (e) Concentrations strongly inhibiting both enzymes
We can see that the more we inhibit the enzymes G6PD and PGI, the production of BC increases; so we can assume this model is correct. However, we cannot say it is the most appropriate to our case since it has not been corroborated with the experiments. We managed, though, to create the basis for a future more precise model.

On August 16th, we hosted a workshop of dry teams. The participating universities were Gifu University, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, University of Tokyo and Kanazawa Institute of Technology. The iGEM team Tokyo_Tech and the iGEM team UT-Tokyo taught modeling methods to the other iGEM teams present. We exchanged our ideas, and thereby we gained new knowledge on modeling.

3. Helping a New iGEM High School Team
We visited The American School in Japan on September 14th and gave a modeling lecture. We explained our project's overview and taught modeling methods. We also talked about what iGEM is because the American School in Japan is a new iGEM team. The iGEM team Tokyo Tech has collaborated with many universities so far. This visit enabled us to collaborate with a high school.

4. Developing an application
4-1. Abstract
We developed an Android application based on the suggestion from iGEM 2016 team UT-Tokyo of turning E. coli cultivation and genetic modification into an application so that more people can know about synthetic biology.
4-2. Explanation of the Application
When a player taps the main screen, E. coli in a medium increases. Additionally, the more E. coli increases, the more experience points a player gains, which increases the player’s level. Leveling up also gives the player access to gene ligation techniques.
This application is distributed"
Yale,2016,Team:Yale#Description#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," in a given food item.
Feedback from children and parents indicated that they enjoyed our events very much, learning more about synthetic biology than they had previously known. What surprised them the most was that such an event concerning synthetic biology would be presented to the public, especially targeting children—which would seem more difficult for them to understand genetic engineering. This topic did interest us because not much initiative is taken to address the scientific literacy gap between the general public and scientists, which is detrimental to the progress of science as a society. Therefore, our team took this opportunity to engage with the public and garner their interest in this field—however brief—to open the conversation about genetic engineering in their lives.
With the pervasiveness of genetic engineering in all aspect of human life, it is necessary for us to expand the understanding of synthetic biology to all sectors of society, starting with children, whose natural curiosity could lead to greater discoveries in the future. By using the Building with Biology kit as a starting point in our efforts, our team hopes to continue the conversation about synthetic biology through further events, possibly expanding the scope of our venues and the age range of participation.

Delivery System
For delivering the peptide the team took inspiration from 2012 iGEM Team Groningen in having two separate compartments for the microbe and nutrients. Polycaprolactone will be used  as the inner membrane for nutrient supply and the external membrane as the dialysis tubing which contains our engineered Bacillus subtilis spores. Dialysis tubing for 1 kDa molecular movement will be used for release of our desired peptide. Alternatively, silk fibres can also carry out the functioning of dialysis membrane.
For the system to function, the inner membrane containing the medium will initially be squeezed to come in contact with the spores outside. The sachet can now be added to the boiling milk for gene expression and peptide release into the milk. Since the peptide synthesis is dependent on temperature, the process is continued till the temperature drops down to 42°C.
With regard to Groningens system we replaced the inner PVC membrane with polycaprolactone(PCL), which is a non-toxic and biodegradable alternative to PVC. The outer TPX membrane was also replaced with a dialysis membrane to selectively facilitate the transfer of our Anti-microbial peptides.
