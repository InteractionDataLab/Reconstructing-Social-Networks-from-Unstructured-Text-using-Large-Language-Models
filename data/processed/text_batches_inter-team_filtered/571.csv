Oxford,2016,Team:Oxford#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," a C-terminal sfGFP tag (also his-tagged) to aid purification, allowing us to view the cellular distribution of MymT and allow analysis by Fluorescence Lifetime IMaging (FLIM). The fluorescence lifetime of GFP with a C-terminal His tag was shown to be reduced by copper by Hötzer et al., allowing FLIM to be used in an in vivo assay of copper binding. This has provided us with preliminary characterisation data for the protein, suggesting copper-binding activity in vivo. More details can be found on our results page .

BBa_K1758324:
We were interested in using this part from Team Bielefeld-CeBiTec in 2015 as a potential copper biosensor.
The team assembled a copper biosensor from two subparts which they then joined together:
The first part is a pCopA-RBS-sfGFP and the second part is the regulator CueR expressed from a constitutive promoter. The part is deposited in the registry and labelled to suggest the CueR is expressed divergent from the sfGFP (on the opposite strand and transcribed in the opposite direction):
How BBa_K1758324 is labelled in the registry
However if you look at the sequence level this is clearly not the case. The constitutive promoter and the CueR start codon are at the 5’ end of the sfGFP coding strand and the CueR stop codon just upstream of pCopA. The part in fact has the constitutive promoter on the same strand as pCopA and sfGFP facing in the same direction and would be better represented like this:
How BBa_K1758324 should be labelled in the registry based on its underlying sequence
As the two coding regions are not separated by a transcription terminator, there would be read through from the constitutive promoter to the sfGFP and sfGFP would be expressed even in the absence of copper. As no negative control is included in the plate reader graph they provide and no settings provided for their BioLector experiments in their protocols it is unclear just how high the expression level at 0mM copper was for this part compared to a negative control strain.
The CueR subpart ( BBa_K1758320 ) making up BBa_K1758324 is also incorrectly labelled.
When we designed this part we flipped the CueR and the constitutive promoter to face the opposite"

Our iGEM team is committed to reflect all aspects of the entire project, including biosafety. From the beginning on, the team thoroughly discussed safety issues that could potentially arise with the implementation of Cellock Holmes. The results of these discussions fundamentally influenced the design of Watson and the choice of potential application fields. Read more about our safety considerations on our Safety page.
Economical View
The economical considerations regarding our project were carried out according to the motto:
Make the world a better place - Open access for scientific advance
For both our WatsOn and our OD/F Device , we are following an economical strategy focused on the open source principle. Low cost and the use of easily available parts have heavily influenced the design choices made when developing our devices. You can find more information on our page Economical View .
Intellectual Property on BioBricks
During the meetup of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May also workshops took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in registry remains unclear, and that there are parts where only upon a closer look it becomes clear that the rights are company–owned. Because the issue of uncertain legal status of parts in the registry persists, the German iGEM teams wrote a proposal on how to deal with intellectual property rights in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
For for information on intellectual property on BioBricks, read the full proposal the German iGEM teams composed.

Procedure: Degrading the July 8 Biofilms
The biofilms created yesterday successfully grew. To degrade the biofilms, Fantastic and bleach cleaner solutions were used that had previously been created. Water was used as a control. 300 μL of respective cleaning solution added to each well. 15 mins after the solutions was added, they were disposed of in the biohazard waste.
Procedure: Reculturing the July 8 Biofilms
To culture the biofilms from yesterday, 300 μL of LB media was added to one well for one of microtiter plate that had been degraded with cleaner. The media was then pipette up and down to mix with any remnants of the biofilms. The media was then pipetted back into the 5 mL tube of LB media. 5 μL of KAN was added to the 5 mL tube of LB media.
Process was repeated for the remaining two plates that used different cleaners.
Cultures were left to grow 24 hours in 37˚C incubator.
Procedure: New Biofilms
New biofilms were created for July 10 testing. 2 μL of KAN was added to 2 mL centrifuge tubes along with 1980 μL LB and 20 μL of culture (E.coli DH5α cells with RFP (PSB4K5)).
300 μL of mix was pipetted into wells of 96 well plate. Biofilms left to grow 24 hours in 37˚C incubator.

Our key partners
All our partnerships were made to continue our venture, and push it forward after the iGEM contest. As soon as we had identified our vision, we established a very strong partnership with the Belgian Defense (the Military Hospital). Throughout our whole venture we keep in touch and exchanged our result and strategy. This allowed us to design something in regard to the final potential application. They were also part of our round table event at the European Parliament. We will do a large kick-off meeting with them right after the iGEM competition to establish the next steps. We also conclude a strong partnership with the Belgian Red Cross, they helped us to better define the problem we try to solve, and helped to to organize our field trip.
We conducted several meeting with key leaders and potential customers/user. We were helped by the entrepreneurs we met to create a strong pitch. We pitched many partners and sponsors to get money from it. We organized a Skype with Andreas Hougaard Laustsen, PhD, Associate Professor (DTU ) Technical University of Denmark) & Serial Biotech Entrepreneur. He gave us advices to better adapt our approach to the European GMO regulation. We also organized a skype meeting with Jordane Dimidschstein, PhD and Group Leader at Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. We explain us the next step about the preclinical studies and the toxicity test that we will have to manage. We met Thibault Helleputte, PhD and CEO & Founder of DNAlytics. He gave explained us the regulatory path to undergoes and gave us the specific contact to the right institutions. We were helped by Philip Hemme, the CEO & Founder of LaBiotech.eu to find our speakers for our Biotech4Change event, he also put us in touch with Deep Science Venture, a life-science incubator. Beside all these specifics meetings, we also had very enriching continuous feedbacks from our advisory board.
Beside those partnerships, we got in touch with the Ann Van Gysel, PhD and CEO & Founder Turnstone. We contacted her on the behalf of Philip Hemme to moderated our Round Table. As for our other partnerships we built a long terme relation and we have the common vision to organise other sessions. In order to give a larger perspective to our project, we paired up with Young Change Maker to interconnect non-scientific people with young researcher.

Stony_Brook,2016,Team:Stony Brook#Description1_-_-_TEXT.html," a construct including Cripto-1 and a secretion tag to ensure that our protein is secreted to the membrane. We plan to use Cripto-1 antibodies on frozen cells and depending on where the antibodies aggregate, we can determine if Cripto-1 was indeed secreted to the membrane. C-SRC is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is phosphorylated by Cripto-1 in humans. We plan to test yeast cells both with and without C-SRC in the presence of GPC-1 to test if yeast C-SRC actually is phosphorylated by Cripto-1. C-SRC functions through the MAP Kinase pathway. We hope to be able to couple Cripto-1 binding to a reporter, GFP, inside yeast for indication of the presence of the GPC-1 in human blood serum. GFP would be expressed at a basal rate without the binding of GPC-1 to Cripto-1, but if binding occurs, GFP's expression would be augmented and could be measured with a spectrophotometer to determine susceptibility to tumors.  This could potentially offer insight into the potential for synthetic biology as an important medical tool in the future.
Vaccine Preservation
Another project this year is focused on lowering the cost of vaccine preservation. Currently, most vaccines need to be stored at temperatures of around 4oC (40oF). The need to keep vaccines cold can account for approximately 80% of the cost associated with vaccine programs in developing nations, which is estimated at around $200-300 million per year. By working to express viral proteins in yeast, which may be dried to withstand fluctuations in temperature, we hope to develop a system by which vaccines can be more easily transported and stored. Activation of the yeast upon introduction to water would occur when the vaccines would be needed, and viral proteins could be filtered from their surrounding solution using a microfiltration apparatus.

5 iGEM teams, 8 cities, 11 Days: The “Escape the lab”-Tour of TU Darmstadt
In order to launch the LabSurfing webpage we decided to visit a couple of iGEM teams ( iGEM Team Tübingen , iGEM Team UNITN-Trento , Freiburg, iGEM Team ETH Zürich , iGEM Team FAU Erlangen )  in a big trip through europe. Here we not only let them test a beta version of our page, but also we experienced how it is to be a LabSurfer. The result: definitely fun for both sides! Beside the iGEM teams, we visited alumnis of our team, contacts and experts from last year and the international Exhibition in Milan .
 
The lab escapers: Traveling together for over a week LabSurfing provided a good training for the last week before wikifreeze. .  .
Of course we used the opportunity to present our projects to the other teams and reverse. Furthermore we discussed our application idea and received a lot of crucial feedback for our final web version of LabSurfing. We motivated every iGEM team to pass on a gift for the next team on our way. This way all teams offered and received a gift.

In one study, the removal of arsenic from mining tailings ponds was done by  Rhamnolipid biosurfactants, which decreased the interfacial tension between contaminants and tailings, increasing the metal’s mobility and thus separating them [8].
Another current method of metal removal from tailings ponds is bioleaching. Bioleaching is the use of organisms as a catalyst to leach certain metals from their ores, by turning the metal sulphide crystals into sulphates and metal [9]. This is used to oxidize the sulphide materials left behind from mining, in addition to extracting the valuable metals from the tailings. This bacterial oxidation technology is advantageous due to its use of natural bacteria already present in the tailings and its relative simpleness. [10].
Comparison of Our System
Biosurfactants
Our system of recovering heavy metal ions from tailings ponds is more effective than biosurfactants in a couple different ways. The removal of metals by ionic biosurfactants is thought to occur in the following order: the sorption of the biosurfactant to the soil surface and complexation with the metal; the detachment of the metal from the soil to the solution; and the association with micelles. Heavy metals are trapped within the micelles through electrostatic interactions and can be recovered through precipitation or membrane separation methods[11]. Our system is more beneficial than biosurfactants because it is more self-sustaining with our phage infection system; additionally, biosurfactants are affected by the slightest change in temperature and pH levels. They also require a higher concentration of carbon and nitrogen for growth and production. All these factors combined give us insight to the possible benefits our system compared to biosurfactants.
Bioleaching
In comparison to bioleaching, our system is more favourable. One benefit is that our system does not produce heat. The sulphide oxidation present in bioleaching is an exothermic process, which releases large quantities of heat, therefore requiring a cool environment in order to prevent the bacteria from dying. Our system would not require this. In addition, our system is self-renewable, which demonstrates the potential for greater metal removal efficiency. Our phage capsid display technology is complex, yet it provides a potential alternative for the extraction of metals from tailings ponds.
Incorporation
In order to efficiently integrate our system into the removal of metals from mining and oil sands tailings ponds, we propose a solution using multiple cisterns. It would not be feasible to implement our system directly into the tailings"

To do this, we denote an invertase site as any set of characters that begins with a capital ""I"".  For example, ""I1"" would be referred to as invertase 1.  ""Ix"" would be referred to as invertase x.  This however is not enough notation to represent invertases.  Invertases have directionality.  Two sites must be facing each other in order for them to properly invert the parts between them.  Thus, we can imagine the mentioned notation (""I1"" or ""Ix"") as an invertase site facing a particular direction.  Similar to the way the bracket ""["" faces to the right, imagine that I1 or Ix face to the right as well.  To denote an invertase that faces the opposite direction, to the left, we tack a ""'"" to the end of the site's notation.  Referring to our earlier example, our complement invertase sites would be I1' and Ix' respectively.
2. Parts - Parts, on the other hand, can take on any notation.  They can be any alphanumeric character, whatever makes it easiest for you to visualize your design.
3. Designs - Now that we understand how to properly represent invertases and parts, we are ready to enter a design.  For this example let's imagine the simple design ""I1 A B I1'"".  Here we only have 1 invertase, I1, and two parts, A and B.  When entering this design, every element of the design, whether it be an invertase or a part, must be separated by A SINGLE SPACE.  The software parses the design using spaces, so this is a strict rule of the tools.
4. Inputs - For both tools, the user is allowed"
BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," the input fields are either highlighted red to prompt the user to change their input or to green to confirm that the entered data is in the proper format.
Following the form information, the output destination section was improved. The UI dynamically creates a tab for each output, enabling the user to easily switch between outputs on the UI when selecting wells and make edits accordingly. In addition, selected wells change color and can be de-selected before submission. After improving the well selection table, the aesthetics of the UI were redone to make the design sleek and easy to read.
This final version of the UI was received well by users. Given more time, a LiveView feature would’ve been implemented to give users real-time information about TERRA’s status, such as current well and remaining time, during the dispensing process.
Using the UI
Here is a demonstration of how to use the User Interface.
Back-end Code
The back-end software runs both the XY Plane and Control Syringes. The approach in designing the back-end was to treat information in the context of a series of different outputs coming off of the microfluidic chip. By creating an “Output” class, we created different methods that were responsible for assigning each output a set of dispensing coordinates and pair of corresponding control syringes that open and close the output. We are then able to access each output to get the necessary information to control the hardware. The control syringe and xy-plane software are detailed further below.
Controlling the Syringe Pumps
The Control Syringe Pump software is responsible for moving the servo motors in order to actuate valves on the TERRA Adapter to select for certain outputs to dispense. In addition, the Control Syringe Pump software resets the syringes before the start of any experiment. It does this by moving syringes to three known states:
Origin
Close
Open
The origin state resets the syringe to reference point, the open state opens a valve by via negative pressure by pulling the syringe, and the close state closes a valve by releasing the syringe back to origin and applying slight positive pressure by pushing the syringe. Below is a diagram showing the various states:
As mentioned earlier, the Control Syringe Pump software works with the TERRA Adapter to dispense outputs into the targeted vessel. Each output has a pair of control syringes assigned to it, called A and B, in order to toggle between selection and waste; selection occurs when the control syringe A is open and control syringe B is closed while direction to waste occurs when control syringe A is closed and control syringe B is"

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html,". Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) is found at the synapses of the central nervous system; primarilt sensory neurones. It is the most abundant GPCR found in the brain, and is also found in other tissues such as muscle, liver and adipose (fatty) tissue. CB2 is found primarily in the cells of the immune system.
It is illegal in the UK and most US states to smoke marijuana, both recreationally and medically. However, the UK Home Office and the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) have both approved the use of certain cannabinoids from the Cannabis plant to treat medial conditions. This is because determining the effects that one or two cannabinoids have on the body is much easier than testing the effects of dozens at once (i.e. direct from the cannabis leaf). Medical trials have shown that the cannabinoids THC and CBD can have positive medicinal effects, as I shall describe later.
As a result, a number of pharmaceutical companies are making money legally by growing Cannabis. Unfortunately, the process of getting these target cannabinoids is very time-consuming and low-yielding. First, the plants must be clutivated for months in government-inspected facilities; then, the low quantities of target cannabinoids (THC and/or CBD) must be extracted and purified to form the final product. To make matters worse, plants tend to make several variations of the target compound rather than just one; this further reduces the yield, and doesn't really match the strict manufacturing standards of other pharmaceutical products, such as aspirin or paracetamol.
Ultimately, the drawbacks of this so-called ""pharming"" technique mean that these products must be sold at higher prices. However, several companies are now unlocking the power of synthetic biology to make the production of cannabinoids easier. A front-runner in this is GW pharmaceuticals - by mutating genes within the Cannabis plant to alter their activity, they have been able to adjust the relative proportions of different cannabinoids that the plant produces.
The flow chart below shows how the biosynthesis of each product is controlled by each of four regions (known as ""loci"") within the nuclear DNA of the plant. As you can see in the shaded region, the relationship between certain loci and the cannabinoid synthesis pathway is still not fully understood!
The aim of GW pharmaceuticals is to alter the activity of these loci, and therefore bias the cannabinoid synthesis pathway towards the production of CBD and THC, so that the yield from their plants can be increased. Using the products from their plants, GW pharma is selling a drug called Sativex (which contains an approximate 1:1 ratio"

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html," modifications must be made because in other software tools, reaction-searching is name-based. However, in our program, it is structure-based. Matching of species name is much easier than that of Chain-Node structure, which is featured as the most important part of our program. In addition, process of products generating is not as easy as just creating a new species with specific name, too. Their structures are required to be constructed under rules defined in MoDeL at the same time. The species matching and products generating modules are essential to implement our automatic modeling idea.
To complete the final systemn network from initial conditions, we break up the task to several parts:
Setup initial conditions and environmental parameters read from the input file;
Species produced are inserted into a list in the order of time. For each species, we search the database to find template species which could be matched to this species in structural pattern. If not found, then go for the next species;
For each template species found matching, we continue to search template reactions containing this template species as a reactant or modifier or both. Only forward or reverse reaction is handled, never for both at the same time;
For each template reaction found possible to occur, we search in the species list for possible species which could be instances of templates of other reactants and modifiers. If not found, then go for next reaction;
For each possible combination of reactants and modifiers, if the reaction parameter conditions are satisfied for given constraints, we generate the structure of products based on the transfer table and structural templates of products. And then add this new reaction to the reaction list.
Go to step 2 until the end of the species list;
In the following, we will focus on the step (2), (3) and (5). Our algorithms are totally different with that of other software tools since we design them for the purpose of proving the feasibility of MoDeL for synthetic biology. They are kind of complicated because the complexity of biological systems require so.
Figure 1: Algorithm Flow Chart
Special reactions and volume strategy
Transcription and translation reactions are not supported by MoDeL reaction definitions; they are handled specially in the core program. We use pseudo first-order reaction to model both transcription and translation reactions. The rate constant k is the value of forwardPromoterEfficiency/reversePromoterEfficiency for transcriptions and forwardRbsEfficiency/reverseRbsEfficiency for translations defined for each part in the database. It means number of mRNAs per DNA per second for transcriptions and number of proteins per mRNA per second for translations. A transcription will not end at a terminator"

Time Control Module
Overview / Rationale
The purpose of the Time Control module is to introduce a significant delay between the induction of the Sensing module         and the activation of the Recombination module, which allows time for AHL to sufficiently amplify and diffuse to         other cells by quorum sensing, as well as allocates time for gene-of-interest expression. The control of the delay         is executed by employing transcriptional and translational delay of cI and phlF repressors.
Time module has significant application in genetic containment strategy. The amount of protein-of-interest can be controlled         by the delay in Cre recombinase expression, which will knock out the construct and terminate the protein-of-interest         production process. This provides a secure and safe method for researchers to control the expression within genetic         modified organism (GMO).
Diagram 1. Expression in time module construct in the absence of induction by AHL molecules
Diagram 2. Expression in time module construct with induction by AHL molecules
Our Design
Our concept comes from a two-step cascade study which used IPTG as an inducer that regulates the system involving LacI         repressor and Tet repressor with their corresponding repressible promoters. The experiment shows a delay of about         one cell-cycle per step (ref 1). Our simulated graph shown in modelling (4.2 : Adding Time Control) is also based on the concept of two-step cascade study. In our design, we control Cre recombinase to express upon         AHL induction.
The construct starts with pLuxR which is inducible when AHL-LuxR dimer binds. The major CDS in the Time Module         construct just downstream pLuxR (BBa_R0062) are lambda cI repressor (BBa_C0051) and PhlF repressor (BBa_K1725040).         Both are able to repress their downstream constitutive promoters separated by double terminators. These promoters         are pcI (BBa_R0051) and"
SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," J. A. & PETERSON, M. 2015. On the Epistemology of the Precautionary Principle. Erkenntnis, 80, 1-13. . The epistemological condition is a proposition that stands in reference to the damage condition. The damage condition is the possible harm(s), which can happen as consequences of the activity in question. The epistemological condition is then the evidence one has for the probability that the damage will occur. The connection between the epistemological condition and the damage condition is most often thought of as a causal connection.
The three conditions in the Tripod are also the case dependent part of the Precautionary Principle. The Tripod is therefore the most flexible part of the Precautionary Principle and the different cases then require different versions of the Precautionary Principle: “[...] any statement according to which satisfying a specific [epistemological condition] and [damage condition] is sufficient to justify a specific [remedy]” STEEL, D. 2014. Philosophy and the precautionary principle, Cambridge University Press. . Which version to choose is specified by the constraints from the Meta-Precautionary Principle.
The last part, proportionality, is a contextualist-based idea. More precise it is the idea that the level of precautionary measures taken corresponds to both the probability and the damage. It is similar to the economic thought of cost and efficiency - if the cost is high, then the efficiency should be as well.
The three elements are the essential parts of the Precautionary Principle when it functions like a decision rule. But it is important to be aware that the Precautionary Principle can function as a procedural requirement, where the Meta-Precautionary Principle is highlighted or as an epistemic rule STEEL, D. 2014. Philosophy and the precautionary principle, Cambridge University Press. . We will here focus on the Precautionary Principle as a decision rule composed of the Meta-Precautionary Principle, the Tripod and Proportionality.
How does it work?
One thing is understanding the essence of the Precautionary Principle, but when it comes to how it should be applied there are different explications of it. Some interpretations focus on catastrophes (Catastrophic Precautionary Principle), for some it is a maximin rule and others again see it as a minimax regret.
The Catastrophic Precautionary Principle is proposed by Hartzell-Nichols HARTZELL-NICHOLS, L. 2012"

We participated at the Science Uncovered event on the 23rd of September. This event was part of the European Researchers' Night, a Europe-wide event in which scientists interact with the public and talk about their research.
We presented our project and talked about synthetic biology in general to interested members of the public. Our giant furry E. coli and plastic ""BioBricks"" were especially popular.

The Rathenau Instiuut is an Amsterdam-based institute that aims to ""promote the formation of political and public opinion on science and technology"". In preparation of the regional iGEM Jamboree, it hosted an interdisciplinary debate between young politicians and scientists. In this debate, two politicians discussed pre-prepared statements on how synthetic biology should be regulated and what its impact on society as a whole could become. All other attending politicians and members from selected iGEM teams were invited to comment on these statements.
We were asked to be part of the panel of young scientists at the debate. Rebekka represented our team during the debate.
Publicising our wiki
Lisa got creative and made a QR code linking to our wiki out of post-its on the window of the Bessemer building at Imperial College London. This window faces a large open courtyard that hundreds of people walk through every day to get to different ends of the campus. We have seen lots of people take out their mobile phones to use the QR scanning app, you can try it yourself on the picture below!

University of Maryland meet up!
We started ordering materials and reagents. Finally we can start our project!
August
Based on our conversation with UMD iGEM team we redesign and focus on one project. We decided to go forward with the bacteria mimic although it will now be called the ""Living vaccine""
IDT parts arrive
Everything is moving very slow, and a lot of things are not working. Specially our transformation protocol. We contacted UMD and UVA to see if they had any competent cells that we can use for the interlab study. We've done many transformations but only a few plates are working.
the janitors waxed the floors so we could not meet for almost 4 days.
This is our most productive month, everything seems to be working, specially the transformation.
The news crew came to our lab to see our program and the iGEM program.
September
We had to stop working in the lab and focus on getting money, there are too many people that wan to go to MIT, but we can't fund raise enough money for everybody. Our mentor decided that the funding that we get will be to take students that have shown dedication to the program. <"

Mdfa Antiporter
BACKGROUND
       The resistance of Escherichia coli to many drugs simultaneously (multidrug resistance) often involves the expression of membrane transporters (Mdrs);MdfA,the known bacterial MDR transporters probably utilize the membrane potential(Δψ) and/or the proton gradient (ΔpH) as the driving force for drug export (1, 2, 3).
      In Escherichia coli, Mdfa are identified to function in maintenance of a stable cytoplasmic pH under conditions of alkaline stress.
      This process is mainly activated by the cross membrane proton electrochemical gradient .changing the electrochemical electric potential of proton built by respiration chain to the cross membrane Na+ electrochemical potential. From research about the Na+/ H+ antiporter of E.coli, mdfa can pump Na+ out of cell when it pumps H+ into cell and ATP is consumed through the process. (4)
Secondary structure model of MdfA (5). TMSs of 19 to 21 hydrophobic amino acid residues were chosen based on the hydropathyproﬁle. Positively charged residues are in bold-face type, and the transport protein’s consensus footprint (11, 14) is emphasized in the loop between TMS 2 and TMS3 (numbers at top of panel C indicate TMSs).
METHOD
      The sequence of Mdfa was from GenBank. After primer design, pcr and gene sequencing, we linked Mdfa to a strong promoter and RBS(BBa_K608002). Then the product, Mdfa device(BBa_K1350006) has been done. (6) We both single digested and double digested the Mdfa+pSB1C3(BBa_K1350005) and promoter+RBS+Mdfa+pSB1C3(BBa_K1350006)to testify if we have inserted the Mdfa and promoter+RBS +Mdfa successfully"
Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," use this energy it to break down carbon dioxide as well as molecular nitrogen, and create biologically available carbohydrates and nitrogen. We considered a design for a system that would ensure the cyanobacteria was well supplied and that could feed the products into the mycelium matrix.  The source of the nutrients required for cyanobacteria growth would in part be provided by the martian regolith as well as the atmosphere and would be supplemented with any lacking nutrients by fertilizer brought from earth. The mycelium layer provides the main functionality in the system, providing structural stability, radiation protection and insulation and can be functionalized to provide additional benefits such as water filtration. The mycelium from the species we used in our experiments as well as many others produces edible mushrooms which astronauts could eat. Our design requires some robotic assembly.
In order for our mission to succeed we have made some assumptions which are based on expert advice in the field. Talking to Planetary Geologist Jim Head, we came to the conclusion that a landing site in the Deuteronilus Mensae portion of Mars would be the most suitable. Deuteronilus mensae is near the equator so there is less seasonal temperature flux. It is still far enough from the equator that it can still recieve ice and dust accumulation and currently there is a strong hope that there is a large body of ice water within 10m of the surface in this area according to Head. The region also has a lower elevation and thus thicker atmosphere which will provide more nutrients and protection to our system as well as helping slow down any lander we send to the area.
Radiation Protection
Our group also considered the radiation environment on Mars as well as some possible solutions. Since Mars has little atmosphere nor a magnetic field to protect it from radiation, solar flares, solar ultraviolet radiation and galactic cosmic rays can bombard the surface and could cause serious damage to life forms (Zeitlin et al. 2004). For comparison, the amount of total radiation incident on an astronaut over the course of 180 day transit and 500 days on the martian surface is almost 200 times as much as a person who remained on earth would receive over an equal amount of time (Hassler et al. 2014). This amount of radiation incident is enough to rapidly kill any life form as we know it, and is thought to have sterilized the surface and some of the subsurface of Mars (Dartnell 2011). If humans are ever to live on the surface of Mars, the problem of radiation must be addressed.
While there are many proposed solutions to mitig"

Not only was this a great experience for the team in having to explain and instruct in the most pedagogical way possible - reaching out to everyone is important - but also for the participants themselves for doing something completely unique in Sweden.

Our Primary School Creativity in Materials programme
We reached out to a primary school (students aged 5-11) and targeted a class of 9-11 year olds at the beginning of their school year to undertake a project considering the application of different materials for different products and uses.
This project had a totally different pitch to the case studies for older students and the Makerspace workshops we had planned. Of course it was a far cry from the realms of our usual work too, and this made it all the more challenging to prepare!
What did we do?
We decided to base this project fully on our wet lab work, but at a very basic level. We introduced mainstream concepts in material properties (why we choose which materials for which purpose), before evolving this into another creative exercise.
We described how and why spider web was a desirable material to manipulate in various ways (such as for SMITe) but also introduced students to a number of ways other scientists around the world have developed and modified spider silk into fabrics or biological materials. This included a video on 'bullet proofing' skin with spider silk, which appeared to influence our audience considerably more than the other resources we promoted!
We communicated this workshop style learning exercise through an online web resource, as we had also done for the older school students, however this time the time frame was dictated by individual teachers.
The final part of the exercise was to design a futuristic use of spider silk and or think of a way another natural material could become useful in society.
We asked for the students’ ideas to be communicated back to us, with the overall endeavour to further develop some of the best concepts and feed our interpretation back to the students. With this aspect we aimed to show how they could be instrumental in shaping our future lifestyles. The school were delighted to be involved in our project and fitted the work in alongside their focus on ‘aspirations’ and basic sciences.
Innovation comes in all formats and the resulting ideas from the students were varied to say the least:
Spider silk to be incorporated into an iPhone screen cover or case, a bulletproof 'skin' to line soldiers helmets in combat, and spider silk incorporated into a grapple for rock climbing were among the suggestions- see Integrated HP for more details.
Two examples of student's work are shown below.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html," respective part of bpsA.  b) E. coli TOP10 co-transformed with modified versions of indC and the PPTase sfp The co-tranformation of the modified indC-(bpsA-T) plasmids described above with a second  plasmid coding for the PPTase Sfp shows that only three domain border combinations can be  used for exchanging the indC T-domain with the T-domain of bpsA. These are the  combinations A1, A2 and C1. We applied combination A2 for further T-domain exchanges.
Figure 9: Applying optimized domain border combinations by T-domain exchange of native NRPS T-domains As described above, we determined an optimized domain border combination for the exchange of the native indC T-domain with the T-domain of the indigoidine synthetase bpsA. We applied this border combination (previously referred to as ''A2'') to the T-domains of the NRPS modules entF, delH4, delH5, tycA1, tycC6, plu2642 and plu2670, replacing the indC T-domain with the respective fragments of those modules. This figure shows three transformants with a blue phenotype in which the indC T-domain was exchanged by the T-domain of the respective NRPS module. The pictures were taken after 60 hours of incubation at room temperature. Once more one can see the differences in growth kinetics due to the production of indigoidine: Cells expressing the indC variant with the T-domain of bpsA  grow very slow and form small and dark blue colonies, whereas cells expressing other variants grow faster. Comparing the images on the very right, we suggest that cells expressing indC with the T-domain of plu2642 produce the most indigoidine in the given timeframe, compared to both the delH4- and the bpsA-variant. The combination of the plu2642 T-domain and the indC indigoidine synthetase seems to be ideal, concerning both indigoidine production and overall growth.
Figure 10:  Synthetic T-domains in combination with different PPTases lead to distinct differneces in indogoidin production.
Figure 11: Indigoidine production over time is not a strictly monoton function
Discussion
In this subproject, we wanted to set the basis for engineering entirely synthetic NRPS modules composed of user-defined domains.  As model system, we used the unimodular indigoidine synthetase"

Superoxide dismutase
“[...] are a class of enzymes that catalyze the dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. As such, they are an important antioxidant defense in nearly all cells exposed to oxygen. One of the exceedingly rare exceptions is Lactobacillus plantarum and related lactobacilli, which use a different mechanism.” - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase
""Histological examination of involved and uninvolved epidermis in vitiligo revealed evidence for peroxidative damage to both keratinocytes and melanocytes. Superoxide dismutase is important for the generation and disproportionation of superoxide anion. As a consequence of UV irradiation, superoxide anion and reactive oxygen species are generated in the skin."" - Efficacy of antioxidants as an adjunct to photochemotherapy in vitiligo: A case study of 30 patients

""To offset the harmful effects of ROS, cells have evolved protective mechanisms that utilize antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutases (SODs) and hydroperoxidases, which scavenge superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide"" - Expression of a Heterologous Manganese Superoxide Dismutase Gene in Intestinal Lactobacilli Provides Protection against Hydrogen Peroxide Toxicity
Nina: There seems to be several SODs. We have to check out which one is preferable for us.
""Superoxide dismutases (SODs) (EC 1.15.1.1) are metalloenzymes that catalyze the conversion of the superoxide anion into hydrogen peroxide and dioxygen (38). There are three forms of the enzyme that are distinguished by their metal center: manganese, copper-zinc, or iron (25). These enzymes are found across a broad range of organisms, which can use one, two, or all three enzymes to meet their antioxidant needs (25). For example, Escherichia coli possesses all three isoforms (7, 32, 60). In most Streptococcus and Lactococcus spp., elimination of ROS conform to this general antioxidant defense system since they both possess MnSOD (46, 52).

In this section, the step by step functioning of our application,     along with the encapsulation of the algorithmic concepts of ‘standardization’     of functional iGEM devices are depicted in pictorial forms called flowcharts.     Rectangular boxes represent the encapsulation of implementations of     the computer programs to perform the particular tasks stated in that     box on the flowcharts. These boxes are sometimes called subprograms,     objects or packages in Object Oriented software Engineering context.     The diamonds represent decision branching and they are found between     two rectangular boxes. The arrows show the direction in which subprograms     work and communicate. The subprogram at the head of the arrow starts     executing after the termination of the subprogram at the tail of the     arrow. Following flowcharts are the high level representations of our     algorithms developed for the BioGuide software.

Information about the iGEM parts had to be collected in a standardized     format for our application to function properly. Following data collection     custom subprograms is needed to parse and forward the data the application’s     database. In order to achieve this we have designed and implemented     the algorithm shown in diagram 1. In this algorithm, the first stage     was to find the list of part IDs of devices which were supplied by iGEM     in Spring 2010 distribution. This information has been collected from     two sources 1) plate files in excel format which was available online     2) device data provided in xml format, both provided by iGEM. The last     step in the algorithm was to send the collected partID data to the application’s     database.

Overview
The outreach project is of great importance in our whole iGEM program. To make more people know about what synthetic biology is and help them consider the safety of biotechnology, our team have divided  our project into several sections.
The students' synthetic biology group have conducted GMF safety activity in our campus to help students reach a further understanding of transgenosis and synthetic biology. A training camp was held for members of the group during the winter.
Our synthetic biology lab have welcomed some visitors from the outside and show them how we conduct our work. The open day were done during the week of science of USTC, getting a great range of people involved.
Lectures were held for students from the high school summer camp, providing them a general impression of synthetic biology.
Collaborations with Xiamen University and Nanjing University were done to help the team prepare for the Asia Jamboree.
The safety of our project is taken into fully consideration before we start, with discussion with our professor and proper rules followed, the risks of our work should be minimal.( know more about the safety )
Students' Synthetic Biology Group
The leaflets of our activity.
Started by the team members of iGEM USTC in 2012, the students' synthetic biology group has developed into a healthy organization which contributes a lot to the promotion of synthetic biology in our campus . This year, the group have conducted GMF safety activity which helps the students in our campus get a further understanding of transgenosis and synthetic biology.
Also,the recruiting campaign was conducted to attract more students in our campus to join us. To help these students better understand the field of synthetic biology, we held a training camp inside our campus during the winter vacation. This training camp is also aimed to choose the new iGEM members for the next year.

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

Human Practice and what we did to help another iGEM team!
Macquarie University and Tsinghua University joined forces to build a better biobrick!
Tsinghua and Macquarie iGEM Teams have strengthened their bonds with Sydney Meetup and demonstrated a good example of Human Practice.
On 27 September, on behalf of Tsignhua iGEM Team, GU Xiang has paid a visit to Macquarie University. Yagiz Alp Aksoy, leader of Macquarie iGEM Team, has welcomed GU Xiang and introduced him to other iGEMers at Macquarie. They caught Hilal on action in the lab. “I am so excited to finally see each other” said Hilal. They have visited the “iGEM Labs” at Biology and Chemistry&Biomolecular Sciences Departments. Bright scientist of Tsinghua was amazed by the technology used at Macquarie. Then it was time to get into action. Two teams have been helping each other for a long time and there were many questions to be asked many topics to be discussed.
They have started with biosafety and ethics topics related to the iGEM. Since Tsinghua Team is an experienced follower of iGEM, GU Xiang shared his team’s ideas about biosafety then Macquarie Team has explained what necessary precautions and action they took before starting their experiments. GU Xiang was surprised to see how strict the biosafety regulations are in Macquarie. After highlighting the essential points on biosafety and ethics, it was time for GU Xiang to demonstrate his expertise in Wiki-design. He shared his experiences with Macquarie Team how to build an effective and efficient wiki. Then presentation of projects took place followed by mind-blowing brainstorm and discussions. It was climax of the day when Yagiz Alp asked “why don’t we use our light switch system to screen and select your antibodies?”. Because the Macquarie’s E. coli light switch is designed to serve as a fundamental biobrick"

WHY WHEY?
Whey is a component of milk, which separates after curdling when rennet or an edible acidic substance are added. It represents one of the main by-products of the cheese and casein industry. It is a mixture of different substances, some of which potentially valuable if extracted and individually processed. As reported in the following table, the main solid components of whey are soluble proteins, lactose, mineral salts and vitamins. In this section a summary of ""Ethanol? Whey not!"" project results is reported. For more information you can visit Parts Characterization section, in which you can find a documentation for each every single BioBrick involved in this project.
*Scotta is the denomination of the whey resulting from ricotta production process.
This liquid waste is commonly regarded as the ""environmental problem"" of the cheese factories, which generally produce wheys of different content depending on the specific productive process  and kind of cheese.
In Italy, as in other countries with an important casearian tradition, the amount of whey produced every year is huge (8-10 million m^3/year). Differently from other countries in the central/nord Europe, in Italy the 85% of the milk produced is transformed in cheese by an high number of small/medium creameries, spread on the whole territory. Until some year ago, whey was given to pigs or introduced directly into the river systems, thus contributing to the organic pollution of environment and giving rise to water asphyxia. Its high nutrient load, in fact, causes the proliferation of microorganisms which deplete oxygen levels in the surface water systems. For this reason, the Italian law classifies whey as ""special waste"". Two indicators are commonly used to measure the nutrient load: B.O.D.5 and C.O.D..
B.O.D. 5 (Biochemical Oxigen Domand 5)
It is an index to measure the oxygen need within 5 days (in mg/l), for the oxidation processes of the organic substances present in waste"
Valencia_Biocampus,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Molecular_-_-_TEXT.html,"isation of this construction .
TEMPERATURE-INDUCED PROMOTER
This construction is made up of three parts:
The transcription factor-binding site inside the promoter
the coding sequence, which contains a synthetic fluorescent (red) protein. Our construction uses the well-known high chaperon expression when the bacterium      is suffering from heat shock [1]. We have taken the promoter sequence of groE, one of these proteins highly produced when heat shock [2].   When is the protein synthesized? In order to obtain the red fluorescent protein a condition has to be met. High temperatures for E. coli must be reached, like for example from 42ºC degrees. We focused on 44ºC because here we got the best results.
The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is as follows: high temperatures are sometimes harmful for microorganisms, so they have adapted successfully for such a strong condition by synthesizing some proteins, called HSP (Heat Shock Proteins), that help in protein folding. Heat-shock response is mediated by the sigma32 factor [3]. This alternative sigma factor allows the RNA polymerase to bind to some consensus promoter sequence. groE has this sequence in its promoter [4]. That is because this gene encodes a chaperon protein, GroE. Chaperone proteins are a group of proteins present in all cells; many of them are heat shock proteins, whose function is to assist the folding of other proteins in the newly formed protein synthesis.
In the case of GroE, it processes a nonnative polypeptide in a cycle consisting of three steps. First, the polypeptide substrate is captured by GroEL. Upon binding of the co-chaperone GroES and ATP, the substrate is then discharged into a unique microenvironment inside of the chaperone, which promotes proper folding. After hydrolysis of ATP, the polypeptide is released into solution. Moreover, GroE may actively increase the folding efficiency, e.g. by unfolding of misfolded protein molecules. This chaperon has an important role in heat shock process too, helping other proteins not to denature.
How did we deal with this construction? We were able to activate the promoter after a heat shock, like keeping the culture at 44ºC during 5 min. However, since we wanted a very good modeling for this construction, we developed a lot of experiments with different temperatures, different times of incubation, as well as gradating the temperature ranging from 37ºC to 46ºC.

Troubleshooting -- Wiki course
     On August 23th, we prepared a wiki course for NTHU_Formosa, helping them to troubleshoot on their difficulties of writing their wiki. First of all, we taught them the concept and process of designing a website as an introduction.  Second, we introduced how to use HTML, CSS, as well as  JavaScript. Third, we helped them to build up a simple RWD website step by step to make them more familiar with the web languages. Finally, we gave them some tips and advices on editing their wiki. We’re really happy about having such a chance to share our knowledge with other iGEM teams! Hope the course could help them in a meaningful way. We’re looking forward"

- Then, the tube 2 was plugged and maintained with the thumb while another iGEM mate was adding the bacterial suspention of WT B. subtilis into the tube 1.
- The tube 1 was also plugged and only then the thumb could be removed from the tube 2.
- In the same way, the N-Acetylglucosamine was added in the tube 2.
- The same process was made with xylose as a positive control.
NB: According to the paper ""Chemotaxis towards sugars by B. subtilis, (Ordal et al., 1979), glucose and xylose have the same attractant power. We have privileged a positive control instead of a negative one as we were not sure that this system was efficient.
- The system was kept straight for 2 hours. Every 40 minutes, samples from each were removed and streaked on solid medium (dilution 1/1,000) in order to estimate the bacterial concentration.
Figure 8: Photography of the tubes system
Unfortunately, the dilution was too high to detect any chemotaxis movement. As we did not find any information in the litterature and did not have enough time to optimize this protocol, we decided to test again and possibly ameliorate the first protocol from the Imperial college 2011 iGEM team : the tips capillary test.
5. Tips capillary system
First tips capillary system
This protocol was adapted from The Imperial College 2011 iGEM team (See chemotaxis protocol ).
In the first tips capillary system, we used parafilm to avoid any kind of air disturbance in the tips. The different steps are described below:
- 15 µL of each chemo-attractant was pipetted.
- The bottom of tip with the pipette was then put on a piece of parafilm and the pipette was removed from the top of the tips.
- The tip was then sealed with a piece of parafilm in order to keep the liquid sterile and inside the tip.
- To finish, the level of the solution in the tip was marked.
Figure 9: Sealing of a tip with parafilm
- When all the chemo-attractants were added, the tips were fixed on a green support. The whole process can be seen on Figure 10.
- Each tip was then immersed into 300 µL of a bacterial suspension in the wells of an Elisa plate.

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," is widely used in researches concerning yeasts as a “marker gene” (systematic name YEL021W. URA3) and used as a label for chromosomes orplasmids. URA3 encodes Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase—an enzyme that catalyzes one reaction in the synthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleotides. We obtained the URA3 gene from the PRS416 plasmid，which worked as a vector for our functional genes.
Principle of operation
1) Pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway of S. cerevisiae
Fig.2 The pyrimidine metabolism pathway in yeasts
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the biosynthesis of pyrimidines involves the de novo synthesis of UMP from glutamine. Carbamoyl phosphate, derived from glutamine, undergoes a condensation reaction with aspartic acid, resulting in the formation of N-carbamoyl aspartic acid. Both the formation and subsequent condensation of carbamoyl phosphate are performed by Ura2p. The pyrimidine ring of N-carbamoyl aspartic acid is closed by the elimination of water to form dihydroorotic acid (DHO), which is subsequently oxidized to form orotic acid (OA), and a ribose-phosphate group is then added to form orotidine 5′-monophosphate (OMP). The formation of OMP is performed by two isoenzymes, Ura5p and Ura10p. OMP is then decarboxylated to yield UMP, which may subsequently be processed to form other pyrimidines. Regulation of this pathway occurs at several levels. First, UTP down-regulates the enzymatic activity of Ura2p and transcription of the URA2gene. Second, under conditions of pyrimidine starvation, transcription of the URA1, URA3, URA4, and URA10 genes (the URA genes) is increased some three- to eightfold. This increase in transcription is dependent on a transcriptional activator, Ppr1p.
2) Usage in yeast research
The URA3 gene in the yeasts used in lab has already been deleted. Hence the loss of ODCase activity leads to a lack of cell growth unless uracil or uridine is added to the media. The presence of the URA3 gene in yeast restores ODCase activity, facilitating growth on media not supplemented with uracil or uridine, thereby allowing selection for"

We are working towards to introducing an inducible system that allows tunable fatty acid uptake regulated by fatty acid concentrations. To test our promoters, fatty acid has to be added in the cell culture medium. It is however known that high fatty acid levels could lead to apoptosis by inducing stress responses. So in order to determine the range of fatty acid concentration suitable for testing, we conducted cell viability tests using MTT assay under different sodium palmitate concentrations. Our desired concentration range should keep at least 60% of cells alive after 24 hours incubation and/or at least 50% alive in 48 hours.
Fatty Acid Quantification
To differentiate between the fatty acid amount added to the medium versus the actual fatty acid amount inside the medium, we investigated two fatty acid quantification methods: 1) Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrophotometry (GC-MS), and 2) fatty acid quantification kit (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO). While we managed to measure the fatty acid quantity in cell culture medium using GC-MS, we were not able to use the fatty acid quantification kit due to time limitations.

Abstract
We investigated the properties of a novel yet under-researched group of proteins called reflectins.
Reflectins are interesting and unusual because of their self-organising properties, which cause them to produce dynamic structural colour.
We expressed codon-optimised reflectin in E. coli, and investigated the proteins' in vivo and in vitro effects.
Structural Colour
Nature’s colours don’t just come from pigments, but from structure too.
Cephalopods camouflage themselves using intracellular structures made from reflectins.
These are the only known proteinaceous structures to exhibit structural colour. They are inspiring a new class of responsive optical materials.
Impact of iGEM
We wanted to know what effect the iGEM competition has had on its past contestants.
We were also interested in what past participants thought of iGEM and how it shaped their view of synthetic biology.
We got in touch with a number of iGEM alumni and asked them to share their experience.
Tools
We used Gibson Assembly exclusively to build our constructs during the competition. This allowed us to do multi-part assemblies faster and with fewer bugs than if we had used standard techniques.
We contributed to a collection of software tools called Gibthon (initiated by Cambridge iGEM 2010), which aids the design of primers for Gibson assembly.

Aix-Marseille,2018,Team:Aix-Marseille#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"^2 c = D\times\Delta c \end{equation}
With \(\Delta\) being the Laplacian operator. This equation is called the Heat equation and is well known to model various transfer problems.  In our case, this equation models the diffusion of pheromones, in the absence air flow.  In a 2D environment, the equation would be :
\begin{equation} \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = D\times\Delta c = D\times(\frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial y^2}) \end{equation}
Adapt the equation to our model, discretization
Even though we have our mathematical model, we still have to adapt it to our program. In order to do it, we use the finite difference method to approximate the solution of our equation. This method allows the program to compute on every position the approximate solution of our equation. By this, we are able to monitor the diffusion of the phermones at each point in time and space. Finite difference method can be achieved through various ways. Here, and even though the implicit method is stabler we choose the Euler's explicit method, since it is the simplest method for us to use.
This method allow discretization through 3 steps :
Splitting time and space
We firstly need to split each time an space variable in order to compute the variable at each point and time.
Here, we splitted the coordinates with the same value, noted \(\Delta a\) (with \(a\) either x, y or t) for each type of coordinates. It is written as follows :
\begin{equation} x_i = i\times\Delta x \end{equation} \begin{equation} y_j = j\times\Delta y \end{equation} \begin{equation} t_n = n\times\Delta t \end{equation}
Discretization of the equation
We now need to translate the equation from a continuous to a discrete way, in order to make the computation of the solution possible. There is 3 elements to be descretized in our equation: \(\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}\), \(\frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial x^2}\) and \(\frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial y^2}\). In the first case, the partial derivative can be discretized as follows:

It is hoped that once the alkane can ultimately enter β-oxidation, it will subsequently enter the TCA cycle by the cell’s natural processes so that it can serve as a carbon source for Shewanella to generate electricity. However, some of the aforementioned proteins are actually made from subunit peptides. Therefore, to enable such a metabolic pathway, theoretically a total of 9 genes are necessary. The genes AssA1, AssB1, AssC1, AssD1 code for subunits that form alkylsuccinate synthase, assisted by AssE1 that encodes for a chaperone-like protein. AssK1 encodes for CoA transferase. McmSS and McmLS code for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. And finally, Dalk_1740 codes for Carboxyl Transferase. The original plan was to transform all of them into Shewanella but the complexity of the genes posed a major challenge, one which we intend to solve next year.
Therefore, by engineering AlkL and the alkane metabolic pathway into Shewanella, we hope it provides a bridge between PE degradation and exo-electrogenicity.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
Best Basic Part Special Prize
To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.

Yunfan LI
Riding the subway with my MP3 is the most enjoyable thing I can imagine.
Yunfan is a sophomore majoring in biology in UCAS.
He gets a pretty memorable experience with his fantastic teammates and sapiential tutors and learns a lot in the lab. That really promotes his gcolumnth in both knowledge level and spiritual level. He also recognizes what he is truly interested in and figures out his future researching plan in cell oxidation and reduction.
He spends most of his time on fighting with the experiment in lab and draws the vestigial energy out for the hardware designing and circuit welding. The interlab work is also finished by him.
Like most schoolboys in campus, he loves computer games and sports and can play badminton quite well. Taking the public transport for aimless roaming is also his favor. However, no one can strip the comic out of his life. Remember! No one!!!

Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA. (pic3.LED v/pic4.LED a)
To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

Introduction
Needless to say, in research, we have to cooperate with others materially and informationally. Otherwise, we cannot expect any development in our research, because working alone only leads us to a deadlock.  This is also true to our iGEM activities. However, since iGEM is an organization by only undergraduates, it is difficult to collaborate with the exterior, compared with the general laboratories which have relation with academic meetings. Therefore we face some difficulties which arise when managing the laboratory only by undergraduates. Moreover, we often face difficulties caused by lack of sufficient experience. Because of these special situations, it is difficult for iGEM teams to ask for help to other organizations. However, problems peculiar to iGEM teams are easy to be understood by other teams. Therefore, we iGEM teams have to connect with each other positively. By asking other teams for help, we can smoothly carry out our research, and by helping out other teams, we can reconfirm some problems. Cooperating with other iGEM teams carrying the same problem leads to a hiring the quality of our research.
Support
iGEM has been developing and the number of the teams participating in iGEM has been increasing. There are new teams from many countries every year. The more teams in iGEM, the more viewpoints we get.  By helping each other, we can get out of experimental difficulties and our projects can reach a higher degree of perfection.
However, managing a team by only undergraduates is not easy, because we have to operate the laboratories by ourselves regardless of our knowledge. So, newly joining is very difficult without other team’s help.  Therefore, this year, iGEM Kyoto helped Biwako_Nagahama to establish their team, and succeeded in increasing the number of iGEM teams. We have helped this new team in the ways listed below.

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Women Association (KUWA)
Our iGEM team contacted Kabugho Beatrace through Hank Pellissier of the Brighter Brains Institute. KUWA is a women’s group based in the Kasese Municipality of Uganda. They assist marginalized women in the surrounding villages by providing them condoms, sanitary products, feminine hygiene education, and economic empowerment. They reside in the Bukonzo county which is “rated among the poorest counties where women live below poverty line and one [Ugandan citizen] survives on less than one US dollar a day” (Kabugho Beatrace, chairperson of KUWA). Read More >> According to Beatrace, the population of Kasese increases every day due to high birth rates. At the same time, there is also a high infant mortality rate, as many mothers are too unhealthy to bear a child. The only contraception available in Bukonzo county are condoms sold in remote pharmacies. According to Beatrace, the condoms are placed near registers and customers are often too afraid to be seen purchasing condoms due to stigma. When we spoke with Beatrace, she was very supportive of our new contraceptive. She works closely with other women’s groups in Uganda and contacted them to discuss our new method and provide us their input on our project’s safety, maintainability, and cost. Our team is extremely grateful for Kabugho Beatrace and the connections she provided us.
Kyogha Women
Our conversation with the Kyogha women was informative. Their chairperson, Esther, told us that her group has been on the search for advanced, safe birth control methods for a while now. Her group recently visited Makerere University in Uganda to see if they can “make an advanced birth control method that is also accessible with less side effects”. She’s spent many years implementing family planning programs and trying to address the stigma on birth control. As with other groups, she mentioned that people fear purchasing birth control because they fear ""being laughed at"". We hope that our new birth control method will contribute to the new market of affordable and safe contraceptives. We also want to design our packaging to be more discreet so Esther and other women feel comfortable using it.
Nyakiyumbu Widows Association
We reached out to the Nyakiyumbu Widow’s Association, they were interested in our contraception method. Muhindo Nyesi, chairperson of the NWA, stopped replying to our emails soon after. Our team wondered if her group lost interest, but we soon learned the reason for her absence; Nyesi’s nephew was hit by a car and,"

Figure 5. STEP system test for D-Dimer and in HeLa cells. (a) Test of D-Dimer-STEP in HEK293T. 4 paralleled experiments of TC/PC = 12, total quantity = 3.25 μg/ml test were done using the D-Dimer-STEP, and the dynamic range reached 3.17 folds.  (b) Test of VEGF-STEP in HeLa. 4 paralleled experiments were carried out, but the dynamic range was only 1.49 folds in HeLa cells.
Conclusion
As is suggested by our model , there must be a certain set of conditions that will lead to the largest dynamic range as well as the expression level. These conditions will be further explored in our future experiments, and be applied in real clinical cases.

Collaborations
Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. During our project we have met many inspiring people who have helped us, some of them we have listed in Attributions . But we have saved a special place for our fellow iGEM teams who have helped us. As an iGEM team ourselves we know how little time everyone has and we are very impressed with the amount of help we received and the happenings arranged by other teams:
DTU Biobuilders
We had a fantastic workshop weekend hosted by DTU in the beginning of our project. Our team benefitted a lot from the introduction to different Synthetic Biology techniques, especially since our team is such an interdisciplinary group with a limited background in lab work. We received safety introductions, learned how to do PCR, and had our first real team experience together. DTU biobuilders have also shared their template for funding application with us. A big thank you to our friends at DTU for putting together a fun weekend and for being great teamworkers. Read more about the DTU BioBrick Workshop .
SDU iGEM
SDU helped us by having a wiki-presentation held at the DTU workshop mentioned above. SDU won for best wiki in 2013 and 2014 and hence had a many good considerations and tricks for making a wiki simple, visually soothing and efficient at the same time. See this years team and their beautiful web design
Stockholm iGEM
Uppsala iGEM
We travelled to Uppsala, Sweden to participate in the Nordic iGEM Meetup hosted by the Stockholm and Uppsala iGEM teams together. There were iGEM teams present from Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. It was a really fun weekend and we had the opportunity to practice presenting our project for the first time. We got a lot of feedback and got to spend discuss our ideas and progress with the other teams from the region. Nordic iGEM Meetup"

Entrepreneurship Award
We believe Aptapaper has the potential to be a real, life saving product. To help facilitate our bench to bedside process, our team entered Aptapaper in the OptiMize Social Innovation Challenge and won $5000 to continue our research and development along with $6000 in stipends to work on the project over the summer and receive entrepreneurial training. OptiMize is a year long social entrepreneurship competition where teams receive training in critical entrepreneurial skills, as well as network and develop contacts in the business world to help facilitate making their ideas into reality. Our team took OptiMize's mantra, ""Why not me?"" to heart, working tirelessly to perform market research, consult attorneys about IP protection options, and consult with succesful entrepreneurs on how to make Aptapaper a reality. We developed an especially close relationship with one such entrepreneur, Grace Hsia (CEO of Warmilu LLC). Among other things, Grace was able to offer us valuable advice about traversing the difficult path of getting a healthcare related device approved for use. We also sent a representative to MCON, a conference in Washington, DC for millennial social entrepreneurs and innovators to network. Closer to home, we attended Ann Arbor Health Hacks, and were able to get valuable feedback from various local health experts. We plan to continue developing Aptapaper and, once finished, hope to license it to a biotechnology company to bring the product to the market, then partner with non-governmental organizations to help distribute Aptapaper and begin helping tuberculosis patients around the world."
Dalhousie_Halifax_NS,2016,Team:Dalhousie Halifax NS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the Microbiome Survey section
The 16S rRNA gene contains nine variable regions, some of which are flanked with constant regions that can be used to amplify smaller fragments that contain the variable regions. These variable regions help us assign taxonomy. For 16S sequencing using high-throughput assays, it generally requires a smaller piece of DNA, so these constant regions can be useful when the input size is smaller than the entire gene.
Metagenomic Library
When we first begun our project we had every intention of constructing a metagenomic library using the porcupine fecal sample as our environmental isolate. However, as other areas of the research began to erupt in exciting results, the library got put on the back burner. That being said, we did begin the construction of the library with the help from the Waterloo iGEM team who provided the pJC8 cosmid, to be used as the vector for our library construction. Waterloo iGEM also sent us a protocol to help with our environmental metagenomic library construction. Although we didn’t get too far with the library, we did make some changes to the protocol to make the construction procedure more efficient.
We were originally interested in developing the metagenomic library as it would provide the ability to assess and exploit the whole microbial genomic composition found in our environmental sample. Metagenomics, in comparison to phytogenic surveys, does more than look at the diversity of one gene (ex. 16s rRNA gene). Metagenomics can provide insight into enzymatic pathways, evolutionary profiles, and microbial function.
Metagenomics provides the chance to search through the incredible biodiversity found in the environment without having to conform the sample to fit within standard laboratory techniques. When we finish constructing the library, we will use it to search for enzymatic and chemical pathways that are involved in cellulose-degradation.
How to make a metagenomic library (in short):
Isolation of the DNA. It is important that the sample collected represents the entirety of the environment being examined. We used chloroform extraction to isolate large pieces of DNA from the porcupine fecal sample.
Manipulation of the DNA. To be used in further downstream processes, the large environmental DNA pieces were cut by restriction enzymes which act at specific sites called restriction sites
Incorporation into a vector. A vector is a DNA molecule that can carry foreign genetic material into another cell. It can then use the host cell macromolecular synthesis machinery to produce proteins encoded by the foreign genetic material. Vectors usually contain a selectable marker which can confer antibiotic resistance. The incorporation of the vector into a model"

Microscopy Test to characterize KinA
Today we tried to test our transformed colonies with IPTG and get the results with microscope. We had overnight cultures in MM medium as if we were going to transform them. Our overnight cultures were in 25 ml of MM competence medium. We prepared the tubes as below. For each of them we prepared a flask with IPTG and without IPTG. IPTG was added after an hour we prepared them.
ON Culture 1 + MM medium
ON Culture 2 + MM medium

B. subtilis 168 WT + MM
B. subtilis transformed with gfp-rrnb + MM
Every 30 minutes we took samples and recorded the growth curve.
We did not have good results using microscopy because our ON cultures did not grow very well. There was not much bacteria in the samples. Tomorrow we will repeat the same experiment but this time we will grow them in LB.
We prepared the LB+CHL and LB+CHL+Em solutions and inoculated the cultures. For B. subtilis we use

We did a PCR (His_F and and His_R primers) on 24 of the 48 cultures we grew and sent them off for sequencing.
Results of NM culture:
The selection strain (∆HisB∆pyrF∆rpoZ+pKD46) did not grow in NM, which is worrisome.  None of the MAGE samples grew in NM either, so either they all have HisB knocked out or there is something wrong already with the strain's His pathway.
We will grow up selection strain (without pKD46) from glycerol stock in LB+tet and transform with Vatsan's plasmid tomorrow to see if that has any effect on the his-deficiency phenotype.
Kan-ZFB insertion: modified nucleotides:
Primers finally arrived that would put modified nucleotides on the 5' ends of the insert, which should improve lambda red efficiency.
PCR: KAPA protocol with Kan forward phosphorthioate and URA2 reverse phosphorthioate, 56˚C annealing, 90 sec elongation, 25 cycles, 1µL kan-ZFB-hisura DNA as template
Results: PCR only produced a smaller side product. This is strange since we also ran a gel of all our different kan-ZFB-hisura purifications and they all run at the correct size (see images below).

Based on the integral form of the continuity equation for an incompressible fluid, at any given time, the sum of flow volume in each branch is equal to the total volume pumped in the whole chamber. According to the Kirchhoff's law, the accumulation of flow speed at the joint point must be zero. It is easy to get the equation that\begin{matrix} L_{AC}V_1=L_{AB}V_2+R_{AB} V_3 \\ V_2:V_3=R_{AB}:L_{AB} \end{matrix}
Consequently, we could reach the conclusion that the maximum velocity, average flow rate and the shear force on the bottom of each channel is at a ratio of 81 : 9 : 1. To verify the modeling result, we made calibration in the real microfluidics chip, and the testing result is very close to designing value (about 75 : 8 : 1 of the maximum velocity ratio in each channel) and the simulation result (80 : 8 : 1).
Experimental Result Analysis
In the whole experiment, we tested one mechanosensitive channel, Piezo1, with different magnitude orders of shear stress.
Comparing the fluorescence intensity amplitudes corresponded to the shear stress ranged from 0 Pa to 5 Pa, we found a best response at around 0.01-0.1 Pa. No response was observed when the shear stress is larger than 2 Pa.

Calibration
Rainbow beads (SPHEROTM Rainbow Calibration Particles, diameter: 6um) were dissolved in the cell culture medium. A series of pumped flow rate (5ul/min, 15ul/min, and 45ul/min) were applied to generate a steady fluid flow. The exposure time was set to 100ms (one representative image is shown in Fig. 6).

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," Digispark pretends to be a keyboard, that types the results extremely quickly into the computer it’s plugged into. The interpreter software can intercept this, along with other keyboard events for changing the settings to provide useful output.
As processing is shifted onto the device it’s plugged into, data analysis is much easier as readings can be automatically logged and exported to spreadsheets. With Judd-UK’s feedback, readings can be marked with ‘recording numbers’, making it easy to do batch measurements. Also based off their feedback, we added a button to export only the ‘recorded’ data to csv. See the collaborations page for more details.
Showing Judd-UK our fluorometer and densitometer.
This framework makes the device easier to modify as a few lines can be changed on the webpage rather than reconfiguring the Arduino board or rewiring the circuit with different components. This in turn also reduces the risk of irreversibly damaging the hardware through bugs in the code. Website programming is much more forgiving than Arduino programming, allowing people with less experience to modify the software. It is also much easier to debug as computers can spit out error messages to the screen.
Moving the complicated processing to the device it is plugged into also means you can use cheaper components in the fluorometer, further reducing the cost. It allows smaller and fewer components to be used, making the device more portable and easier to build.
The interpreter is designed to be used continuously. While the fluorometer is logging data, you can use the keyboard shortcuts to change the options.
Instructions
Our digisparks came with pins free - if yours do too, solder the pins to the board first so you can more easily swap components out if it doesn’t work.
To snap them simply use 2 sets of needle-nose pliers at the point you want them to break and twist.
If you don’t already have a soldering iron check your electrical engineering, physics department or local hackspaces. Most of the time they’ll give you instructions, but if not or you just want more guidance there’s lots of advice online on how to get started soldering. We were lucky enough to be trained by our physics teacher, but sparkfun’s guide looks pretty good too! Don’t hold us responsible for your safety - if in doubt ask someone who knows what they’re doing.
Our one warning is about the light sensors (TSL235R) - the pins are easy to break and they are fairly expensive so be careful with them!

The  BBa_K1976051 was made by performing a PCR on a product synthesized by IDT, using the primers M_RBS_DNAse_FW and suffix right.  Following that another PCR was performed using prefix right and suffix right and digesting it using EcoRI and PstI. Following that it was ligated into the backbone pSB1C3 which was digested the same way and dephosphorylated, using our standard protocol for the antarctic phosphatase. Following that using the standard T4 protocol, these fragments were ligated together. E. coli Top10 were then transformed with the ligated plasmid. Following that a colony PCR was performed to check for the proper band height.

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

Through testing our bacteria with gasoline last year, we hoped to one day be able to implement our engineered cells directly onto an oil spill and be able to watch our cells degrade the harmful oil from the environment.  To better understand what this would entail, we interviewed a professional in the field, Dr. Terry Hazen who uses microbial ecology and environmental engineering to research bioremediation and oil recovery.
While interviewing Dr. Hazen, he explained how we would approach our project in regard to implementation, as well as general tips surrounding permits, patents, and other projects dealing with hydrocarbon degradation.

After coming up with a prototype for the screening system, we arranged for a second meeting with Dr. Chen on the 23rd of May, to make sure it is practicable. Dr. Chen suggested that we should divide our project into two subparts, which we carried out simultaneously because of our short on time. Also, to let us practice our cell culture technique, Dr. Chen provided a lot of dermal papilla cells for us, and we are very thankful for him.
Visit Dr. Chao-Ling Yao --Eukaryotic cell culture related study
To learn how to culture eukaryotic cells, we arranged a video conference with Dr. Chao-Ling Yao, an expert in stem cell research who specializes in dermal papilla. Thanks to the experiences he shared with us, we improved our experiment design and saved our project from unnecessary twist and turns.
Visit Dr. Tsair-Yuh Tzeng --Gene editing technique instruction and suggestions
Since the gene editing technique CRISPR has been popular, we considered using it to design a unique cell that can express the efficacy of the different drugs. We changed our mind after visiting Dr. Tsair-Yuh Tzeng at the NYMUVYM Genome Research Center, who told us that CRISPR is not only expensive but also not suitable for every project. Though the idea was a failure, the tour Dr. Tzeng gave us at the center was invaluable, and it opened a whole new world of research for us.
Visit Dr. Yi-wen Tsai —Understanding the practicability of questionnaires
As the practicability and safety of the project have reached a certain extent, we designed a set of questionnaires to make sure that our project reflects the true needs of the community. The questions include their use of medicines for hair loss and their suggestions for future medications. We showed our questionnaire to NYMU Institute of Health and Welfare Policy’s Dr. Yi-wen Tsai, who told us that even though we have a good intention, issuing the questionnaire would be a big problem, since we do not have access to the major crowd. Also, she pointed out that questionnaires can only give us a general view instead of the whole picture. Hence, to achieve higher credibility and effectiveness, we gave up the questionnaire and interviewed patients instead.

4)Talking to the society
The distance between the academia and the society, beyond restrict the demands that are addressed by science and make them apart from the societal needs, also interferes in the public acceptance of the projects developed by science. This subject was covered by our team work in the Synenergene project, which is described here.
To evaluate the public reaction about Synthetic Biology and our project, since we have the objective of using attenuated pathogens as a disease treatment, and to also assess the concerns and fears of the population about this approach, the team conducted a survey at different points of Belo Horizonte.
Overview of interviewees
Among a total of 302 people interviewed, 52.8% were female, and 46.9% were male (Figure 1).
Figure 1: The majority of the people interviewed had between 12 and 40 years(Figure 2)
Figure 2: Age of the interviewees.
The majority of the people interviewed has middle school to undergraduate degree (Figure 3).
Figure3: Education level of the interviewees.
Public background and opinion
In the survey questions on people’s opinions about genetically modified organisms (GMOs), most respondents (75%) showed that they were familiar with the concept, but the majority is unsure about the benefits they can provide (25.7% thinks they are bad for society and 34.2% do not know what to respond).  In some cases, the phrase ""that's playing God"" was mentioned (see Figures 4 to 10).
The two main mistrusts reported by the public were the possibility of something going wrong, leading to the creation of a more dangerous pathogen than the pre-existing one; and the lack of faith that the Leishmania strain is indeed apathogenic. Thus, further explanations were given about the specific proposal and about Synthetic Biology.
In some cases, an oppening to the idea was observed and people seemed more sympathetic to the project, leading to a detected 84.5% acceptance to the team’s proposal. The reactions detected in the survey’s results made the team realise that there is a lack of"

For our INP Biobrick we began with an INP-YFP (Yellow Fluorescent Protein) BioBrick created by the Edinburgh 2010 iGEM team. To this we added a sequence consisting of BglII, a FLAG tag and His tag (in different constructs), followed by a HindIII restriction site.

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Design and Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"otic pressure and communicate this information to the OmpR protein, by phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. When the osmotic pressure is high, the phosphorylated OmpR-P will inhibit the expression of OmpF and simultaneously bind to the promoter upstream of OmpC, increasing the expression of this membrane porin and hence stabilizing the osmotic pressure due to increased inflow of solutes.
Figure 1. Mechanism of promoter activation upon increased osmotic pressure.
By replacing the OmpC gene with the gene for our mucus-degrading enzyme, we take advantage of this OmpR responsive promoter and introduce a system capable of self-regulating its enzyme expression. Consequently, the higher the osmotic pressure (the thicker the mucus), the more mucus-degrading enzymes will be expressed.
How do we know that the activity of the OmpR promoter is truly dependent on changes in osmotic pressure?
iGEM Stockholm 2015 characterized the OmpR responsive promoter with RFP (BioBrick BBa_M30011). By cultivating the transformed bacteria in a sucrose gradient, ranging from 5% to 15%, and thereafter measuring the fluorescence of the RFP, they observed increasing fluorescence with increasing sucrose concentration. To prove that the increased activity of the OmpR promoter was truly dependent on the OmpR/EnvZ system, they performed the same experiment in an EnvZ deficient strain. They found a significant difference in fluorescence and could, therefore, conclude that the increased fluorescence was due to increased osmotic pressure and not due to more available nutrients.
The promoter was also characterized by iGEM UCL 2015. However, instead of testing it in a sucrose gradient, they performed their activity test in a salt gradient ranging from 0.05% to 0.4% NaCl. They reached the conclusion that the NaCl concentrations were too high for the bacteria to survive as they did not retrieve any conclusive results regarding the activity of the promoter.
How will we test our system?
To demonstrate that the activity of the promoter is increased when the osmotic pressure rises, we will use the same BioBrick, OmpR responsive promoter with downstream RFP, and protocol as iGEM Stockholm 2015. We will also test the system in a salt gradient, ranging from 0.00625% to 0.1% NaCl to elaborate on the work done by iGEM UCL 2015. By using a sucrose and salt gradient to represent the increase in osmotic pressure,"

However, what pleased me most was the complete autonomy which benefit iGEM teams. That’s why it seems to me that this experience is a formidable springboard toward research and entrepreneurship.

""I am a student in Science History and I am currently writing a thesis about typhus in Napoleon's 1813 Grande Armée. If I took part in iGEM, it was first because I missed sciences and because I wanted to broaden my interest. Afterwards, I understood that iGEM was, in addition to a fascinating adventure where we meet fantastic persons, useful in my university cursus. Indeed, I can ""dissect"" my friends, their moves, their habits. I can see the internal and external factors of a scientific project elaboration. I can study the team like I would study a XIXth Century team in the remit of the ""science studies"". A real luck for a future science historian! Thanks to iGEM, I understood that I do not want to stay in the classical historian experience, but to work in an interdisciplinary field. ""

With the three models mentioned above, we finally proved the accessibility of our roGFP2-Orp1 detecting method.
Fluorescent Probe Model (Chick                     here for details)
The model was established based on the mechanism of the fluorescence probe and we revised it                     according to the experimental results. From this model we can realize the conversion between                     fluorescence intensity of the probe and intracellular H2O2 concentration from                     overexpression of genes.
H2O2 Decomposition Model (Click                     here for details)
In our experiment, we found it was hard to measure the intracellular H2O2 concentration, so we controlled the external H2O2 concentration in culture to confirm our system's function because the H2O2 can entry the cell quickly through simple diffusion. So we fitted the relationship between two kinds of H2O2 concentration, through experimental data and ordinary differential equation based on the processes of H2O2 diffusion and decomposition in yeast cells. In this way, the mutual translation of external and intracellular H2O2 concentrations can be achieved.
roGFP2-Orp1 Michaelis equation model (Click                     here for details)
The model was established based on the mechanism of the Michealis equation to describe the                     relationship between intracellular H2O2 concentrations and the roGFP2                     fluorescence intensity changing. We simplified the process of the reaction between roGFP2-Orp1 and                     intracellular H2O2 as a classic Michealis equation, which helped us                     understanding this process better.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Market#_-_-_TEXT.html," initial price point that we hope to achieve is $100 per sampling, and $5,000 per detector system.
Comparing the financial data from other general toxin monitoring companies, it is clear that to be competitively priced we must be able to match or beat the pricing of the Microtox® system. Due to the high prohibitive cost of this monitoring technology, and the results of our manufacturing analysis , it would seem reasonable to select price points for our technology that are just below the cost of MicroTox® for the per unit cost of the cartridges, while selling our detection system at a much lower cost than our competitors. This will ensure that we can remain competitive, maintain high profitability (over 10x production cost for both the cartridges and the detector system), and expand new market avenues to private companies as well as small groups where price point would have a more dramatic effect on the amount of sales made. All of these key factors will highly influence our selling activities which are detailed below.
Financial Market Assessment - Can Our Technology Be Profitable?
The monitoring market is dominated by government regulation, oil sands mining companies and their respective consultant service companies are likely to use the products and technology dictated by government bodies.  Therefore, it is possible to capture a large portion of this market by gaining government support.  Regulation will be the key component in seeing success in this market place.  Our initial market therefore looks at the government mandated monitoring sites.  An overview of this market and its profitability follows:
General toxin sensing for oil and gas applications represents a $50 Million market opportunity. The potential market profitability based solely on this government framework:
Figure 12: Financial calculation.
Assuming that we can capture 30% of the target market, our company may reach a potential annual revenue of $2,250,000, factoring in the one-time sale of our detector unit. The market is expected to grow in the next three years (projected to 2015), due to an increase in the number of sampling sites for water monitoring according to the Joint Canada|Alberta Implementation Plan.
As identified in our financial assessment, in order for our company to be profitable we require 20,000 cartridge units sold at a cost of $100 per cartridge or 1,200 units of the detector at a price of $5,000. Provided that we capture 30% of the sensing market (150 operation sites with 100 samplings per year = $750,000 revenue from detector systems and $1,500,000 from cartridges) who fulfill the government of Alberta’s mandated water monitoring, this will take approximately 1 year of"

Penn,2011,Team:Penn#project#future-directions#_-_-_TEXT.html," other signaling mechanisms.  Another advantage with our system is that light propagation is almost instantaneous, inevitably making the signaling faster than a small molecule signaling mechanism, which is limited by diffusion rates.
The field of optogenetics uses an external light source to stimulate an ion channel to cause depolarization and a triggering of action potentials in a population of neurons.  This optogenetic method reconstitutes diseased cells by bypassing the upstage neural circuit and stimulating the downstage cells directly.  If this process could be regulated by a different cell population, then the triggering would be within the body and no outside light application would be necessary.  Our sender cell that has an output light signal intense enough to activate a light-induced ion channel such as Channelrhodopsin 2 would do just that.  Receiver cells engineered to respond to the light from sender cells could be designed to perform any desired function.  As an example, activated sender cells could signal to receiver cells to produce insulin, eliminating the requirement for diabetics to have an insulin pump or inject insulin using needles.
In conclusion, the fully optimized and characterized light-based cell signaling system that we envisioned for our project would prove extremely beneficial to both researchers and patients.

LMU-Munich,2014,Team:LMU-Munich#Project#Bakillus_-_-_TEXT.html,". They consist of an N-terminal cell wall binding (CWB) domain with a signal peptide directing export via the Sec pathway and of a C-terminal catalytic domain [3, 4]. Fusions of the CWB domains of LytC and LytE to heterologous proteins have been shown to successfully facilitate surface display of their passenger protein in B. subtilis [1, 2]. Another promising system is based on the B. subtilis sortase YhcS and its substrate YhcR. Sortases represent a class of membrane-anchored proteins in gram-positive bacteria, which recognize their substrates via a conserved C-terminal pentapeptide sequence. They catalyze covalent binding of their substrates to lipid II, an intermediate of peptidoglycan synthesis [5]. Two putative sortase-substrate pairs have been identified in B. subtilis, one of them being YhcS/YhcR, which has already been used for successful surface display of recombinant proteins [5, 6].
Pathogen-binding peptides
Bacterial adhesins mediate binding of the cells to all kind of surfaces, thereby preventing removal by physical influences like sheer forces. Attachment of pathogens to their host is often crucial for infection, which is why many adhesins are listed as virulence factors [7]. Binding partners of adhesins are often components of the extracellular matrix, which would be difficult to express on the BaKillus surface. In contrast, proteins of human cells that get bound by adhesins are optimal candidates for translational fusions to surface display systems. BaKillus mimics human cells by expressing parts of the proteins on its surface, leading to binding of the pathogens to BaKillus. Barbu et. al. 2010 [8] and Muchnik et. al. 2013 [9] used phage display to identify the binding peptide interaction partners of Staphylococcus aureus virulence factor SdrC and Streptococcus pneumoniae adhesin NOX, respectively. Those peptides are the specific binding sequences of SdrC and NOX within surface proteins of human cells. Thus, expression of the peptides on the BaKillus surface should enable it to adhere to the targeted pathogens.
