ULB-Brussels,2011,Team:ULB-Brussels#Debate_-_-_TEXT.html," a perfect opportunity to have the media attention we need to touch many people.
Probabilities, in turn, have been invoked by Jacques Van Helden. He drew our attention to the fact that the KUL had not fully measured the probabilities related to the fact that they can spread bacteria in nature. He said that although there is a low probability, when it comes to bacteria, we speak directly to millions and the low probability then has a big chance of happening. In addition, these low probabilities may have a large impact on the world. So, how do you measure this? Must we write a stringent law on this? We think that probabilities are crucial, mainly for organisms which are apt to go in the outside world. That’s why it must be developed by team composed by people with different backgrounds to don’t forget taking every part of context into account. Well, our project don’t really need this kind of mathematics because we developed a tool which will stay in the lab but if we had constructed an organism which had to be send in the outside world, we surely would worried about horizontal transfer or contamination and probabilities would be in the center of our defense project.
Finally, for the legislation, it emerged from the debate that it is imperative to develop specific legislation for what happens in the laboratory and what is destined to one day leave the laboratory. These laws must be different to allow science to evolve in the laboratory without the risk of contaminating the outside world. We might consider developing bacteria that dies outside of the laboratory. We tried to inquire about the current legislation but it’s not easy to found it. After hours of research, we threw in the towel. It appears that if the legislation exists, it’s not accessible and well known from everybody. So after defining a specifically legislation for the lab and for the outside world, it is imperative to make sure that it is accessible and understandable for everyone. Writing this legislation is good but it won’t help if it’s not closely monitored. People need to know that limits exist in synthetic biology, they can’t do everything they want without an external system which controls what they do. So our last request is this external controlling system which would monitor the well known and the respect of the legislation.

4. Risks of Your Project Now
Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:
Pinene and limonene are mucosal irritative substances, so they may affect people in the lab.
Risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab):
When we show the parts to children who take part in our Open House, they might accidentally lick and intake them.
Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab):
Water may be polluted by waste disposal.
Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
If strangers contaminate the sample, we might be unable to keep it under control.
What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices, choices of which organisms to use.)
a) Our lab is ventilated continuously.
b) We warn children not to enter our lab in advance.
c) We make sure that we do not drain the waste materials and that we bring them to the disposal center.
d) We make sure to lock the door of our lab when not in use.

TnrA-pAlsT -RFP
Main goal of this part is to show TnrA protein’s repressor activity on pAlst promoter and derepression of this promoter in the presence of NH3. Thereby we combined TnrA protein’s and pAlst’s gene sequences on the same biobrick. As a reporter, we put RFP gene sequence in front of the pAlst sequence. To make sure the repressive protein TnrA is produced in a high amount, we combined TnrA-pAlst-RFP gene sequence with T7 promoter which has a high transcription rate. Also, we put a Lac operator which LacI protein can bind, between this sequence and T7 promoter, in order to create a controllable system. We searched to find an expression vector working in harmony with this system, peT45-b expression vector was serving this purpose. . When we ordered our genes, we put RFC10 prefix site on 3’ end of TnrA-pAlst-RFP gene sequence and also BamHI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning to peT45-b. We added RFC10 suffix site on 5’ end of the same gene sequence and also XhoI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning to peT-45 vector, again.
As shown above,we planned to clone the ordered TnrA-pAlst-RFP gene into peT45-b vector by using BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Final construct after this cloning is, T7 promoter-Lac operator(LacO)-HisTag-TnrA-pAlst-RFP, respectively. Besides, a constitutive promoter called LacI promoter and LacI protein sequence in front of that, found on peT45-b vector’s another part. It is obvious that this part is IPTG-dependent, so Western Blot can be performed easily with the help of His Tag.
According to this system, under the absence of IPTG; TnrA production  will be repressed, pAlsT promoter will be derepressed and RFP won’t be produced. If IPTG is present,  TnrA will be produced , pAlsT promoter becomes derepressed and red colored bacteria will be observed with production of RFP. After showing stability of TnrA-pAlst sytem by using the"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,". Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the"

We team HFUT_CHINA keeps good connects with USTC_Software. As it's our first year to participate the iGEM and USTC has got great achievements in the last few years, there're a lot for us to learn and USTC is a good one. In the usual days, we communicated with each other and talked about the problems and tried to solve them. We also had some meetings in order to show our working process. What we saw gave us energy and we did  benefit a lot from them.
 
Also, we had communication with other Chinese teams such as SYSU, BIT and UESTC.
 
In the software testing session, we asked for some existing parts from those teams or their wet teams to check our software.

KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," ‘safety and laboratory practice'. [1] We apply the standard rules of ‘Good Laboratory Practice’; we always wear a lab coat, safety goggles and if using chemicals or handling organisms, we wear gloves. In addition, a member of the safety institution of our university ‘Health-Safety-Environment’ ( https://admin.kuleuven.be/vgm/en  ) is standby and the advisors are constantly present to guide, assist and help us. We reported the project to our department and HSE by filling out the forms ‘risk assessment for experiment with hazardous biological materials' . We asked the HSE to give feedback on the safety of our project, click here to read it. In this form we considered the danger of working with genetically modified organisms.  In Belgium, we have the Belgian Biosafety Server who has formed some federal regulations and laws concerning lab safety. Besides those safety measures, the K.U.L. has its own guidelines and procedures that are strictly mandatory. The HSE makes sure that all this requirements are fullfilled.
3. Safety and the environment
Marcus Schmidt wrote a chapter in his book ‘The technoscience and its societal consequences’: “Do I understand what I can create?” [2] Synthetic biology opened a whole new world for scientists where they can create everything they have ever dreamed of. There are many remarkable ideas, like an organism that detects when people become ill and cures them immediately, such as Dr. coli, to bacteria that fill micro cracks in concrete such as the Bacillafilla. [3, 4] The aim of these projects was to help people by improving the quality of their life.
But we have to keep in mind that there are also people who may not have the best intentions when creating a genetically manipulated organism. Although biosecurity – the prevention of intentional release of pathogens and toxins – is not something we can control, it is important to think about what happens if our creation falls in the hands of the wrong people. [2] And finally, we consider that even when we have good intentions, we can still, unintentionally, create something very dangerous.
The strain of E. coli that we are using, MG1655, is a derivate of K-12 and has the same properties. E.coli K-12 normally doesn’t colonize the human intestine. This strain is commercially used and has not any known adverse effects on humans, animals or the environment. If these bacteria are exposed to the environment, they would have low survival chance. Indeed, they would have to compete with other organisms for nutritional sources and E. coli could lose this competition since"

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," determined by measuring β-galactosidase’s activity. We designed our experiment so that we first transform a high copy plasmid into Vibrio natriegens and then the lacZ α fragment into the genome trough natural competence .The lacZ α fragment is inserted into different chromosomal integration sites. The lacZ α fragment must complement the lacZ on the plasmid for there to be any β-galactosidase activity. By measuring the β-galactosidase’s activity it is possible to draw conclusions about the transcription level at the different integration sites.Because the lac Z α fragment should be the limiting factor for the enzyme complex, as only one copy of it is present in the cells from the genome and there are multiple copies of the rest of the lac operon stemming from the multiple copies of the plasmids in the cells. To quantify the amount of functional β-galactosidase, pre-experiments with a defined amount of β-galactosidase should be conducted, and the amount of processed ONPG at the end of the experiment measured. By comparing the data form the pre-experiments with the β-galactosidase activity of the different integration sites the transcription levels of the integration sites can be determined.
As described previously, we tried to find regions in the chromosomes of V. natriegens with opposing transcription units and at least 500 bp between neighbouring CDS.
To omit screening through the genome manually, which is time consuming and less flexible if the search is repeated with different parameters, we created a Matlab program to automate this process.
V. natriegens' two chromosomes are imported both as .gb and .fasta. The .gb file is used to get information about the location and orientation of all CDS in the genome. Using if-statements, we are able to identify regions that fulfil both required conditions: opposing CDS and spacing larger than 500 bp.
Finally, the middle between both neighbouring CDS is calculated and a DNA sequence is drawn from the fasta files which includes 1000 bp both-sided and saved, representing the homology flanks. This sequence can either directly be used for designing PCR primers for amplification of the homology flanks or used for creating an alignment with the genome sequence to check for the local genomic context.

This part enables our E. coli KO11 strain to convert toxic furfural into furfuryl alcohol. Our construct was inserted                  into pSB1C3 and delivered to the Registry.
Figure 1: Circuit design of Composite part 1 with FucO gene. BBa_K2571003. Our construct includes a strong promoter,  RBS, FucO and double terminator.
In order to make our gene compatible with RFC 10, 25 and 1000, we reconstructed the nucleotides to get rid of the restriction sites while protecting                      the amino acid sequence. We looked through the codon bias property of E. coli and made the nucleotide changes accordingly.
FucO has NADH-dependent furan reductase activity. When furfural is present in the field, the metabolism of furfural by NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases                  goes active in order to reduce it to its less toxic alcohol derivative-furfuryl alcohol (Zheng, 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Allen et al., 2010).
Figure 2: Effect of FucO overexpression in LY180 (Wang et al., 2011). The cell mass was observed in furfural containing medium. The FucO gene expressing                  L-1,2-propanediol oxidoreductase reduces the effect of furfural. The specific death rate of normal bacteria is observed to be higher than the specific                  death rate of bacteria with FucO gene. Thus, FucO is shown to increase the tolerance and lifespan of bacteria.
In this metabolism, the expression of oxidoreductases that are NADPH-dependent, such as YqhD, are shown to inhibit the growth and fermentation in E. coli by competing for biosynthesis with NADPH (Zheng, 2013).
Figure 3: The overexpression of FucO and YqhD and relationships with furfural resistance traits, metabolism, and reducing cofactors (Wang et al., 2013).
Because the native conversion of NADH to NADPH in E. coli is insufficient to revitalize the NADPH pool during fermentation, the actions shouldn’t be                  interfering with NADPH metabolism (Wang et al., 2011). Thus, the overexpression of plasmid-based NADH-dependent propanediol oxidoreductase (FucO) gene                  reduces fur"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#riboregulator#characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," the RBS sequence. In order to repress translation, the  cis-repressing sequence need to interact with the RBS, and so the interaction depends on the sequences. Since different teams used different RBS to design their cis-repressing  sequences, we also had to use corresponding RBS for characterization. We had a constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23102 ) to drive the  expression of the cis-repressed GFP translation unit. For the expression taRNA, we wanted to control the expression and therefore we decided to use the arabinose inducible  PBAD promoter ( BBa_I0500 ). The promoter was chosen because the 3’ end after the transcription start site of the  promoter is short. Longer 3’ end can affect the function of the taRNA (Isaacs et al., 2004) (Figure 1. A).
For the riboregulator system to work, the repression of GFP synthesis needs to be first observed when the cis-repressing sequence is added 5’ of the RBS of the system.    Significant repression can be seen in Lock 1-Key1, Lock 3-Key 3, and Medium lock (Lock m)-Key for medium lock (Key m) cognate pairs (Figure 1. B, C, D respectively). Almost    full repression was observed for the three cognate pairs. For Lock 3c-Key 3c pair, we do not see repression when cis-repressing sequence is introduced to the system. Instead,   converse can be observed. When we don’t have cis-repressing sequence, we see significant drop in the fluorescence (Figure 1.E). One possible reason could be that the RBS    sequence that we used for the controls of Lock 3c Key 3c was incorrect. For Lock3c the target RBS sequence was not mentioned. It seemed like a variation of BBa_B0034 with shorter 3’ end. In order to build the construct type 2 and 3 (Figure 1. A), the RBS sequence had to be    deduced from the Lock 3c sequence. From the Lock 3c sequence, we have used a part of sequence that resembled the RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). The RBS sequence used may have been too short to be functional. Therefore, no fluorescence is observed when cis-repressing sequence is not present. On the other hand,    fluorescence can be observed when cis-repressing sequence is present because firstly, the RBS is sequence is correct, and secondly because"

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#Phage Purification#Winterexp#Period1#Dailylog_-_-_TEXT.html,"- We spent time trying to find a good procedure to propagate phage in a liquid medium. We finally found one that I think will work well for us.
- Today we learned a procedure for how to count phage.   - We performed a phage titer on the T4 phage to see if we have a high enough concentration to work with.  This is the general procedure: - Phage titer: reported in Pfu/mL (Pfu stands for plaque forming unit)
mix E. coli (500 microL) with 50 microL of phage lysate
incubate for 20 minutes
mix with 4 mL top agar and then plate
holes will appear in the agar that are called plaques
- How we followed it:

- Next step: find procedures for purifying different phage. Become experts on phage structure. possibly help with designing point mutations.
osmotic procedure
procedure from Dr. Grose
-Phage structure:
T7 has proteins 10 A and 10 B for capsid, and an assembly protein
T4 has SOC and HOC proteins
- We are currently waiting for our phage to come in so that we can begin running tests to purify the capsid.  We have several procedures in mind.  We need to prepare the reagents so that when the virus comes in we can immediately begin attempting to purify it.  Most of the procedures we have found apply specifically to T7 but we will also try them on T4.  We will continue to look for other procedures that may apply specifically to T4.

-Come up with a list of needed reagents for phage purification, so that when phage arrive we can begin testing procedure effectiveness for phage purification. Our findings may also be useful for the cholera group, since they also need phage to disrupt biofilms/kill cholera.

One of the ideas behind iGEM is to create new BioBricks and to improve already existing ones. These BioBricks contribute to the constantly growing part collection of the iGEM Registry. The Registry enables and simplifies projects in synthetic biology for all participating teams. Contributing new or improved BioBricks to the iGEM Registry is a medal criterion.
This year UiOslo_Norway contributed to the Registry by submitting a new BioBrick . Furthermore, we aimed to improve some of the BioBricks previously submitted by the Peking team in 2015 , namely their dCas9 parts linked to a split reporter. Unfortunately, experiments and cloning attempts in synthetic biology do not always work as planned. We were not able to successfully clone our improved DNA sequences during the time of the competition.
This is a collection of the parts we have submitted

Introducing DIYbio What we think What others think An insider account Conclusion
The Interviews
In addition to conducting a large-scale survey to determine the public's attitude towards DIYbio, we also wanted to get an insider's point-of-view. We contacted an active member in the DIYbio community, Tito Jankowski and he graciously agreed to answer a set of interview questions we had specially prepared.
We had also prepared a survey especially for active DIYbiologists, but as of mid-October, we feel that the number of responses is still too little to make significant conclusions. So we will not be analyzing the results of that survey at this time.
However, we noted that Jason Bobe, one of the founders of DIYbio, had responded to our survey. We have selected a few of his responses to highlight here, as an unofficial interview, with his permission. Thank you Jason!
Interview with Tito Jankowski
Q. How did you get involved in DIYbio?
Tito Jankowski : I was the team leader of the Brown University iGEM Team in 2007. I loved the idea of ""applying"" synthetic biology, such as lead detecting bacteria, or trees that grow into a house. However, since I couldn't find a job in the field, I instead started taking a closer look at DIYbio. My first real work in DIYbio was starting on the Open Gel Box project.
Jason Bobe : I founded DIYbio.
Q. Which aspect of DIYbio appeals to you?
Jason : It's fun, interesting & cutting-edge.
Q. What made you think that people /the public were ready for taking biology on in the comfort of their own homes?
Tito : Recent leaps in our knowledge justify the risks. Projects such as the human genome project and iGEM make biology accessible to everyone, not just scientists in labs.
Q. Who do you think should engage in DIYBio?
(Of course we understand the idea is to make biology accessible for anyone, but what do you think is the minimum level of expertise/knowledge these people should possess?)
Tito : I think iGEM Teams are the best -- they understand that biology should be engineered. Those interested in synthetic biology are usually"

These guides should provide a more precise target for CRISPR/dCas9 while retaining the desired function of dCas9. The University of Toronto expressed their gratitude for the guide sequences and will provide us any data produced with them during the competition.
Concluding Remarks
We believe that our sgRNA design program will prove to be incredibly useful for any team looking to use CRISPR in their projects. This model brings unmatched specificity while still remaining easy to use. Given that many iGEM teams work with non-model organisms or modified model organisms (think E. coli with a plasmid), we predict that our model will be a fantastic asset to future iGEM teams working with CRISPR.

Lamella sedimentation uses iron chloride to make the sludge sediment from the water, further cleaning the water from impurities.
The sludge is collected in a mixed sludge tank. Water is removed using polymers, and the sludge is continuing to a digester heated up to 37 degrees Celsius for about a month, before being used as compost.

Inserted mutations are indicated by the triplets consisting of N and K, whereby K stands for guanine or thymine, N for any possible base. Only in the mutated regions no distinct peaks are present. G: guanine, C: cytosine, A: adenine, T: thymine.
In order to examine the property of the generated chemoreceptor J23100_TAR_QClibrary the transformation efficiency was determined. Due to the fact that the first liquid culture of TAR_QC library only revealed 105 clones (attempt a), a repeat of the 2nd round of the library (attempt b) was carried out to increase diversity and resulted in the same diversity. Isolated DNA of attempts a and b were merged to gain a final diversity of 2x105, covering 6% of the theoretical diversity which would be 3.26 (Fig. 13A). The comparison of the sequencing chromatograms between the original and the mutated sequence excerpts indicated high quality of the TAR_QC library, because only the expected mutation sites had been changed. Every sequence of the isolated liquid culture DNA, which was not targeted, remained the same (Fig. 13B).

Following correspondence with Oxford’s modeling team, we changed the values of some of our parameters. Oxford recommended we used Karzburn’s 2011 paper, ‘Coarse grained dynamics of a cell free system’ for the translation constant. They also pointed out that we had forgotten to change some of the parameters’ units so our model was not dimensionally consistent, and we updated the model to fix those.

1.28×10-3
One of the biggest potential problems we identified was that if enough translation of closed switches occurred, it would be difficult to see any meaningful results. The kleakage parameter represents the ratio of translation rate on the closed and the open switch. We concluded that would not get any observable difference if translation on the closed switch was above a ten thousandth of the rate on the open switch, something we would never have been able to quantify easily without the model.
Without the model we wouldn’t have realized quite how crucial reducing leakage was. We spent a lot of time designing our switches to minimize leakage.
The lab team also asked us to find the optimal concentration of DNA for both output variation and overall output. By varying ktranslation and the concentration of DNA we found that a higher concentration was better in general, however it would plateau eventually as miRNA consumption became the limiting factor. In the specific case of miRNA degradation being 2 orders of magnitude lower than the rate of degradation of the other RNAs the GFP concentration plateaued around 5×10-9 mol dm-3.
Try out the model for yourself and see if you can see our conclusions by changing the parameters to see the final"

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," the main priority is curing patients of their infection. Diagnosis is critical here, as in order to cure a person one should first know which disease the patient is infected with. Moreover, diagnosis of potential patients is important as well, as this allows for proper treatment, limitation of further spread (e.g. quarantine) and monitoring the disease impact over time [4,5]. This is especially important when there are no vaccines available.
The development of a new diagnostic test
The development of an adequate diagnostic can be challenging as many aspects are required. This is especially difficult for point-of-care diagnostic tests. These tests are used in low resource areas such as tropical areas. As a guideline, the WHO has postulated the ASSURED criteria, highlighting the most important aspects. A diagnostic test should be Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and robust, Equipment-free, and Deliverable to end-users [4].
Current diagnostics: Antibody detection tests
Diagnostic tests that detect antibodies against diseases in blood samples are widely used in the field as point-of-care diagnostics. These include antibody dipsticks and agglutination tests. Both of these tests rely on the detection of antibodies against a disease in the blood of the patient and are therefore called serological tests. These antibodies will agglutinate together with the antigen present in the test, giving a visible output. These tests are easy to handle and fast but have several drawbacks. Since antibodies are present in the body even after an infection has been fended off, these tests cannot distinguish between current and past infections. Moreover, due to cross-reactivity (antibodies that can bind to multiple disease markers), false-positive results are periodically observed [6]. For example, the Card Agglutination Test (CATT) for HAT. This test is small, fast and high throughput, but it needs refrigeration, electricity and it lacks specificity. Moreover, these serological screening tests yield 99 false positives for every true positive, meaning many people are unnecessarily sent to the hospital for further investigation [7]. In dipstick tests, there is no positive control available. A negative result might mean no infection or an incorrectly working test. We learned this from dr. Philippe Büscher, HAT expert at the Institute of Tropical Medicine of Antwerp.
Mantis will be suitable for point-of-care diagnosis and targets antigens directly. The presence of a disease-causing agent, either a virus or a parasite, can now immediately be confirmed. This way, a lower rate of false positives is achieved. Also, Mantis contains a positive control whereby the functioning of the device is confirmed.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Model#Larginine_-_-_TEXT.html," for most of the repression.
Dashed lines were used to indicate species which do not get used up in the reactions, e.g. enzymes, and are both reactants and products of the reactions. Reverse arrows indicate reversible reactions and closed-circle arrows indicate that species are replenished and kept at a constant level.
The reactions in the pathway are all modelled with Michaelis-Menten kinetics, while the repression reactions are modelled using reversible mass action.
Figure 1. Overview of the model.
Detailed description of our model
Parameter adjustment:
Without experimental data from the lab to fit our model to, we adjusted the model until sensible and consistent with the published observations results were reached. The scale of the model would need to be adjusted when our data was available, but we can still make predictions about the relative change of arginine levels under certain conditions. With certain parameters the model produces unphysical results, for example if the initial concentration of arginine is set to 0 there will be an integration error where the gradient of arginine tends to negative infinity.
Table 1. Behaviour of all species.
Table 2. Equations in the model.
Experiments
In our model, the concentration of arginine reached a steady state. The steady level reached can be finely controlled by adjusting the rate of degradation of ArgR. This shows that argR could be a good target for tightly controlling the amount of arginine produced by E. coli. ArgR degradation rate constant kf varied between 0 and 1.
At kf above 0.05, changes in the kf have a minimal effect on the level of arginine reached  (Fig. 2A, a.u. stands for arbitrary units). With kf = 1 the argR level reached equilibrium at a very low concentration (Fig. 2B), and with kf = 0 (Fig. 2C), the argR levels reached a maximum.
 
Figure 2. Effects of argR degradation rate kf on the behaviour of the model. A) kf = 0.05, B) kf = 0.01 C) kf = 0
 
The level of arginine does not scale linearly with the level of degradation, but is more sensitive when argR is at the lower end of the scale. This would have to be taken into account when planning future experiments and we decided to explore it further.
We tested the behaviour of the model with six different values of argR degradation rate kf (Fig. 3A). Then, we analysed the maximal value of arginine reached in each of the simulations with a different kf. This confirmed"
Virginia,2012,Team:Virginia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," one-step reaction in which 5’ ends are chewed back by 5’ exonuclease, complementary overhangs base-pair and are extended by DNA polymerase, and then gaps are sealed by DNA ligase (Gibson, 2009). Gibson assembly master mix was purchased from NEB, and the reaction was run at 50°C for 1 hour. Subsequent PCR and gel confirmations revealed that the reaction products were a heterogeneous mixture of original and modified genome.
Chemically competent BL21pLys E. coli were transformed with wild type T7 phage genome, incubated at 37°C, monitored spectrophotometrically at O.D.600 for several hours. Chemically competent Bordetella bronchiseptica were transformed with BPP-locked genome and monitored for O.D. as well.
Folding Solution
Before attempting to detect hCG-β produced from modified bacteriophage, an experiment was conducted using recombinant His-tagged hCG-β in pET-30a vector. Cells were induced with IPTG (1mM) for several hours, lysed by various methods (either B-PER, T7 phage, or sonication), and exposed to denaturing and refolding conditions. These conditions were adapted from a protocol used by Huth et al.
Lysis by B-PER (bacterial protein extraction reagent from Thermo Scientific): cells were washed with BPER and incubated for 10 min. Lysis by T7 bacteriophage: bacterial culture in log phase (45 mL, OD~0.650) was infected with purified phage (50μl) and incubated (37°C, 2 hours shaking), after which OD dropped to 0.1-0.2.  Lysis by sonication: bacterial culture was sonicated for six 1-minute intervals interspersed by 1-minute resting periods.
Following lysis, three denaturing conditions varying in the reducing agent DTT (0, 0.5, and 5mM DTT) and a fourth condition without denaturing solution were applied. Cell lysates were spun down (12,000g, 10 min), and pellets were collected and resuspended in Tris buffer (1mL 50mM). Resuspended cells (200μL) were aliquoted to either denaturing or non-denaturing (control) solution (800μl). The denaturing solution contained 6M, 50mM Tris (pH 8.9), and variable DTT. The control"

Folding assay
To determine whether the purified proteins act as expected we conducted a specific a folding assay. Proteins possessing β-barrel structures exhibit a unique characteristic - when mixed with SDS (for SDS-PAGE) but unboiled, the β-barrel structure remains intact, which causes the protein to move differently in the SDS-PAGE gel in comparison to the same protein lacking these structures - which occurs when it is denatured or did not originally fold. Exploiting this characteristic makes it possible to observe and quantify protein folding levels.
For the first experiment we observed if BamB and BamCDE can incorporate the unfolded BamA protein into the membrane and reconstitute the complete BAM complex. This was accomplished by incubating SurA with BamA denatured in urea, then transferring it into a solution featuring liposomes, BamB"

iPhone: an important tool in biology research
In our human practice, we aim to investigate how an iPhone aids biologists in the lab.
 
  It is expected that the sales of iPhone and iPad will over 170 million. And the number of software in APP store has been as high as 700 thousand already. All these facts have shown us that the era of mobile information is coming. We can already feel the changes coming with it in the fields of communication, business and so on. Expecting to be one of the future researchers, we want to know what changes it will bring to the research in the future, especially in the field of synthesis biology.
  Now, let us tracing back the history, and see the connection between biology research and scientific computing tools.
1. The birth of computer   In 1980s, IBM created the first personal computer. Since then, PC has spread rapidly, and bioinformatics was born with the trend. This in turn promoted the development of molecular biology.
2. The network technology   E-mail and newsgroups have become the major communication tools of biology study. And the protocols used in the network have provided many new methods for biological information integration. And the biological database system is also developing.
3. Database technology, data mining techniques, mass storage technology   Bioinformatics database has a complex data structure, a complex data organization and a rapid growth in the amount of data. The development of computer network as well as artificial intelligence has helped to improve the ability of biological information processing.
  So we can see that the development of synthesis biology is tightly connected with the improvement of the scientific computing tools. Now we have enough confidence to expect the coming of mobile biological information processing.
  When we are making such assertion, at the same time we have studied the software about synthesis biology on app store, to prove our words are not empty.
  The study above is mainly about the data, but how many software are really practical and user-friendly? Let’s take the most influential journals"

I Introduction
    In solid media,things are not so easy as it is in the fluid media. In this case, the bacteria are not mixed at once.Besides, we have to consider the influence of the initial position of each bacterium. Like the situation in fluid media, now for solid media, we still have three characters, the farmers, the warriors and the beggars. And the cute bacteria still face the severe war against another battalion. Now let us learn more about them.
    Farmers are aimed to produce resources for all the bacteria. In our experiment, the ‘farmer’ bacteria can generate invertase to break down glucose; while in our online game, they can produce food for others to make their living. Be careful, your farmer’s food can also be eaten by the enemies so you need to take care of where to initialize them.
    Warriors' skill is to kill enemies. No matter who the enemy is, your brave warriors can kill both farmers and beggars from the enemy troop and can fight against your enemy’s warriors as soon as they meet. But these little combatants can’t make a living without  food from farmers so you have to initialize them within the nutrition range around farmers.
    Beggars are so lazy that they just sit there doing nothing. They don’t produce food so they have to rely on farmers. Also, they are not part of the military force so they kill ‘nobody’.

In the absence of β-estradiol, the ER interacts with Hsp90 chaperone complex and keep the ATF out of the nucleus. This AFT will provide a strong transcriptional activator that is dependent on the presence of β-estradiol. By using a synthetic 4-time-repeated zinc-finger DBD array from the mouse TF Zif268, residual off-target effects have been totally avoided.
Z4EV (the Z4EV gene has been introduced into the SynX chromosome of this group of haploids) to strictly control the expression of HO gene. Unlike common β-estradiol-induced or galactose-induced promoters, this modified promoter is designed to be activated only when it is specifically bound with the activated Z4EV factor.

Characterization of Mating Switcher (RFP to CRT)
OVERVIEW
Vika-vox system is used in our project in order to switch the expression from RFP to β-carotene, as a characterization of our Mating Switcher. In this way, we can easily visualize the function of our switcher through its color, as well as measure its efficiency and error rate.
Vika-vox system mainly consists of vox sites and reporting parts. At first the expression of yEmRFP will be activating and the expression of β-carotene will be inhibited so that we can detect red fluorescence when recombinase Vika doesn’t exist in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After the expression of recombinase Vika, with the deletion of yEmRFP and terminators flanked by vox locus, β-carotene expresses and the strains take on orange. This is the whole characterization process of Mating Switcher.
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
1) Vika-vox System
Genome editing is emerging as a powerful technology platform which paved the way for exploring the nature of life comprehensively and systematically. Site-specific DNA recombinases have been tamed as a powerful tool in genome editing, such as Vika/vox and Cre/loxp. Site-specifc DNA recombinase Vika, originally identifed in a gram-negative bacterium Vibro coralliilyticus, could functionally and specifcally deleted genomic DNA fragment via recognizing specifc DNA site vox in"

Improved Part：Lpp-OmpA
Our team worked to improve the characterization of a signal peptide, our team modified the sequence of the signal peptide, BBa_K103006 , a part from the University of Warsaw 2008 iGEM team, to make it more conducive to guide the FABP to anchor onto the outer membrane of E. coli. To improve the expression of this part in bacteria, we optimized its codon usage. In addition, we removed several amino acid residues at the N-terminal of the peptide; thus, the sequence was shorter than that in the Registry of iGEM, and the FABP with our signal peptide can be expressed at high levels. See more details in basic part BBa_K2302003 .  FABP (L-FABP) is primarily expressed in the liver where it is involved in the binding, transport and metabolism of long-chain fatty acids. Lpp-ompA is a signal peptide that is used as an outer-membrane anchor for its fusion proteins in E. coli . Thus, proteins fused to OmpA-link are theoretically presented on the surface of bacteria. We combined the characteristic of FABP (bind to long-chain fatty acids) and Lpp-OmpA (anchor to the outer membrane of E. coli ) in our case. When the whole fusion protein was expressed, the signal peptide would lead the FABP to anchor onto the outer membrane of E. coli so that Follower E could bind fatty acids by the FABP expressed in the outer membrane of E. coli.  See more details in the composite part BBa_K2302009 .
Improved Part：PelB
Our team worked to improve the characterization of a signal peptide named PelB, BBa_J32015 , a part from the iGEM Registry. This part originated from iGEM2006_Duke team and can be used as a signal peptide to allow proteins to be exported outside the cytoplasm. To improve the function of this part, we made the codon optimization for its efficient expression in E. coli.

Lysate Purification via Column Chromatography
Using the collected supernatant form Sample 1, we optimize and troubleshoot a protocol to purify our protein using nickel column chromatography and gravity filtration. The column contains a Histidine resin that selectively binds to His-tagged proteins. The column is equilibrated and charged before the sample is run through. The sample is diluted in 1X binding buffer in a 1 to 1 volume ratio. The idea is to add solutions of successively higher concentrations of imidazole. Imidazole has an extremely high affinity for the nickel charged column, and by the time the elution buffer is added (250mM), imidazole will outcompete our Tamura proteins in binding, allowing the Tamura proteins to elute and drain through the column to be collected as the final eluate.
PROBLEM: The first step of the protocol states to run the sample diluted in 1X binding buffer through the column and collect what drips through as Fraction 1. About 5mL of Fraction 1 was collected before the column became clogged, preventing further use of gravity filtration. The contents of Fraction 1 are expected to be any unbound proteins, a.k.a. contaminant proteins that are not Tamura. As a result, we hypothesize that blockage is likely due to these contaminant proteins being too big in size, unable to flow through our smaller-sized pores in the column. Tomorrow, we will troubleshoot the protocol or attempt a new method to purify our protein sample."

Project Safety
Safety was a key feature in our project design. Our advisors Eivind Almaas and Nikolay Martyushenko helped us with choosing a safe project. Most of us had little lab experience to begin with, so we were in need of lab expertise and general safety protocols. Nikolay Martyushenko introduced us to various lab procedures such as making medium, autoclaving equipment, inoculating bacteria on plates and in liquid media. We were also introduced to the various safety precautions associated with these procedures which we followed whenever working in the lab.
A lot of our work was done in laboratories belonging to the faculty of biotechnology and food science here at NTNU. Before we could use their lab and all its equipment everybody had to fill out risk assessment forms (Link) and take part in a lab training tour led by the faculties’ staff engineer Hanne Jørgensen. The tour introduced us to available equipment and its location, safety requirements, and responsible use.
Our studentlab where most of our lab work was done.
We worked with E.coli Dh5α and TG1 strains, both risk group 1 organisms. Transformation of these organisms was done inside our student lab. Since we were working with genetically modified organisms, we put a strong emphasis on keeping our engineered bacteria inside our lab. This was done by autoclaving all bacterial waste and contaminated equipment such as gloves and Eppendorf tubes, washing our hands before leaving the lab and washing our workspace with 70% ethanol.
Except for Crystal Violet (CV), the chemicals used during our project didn’t present any unique safety risks. CV, a carcinogen, was handled with great care. Due to it being light-sensitive, all CV solutions were covered with aluminum foil and marked with stickers matching its Safety Data Sheet (Link) . CV liquid waste was marked by its contents and disposed of in accordance with instructions from staff engineer Hanne Jørgensen.
We also worked with confocal fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. We received instrument training from Astrid Bjørkøy and Marieke Olsman, respectively. These instruments presented no intrinsic safety risks, but we made sure to follow the protocols associated with both instruments carefully. Bacteria-contaminated equipment such as optical glass and gloves were thrown away after use and then"

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," for responsible innovation that, in turn, demonstrates some of the qualities that are required to make the governance of synthetic biology viable in terms of managing sustainable innovation. The way the competition is organised shows that within a team and within the context of the competition, spaces are created for the students to think about what they are doing, how it affects society and how they can respond to issues of safety and security while being part of society. Moreover, the competitive elements of iGEM gives students the necessary incentive to practice synthetic biology as a profession to which they can aspire to. The anticipation of fulfilling this objective, as portrayed by the iGEM, shapes the student's expectations of  what it means to be a synthetic biologist (Pauwels 2011; Zhang 2013).
Therefore, the competition not only prompts students to reflect on their own scientific efforts and how science is practiced in general, the projects also encourages efforts that can benefit appropriate policy-making and governance for emerging dual-use technologies. In the case of UCL iGEM 2014, the governance implications also pertain to sustainability in response to environmental decline that has already occurred. Coming up with a solution that can subvert ecological controversy also requires an understanding of environmental governance in addition to dealing with the nature of emerging technologies. As such, the Goodbye AzoDye Project can thus act as a clear example of how a politics of environmental knowledge can be highly ambiguous in its discursive practice when confronted with the uncertainty that dual-use technologies bring (Kelle 2013; Lentzos 2012; National Research Council (U.S.) et al. 2009).
Methodology
In order to gain a better understanding of the challenges related to the sustainable governance of an emerging technology, and synthetic biology in particular, the study in Sociological Imaginations has focussed extensively on the case study method. The singular nature of this method allows the researcher to isolate a specific instance within its wider context in order to explain how social relationships are interwoven in a specific case. Here we have chosen to take a look at our own team, UCL iGEM 2014, so that we are able to see how this team’s work and environmental discourse is related to broader societal developments. In other words, why does the team choose to do the project that they have chosen to do in the light of the characteristics of the times we currently live in? The topic that is developed here involves the ways in which our environments are under the influence of scientific human practice and technological innovations. These are issues that necessitate questions of sustainability as the environmental implications and discourses surrounding the"

Sunday 12/10
Most of the plates from yesterday, were covered in a carpet of bacteria, but we succeeded in extracting 4 single colonies from the edges of the plate of TIB and T-Prot.
Colony PCR were performed on 4 colonies from each plate, and they were plated out on new Cm-plates. The colony PCR ran with VF2 and VR primers at 49 deg with 2.30 min elongation time.
Something went wrong with the colony PCR and no bands were observed on the gel. Not even the usual primer dimers in the bottom. This indicates that either the primers, polymerase or the Cm-plates haven't been working.
The primers were investigated by running a PCR on a mini-prepped plasmid with MyTaq polymerase. Bands were observed on the gel, which confirmes that neither the primers or the polymerase was faulty.
A transformation on TIB, TKB and Tet-Prot into the odor free strain, YYC912, were performed once again.
TIB:    0,25 µl and 0,50 µl
TKB:    0,50 µl and 1,00 µl

Sequencing confirmed the correct mutation of both illegal sites.
We remade the insertion PCR once again, using the new primer, but then we discovered that I made ANOTHER mistake: I forgot to exclude from the primer itself the EcoRI site that was in the linker between the two proteins… We had to order ANOTHER primer to be used in a insertion-deletion-point mutation PCR!!!
We also tried to digest the construct with EcoRI and then ligate it, to see if maybe in this way we could eliminate the double EcoRI site.
Week 8 (07/09 – 07/15)
To finish with the mutated construct I transform it into DH5a and confirm it      by screening . I choose 3 colonies to send for sequencing, one of which has the vector band lower than the others (as a negative control).
And now it’s time to start thinking about the characterization of the construct I      made. Ross is currently testing the promoter expressing GFP, so his      results will serve as a guideline for my experiments.
Since I can’t actually see if the protein is expressed in real time, I use      Gibson’s Assembly to attach a sfGFP at the end of M256I CysE directly in the      medium copy vector. I’ll transfer it in the submission one afterwards, to let      me test it first. The PCR fails.
However, this doesn’t mean I can’t start to characterize: I transform araCpBad-CysE WT (I’ll call it 1025 from now on) in NEB10b, our chosen cell line for expression. I make my first real characterization experiment: I grow cells overnight in LB, dilute them 1:50 and, when they reach an O.D. of about 0.6, split and transfer them in minimal medium (MOPS) containing respectively Glycerol and Glucose as carbon source. At O.D. 0.8 I split them again, and induce      one culture with arabinose (0.5mM). I take a sample from each culture before induction, after 4h of growth, and after 8h. Every hour after induction I measure the O.D, to get growth.
More testing! I am getting myself used to MOPS medium, where the growth is slow, so I was trying to see if I could standardize a protocol for bacterial growth in the two versions of the medium we were using, the one with glycerol amd the one with"

2nd Mediterranean Meetup
For the second year in a row, the mediterranean meetup took place in Marseille on the 9th and 10th of August at the CNRS campus, with the same goal: giving the chance to iGEM teams from countries on the Mediterranean shores to attend a close-by meetup.
This year, 7 teams from Spain and France joined us: UPF_CRG_Barcelona , Madrid-OLM , Grenoble , Bordeaux , Pasteur_Paris , Paris_Bettencourt , and Montpellier . To present their projects and captivate the audience, the teams had 180 seconds. An initiative that was taken from Swissnex Brazil and Nano-Tera .
“This type of science contest not only helps students to feel more comfortable in presenting their work to others but also serves to inform the general public about the wide and exciting range of scientific research being carried out”.
- Adriano Bürgi, lead project manager of the event from swissnex Brazil.
In addition, poster sessions and various workshops debating around bioethics and after-iGEM aspects were held.
We had a caring judging panel to evaluate the presentations: Mr. Laurent VILLARD (Department of medical genetics at the Timone hospital ), M. Victoria SCHMIDT (Post-doctoral at the LISM laboratory), M. Leticia HOUOT (Secondary PI), Mr. Gauthier DANGLA PELISSIER (Instructor), Mr. Marlon SIDORE (Instructor), and M. Thea Chrysostomou the European after-iGEM ambassador
We thank all the attendees, and can't wait to check out the finalized projects in Boston.
4th Annual Parisian Meetup
Our team participated in the 4th Annual Parisian Meetup, organized by Pasteur_Paris . The meetup gathered all 10 french iGEM teams around projects presentations and workshops. We met bioethics, parasitology and many more experts who enlightened us and helped us in shaping our projects. Last but not least, we met one of the European after-iGEM ambassadors, Mr. Will Wright"

FAFU-China
jacarandasmile@163.com
Cry4Aa is cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis BRC-LLP29. It shows specific toxicity to Culex by bioassay. The Cry protein is consisted of three functional domains. Domain I is a seven α-helices bundle. It can insert itself into a membrane by using its hydrophobic helices α4 and α5 to insert into the phospholipid bilayer. The pore formation occurs on its α3 helix. Domain II and domain III are two β-sheets which are involved in the receptor interactions. Domain II contains extremely variable loops, which are the binding site of the receptor. Domain III has the function of stabilizing the toxin. Cyt proteins have a single α-β domain which do not bind to receptors but can directly insert into the cell membrane and then form a pore causing cell death. Although Cry and Cyt proteins are two big families of δ-endotoxins, they are far related.Cyt1 and Cyt2 are two types of Cyt proteins found in Bti.. Generally, Cry proteins are believed to exert toxicity by interacting with the proteins on the brush border membrane and then insert into the membrane which takes multiple"

Abstract
In this summer, our project is aiming to engineer Enterobacter sp. FY-07 (which is separated from oilfield produced water and able to produce cellulose naturally), so as to controllably produce rhamnolipid and cellulose. We successfully achieved the expression of rhamnolipid in FY-07, the controllable expression of cellulose and the verification of the FimS switch function.
Verification of rhlABC gene function
We have cloned rhamnolipid synthesis gene (rhIABC) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and transformed it into Escherichia coli BL21 and successfully achieved the expression of rhIABC in E.coli BL21. Subsequently, we also verified that engineered BL21 has an emulsifying effect on diesel. Then we have transformed rhlABC into Enterobacter sp. FY-07 and verified that engineered FY-07 has an emulsifying effect on diesel.
Verification of BcsA gene function
In order to make the production of cellulose become controllable, we knocked out the BcsA gene (the coding gene of the A subunit of the cellulose synthase in FY-07) in FY-07. It was observed that FY-07 knocked out the BcsA gene no longer produced cellulose. When we replenish the BcsA gene into FY-07, FY-07 began to produce cellulose again. This phenomenon can be clearly observed on Congo red media. On the Congo red medium, when the bacteria produce cellulose, the colonies will show red.
Verification of FimS switch function
In E. coli, the expression of the Fimbriae component, FimA, is controlled in a binary fashion through the inversion of a 314 bp segment of DNA (FimS) that contains the FimA promoter. The inversion of FimS is performed by the DNA recombinase FimE, which binds to two inverted repeat sequences (Inverted Repeat Left and Right, IRL and IRR, respectively) that flank the Fim"

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Project#dsf_-_-_TEXT.html," bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Humans and SynBio
Humans and SynBio is our team's take on the Humans of New York project that showcases the diversity of people in New York City and their stories. Humans and SynBio aims to display the opinions of the public on synthetic biology, genetic engineering and related topics. By actively engaging with our local community through Humans and SynBio, we have learned a great deal about peoples' hopes and concerns about synthetic biology. We have integrated some of these opinions we garnered into our project design -  an explanation of these precautions is detailed in our risk assessment section .
We continue to actively solicit and accept submissions for Humans and Synbio. We hope that by using Humans and SynBio as a platform for public discussion, we can make synthetic biology a safer and more accepted practice. Please contact us through Facebook if you are interested in participating!

""I actually found a study a few years ago on E. coli, specifically about the fact that beef can be contaminated very easily. But this study actually showed if you grass-fed your beef you had a much lower incidence, and feeding grain to the animals gave rise to E. coli that was acid resistant.""
Because they're not meant to eat corn?
""Yep - there was a even a part of it that said if you stopped feeding them grain the last few weeks before slaughter, the levels of the worst E. coli would actually drop.""
Did anybody act on that?

WashU,2012,Team:WashU#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," an EHS training course to encourage lab safety. Our project was approved by the biology department which is held accountable directly to the EHS representative. In addition, we worked directly with the EHS in order to facilitate our YLC project. After extensive communication with our team, they gave us their approval for our project.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Currently all team members are required to complete EHS training as part of the Washington University requirements to work in a lab. Every team in the iGEM competition should complete basic lab safety training as a part of the requirements to compete. This would encourage safer practices which will set good habits for the future of bioengineering.  In order to make parts safer, better characterization upon submission should be stressed by iGEM. That way, future iGEM teams will know how to properly deal with submitted parts and prevent any potential risks that may be associated with a dearth of precautions taken while dealing with harmful parts.

Safety
Safety is a top concern in the lab and in all food, health, and cosmetics products.  Throughout our project, we always kept safety in mind, especially since the product we are developing may influence the microbiome of the scalp for the user.  Here are some of the ways we kept safety on our minds:
Lab Safety
Our team works in a laboratory classified as having Biosafety level 1, which is the lowest, applying to work with microorganisms that pose minimal potential threat to humans. The risks we encounter are common in every molecular biology lab, and can be easily minimized through compliance with a strict code of conduct, largely similar to World Health Organization (WHO) Laboratory biosafety manual 1 . Here we will review some of the main precautions taken.
Biological waste treatment is of great importance due to possible risk of GMO release to the environment, and release of bacteria containing self-replicating plasmids with antibiotic resistance. We took the following precautions in order to avoid the spread of those genes: all disposable equipment in possible contact with laboratory microorganisms (tips, petri dishes, gloves, etc.) were collected in biohazard bags and autoclaved before disposal, liquid media was sterilized with 96% ethanol overnight before their containers were washed.  We always wear gloves and lab coats while handling such materials and open doors while wearing gloves by grabbing the handles only in areas marked specifically for touching with gloves.
Personal Safety
Each Technion student has to receive safety training before starting a project involving wet lab work.  The aim of the training is to learn about safety measures and proper use of equipment in the lab. In addition to this, all iGEM team members participated in a nano-course - two weeks of laboratory training in genetic engineering and cloning techniques, with emphasis on safety and proper laboratory techniques, given by experienced personnel. The key to safe and efficient lab work lies in safety-conscious and responsible implementation of guidelines.
Work with bacteria sometimes requires minimizing the distance between the person handling the bacteria and the bacteria itself (making starters, plating cells, inoculating bacteria, etc.).  To avoid the risk of aerosols, as well as cross-contamination, we worked near fire when handling bacteria, using disposable loops"

Street Science:
Went to Dr. Joe Max Risse today and asked him about the mircoorganisms of the Fermentationgroup. He recommended Euglena gracilis, since it is without risk, big, colorful, and very healthy under the microscop.
I asked for the bacteria they have and he told me I could check if their Kocuria rosea is a wild type.
In the DMSZ catalog there are three strains of Kocuria rosea and all have been assessed to be of riskgroup 1, which is the safest group of bacteria and means it is unlikely that it will infect humans.
I also asked for Penicillium chrysogenum but the one they use is a GVO.
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
Colony PCRs: some prefix insertions of promoters in pSB1C3 with ecol and ecol_HIS showed positive bands, so we picked the colonies for plasmid isolation. The problem with the prefix insertion of the promoters in pSB1C3 with the ecol gene is that we can’t easily prove that the promoters were ligated in the backbone because with control restriction there would be an about 50 bp longer fragment which is difficult to see"

Overall project
Our goal is to build a simple, flexible and effective digital signal buffer. In electronics, buffers can be used to make a high signal higher and a low signal lower, and to isolate different wires. Our buffer will also make a high signal ""higher"" and a low signal ""lower"", so that a buffer with its own output fed back into its input forms a bistable system. We have not yet decided whether the buffer will connect different ""wires"" (chemical signals), or whether it will amplify a single chemical signal. Additional objectives are for the buffer to stabilize its own output and to smooth noise in the input signal. We would like our part(s) to be easily adaptable to many systems. In addition to creating the part(s), we will explore physical limits on the efficacy of buffering chemical signals beyond those imposed by information theory.

ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,". If the patient is also resistant to glucocorticoid, we add imuran(AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine(6-MP). Note that patients with severe lesions should use intravenous corticosteroid, and for nonresponder , we consider to use intravenous cyclosporine or to operate, which remove the whole colon and rectal mucous membrane. Some foreign countries use infliximab or adalimumab to induce and maintain remission. But this treatment is not widely used in our country.
Crohn's disease(CD) may involve the whole digestive tract, any place from oral cavity to crissum, typically at the terminal of small intestine, which is ileum and ileocecus. It is an inflammation covered the whole layer. The general pathology of CD is fissuring ulcers and changes in mucus pattern, which will make intestinal tract become narrow and induce the formation of internal/external fistula, characterized by bellyache, fever, abdominal mass and hematochezia/ melaena. We mainly use glucocorticoid to induce remission, supplemented with 5-ASA preparation. To maintain the remission, we mainly use AZA or 6-MP. If it is difficult for glucocorticoid to induce remission, we can try the methotrexate(MTX), cyclosporine(CsA) and infliximab. The latter applies more but there exists the primary/secondary drug resistance problems.
Ulcerative colitis is less difficult to treat relatively. Patients with poor therapeutic effect can choose to have a operation, which is considered to be a radical cure of disease. ( Of course, not every patient in our country will accept the fistulization at the end of ileum. However, PORCH operation is not spread widely currently. ) Patients who have had ulcerative colitis over 10 years has an increased risk of colon cancer. It is more difficult to treat Crohn's disease, because recurrence tendency always exists throughout one's life. Operation can only deal with the problem that intestinal tract become narrow, get block or bleeding. What’s more, it often brings up anastomotic recurrence, thus we mainly consider medicine as a treatment. However, many CD patients require to undergo surgery once or twice all their life, facing the risk of short bowel syndrome.
Actually I think that particular case is not the key point, and learning some common sense about the disease is more meaningful than individual cases.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Acknowledgement_-_-_TEXT.html,"100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

Duke,2012,Team:Duke#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"SSM iGEM Team can be found on their wiki at:
NCSSM 2012 iGEM Team Wiki
Although he's now graduated Peter hopes that the NCSSM iGEM Team will continue to be successful in their research endeavors and has become an AlumniGEM high school mentor. He's currently attempting to establish iGEM Teams at other local high schools in his community. In addition, he's attempting to gather interest at UNC-Chapel Hill for a synthetic biology pilot program which will be added to UNC-Chapel Hill's Biomedical Engineering Department and hopefully will result in a 2013 UNC-CH iGEM Team.
New Human Practice--Guide to Synthetic Biology Resources for Beginners
Thinking back to when they first started learning about Synthetic Biology the Duke iGEM Team realized just how difficult it had been to take those first steps into the world of Synthetic Biology. As a result of this realization and their continuing efforts to work with the NCSSM iGEM HS Team the Duke iGEM Team developed a comprehensive list of Synthetic Biology resources for beginners. These tutorials contain both text and multimedia resources and were used to instruct the 2012 NCSSM iGEM HS Team with great results. The resources are listed below in no particular order although they will later be compiled into an unofficial ""Synthetic Biology for Amateurs"" guide. These Resources each have a short description and are complemented by several journal articles and books who's titles are also listed below.
Online Resources
http://www.tinkercell.com/Home (This was the network modeling software we used to build/test the networks we designed and show that they worked in silico. We encountered some problems with the software at times since we didn't download all of the plug-ins/extensions but found it to be extremely powerful once operational.)
http://partsregistry.org/Help:Parts (It has a lot of links to pages on individual parts such as promoters, RBS's, protein domains, backbones etc. which helped us understand some more about the nuances of using each part in a network.)
http://www.nature.com/scitable (Wealth of mini-courses on a variety of different aspects of genetics/molecular bio. I also found that http://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/bio2.0 had very interesting articles about recent developments in synthetic bio such as the creation of a ""genetic switchboard"" network. I contacted the writer and he works in a Synthetic Bio lab at Davidson which had one of the first iGEM Teams.)

Columbia iGEM: Students and amazing mentors alike!
Noah Basri
A member of Columbia College’s Class of 2018, Noah Basri exhibited a keen interest in biology and medicine since             his early years. Majoring in Biology at Columbia, Noah joined the student-run Emergency Medical Service with             the aim of making a meaningful impact on the Morningside Heights community. During the academic year when he             is not driving the ambulance around the Columbia neighborhood, Noah can be found communing with his residents             in McBain Hall as he is also a Resident Advisor. Noah’s previous research has helped characterize the epigenetic             landscape of gliomas, specifically the role of the chromatin modifier CHD6 at dysregulated oncogenes. His findings             were subsequently published in the Columbia Undergraduate Science Journal. These days when away from his cloning             projects on the lab bench, Noah enjoys spending his time hiking and biking outdoors.
Brandon Cuevas
Brandon Cuevas is a sophomore in the Egleston Scholars Program on the pre-med track majoring in Biomedical Engineering and minoring in Computer Science. On campus, Brandon is involved with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, Synthetic             Biology Initiative and American Physician Scientist Association, holding positions as the community outreach             chair, education/media committee member and Co-Medical School Liaison, respectively. He has done research on             microtubules at the Hess lab at Columbia University, and is now doing research on pancreatic cancer with the             Olive Lab at the Columbia University Medical Center. In his spare time, Brandon enjoys playing video games, watching             comical YouTube videos, dunking on Alex Kim in basketball, and collecting catchphrases to add to his lexicon. Cool beans, right?

Overview
The team planned and implemented several events concerning the application and field of our project.  We focused on fields including transgenesis and genetic therapy, where TALE has been widely used as gene editing tool.  Two of our teammates attended as guest lecturers a conference held for leaders in sci-tech education of High school and elementary level students in Beijing.  Aside from publicity among high school students and educators, we held two seminars on synthetic biology and systems biology in Tsinghua University. Through heated discussions of the fields and our project itself, we managed to raise public awareness of novel advance in such interdisciplinary subjects.  Multiple ethics issues were proposed during the seminars considering current topics in synthetic biology.  We also conducted questionnaire survey on these issues later on. Results revealed important information and resolution on such. Ethics problems in genetic editing are researched and discussed in relevant pages.

Lecture
On Sep. 9th, Xu Chumeng and Liu Huarui gave a lecture on our project and current topics in synthetic biology as part of the conference for leaders in sci-tech education of High school and elementary school students in Beijing.  Teachers, high school students and researchers on Bioinformatics, Heredity, Molecular Biology and Botany gathered in Beijing No.8 Middle School aiming at enacting educational plans on science and technology research for high school and elementary level students.
After presenting our project, Chumeng, as an alumna of Beijing No.8 Middle School, shared her experience on high school sci-tech research experience and how it had led to synthetic biology research in Tsinghua.  We received a lot of useful insights on our projects from attending researchers.  An overview on the current topics in synthetic biology and its applications was delivered by our two teammates.  We found that interdisciplinary subjects like synthetic biology still lack awareness among students below collegiate level and their educators.  The high school students present at the conference showed keen interest in the topics, even raised a"

If it is stated that the individual green fluorescent protein (GFP) is related via ""produceLight"" to the individual yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), and that GFP is a member of the ""isProtein"" class, then it can be inferred that YFP is not a member of ""isPromotor"" class. In this fashion, OWL allows the use of more sophisticated relationships amongst database components. Furthermore, there already exists various ontological hierarchy optimized for biology such as genetic interaction ontology, protein interaction ontology, and cancer genomics ontology. And OWL allows potential interaction of multiple ontologies. So, the integration of OWL into SBiDer allows SBiDer to potentially interact with many other aspect of biology such as genetic interaction, protein interaction, and RNA processing. As a result of OWL integration, SBiDer can represent the biological reality of synthetic biology in a much more complex, sophisticated, and realistic manner.
Factor Graph
What Factor Graph is
In probability theory and its applications, a factor graph is a particular type of graphical model, with applications in Bayesian inference, that enables efficient computation of marginal distributions through the sum-product algorithm (H. Loeliger). Factor graph can capture a system as Markov networks or Bayesian networks, and represent mathematical relationships of elements of a system.
Integration of Factor Graph into SBiDer
SBiDer currently implements its network representation of the database as a Petri-Net, which allows modeling of our complex biological system. SBiDer can also capture the network using factor graph, which provides additional statistical tools for analyzing, interpreting, and prediction of the behaviour of our network. Integration of the factor graph can also provide us with machine learning tools to further advance our tools quantitatively and qualitatively.
Web App
The current SBiDer web tool has been constructed with consideration for expansion in all its components from the structure of the source code to the allowance of users to contribute to the database. It is the latter improvement that allows SBiDer to become more efficient as time progresses. As more information becomes available, the SBiDer application can begin to transition from a qualitative description of how its proposed genetic circuits behave to a more quantitative model.
